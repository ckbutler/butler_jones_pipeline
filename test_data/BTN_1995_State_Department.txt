 BHUTAN *
 The Wangchuk dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan since 1907. Lo-
 cated in the Himalayas between India and Tibet, the small kingdom has been able
 to escape domination by any external power since the 10th century. There is no writ-
 ten constitution or bill of rights. King Jigme Singhye Wangchuk, on the throne since
 1972, has continued efforts toward social and political modernization begun by his
 father.
 Three quarters of the population of 600,000 is composed of Buddhists with cul-
 tural traditions akin to those of Tibet. The remaining quarter of the population are
 mostly Hindus of Nepalese origin inhabiting the country's southern districts. The
 rapid growth of this ethnic Nepalese segment of the population and the Buddhist
 majority's fear for the survival of their culture led to ethnic conflict and repression
 of ethnic Nepalese in southern districts during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tens
 of thousands of ethnic Nepalese left Bhutan, many forcibly expelled. Approximately
 90,000 remain in refugee camps in Nepal and upwards of 15,000 reside in the In-
 dian states of Assam and West Bengal.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, including those as-
 signed to the Royal Body Guard, and a national militia, maintains internal security.
 Some members of these forces committed human rights abuses against ethnic Nepa-
 lese in the past.
 The economy is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main liveli-
 hood for 90 percent of the population and account for about half of the GDP. Agri-
 culture consists largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Cardamon,
 citrus fruit, and spices are the leading agricultural exports. Cement and electricity
 are the other important exports. Strong trade and monetary links align the economy
 closely to that of India. Hydroelectric power production potential and tourism are
 key resources, although the Government limits foreign tourist arrivals by means of
 pricing policies. The gross national product per capita is estimated to be $700.
 *The United States does not have an embassy in Bhutan. Information on the human rights
 situation is therefore limited.

 The Government significantly restricts the rights of the Kingdom's citizens. The
 King exercises strong and active, although indirect, influence over the Government.
 The Government discourages political parties and none operate legally. Judicial
 processes remain rooted in practices hundreds of years old. Written criminal and
 civil procedure codes are lacking, although programs to build a body of law and
 train lawyers are underway. There are significant limitations on the right to a fair
 trial, assembly, association, privacy, and workers' rights. All private television re-
 ception has been banned since 1989. The Government has failed to reach agreement
 with the Government of Nepal on procedures for screening and repatriation of the
 refugees. The Government has done little to investigate and prosecute security force
 officials responsible for torture and other abuses committed against ethnic Nepalese
 residents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 From 1989 to 1992, many of the thousands of ethnic Nepalese detained on sus-
 picion of supporting a dissident movement were held in incommunicado detention.
 The Government has denied responsibility for any disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reliable reports of torture or of rape by security forces in 1995. How-
 ever, new and credible evidence continues to emerge among recent arrivals in refu-
 gee camps in southern Nepal that persons detained as suspected dissidents in the
 early 1990's were tortured during confinement. Security forces committed these
 abuses in southern Bhutan as a part of the Government's efforts to reduce the pres-
 ence of ethnic Nepalese. This policy created a climate of impunity in which the Gov-
 ernment tacitly condoned the physical abuse of ethnic Nepalese. There is little indi-
 cation that the Government has adequately investigated or punished any security
 force officials involved in the widespread abuses of 1989-92.
 Prison conditions are below international standards, but have been described by
 international monitors as adequate if austere. A prison visit program begun in 1993
 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and opening of a new pris-
 on in Chemgang in 1994 contributed to substantial improvement in conditions of de-
 tention over the primitive conditions that existed until a few years ago.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Police Act of 1979, police may
 not arrest a person without a warrant and must produce an arrested person before
 a court within 24 hours of arrest, exclusive of travel time from the place of arrest.
 Legal protections are incomplete, however, due to the lack of a fully elaborated
 criminal procedure code and deficiencies in police training and practice. Arbitrary
 arrest and detention remain a problem but are not routine  use as a form of har-
 assment. There may be delays in informing family members of an arrest. Incommu-
 nicado detention of suspected militants was a serious problem in 1991 and 1992, but
 the initiation of ICRC prison visits and establishment of an ICRC mail service be-
 tween detainees and family members has helped allay this problem. The authorities
 continued to hold 129 persons on charges associated with political dissidence in
 southern Bhutan. Of these, 49 were serving sentences following conviction and 79
 were still being tried 5 years after their alleged offenses were committed.
 Although the Government does not formally use exile as a form of punishment,
 many accused political dissidents freed under government amnesties say they were
 released on the condition that they depart the country. Many of them subsequently
 registered at refugee camps in Nepal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is no constitution and the judiciary is not
 independent of the King.
 The judicial system consists of district courts and a High Court in Thimphu, with
 judges appointed by the King on the recommendation of the Chief Justice. Minor
 offenses and administrative matters are adjudicated by village headmen.
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a legal code
 established in the 17th century and revised in 1965. For offenses against the State,
 state-appointed prosecutors file charges and prosecute cases. In other cases, the rel-
 evant organizations and departments of government file charges and conduct the
 prosecution. Defendants are supposed to be presented with written charges in lan-
 guages they understand and are given time to prepare their own defense. This prac-
 tice is not always followed, however, according to some ethnic Nepalese refugees. In
 cases where defendants cannot write their own defense, courts assign judical offi-
 
 
 1306
 cers to assist defendants. There are no lawyers. A legal education program is gradu-
 ally building a body of persons who have received formal training in the law.
 Defendants have the right to appeal to the High Court, and may make a final
 appeal to the King, who traditionally delegates the decision to the Royal Advisory
 Council. Trials are supposed to be conducted in open and public hearings, however
 in practice this is not always the case according to reports from ethnic Nepalese ref-
 ugees.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce and adoption, are resolved ac-
 cording to a citizen's religion: Buddhist tradition for the majority of the population
 and Hindu tradition which predominates in areas inhabited by ethnic Nepalese.
 Some or all of the 129 prisoners accused of antinational activity serving sentences
 or under trial for offenses related to political dissidence primarily among ethnic
 Nepalese during 1991-92 may be political prisoners.
 Tek Nath Rizal, an ethnic Nepalese and internationally recognized political pris-
 oner, remained in prison following his 1993 conviction under the National Security
 Act for writing and distributing political pamphlets and attending political meet-
 ings. Nevertheless, a United Nations Human Rights Commission working group on
 arbitrary detention which visited Bhutan in 1994 at the Government's invitation de-
 termined that Rizal had received a fair trial and declared his detention "not to be
 arbitrary."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions are highly respectful
 of personal privacy. However, the Government has undermined these traditions by
 its emphasis on promoting national integration. The wearing of national dress, for
 example, is required when visiting Buddhist religious buildings, monasteries and
 government offices, in schools and when attending official functions and public cere-
 monies. According to human rights groups, police regularly conduct house to house
 searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or legal justification.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government restricts freedom of speech
 and press. The country's only regular publication is Kuensel, a government weekly
 newspaper, with a circulation of 10,000. Kuensel sometimes reports criticism of the
 King and government policies in the National Assembly. Indian and other foreign
 newspapers are available. The Government bans all private television reception in
 the country. Since 1989 all television antennas and satellite receiving dishes have
 been ordered dismantled.
 The Government radio station broadcasts each day in the four major languages
 (Dzongkha, Nepali, English and Sharchop).
 English is the medium of instruction in schools and the national language,
 Dzongkha, is taught as second language. The teaching of Nepali as a second lan-
 guage was discontinued in 1990.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are restricted.
 Citizens may engage in peaceful assembly and association only for purposes ap-
 proved by the Government. Although the Government allows civic and business or-
 ganizations, there are no legal political parties. The Government regards parties or-
 ganized by ethnic Nepalese exiles-the Bhutan People's Party (BPP), the Bhutan
 National Democratic Party (BNDP), and the Druk National Congress (DNC)-as
 "terrorist and anti-national" organizations and has declared them illegal. These par-
 ties are not known to conduct activities inside the country. Their announced goals
 are the repatriation of refugees and democratic reform.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the kingdom's
 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation in the
 National Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public
 policy. Citizens of other faiths, mostly Hindus, enjoy freedom of worship but may
 not proselytize. Under the law, conversions are illegal. The King has declared major
 Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the royal family participates in them.
 Foreign missionaries are not permitted to proselytize, but international Christian
 relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active in education and humanitarian ac-
 tivities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Bhutanese travelling in border regions are required to show their citi-
 zenship identity cards at immigration check points, which in some cases are located
 at a considerable distance from what is in effect an open border with India. By trea-
 ty, citizens may reside and work in India.
 
 
 1307
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the rights to change their government. Bhutan is a monarchy
 with sovereign power vestee in the King. There are, however, elected or partially
 elected assemblies at the local, district and national levels, and the Government
 purports to encourage decentralization and citizen participation. Since 1969 the Na-
 tional Assembly has had the power to remove ministers, who are appointed by the
 King, but has never done so. Political authority resides ultimately in the King, and
 decision making involves only small number of officials.
 Poitical parties do not legally exist, and their formation is discouraged by the
 Government as unnecessarily divisive. The Government prohibits parties estab-
 lished abroad by ethnic Nepalese (see Section 2.b.).
 The National Assembly, established in 1953, is composed of 150 members. Of
 these, 105 are elected by the people and 10 by religious bodies. The remaining 35
 represent the Government and are appointedby the King. The assembly enacts
 laws, approves senior government appointments, and advises the King on matters
 of national importance. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple majority needed to
 ass a measure. The King may not formally veto legislation, but may return bills
 further considertion. The assembly occasionally rejects the King's recommenda-
 tions or delays implementing them, but in general, th~e King has enough influence
 to persuade the assembly to approve legislation he considers essential or to with-
 draw proposals he opposes. The assembly may question government officials and
 force them to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.
 As a result of efforts to integrate ethnic Nepalese and women into the Govern-
 ment, ethnic Nepalese account for 28 percent of the civil service at all ranks up to
 minister, according to the Government. Women have made smaller but visible gains.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igat ion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Bhu-
 tan. The Government regards human rights groups established by ethnic Nepalese
 exiles--the Human Rig    Organization of Bhutan (UROB), the People's Forum
 for Human Rights in Bhutan (PFHRB), and the Association of Human Rights Activ-
 ists-Ehutan (AHURA)--as political organizations and does not permit them to op-
 erate openly in Bhutan. ICR representatives continue their periodic prison visits,
 and the Government has allowed them access to detention facilities, inuding those
 in southern districts inhabited by ethnic Nepalese. The United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees visited Bhutan in July 1994. The chairman and members of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission working group on arbitrary deten-
 tion visited in October 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Government efforts to cultivate a national identity rooted in the language, reli-
 gion, and culture of the Drukpa ethnic group constrain cultural expression by other
 ethnic gups. Concern over rapid popumation growth and political agitation among
 ethnic Nepalese has resulted in policies and abusive practices that led to the expul-
 sion of tens of thousands of members of this group. The Government disputes claims
 by exile groups that ethnic or gender discrimination in employment is a problem.
 Women are accorded respect in the traditions of most ethnic groups. Persistence of
 traditional gender roles apparently accounts for a low proportion of women in gov-
 ernment employment.
 Women.-There is no evidence of an extensive pattern of rape or spousal abuse.
 Six cases of rape or attempted rape were registered during 1995 in the capital city,
 which has a population 20,000. Crminal gangs oprating in southern border dis-
 tricts continued to commit rape in addition to rob ,ry.  a May 4, one such gang
 raped seven women, including two girls. Security forces reportedly used rape in ef-
 forts to force emigration of ethnic Nepalese from southern huan during 1991 and
 1992.
 Rape was made a criminal offense in 1953, but that law had weak penalties and
 was poorly enforced. In 1993 the National Assembly adopted a revised rape act with
 clear definitions of criminal sexual assault and stronger penalties. In cases of rape
 involving minors, sentences range from 5 to 17 years. In extreme cases, a rapist
 may be imprisoned for life.
 Bhutan has not developed a rigid caste system or customs that seqester women.
 Women comprise 48 percent of the population. Forty-three percent of enrolment in
 schools is female, and women account for 16 percent of civil service employment. In-
 heritance practices vary among ethnic groups, but generally divide family land
 
 
 1308
 eqally among sons and daughters, and dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic
 Nepalese Hindus. Inheritance practices favoring daughters among some groups are
 said to account for large numbers of women among owners of shops and businesses
 and an accompanying tendency of women to drop out of higher education to go into
 business.
 Polygyny is sanctioned as long as the first wife gives her permission. Marriages
 maybe arranged by partners themselves as well as by their parents. Divorce is com-
 mon. Recent legislation requires that all marriages must be registered and favors
 women in matters of alimony. Women in unskilled jobs are generally paid less than
 men.
 Children.-The Government has demonstrated its commitment to child welfare by
 its rapid expansion of primary schools, health-care facilities, and immunization pro-
 grams. The mortality rates for both infants and under-five-year-olds have dropped
 dramatically since 1989. Children enjoy a privileged position in society and benefit
 from international development programs focused on maternal and child welfare.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse against children.
 A study by the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) found
 that boys and girls receive equal treatment regarding nutrition and health care and
 that there is little difference in child mortality rates between the sexes. UNICEF
 found that, among urban dwellers, girls are given "equal or near equal opportuni-
 ties" to pursue education.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of official discrimination toward
 people with disabilities but the Government has not paszed legislation mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese arrived in Bhutan in large
 numbers at the turn of the century. The Citizenship Law of 1958 granted citizen-
 ship to all ethnic Nepalese adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for at
 least 10 years. However, the Government maintains that large-scale illegal immi-
 gration occurred and was not detected until the 1988 census. The increase of popu-
 lation prompted the Government to launch an aggressive campaign to reassert
 Drukpa culture, restrict immigration, and expel ethnic Nepalese. Members of the
 Buddhist majority, including many members of the National Assembly, expressed
 fears that Bhutan's Buddhist society would be overwhelmed by the Hindu ethnic
 Nepalese-as happened in neighboring Sikkim, which was incorporated into India
 in 1974.
 Early efforts at halting the demographic trend focused on limiting immigration
 and attempting to assimilate the existing ethnic Nepalese. Measures to promote as-
 similation included financial incentives for intermarriage, education for some stu-
 dents in regions other than their own, and direction of economic development funds
 to the south. By 1989 assimilation gave way to policies aimed at "Bhutanization."
 Measures intended to promote a national identity required the wearing of national
 dress for official occasions, the teachingof Dzongkha as a second language in all
 schools, and discontinued instruction of Nepali as a second language. (English is the
 language of instruction in all schools.)
 Beginning in 1988, the Government expelled limited numbers of ethnic Nepalese
 through enforcement of a law that significantly tightened the requirements for citi-
 zenship. Until 1985 citizenship was conferred upon children if their father was a
 citizen under the 1958 Nationality Law. However, the 1985 Citizenship Act raised
 this standard by requiring that beth parents be citizens to confer citizenship on
 their children. The Government declared as illegal immigrants all residents who
 could not meet the new requirement. Residents who lost their citizenship under the
 1985 Act may apply for naturalization but must prove residence during the previous
 15 years.
 Exile political groups complain that the law makes unfair demands for docu-
 mentation on largely illiterate people in a country that has only recently adopted
 basic administrative procedures. They claim that many ethnic Nepalese whose fami-
 lies have been in Bhutan for generations were expelled because they were unable
 to document their claims to residence. The Government denies this and asserts that
 a three-member village committee-typically ethnic Nepalese in southern Bhutan-
 certifies in writing that a resident is a Bhutanese citizen in cases where documents
 cannot be produced.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also stipulates the revocation of citizenship of any natu-
 ralized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner what-
 soever to the King, country and people of Bhutan." The Home Ministry, in a circular
 notification in 1990, advised that "any Bhutanese national leaving the country to
 assist and help the antinationals shall no longer be considered as a Bhutanese citi-
 zen . . . such people's family members living under the same household will also
 be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizenship." Human rights groups charge
 
 
 1309
 that this provision was widely used to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Nepalese who
 were subsequently expelled or otherwise departed from southern Bhutan.
 A large-scale flow of people from southern Bhutan began in 1991, resulting from
 a Government policy of discrimination against ethnic Nepalese. Tens of thousands
 of them were expelled between 1989-92. The Government asserts that claims of
 widespread abuses were fabricated and that civilian and security officials have been
 punished for a few instances of misuse of authority. When the UNHCR began pro-
 viding food and shelter in September 1991, there were only 304 persons claiming
 to be Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. By year end, there were 6,000. The refugee flow
 peaked in 1992, when 66,000 refugees arrived in southern Nepal. At year's end, ap-
 proximately 90,000 refugees were registered in UNHCR camps in Nepal. Upwards
 of 15,000 other refugees are believed to have settled with family members in India.
 By 1994 the flow into the refugee camps had slowed to slightly more than 60 per-
 sons a month and has further declined since then. Many recent arrivals report that
 they departed Bhutan because of the depopulation in the southern districts, a
 heightened sense of apprehension and insecurity, and the desire to be reunited with
 family members already in Nepal.
 The Government maintains that the numbers of persons who departed southern
 Bhutan during those years was substantially smaller than the number in the refu-
 gee camps, that many of those who left were Nepalese or Indian citizens who ar-
 rived in Bhutan after the enactment of the 1958 Nationality Law, and that many
 of the persons registered in the camps as refugees have no claim to Bhutanese citi-
 zenship and may never have resided in Bhutan. The UNHCR reports that the over-
 whelming majority of refugees who have entered the camps have been able to show
 documentary proof of Bhutanese nationality since screening began in June 1992,
 and random checks of camp residents bear this out.
 A Nepal-Bhutan ministerial committee met six times in 1994-95 to discuss ways
 to determine which refugees might be entitled to return to Bhutan. These discus-
 sions achieved little progress and as of the end of the year, no date for another
 round had been set.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unionism is not permitted, there are no labor
 unions, workers do not have the right to strike, and the Government is not a mem-
 ber of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing in industry, which accounts for about 25 percent of the gross domestic product
 but only a minute fraction of the total work force. The Government affects wages
 in the manufacturing sector through its control over wages in state-controlled firms.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government abolished its sys-
 tem of compulsory labor taxes in December. Laborers in rural development schemes
 previously paid through this system will now be paid regular wages. There is no
 evidence to suggest that domestics or children are subject to coerced or bonded
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law set the minimum age for
 employment at 18 years for citizens and 20 years for non-citizens. A UNICEF study
 suggested that children as young as 11 years are sometimes employed with road
 building teams.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A circular effective February 1, 1994 estab-
 lished wage rates, rules and regulations for labor recruiting agencies, and regula-
 tions for payment of workmen's compensation. Wage rates range from $.75 (roughly
 25 ngultrums) to $2 (roughly 70 ngultrums) per day for unskilled and skilled labor-
 ers, with various allowances paid in cash or kind in addition. The work day was
 defined as 8 hours with a 1 hour lunch break. Work in excess of this must be paid
 at one and a half times normal rates. Workers paid on a monthly basis are entitled
 to 1 day's paid leave for 6 days of work and 15 days of leave annually. The largest
 salaried work force is the government service, which has an administered wage
 structure last revised in 1988 but supplemented by a special allowance in July 1994.
 Only about 31 industrial plants employ more than 50 workers. Smaller industrial
 units include 69 plants of medium size, 197 small units, 692 "mini" units and 651
 cottage industry units. Bhutan's rugged geography and land laws that prohibit a
 farmer from c lling his last five acres result in a predominantly self-employed agri-
 cultural work force.
