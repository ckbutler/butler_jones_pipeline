 ALGERIA
 Under a revised Constitution adopted in 1989, Algeria was
 converted from a one-party Socialist state, in which power was
 held by the National Liberation Front (FLN), to a multiparty,
 parliamentary system. President Chadli Bendjedid wields
 strong executive power. Although retaining his position as
 titular head of the FLN, Bendjedid has dramatically loosened
 the party's grip on government policy. In June the first
 multiparty elections in Algerian history were held at the
 local level throughout the country. Parliamentary elections
 are scheduled to be held in 1991.
 Internal security is maintained on a day-to-day basis by the
 urban Police (Surete) and the rural police (Gendarmerie),
 which, while generally adhering to constitutional guarantees
 against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, have been known to
 resort to brutal treatment of prisoners and detainees,
 including torture. The process for trying political crime was
 officially abolished in 1989, and the growing freedoms of
 speech and press served as a check against arbitrary police
 action. In late 1990 the Government announced the abolition
 of the Algerian internal intelligence services, although this
 "abolition" seems to represent a transfer of intelligence
 functions to other agencies rather than the end of governmental
 intelligence-gathering activity.
 Over recent years the Government has pursued a reform program
 that emphasized job creation, the decentralization of economic
 decisionmaking, and the development of agriculture. The
 Government has called for the introduction of a market system
 by 1991. With the passage of several major economic reform
 bills in 1990, and with the implementation of previously
 legislated reforms, Algeria made progress towards a freer
 economy. Bills passed in 1990 liberalized considerably the
 foreign investment regime, reformed the financial system,
 introduced collective bargaining at the enterprise level, and
 also removed prior import restrictions. However, high
 population growth, inflation, a scarcity of foreign exchange,
 and the legacy of decades of economic inefficiency and
 corruption continued to hamper the Government's efforts to
 meet social needs. High unemployment, inadequate housing and
 infrastructure, below-standard education, and chronic scarcity
 of consumer goods remained serious-problems.
 The Government continued to make significant progress on
 human rights. Since the adoption of the 1989 Constitution,
 which granted the right to form political parties and civic
 associations and to call strikes, over 30 political parties
 encompassing the ideological spectrum have been recognized,
 many of which took part in the June municipal and provincial
 elections. These elections were generally held to be free and
 fair; in many communities the FLN candidates were defeated.
 Restrictibns on the press were reduced and many new journals
 were founded, although independent journalists in Algiers
 complained about difficulties in gaining access to government-
 owned presses and paper supplies.
 However, the Government's promise to prosecute those in the
 security forces who participated in suppressing the riots of
 1988 was not kept. In mid-1990, the Government pardoned all
 involved in these events. While this pardon also served to
 protect dissidents and political figures, the net result was
 the effective repudiation of the Government's promise to bring
 torturers to justice. Widespread discrimination against women
 
 
 1369
 ALGERIA
 also remained an important problem, and there was growing
 concern that the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria
 might further threaten women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law, but the police have been known
 to subject detainees and prisoners to brutal treatment. While
 torture has always been prohibited, since the October 1988
 riots, the Government--through a combination of internal
 investigation and toleration of press and human rights
 organizations' probing--has made significant strides in
 rooting out the practice. Recaptured escapees from Blida
 prison were severely beaten and tortured in October by angry
 guards. The Government formed a commission to investigate the
 case and recommend disciplinary action for the guards.
 Another person was violently tortured after he was detained
 for car theft. Human rights activist Miloud Brahimi confirmed
 evidence of the torture and was satisfied with the
 Government's investigation into the incident. There were also
 reports of police torture of some 22 persons arrested in a
 violent demonstration against worsening economic conditions in
 Tenes in October. The Government investigated charges of
 torture and pronounced them groundless. The Algerian League
 of Human Rights (ALHR) insisted, however, that torture had
 occurred.
 The Government's failure to keep President Bendjedid's promise
 in November 1988 to launch an investigation into reports,
 generally accepted as true, that the police and military
 security services used systematic torture in suppressing the
 riots in 1988, and to punish the guilty, remained a
 significant human rights concern. By pardoning in July all
 those involved in the riots, the Government provided immunity
 from prosecution for the army, police, and security officials
 responsible for the grave violations of human rights that
 occurred at that time. Senior officers of the National Surete
 who had been in charge during the brutal repression of the
 1988 riots were relieved of their duties in July. Some
 interpreted this as an act of government reform.
 . d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention. It
 also provides that detention for questioning in criminal
 investigation cases cannot exceed.48 hours, after which the
 suspect must be charged or released. This period can be
 extended to 4 days by written request of the government
 prosecutor. Provisional liberty can be authorized in cases
 where the detainee can show that he can guarantee to present
 
 
 1370
 ALGERIA
 himself at all necessary stages of the inquiry. Detainees
 must be informed immediately of charges against them. Once
 charged, a person may be held under pretrial detention
 indefinitely while his case is being investigated. There is
 no bail system. Lawyers are entitled to have access to their
 clients at any time. Meetings are supervised visually by a
 guard.
 There is no evidence that any cases of prolonged incommunicado
 detention or house arrest occurred in 1990. The elimination
 of this practice was the first priority of the ALHR.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment in Algeria. A number
 of opposition figures have lived abroad to escape arrest and
 trial, ostensibly on criminal charges. By the end of 1990,
 most of these persons, including former President Ben Bella,
 had returned to Algeria.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into civil and military
 courts. There are no Islamic courts in Algeria. Judges are
 appointed and promoted by the Ministry of Justice through an
 independent board, which was created in July. The
 Constitution calls for the independence of the judiciary, and
 there were no publicized or known instances of interference
 with the judiciary in 1990. In past years the civil courts
 were not entirely free from executive or military influence'
 Military courts deal directly with espionage and offenses
 committed by military personnel.
 Defendants in civil courts have unrestricted access to
 counsel, who operate without government harassment. The
 Algerian Bar Association has a pool of lawyers who provide
 free services to defendants unable to afford counsel.
 Defendants are made fully aware of the charges against them at
 the time they are bound over for trial. Defendants have the
 right to confront witnesses and present evidence. Trials are
 public, although generally not publicized, and defendants have
 the right of appeal.
 A special court that tried political "crimes" was abolished in
 1989, and it was widely agreed by.human rights organizations
 that there were no political prisoners remaining in Algeria in
 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home,
 and this provision is generally respected, except in cases
 involving the security forces. Police may not enter a house
 without a warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating
 magistrate, and may not enter a residence during the night
 hours. The police and security services are believed to use
 telephone-monitoring systems, reportedly without prior court
 authorization as required by law.
 On September 22, the President announced the dissolution of
 the General Delegation for Documentation and Security (DGDS),
 the state foreign intelligence and internal security
 apparatus. This institution was widely believed to have been
 the leading human rights violator in the Government until the
 Government cracked down on torture in the wake of the 1988
 riots. The abolition of the DGDS, part of the series of
 
 
 1371
 ALGERIA
 governmental reforms aimed at increasing individual liberties
 in Algeria, was widely hailed by national human rights
 organizations. As noted above, the human rights implications
 of this "abolition" remain to be seen.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In 1990 the trend toward greater freedom of speech continued.
 Algerians at all levels of society freely expressed their
 opinions, and criticism of the Government was widely heard.
 Although the Government has not abolished censorship, the
 print media continued to enjoy a far greater degree of
 editorial freedom than they had during any period since
 independence.
 The Government formally turned over ownership of two leading
 dailies to the FLN in May. Although the ruling FLN party
 continued to receive the lion's share of coverage in the
 FLN-controlled press, other parties have created their own
 journals and newspapers, and new independent journals began to
 appear on almost a weekly basis. Individual Algerians,
 writing as columnists, often expressed opinions contrary to
 those of the Government. Criticism of government economic and
 social policies and management appeared relatively often in
 the established, FLN-controlled press, as well as in the
 independent papers, but was more frequently seen in the
 publications of various political parties. Some foreign
 publications were openly sold, although in limited numbers
 because of the scarcity of foreign exchange. The
 French-language Paris weekly Jeune Afrique remains proscribed,
 however, because it is seen as hostile to Algerian interests,
 and Le Monde is no longer available at local newsstands due to
 arrearages in payments to the distributor. In May the
 Government briefly prohibited distribution of a paper
 published in France by former President Ben Bella--ostensibly
 for customs irregularities--but quickly relented after several
 Ben Bella partisans began a hunger strike to publicize the
 government ban.
 Radio and television remained under government control and
 enjoyed somewhat less freedom than other news media. The
 Government claimed that it no longer exercised control over
 the electronic news media; yet the coverage appeared to
 continue to be heavily biased in favor of governmental
 policies and the FLN. However, because of the widespread
 accessibility of satellite dish antennas among the Algerian
 middle class, many Algerians have easy access to European
 television news, which is watched regularly. Some Islamist
 groups have indicated that they would ban satellite dish
 antennas if they come to power in the national elections.
 There has been little focus by Algerian or foreign human
 rights organizations on the issue of academic freedom in
 Algeria. Algerian professors attend international conferences
 regularly, and many Algerian professors are active in human
 rights circles without apparent prejudice to their
 professional careers. However, recently there has been an
 increase in social pressure on the campuses to conform to
 Islamic norms of dress, thought, and behavior in the academic
 context. In the new atmosphere, some female teachers have
 complained that they are finding it more difficult to continue
 teaching, and in some schools religious indoctrination in
 Koranic themes has taken the place of secular education.
 
 
 1372
 
 ALGERIA
 Islamist students disrupted a seminar on democracy at
 Constantine University on January 7, forcing its cancellation
 by the Movement of Democratic University Professors.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1989 Constitution provides for the rights of assembly and
 association without reservation. Implementing legislation
 adopted in 1989 set out procedures for obtaining permits to
 hold public gatherings. The Government routinely granted such
 permits in 1990. Political meetings and large-scale
 demonstrations by diverse political groups have become
 commonplace, in contrast to previous years when political
 discourse was strictly limited. There was a series of mass
 popular demonstrations in protest against continuing economic
 problems. Most ended peacefully, with local authorities
 agreeing to discuss the problems with protesters. On some
 occasions police intervened to disperse the protestors or to
 protect government and private property. In the aftermath of
 one such riot, in Tenes 22 youths were arrested and some were
 allegedly tortured (see Section l.c.). In January police
 forcibly dispersed a demonstration by students in Oran who
 blocked a major highway to protest a 50-percent reduction in
 their stipend. At least seven students were injured.
 According to the July 1989 political associations law,
 membership in political organizations is permitted for all
 Algerians except judges, army and security service personnel,
 and members of the Constitutional Council. All
 nongovernmental associations must be approved by the Interior
 Ministry. Political groups across the spectrum are now openly
 operating throughout Algeria. These range from political
 parties--there were over 30 recognized parties by the end of
 the year--to specialized groups such as the Algerian League of
 Human Rights (ALHR), which monitors Algeria's human rights
 performance; the Committee Against Torture (CAT), which
 investigates allegations of government torture; Islamic trade
 unions; and secularist women's groups. Following the riots in
 October 1988, a number of citizens' associations emerged, many
 with the objective of protesting the use of torture by the
 police and army during the unrest.
 After a long delay, the Government accorded legal status to
 the CAT, which promptly protested the Government's bad faith
 in delaying approval. Critical discussion of the controversy
 and denunciations of the Government's alleged bad faith in
 this case were widely carried in the national press, even by
 those journals still technically owned by the State or ruling
 party.
 As the FLN's monopoly on political life in Algeria continued
 to weaken, its ability to dominate mass organizations in the
 country continued to decline. Although intended to play key
 political roles in mobilizing popular support for government
 programs, the traditional FLN mass organizations have failed
 to do so. The organizations for youth and women are
 increasingly irrelevant, while the more narrowly focused
 farmers, veterans, and workers organizations have somewhat
 greater success in presenting the views of their
 constituencies to the Government. In 1990 several new labor
 unions appeared, sponsored predominantly by the Islamic
 parties (see Section 6.a.).
 
 
 1373
 ALGERIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the Constitution declares Islam to be the state
 religion, it also prohibits discrimination based on "opinion
 or any other personal or social circumstance or condition."
 The Government protects the rights of the very small Christian.
 and Jewish populations and includes leaders of these
 communities at ceremonial state functions. There is little
 evidence of individual prejudice against those born into these
 faiths. The Christian clergy focuses its activities on the
 foreign community since both society and the Government
 strongly discourage conversion from Islam. Those Algerians
 who do convert from Islam do so clandestinely to avoid the
 sanction of family and community. The Jewish population
 numbers less than 300; it maintains a synagogue in central
 Algiers. The Islamic clergy is government trained, and the
 Ministry of Religious Affairs assigns imams to state-funded
 mosques. Privately funded mosques, however, can choose their
 own religious leaders. During the campaign leading up to the
 June local elections; certain mosques were used by Islamic
 movements for political ends, contrary to Ministry of
 Religious Affairs' orders prohibiting the use of places of
 worship for political purposes. The Government, although
 repeatedly warning Islamist political organizations against
 this practice, seemed to lack either the will or the power to
 enforce its warnings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 provided for by law and generally is respected in practice.
 An exit visa is no longer required to exit the country, but
 men who are 19 years of age or older must have proof of
 completion of mandatory military service, and employees of
 state organizations who are paying back educational
 scholarships through work also need authorization. Because of
 bureaucratic inefficiency, passports sometimes take months to-
 acquire. The primary limitation on foreign travel for
 Algerians- s their inability to obtain foreign currency in
 exchange for the Algerian dinar. Algerians can no longer
 purchase a guaranteed amount of foreign exchange for travel
 abroad. Algerians traveling privately must either buy all of
 their foreign currency on the black market--a procedure that
 is both illegal and expensive--or receive the money from
 friends or family who work abroad.
 Travel within Algeria for tourists is generally unrestricted,
 except in areas designated as "military zones." Visitors must
 register with local police if they are staying overnight.
 Gendarmerie checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect
 vehicle registrations and occasionally search vehicles of
 Algerians in search of evidence of black-marketing.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 An estimated 165,000 refugees from the Western Sahara live in
 camps in southwestern Algeria. They are supported by both the
 Government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR). The fate of the nomadic Tuareg of Algeria's southern
 desert continues to be a subject of Algerian governmental and
 international interest. In September Algeria convened an
 international conference in Djanet, bringing together the
 leaders of Algeria, Mali, Niger, and Libya in an effort to
 address the problems the Tuareg face as a result of their
 nomadic way of life. In Algeria the Tuareg are encouraged to
 settle and are generally treated fairly by governmental
 authorities.
 
 
 1374
 ALGERIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 With the approval in 1989 of a kevised Constitution which
 converted Algeria from a one-party Socialist state to a
 multiparty system, the legal framework was in place to allow
 citizens to change their government. Elections for municipal
 and provincial offices were held on June 12. In many
 communities they resulted for the first time in rule by
 Islamic and other opposition political parties. Elections to
 the National Assembly, in which the FLN still holds all the
 seats, are to be held by June 1991.
 The political associations law adopted in July 1989 was
 broadly interpreted by the Interior Ministry, which approved
 applications from political parties ranging from the Socialist
 Vanguard Party (PAGS), which is essentially a Communist party,
 to the Islamic fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) as
 well as former President Ben Bella's party, the Movement for
 Algerian Democracy. In addition to the FLN, there were over
 30 legal political parties as of late 1990. A new electoral
 code, revised to accommodate multiparty elections, included
 some elements of proportional representation.
 In 1990 Algeria's basic political institutions remained the
 same as those that had been set by constitutional revisions in
 1989. The President, charged with assuring national defense
 --through a minister of national defense--and conducting
 foreign policy, can appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister,
 whose selections for government ministers are subject to
 presidential approval. The Government presents its program to
 the National Popular Assembly (APN) for debate and approval.
 If the Assembly rejects the program, the Government must
 resign; a second rejection results in both the dismissal of
 the Government and the dissolution of the APN.
 A continuing issue of major concern is the government-
 sanctioned process by which male Algerians frequently vote by
 proxy for other (usually female) members of their household.
 This law--which currently serves to effectively disenfranchise
 any woman whose husband or father chooses to vote in her
 place--is under heavy attack from a wide spectrum of political
 parties. There are other potentially undemocratic elements in
 the electoral code as it now stands. The provision under
 which an automatic majority in the local assemblies was
 accorded to the party gaining only a plurality of votes has
 also been criticized by a number of political parties. While
 it was widely expected that some of these provisions would be
 reformed before the national legislative elections in 1991,
 these reforms were still being debated in the National
 Assembly at the end of 1990.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Algerian Government normally does not readily discuss its
 human rights record with outside governmental or
 nongovernmental organizations. The Government is extremely
 sensitive to criticism, particularly to allegations of human
 rights violations that appear in the European press, and
 sometimes publishes its own pointed rejoinders to critical
 articles.
 
 
 1375
 
 ALGERIA
 A number of legally established human rights organizations are
 active in Algeria. They include such organizations as the
 Committee Against Torture, the Algerian League of Human
 Rights, which is affiliated to the Maghreb Human Rights
 Association, and the Algerian League for the Defense of Human
 Rights. Algerian human rights activists are widely published
 in the press, and they regularly give press conferences to
 promote their initiatives. Some activists have said, however,
 that they are quietly ignored by the FLN-controlled
 French-language daily El Moudjahid. Other newspapers tend to
 take greater interest in human rights. The French-language El
 Watan, in particular, focuses attention on human rights
 issues. The Arabic language press tends to be less vigilant
 in this regard.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination based
 on birth, race, sex, opinion, or any other personal or social
 condition or circumstance. It omits, however, the specific
 guarantees for women's political, economic, social, and
 cultural rights that had been included in the 1976 version.
 It does not appear that women and minority groups are treated
 unfairly in access to housing, education, and health care.
 The Government's difficulties in meeting these social needs
 are mostly linked to the country's rapid population growth and
 significant drop (until August 1990) in oil revenues. Ethnic
 minorities seem to fare no better or worse than the Arab
 majority. Discrimination against women, however, is due to
 Algeria's traditionalist, patriarchal culture. Berber ethnic
 consciousness remains strong and is fueled primarily by the
 Berbers' desire to preserve their distinctive cultural
 identity and language in the face of the Government's emphasis
 on the development of Algeria's Arab identity. An estimated
 20,000 Berbers marched peacefully on the National Popular
 Assembly in January to demand their cultural rights. Berber
 spokesmen assert that the Government seeks to repress the
 distinct Berber culture, including the teaching and
 propagation of the Amazight (Berber) language. Although
 Amazight had never been taught in primary and secondary
 schools, until 1980 it was taught at Tizi Ouzou university.
 Following rioting in the region in 1980, the university's
 chair for Amazight studies was abolished but was reinstated in
 1990.
 Women encounter discrimination in the workplace, home, and in
 society. Additionally, women's rights to work, live
 independently, and generally function outside the traditional
 Muslim social norm, although previously supported by
 governmeht rhetoric, have come under heated attack, both from
 Islamist political leaders and from conservative elements in
 the society. Under Algeria's 1984 family code, inspired by
 Islamic law, women are perpetual minors who, regardless of
 their age or civil status, remain under the legal guardianship
 of a husband or father. The code also permits polygamy--which
 nevertheless remains rare, due to the housing crisis--and
 makes it more difficult for a woman than a man to obtain a
 divorce. The same law awards only 4 months of alimony to the
 woman regardless of the husband's means and the circumstances
 of the divorce. Because Islamic law and the family code
 forbid Algerian Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims,
 Algerian women engaged to non-Muslim men are zometimes
 subjected to harassment, including passport confiscation by
 authorities upon entering or leaving the country.
 
 
 1376
 ALGERIA
 Culture and tradition tend to relegate the Algerian woman to
 domestic status, and in some parts of society there are strong
 prejudices against women working outside the home. Violence
 against women is known to occur'but little is known about its
 extent. Wife beating and sister beating are presumed to
 occur, but both are increasingly unacceptable among
 middle-class Algerians, and declining--albeit slowly--in
 society at large. Abuse within the family is seldom mentioned
 publicly because of the value attached to family honor. Wives
 who are the victims of wife beating may file criminal charges
 or sue for divorce, but the filing of such cases is rare.
 Both male and female rape is widely reported in the press, but
 because of the social stigma attached to the victims, probably
 severely underreported to the police.
 Algeria's postindependence rhetoric about female equality flew
 squarely in the face of the country's strong tradition and its
 conservative Islamic culture, and was not followed up with
 substantive government action to prohibit discrimination.
 Increasingly in 1990, some Algerian women found themselves
 pressured to wear Islamic dress (usually the hidjab--head-
 covering with ankle-length overdress) by husbands, fathers,
 and brothers jealous of the family's reputation. On the
 streets, women who do not wear the hidjab are occasionally
 harassed by Islamist sympathizers. Whether motivated by
 family pressure, personal piety, or a desire to avoid
 harassment on the street, the number of young women wearing
 Islamic dress has risen dramatically over the last several
 years. -In municipalities run by Islamist political parties,
 there- have been serious efforts to ban women's sports, women's
 swimming, coeducation, and women in the workplace.- In a
 recent case that drew national attention, an Islamist mayor
 exerted strong pressure on his civil service secretary to wear
 the hidjab. The central Government supported her, but
 Islamist intransigence was such that she transferred to
 another position, working for the Government.
 With the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria, secularist
 women regarded themselves increasingly under attack from
 proponents of Shari'a (Islamic) law and those who blame male
 unemployment on female participation in the workplace. But
 women's issues seemed to have only a limited resonance with
 Algerian women in 1990. Although.there were a number of small
 feminist marches in 1990, by far the largest recent women's
 demonstration was a December 1989 march of several hundred
 thousand veiled women in an impressive display of solidarity
 with the Islamist movement. Police intervention was required
 to disperse Islamist youth who were trying to block a march of
 approximately 15,000 women and men to mark International
 Women's Day in March. The Government has attempted to
 reassure feminist women that their rights will be defended,
 but many Algerian women still saw fundamentalist strength and
 the 1984.family code as the greatest threats to women's rights.
 It is estimated that about 500,000 Algerian women work, mostly
 in urban areas, out of a total work force of 4,700,000. An
 increasing number are trained and employed in the professions,
 and some women serve in the armed forces. Ac6ording to the
 most recent government statistics, girls represent 41 per cent
 of all children enrolled in primary and secondary schools.
 According to 1985 statistics (the latest available), 72
 percent of all school-age girls were enrolled in 1985.
 Islamist efforts to end coeducational classes so far have been
 unsuccessful.

 ALGERIA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 From independence until 1989, workers and professionals did
 not have the right to form autonomous labor unions. In June
 the National Assembly enacted legislation granting workers the
 right to form independent trade unions. This law was a
 significant departure from previous Algerian legal practice,
 which had severely curtailed workers' rights to representation
 by limiting trade union activity to the FLN-backed union, the
 General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), and which had been
 the subject of criticism by the International Labor
 Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) for a number
 of years, including at its 1990 session. Under the new law,
 the UGTA monopoly on union activity is ended, and the right of
 Algerians to form and be represented by trade unions of their
 choice was codified into law in accordance with the February
 1989 Constitution. Under the new statute, government approval
 for the creation of a labor union is not necessary. There
 are, however, limits on union activities. Unions are not
 allowed to be associated with political parties, although in
 practice some are. Unions are forbidden to receive funds from
 abroad, and a union's operations can be suspended by the
 Government if it violates the law. Unions are also subject to
 dissolution by judicial means if the courts rule they have
 engaged in illegal activities. In June an Islamic union, the
 Islamist Workers Movement, was organized. There is no
 evidence that the Government has interfered in this union's
 activities. Other unions independent of the UGTA, grouping
 teachers and civil servants, were created during the fall and
 have operated without government interference.
 The February 2, 1990 law on industrial relations permits
 strikes only after mandatory conciliation, mediation, or
 arbitration efforts fail. This law states that arbitral
 decisions on worker-management disputes are binding on both
 parties. However, another section of the same law states that
 if differences persist, after conciliation and mediation
 efforts have been attempted (arbitration is not specifically
 mentioned in this context), workers may strike after giving 8
 days' notice of their intention. The strike must be approved
 by a majority vote of workers in a secret ballot.
 The result of the new law was a renaissance of labor activity
 as well as numerous strikes in all sectors of society.
 Although many of these strikes were not legally authorized
 under the terms set by the law, the Government has not
 prosecuted the persons involved. In 1990 there were wildcat
 and organized strikes in virtually every sector of the
 economy; teachers, garbagemen, diplomats, air traffic
 controllers, airport ground crews, journalists, and medical
 personnel were among the groups that went on strike. Certain
 categories of government employees, legally forbidden to
 strike, such as diplomats and magistrates; did so routinely
 without apparent governmental sanction. Treasury employees
 went on strike for 1 week in January, demanding higher
 allowances and increased supplementary payments for food and
 transportation that are customarily granted as part of the
 salary package. They also sought standardization of job
 classifications for government employees. This strike
 preyented a million government workers from getting paid and
 paralyzed the operation of provincial and local governments.
 The strike was settled when the Government agreed to adopt a
 more generous compensation package.
 
 
 1378
 
 ALGERIA
 In 1990 the UGTA continued to represent Algeria in the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU) and
 in the Maghreb Arab Union regional association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the June 2 law on trade union activity, Algerians have
 wide freedoms to form independent trade unions. It prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers. It also permits all unions, whether
 longstanding or newly created, to recruit members at the
 workplace. This right appears to have been consistently
 upheld. The law also provides effective mechanisms for
 resolving trade union member complaints of antiunion practices
 by employers. Both the June 2 law and the April 21 law on
 work relations provide for collective bargaining, which has
 been freely practiced. There are no special economic zones in
 Algeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is incompatible with the
 Constitution's sections on individual rights, and the penal
 code has recently been amended to ban it explicitly. At its
 1990 session, however, the COE noted its.continuing concern
 over a 1987 act that makes any person who facilitates an
 association whose objectives are contrary'to the "established
 institutional system" liable for imprisonment with the
 obligation to work. This act was superseded by a new law in
 late 1990. Although the language cited by the COE was not
 changed, the Government asserts that prisoners are paid for
 any work they perform and that forced labor does not exist in
 Algerian prisons.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum employment age is 16 years. Work inspectors, who
 report to the Government, are responsible for enforcing the
 minimum employment age by periodic or unannounced inspection
 visits to the workplace. The minimum age is enforced in the
 state sector, the country's largest employment sector. It is
 not effectively enforced in the agricultural sector or in the
 small private sector, but violations are not widespread. With
 continuing economic hardship, however, there was an increase
 in the number of children occupied in informal employment,
 such as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The April 21 law on work relations defines the overall
 framework for acceptable conditions of work, but leaves
 specific policies with regard to hours, salaries, and other
 work conditions to the discretion of employers in consultation
 with employees. Algeria has a 44-hour workweek and well
 developed occupational and health regulations, but enforcement
 by government work inspectors is generally lax. The legal
 minimum wage was very low--$201.92 per month, at the official
 exchange rate (as of mid-December 1990), and is not adequate
 to provide a family with a decent standard of living.
