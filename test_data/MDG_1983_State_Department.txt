 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar is governed by a President elected in a controlled
 system under which there is limited room for choice. There is a
 broad spectrum of opinion represented in the electoral process.
 Elections are actively contested within the political framework
 sanctioned by the Government. This framework permits political
 activity only by the seven parties making up the National Front
 for the Defense of the Revolution. Although all these parties
 theoretically share a commitment to a "Socialist" state, they
 have established positions ranging from a relatively moderate,
 pro-Western stance to support for pro-Soviet interests. They
 also compete against each other in local, regional, and national
 elections. In the recent elections to the Popular National
 Assembly (the country's legislative body), the four major
 parties fielded from 94 to 135 candidates each to contest the
 136 seats. Additionally, three smaller parties presented slates
 of candidates in regions of the country where they were
 strongest.
 The President ostensibly rules the country in conjunction with
 the Supreme Revolutionary Council (the country's principal policy-
 making body which is chosen by the President), and the National
 Assembly. In practice, however, the President dominates the
 governing process and there is no evidence that the other organs
 of government have effectively opposed him on major issues. The
 President has broad constitutional powers, and his position is
 further strengthened by the influential role played by his
 political party, Arema, which holds an overwhelming majority in
 the National Assembly and which has a broad base of popular
 support. Also contributing to the President's power are his
 close ties to the state security apparatus, the Director General
 of Investigation and Documentation, of which his brother-in-law
 is the Director. The President was reelected to a second seven
 year term in 1982, defeating the candidate of one of the other
 National Front parties. There is currently no effective opposi-
 tion program with which he must contend.
 The Malagasy Constitution has made 'socialism" the state's unique
 political philosophy. This has led to nationalization of a major
 portion of the economy although the private sector still plays an
 important role. Currently, the country's economy is in serious
 straits, with declining production in all sectors, burgeoning
 foreign debt, and rising unemployment. The problem has been
 further exacerbated by weak markets for export commodities, an
 inability to finance imports necessary for industrial production,
 and by the Government's overinvolvement in the marketing mecha-
 nisms especially in the agricultural sector. The Government has
 made efforts at economic liberalization and reform in accordance
 with conditions imposed by the World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund, in return for their assistance. However, pros-
 pects for a rapid improvement in the economic situation are
 unlikely and conditions are expected to worsen further before an
 upturn is seen.
 Basic human rights are guaranteed by the Malagasy Constitution.
 In practice, however, some of these rights are suppressed and
 others are not respected if the individual is accused of such
 generalized offenses as opposing the creation of the Socialist
 state or endangering national unity. In the past year, there have
 been allegations of brutality in the interrogation of prisoners
 and incidents of election fraud in the 1982 Presidential and 1983
 National Assembly elections. These charges of brutality have
 been decried in the independent press, and the judiciary has
 
 (209)
 
 
 210
 rendered decisions against the Government in the election fraud
 cases. In cases where election fraud was discovered, it was not
 widespread nor did it have a significant effect on overall
 election results.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Assassination or government-sanctioned killings are not part of
 the Malagasy political ethos. Since independence there has been
 only one political assassination. There has been no reliable
 evidence to support other alleged assassination plots. Nor have
 there been any reports in the past year of unnecessary force or
 of other actions by the security forces which resulted in loss of
 life.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1983, there have been no reported cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been continuing allegations of brutality being used by
 the state security forces in their interrogation of persons
 arrested. The only substantiated allegations were those dis-
 cussed by the court during the trial of alleged coup-plotters.
 There was no official government response to the comments made by
 the presiding magistrate at the trial. During three separate
 trials of coup-plotters, all those detained on antistate charges
 were either acquitted or found guilty and sentenced. In the
 first trial, five defendants were acquitted. Eight defendants
 received three to five year sentences, all of which were sus-
 pended. In   the second trial, all three defendants were found
 guilty. Two were sentenced to 20 years of forced labor and
 one to 10 years. In the third trial, one defendant was sentenced
 to 10 years of forced labor while the remaining three were
 acquitted. In Madagascar, prison conditions are reported to be
 poor. Overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, health care, and
 diet are all problems in the prisons, and reflect the generally
 difficult economic situation which prevails in the country.
 There is no evidence of systematic or widespread mistreatment of
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no concept of habeas corpus in the Malagasy legal sys-
 tem.  In a normal criminal case the accused must be charged
 within three days or must be released. However, persons sus-
 pected of activity against the state may be legally detained,
 incommunicado, for 15 days, subject to indefinite extension if
 considered necessary by the Government. Defendants are generally
 charged formally and clearly within the specified timeframe and
 upon being charged are entitled to the assistance of counsel.
 Counsel is readily available, and if a defendant does not already
 have a court-appointed attorney or cannot afford one, court-
 appointed counsel will be provided. Arbitrary arrest or deten-
 tion occurs, however, in those cases which involve an alleged
 
 
 211
 threat to the state. In such cases, the authorities may not
 bother with legal formalities in making an arrest. Some defend-
 ants in cases involving alleged coup-plotting were detained
 without being brought to trial for periods ranging from one year
 and eight months to over five years. Extended periods of pre-
 trial detention are the exception, not the rule, and are usually
 limited to cases considered genuine threats to the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Malagasy Constitution the country's judiciary is
 independent of the Government, and this is in fact the case.
 During 1983, there were a number of judicial judgments against
 the Government, some of which involved charges of election
 fraud. The courts also acquitted several individuals charged
 with plotting a coup. Although other defendants were eventually
 found guilty, the trial was fairly conducted, the defendants were
 represented by counsel, and the proceedings were followed by the
 public and media. Judicial procedures are open and impartial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The state does not generally intervene in the nonpolitical
 aspects of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy law, and intrusions into an individual's residence must
 be made under the authority of a warrant. Although government
 economic and social policies limit the choices open to an individ-
 ual, the Malagasy may make their own decisions in such matters
 as changing jobs or residence, marriage, having children, or
 joining or declining to join political parties or social organi-
 zations, without government coercion or interference.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The media in Madagascar are subject to government censorship.
 The Government provides guidelines on prohibited topics, but
 these are not always explicit nor are they rigorously enforced.
 When enforced, the newspapers generally leave blank those columns
 where the deleted material would have appeared. In general, the
 censorship policies are designed to forestall media criticism of
 the President and top government officials and their actions.
 Government control in this area is further strengthened by state
 ownership of the radio and television stations. The Government
 also issues some news publications through the Ministry of
 Information. There are, however, independent, privately owned
 newspapers as well, which can criticize within the above-
 mentioned guidelines what they perceive as the failings of the
 Government. Critical examination of a range of policy issues
 such as economic management, transportation, education, etc.,
 also can be found in the media. Direct attacks on the President
 himself are not permitted in the censored press. However,
 criticism of Presidential policies and decisions are published.
 Individual citizens are free to voice their dissatisfaction with
 the Government without fear of arrest or harassment by the
 authorities. Although the distribution of uncensored publica-
 tions is officially prohibited, no instance is known in which
 action has been taken against them.
 
 
 212
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of unrestricted assembly and association is denied
 in Madagascar. Permits are required to hold public meetings and
 can be denied by the Government if officials believe that the
 meeting poses a threat to the Socialist state or endangers
 national unity. Thus, requests to hold public rallies or
 assemblies designed to express substantive dissent or dissatis-
 faction with government policies are likely to be denied. In
 addition, as political activity by groups other than National
 Front parties is prohibited, dissenting political opinion cannot
 avail itself of the forums of public conventions, rallies, or
 assemblies. Although the right to organize labor unions is
 recognized, unions do not play a major role either politically or
 economically. The labor force of 4.5 million is mostly agrarian
 and union labor accounts for less than five percent of the total.
 Unions are, in theory, permitted to strike and conduct substan-
 tive wage negotiations. If the Government perceives these
 activities as threatening to disrupt government economic pro-
 grams, however, they are unlikely to be tolerated. Major unions
 are affiliated with the National Front parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government of Madagascar is secular and has no official
 position on religion. The population exercises broad religious
 freedom with no government interference, direct or otherwise.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religious affiliation,
 and individuals are free to follow the faith of their choice.
 Missionaries and clergy are permitted to operate freely and the
 Government has so far made no effort to restrain Christian
 churches which have become more outspoken in their criticism of
 government policies. Almost half of the population is either
 Catholic or Protestant with the remainder following traditional
 Malagasy religious beliefs or other faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has imposed no restrictions upon travel within the
 country. Official approval must be obtained for trips outside
 the country, but there has been only one instance in the past in
 which approval was denied due to the individual's political
 views. Foreign travel is impeded by the difficulty of obtaining
 foreign currency, as the Malagasy franc is not convertible
 abroad. The Government limits the amount of hard currency that
 can be obtained for foreign travel. There is no refugee popula-
 tion in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The electoral process in Madagascar permits universal direct
 suffrage, yet the electorate's choice is constrained by the
 nature of the political system. As explained in the introduction,
 the only political parties allowed to operate in Madagascar are
 those which are members of the National Front. Despite the
 obligatory commitment to socialism required of all National Front
 members, there exists a range of ideological and policy views
 among the Front parties.
 
 
 213
 Within this range of electoral choice there are viewpoints
 represented that are at odds with the policies of the administra-
 tion. The electoral process gives the voters a chance to choose
 among these differing views in local and regional elections and
 in the National Assembly and Presidential campaigns.
 In the 1982 Presidential election, the opposition candidate
 was a vocal critic of the incumbent President. His views created
 considerable interest and provided variety to the election cam-
 paign. The electoral process, although not completely free
 from irregularities, was essentially straightforward.
 The political system in Madagascar reflects a considerable
 degree of ethnic balance. There are no special conditions of
 nationality or citizenship which exclude any elements in society
 from participating in the existing political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not cooperate with groups wishing to investi-
 gate alleged human rights violations. There are no official
 representatives of human rights organizations in Madagascar, and
 Amnesty International representatives were denied visas in 1981.
 In 1982, when the President's opponent in the election campaign
 called for supervision of the elections by Amnesty International,
 the President rejected this proposal as being in derogation of
 national sovereignty.
 In the absence of private human rights groups, the Christian
 churches in the country have taken the lead in advocating human
 rights. The churches have not hesitated to criticize the govern-
 ment's record in this area, and they continue to do so. Although
 the Government is sensitive to criticism emanating from this
 quarter it has not officially responded to questions or criti-
 cisms from the churches or any other groups.
 Amnesty International in 1982 adopted one prisoner of conscience
 and continued to seek the trial of three detainees held without
 trial since 1977 and investigated the cases of several people
 detained on suspicion of involvement in political violence.
 These individuals were tried in 1983 and among others either
 released or convicted. Freedom House rates Madagascar "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Madagascar's economic situation has been steadily deteriorating,
 and the outlook for improvement in the immediate future is
 bleak. The Government has actively undertaken many reforms in
 conjunction with World Bank and International Monetary Fund
 assistance and is working closely with Western nations who
 continue to provide development assistance.
 Real gross national product (GNP) has fallen each year over the
 past decade, and per capita GNP in 1981 was approximately $313.
 As the population of 9.5 million continues to grow at a rate of
 2.8 percent annually, unemployment is becoming an increasingly
 serious problem. This problem is exacerbated by the migration of
 the rural poor into urban areas which cannot provide sufficient
 employment.
 
 
 214
 The agricultural sector is the most important in the economy
 accounting for almost 90 percent of employment and approximately
 85 percent of export earnings. However, agricultural production
 has declined to the point where Madagascar has been forced to
 import rice, the staple of the Malagasy diet. Much of this
 decline is attributable to government marketing policies which
 created consumer subsidies and controlled producer prices.
 Recent liberalizations in the marketing system could ameliorate
 this situation, and domestic production has increased in 1983.
 Despite problems with agricultural production, individual levels
 of caloric intake remain high. World Bank figures set caloric
 intake at 81 percent of required levels in 1977; however, other
 sources put that figure at 115 percent. World Bank statistics
 for 1980 still place calorie consumption at 109 percent of
 requirement. Nevertheless malnutrition and dietary deficiencies
 are ongoing problems due to erratic supply and distribution of
 fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy products, and meat. Further, only
 about one-fourth of the population has access to supplies of safe
 drinking water.
 Health care delivery systems are plagued with shortages of
 medical personnel, inadequate facilities, and limited supplies of
 antibiotics and other medicines. Malaria remains a continuing
 problem especially in coastal areas, and the population is quite
 vulnerable to outbreaks of disease following natural disasters
 such as flooding. Life expectancy at birth was 47.08 years in
 1980, and the infant mortality rate was 85.20 per 1,000 in 1983.
 The Government is working with the U.N. Educational, Cultural
 and Scientific Organization to evaluate the existing educational
 system. World Bank figures for 1980 show primary school enroll-
 ment ratios at 99 percent with 83 percent female enrollment and
 115 percent male enrollment.   (This latter figure reflects the
 fact that the number of males in primary school is larger than
 the number of males in the age group which would normally be in
 primary school.) These recent dramatic increases in enrollment
 have resulted in overburdened facilities, shortages of qualified
 teachers, and extremely high student-teacher ratios in the public
 school system. The situation is unlikely to improve in the near
 future, and few families can afford the private or parochial
 schools. Thus, despite government efforts, the quality of the
 education provided is questionable.
 There is little overt discrimination against individuals on the
 basis of ethnic grouping or sex in Madagascar. Although there
 are numerous indigenous ethnic groups in Madagascar, the society
 is relatively homogenous due to a common language and a tendency
 for what were perhaps once disparate cultures to draw together in
 an island environment. There are still distinctions among these
 groups, but there is little discrimination by one group against
 another. Ethnic Indian, Chinese, and French communities have
 experienced some resentment from the Malagasy and occasionally
 have been the target of local government policies favoring
 Malagasy nationals. However, actual discriminatory treatment is
 not widespread and is not openly tolerated by the Central
 Government.
 Sexual discrimination is not considered to be a major problem
 in Madagascar. Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal
 society, and a highly visible role for women has been a long-
 recognized and integral part of the country's sociological
 
 
 215
 framework.  There are no social restrictions concerning activi-
 ties in which women may engage. Women have a lengthy tradition
 of involvement in high-level political activity, and currently
 there are women members of the Cabinet, Supreme Revolutionary
 Council, and the National Assembly. Women are also very active
 and play major roles in the various political parties. Women
 have played a prominent role in the business and economic life of
 the country, with many of them managing or owning business
 concerns or filling management positions in state industries.
 Education at all levels is open to women. Well over 80 percent
 of all primary school age females are enrolled in school.
 However, women in rural areas and among the poor face a greater
 degree of hardship and often find themselves in a more subser-
 vient role than their more affluent counterparts. In addition to
 the responsibilities associated with child rearing and household
 management, economic necessity forces these women to engage in
 farm labor or other similar activities. These conditions stem
 more from socioeconomic factors than from a discriminatory bias
 toward women in Malagasy society.
