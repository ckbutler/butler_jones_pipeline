 ETHIOPIA
 Serious violations of individual rights and civil and politi-
 cal liberties take place in Ethiopia amidst a restructured
 economic and social system that is aimed at improving the
 basic living conditions of the great majority of the country's
 poor.   After the 1974 revolution, the already significant
 level of human rights abuses increased dramatically as the
 Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE)
 consolidated its political control. The current status of
 human rights is affected by many political opposition move-
 ments, pressures generated by wars on two fronts, and various
 insurrections. Since the revolution, the PMGSE has launched
 several extensive campaigns of repression against its internal
 enemies, most notably the "Red Terror" drive of December 1977
 to April 1978. This was an intense, widespread government
 campaign of violence and terror   Amnesty International in
 its report published in November 1978, stated that this
 campaign resulted in several thousands to perhaps tens
 of thousands of men, women and children killed, tortured and
 imprisoned.
 This political violence primarily affected urban dwellers,
 especially in Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian peasants, who make
 up at least 85 percent of the total population, have gained
 economically since the revolution from land reform and
 administrative assistance. More than 250,000 peasants are
 scheduled to be moved from infertile areas of chronic starva-
 tion (such as Welo and Tigray) to more fertile areas further
 south. It is possible that much smaller numbers are being
 relocated to settle in the predominantly Somali inhabited
 Ogaden.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Reports of torture were heard less frequently in 1979 than in
 previous years. Nevertheless, on the basis of such reports,
 it still appears likely that the government tortures political
 and military prisoners to extract information or confessions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The rampant abuses of previous years have abated somewhat.
 Prison conditions are understood to have been adequate in
 1977 due in part to reduced density, although conditions in
 the Grand Palace basement cells in which a small number of
 important political prisoners are detained are reportedly
 still poor. Family members provide food for prisoners;
 visits and the exchange of messages are sometimes allowed.
 Work furloughs are occasionally allowed for some political
 prisoners. At least 100 summary executions for political
 reasons are believed to have taken place in 1979, much
 fewer than in 1978. No access is permitted to prisoners by
 representatives of international organizations such as the
 ICRC.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests occur frequently, but are less common and
 less serious in their consequences than in the last few
 years. Arrests for political reasons by the Government's
 security apparatus still continue, and may result in lengthy
 imprisonment or execution. The bulk of non-criminal arrests
 are now for non-participation in mandatory political activity,
 for curfew violations, or for participation in unauthorized
 meetings. In the majority of cases, such arrests are carried
 out by neighborhood patrols, and the arrestees are released
 in anywhere from a few hours to several days. The power of
 arrest of the neighborhood associations (Kebeles) is not
 subject to any formal controls, but they are now required to
 report to higher authority the names of persons held for over
 24 hours. The government does acknowledge holding persons
 guilty of "anti-people" or "anti-revolutionary" acts. Habeas
 corpus does not exist. Persons can be held as long as for
 whatever reason,the government wishes. Charges as such
 are not normally brought against political prisoners; their
 cases are handled administratively by security organs of the
 PMGSE. Political prisoners do not have right to counsel.
 Persons can be held clandestinely, and therefore can be
 said to have "disappeared." There is a normal legal process
 and criminal code in effect for criminal offenses, as well as
 a parallel "revolutionary" system of neighborhood justice for
 petty offenses.
 d. Denial of Fair Trial
 Individuals arrested on political grounds are denied fair
 trial. Investigations are conducted by government entities
 responsible to the Provisional Military Administrative
 Council (PMAC), the ruling military junta which provides
 directives to the PMGSE. Arrested individuals can then be
 released, imprisoned further or executed without explanation.
 There are no restraints on, or recourse against, such actions.
 There are reports that a system of administrative (not
 judicial) review of cases may be instituted. Civilians are
 not usually tried by military courts. Unless they are
 caught in armed insurrectionary activity. Such proceed-
 ings have been carried out in camera.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 During the 1977/1978 "Red Terror" campaign, house-to-house
 searches were normal practice. No judicial warrants for such
 searches were required. Families were often arrested and
 taken from their houses in the middle of the night by
 security organizations of various levels. The degree of this
 kind of abuse has declined considerably, but individuals
 still have no legal guarantees of security in their homes.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 It is the stated policy of the PMGSE to improve the political,
 social and economic condition of the Ethiopian masses. Its
 efforts at implementation have, however, been disrupted by
 revolution and war. The communist-oriented PMGSE seeks to
 institute an equitable distribution of income and wealth and
 to restructure the economy to favor those disadvantaged
 under the old regime, i.e., the overwhelming mass of landless
 peasants and the lowly paid or unemployed urban dwellers.
 Large private estates have been nationalized. Some are now
 
 
 68
 operated as state farms, others have been turned over to the
 previous tenants to farm. Wages have been frozen at the top
 levels and sometimes increased at the bottom. The new
 tax law introduced in 1978 is sharply progressive. The most
 noticeable improvements have taken place among the peasantry,
 which comprises over 85 percent of the Ethiopian population.
 The Government's sweeping land reform of 1974-75, the increase
 in prices paid to farmers and the encouragement of farmers
 associations have improved the lot of this vast majority.
 Incomes have risen and food availability has increased.
 Since the revolution, farmers have enjoyed somewhat greater
 control over their livelihood. These gains may be at least
 partially reversed by the Government's current drive to
 collectivize Ethiopian agriculture, announced in a directive
 June 26, 1979.
 Given the ease with which minimal shelter can be constructed
 from indigenous materials, housing is not a serious problem
 for a country with a per capita GDP level of $100 per annum.
 Beginning in 1975, large increases in capital budgets of the
 agriculture and health sectors resulted in more service in
 rural areas. They are nonetheless still minimal. Faced with
 a rate of only about seven percent, the government has
 launched a massive campaign across the country to achieve
 universal literacy within ten years, amd has made education
 more accessible to the peasantry than before the revolution.
 Low cost health care is provided in urban areas and whereever
 possible in rural areas. Health clinics have been establish-
 ed in most district administrative centers (perhaps 75 - 80
 clinics), and health stations are being established in most
 sub-district headquarters (about 550 in all). One obstacle
 to rural social service delivery is a poor transportation
 network--approximately 50 percent of the population lives
 more than one-half day's walk from a road. Lack of funds,
 equipment and trained personnel are also a problem. Criteria
 for admission into post secondary educational institutions
 have been modified since the revolution to benefit the rural
 poor and the politically reliable --but with a decline
 in quality at the university level.
 Most large firms in Ethiopia have been nationalized. All
 rental property has been nationalized.   Property remaining
 in private hands is not well protected; there are many cases
 of property being seized without the benefit of any legal
 process. Given the scarce resources available to PMGSE, and
 the high level of military expenditure little progress on
 development was made in 1979. The urban dweller has remained
 poor. Such staple items as food grains, cooking oil, sugar,
 and soap are in short supply. Remedial actions (opening
 neigh borhood stores, price controls, measures against
 hoarding) have been only partially ice controls, measures
 against hoarding) have been only partially
 borhood stores, price controls, measures
 against hoarding) have been only partially
 effective in overcoming tJie shortages.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of religion for the non-Christian
 majority of Ethiopia has been enlarged since the
 
 
 69
 Revolution. Freedom of speech, press and assembly enjoy no
 legal guarantees and are not tolerated. Political cadres
 have been placed in many government organizations, civil and
 military and businesses as well as in secondary school and
 the University to ensure political conformity. Educational
 curricula at all levels are being revised along Marxist-
 Leninist lines. Freedom of religion for the non-Christian
 majority has been enlarged since the Revolution. However
 some religious organizations have encountered difficulty in
 Ethiopia. The Government has begun in selected instances to
 move against what it calls "new religions", i.e. those not
 indigenous to Ethiopia, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and
 Pentacostals. Hundreds of Pentacostals have reportedly been
 arrested around the country. Allegations that PMGSE is
 discriminating against the Falashas, an ancient Jewish group
 centered in Gonda Region appear to be unfounded. The
 Valashas have benefitted from land reforms. However, the
 PMGSE is unable to protect some Falashas in the more remote
 areas from violence by rebel groups.
 The Ethiopian news media are owned and controlled by the
 Government. No views other than those of the Government are
 expressed. However, some censorship is imposed sporadically
 on editions of imported newspapers and magazines which
 contain items critical of the PMGSE or its allies. Many
 journalists have been imprisoned for political reasons.
 Foreign correspondents have difficulty obtaining visas,
 except for PMGSE-iponsored shows such as Revolution Day.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Roadblocks and searches by military and provincial authori-
 ties, by peasant associations and by neighborhood associa-
 tions inhibit travel in rural areas. Permission to travel
 is generally subject to government approval, but on the
 whole, internal travel seems relatively unhindered except in
 combat zones and military maneuver areas. Foreign travel
 and emigration have both been reduced as a matter of policy.
 People may travel on business or to study, but the required
 exit permits are difficult to obtain.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in national political life is impossible except
 in support of the PMACC, or as a member of one of the numerous
 clandestine opposition groups. Mass organizations (labor,
 peasants, youth, women, and teachers) sponsored by the PMAC
 serve only to implement PMAC policy. On the local level
 there has been a substantial increase in political activity
 since the pre-revolutionary days. The PMGSE has organized
 many uneducated, formerly powerless workers and farmers into
 a variety of associations to adjudicate local disputes, press
 for improved labor conditions and manage local development
 efforts. These associations have real power on the local
 level. However, participation in the associations is
 mandatory. They often act as instruments of coercion, and
 they placed a prominent role in the "Red Terror" campaign.
 
 
 An effort is being made to improve the traditionally subjugat-
 ed status of Ethiopian women. Women are publicly encouraged
 to participate more fully in economic and political affairs.
 A women was recently appointed Permanent Secretary in the
 Ministry of Finance. Government-sponsored women's associa-
 tions have been formed at local and regional levels. Men
 who abuse their wives are subject to penalty, and cases are
 publicized as examples of unacceptable behavior.
 Labor unions in Ethiopia are entirely controlled by the
 Government and serve only to mobilize and control workers.
 The modest level of independence enjoyed by unions even a
 year ago has disappeared. Workers are frequently pressed to
 make "voluntary" contributions of money and time to various
 social projects sponsored by the PMGSE. Workers are occasion-
 ally taken into work camps in the countryside for weeks or
 months at a time for participation in economic development
 projects. The choice of workplace is frequently made by the
 Government. College graduates, for example, are assigned
 jobs upon graduation. Most workers, including management,
 cannot change jobs without Government approval. Government
 policy excludes "rich" peasants (so-called "kulaks") from
 leadership in collective farms, although the extent to which
 this policy has been implemented is not clear.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Ethiopian Government rejects international or other
 investigations as the grounds that they constitute unwarrant-
 ed interference in its internal affairs. The PMGSE claims
 that the human rights enjoyed by the Ethiopian masses have
 improved considerably since the revolution. It dismisses
 the concept of "individual human rights" as irrelevant tQ a
 revolutionary Government which is building a Marxist society.
 Amnesty International sent a cable on July 26, 1979 to
 Ethiopian Head of State Mengistu requesting information
 about 26 political prisoners. No reply was received.
 By the same token, the PMGSE has rejected international
 allegations that it is violating the rights of the Falashas,
 as well as appeals to permit the Falashas to emigrate to
 Israel.
