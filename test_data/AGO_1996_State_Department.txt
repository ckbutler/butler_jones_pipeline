 ANGOLA
 The Republic of Angola is in transition from a single party state to a multiparty
 democracy. The Papular Movement for the Liberation of Angla (MPLA) has ruled
 Angola since its indepndene from Portugal in 1975. The Constitution was revised
 in 1991 to provide for elections and for guarantees of basic human rights, but the
 Government does nat generally respect its provisions in practice. In 1992 President
 Jose Eduardo dos Santos received a plurality of the votes in Angla's first elections,
 which United Nations' (U.N.) observers declared to be free and fair. Pending final
 resolution of the peace process, the President and the MPLA, backed by the security
 services, continue to dominate the Government. The judiciary is not independent of
 the President and the MPIA.
 In November 1994, the Government signed the Lusaka Protocol peace accord with
 the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in an effort to
 end 20 years of civil war. Under the auspices of the Unted Nations Angola Peace-
 keeping Mission (UNAVEM I) and with the help of three observer countries-the
 United States, Portugal, and Russia-the Government and UNITA continue to ira-
 plement the Lusaka Prtocor's prvisions far a cease-fire, withdrawal of forces in
 contact, disarming and quartering of UNITA farces, integration of some UNITA sol-
 diers into the Angolan armed farces, demobilization of remaining combatants, and
 reation of a Government of National Reconciliation. In May the National Assembly
 passed and President Dos Santos signed a blanket amnesty covering all crimes
 under military as well as civilian law against internal state security committed from
 May 31, 1991, to May 8, 1996. Passage of this law removed one of the last obstacles
 to UNITA's integration into Angola's armed forces.
 The Ministry of the Interior is responsible far internal security. It exercises this
 function through the National Police and the paramilitary Rapid Intervention Police
 created in 1992 as an elite military force. The armed forces are responsible for ex-
 ternal security. Prior to implementation of the Lusaka Protocol-mandated cease-fire,
 the, were primarily engaged in fighting the civil war against UNITA. While civilian
 authorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces, there were fr-
 quent instances in which the security forces acted independently of government au-
 thority. Members of the security forces committed numerous, serious human rights
 abuses.
 Angala's developing economy, in transition from a centrally directed to a market-
 based model, has significantpotential to exploit extensive natural resource reserves
 and rich agricultural lands. Principal exports are petroleum and diamonds, which
 together with foreign aid are the countrs leading sources of foreign exchange. Oil
 revenues for 1996 exceeded $4 billion and diamond revenues exceeded $850 million.
 Subsistence agriculture, the traditional livelihood far the majority of Angola's ap-
 proximately 12 million citizens, was severely constrained by heavily mined fields
 and rads as well as by beth government and UNITA restrictions on freedom of
 movement. In 1996 more than 3 million Angolans remained displaced or affected by
 the war, including 1.2 million who relied on emergency food aid supplied by the
 international donor community. Areas under government control suffered from
 hyperinflation, scarcity of consumer goods, massive unemployment and under-
 employment, and continuing pervasive corruption. While the Government took some
 measures to increase the availability and control prices of consumer staples, these
 initiatives did not remedy the root causes of economic instability and are not sus-
 tainable. Areas controlled by UNITA experienced scarcities of consumer goods along
 with massive unemployment and underemployment. Annual per capita grass na-
 tional product is roughly $320, but much of the country's wealth remains con-
 centrated in the hands of the small MPLA, military, and business elites. The aver-
 age monthly salary of wage earners is equivalent to only about $10 ($50 to $100
 
 
 in the Luanda area), which provides most of the population with a very low stand-
 ard of living.
 Although there was some improvement, the Government's human rights record
 continued to be poor, and it continued to commit numerous, serious abuses. Mem-
 bers of the security forces committed numerous extrajudicial killings, arbitrarily and
 secretly arrested and detained individuals, and routinely tortured and beat detain-
 ees. The Government did not take effective action to punish abusers. The Govern-
 ment continued to inhibit independent investigations of human rights abuses. Gov-
 ernment leaders cited the 20-year civil war to justify allowing emergency consider-
 ations to override concerns over human rights abuses. Prison conditions were life
 threatening. The Government restricted freedom of expression, the press, assembly,
 and association. While some improvements were made, citizens' freedom of move-
 ment continues to be restricted. The judiciary is not independent from the President
 and the MPLA, and the judicial system does not assure fair trials. Although Angola
 is nominally a multiparty democracy, citizens have no effective means to change
 their government. Parliamentary elections due to be held in 1996 were postponed
 for between 2 and 4 years under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol; presidential elec-
 tions are to be held when the United Nations determines that appropriate condi-
 tions exist. Discrimination and violence against women were widespread. Children
 and the disabled continued to suffer as a result of the civil war and poor economic
 conditions. The Government continued to dominate the labor movement, and there
 was no improvement in the poor worker rights situation.
 UNITA human rights abuses in territories under its control included disappear-
 ances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, denial of fair public trial, forced conscrip-
 tion, and violations of humanitarian law, including attacks on civilian populations.
 UNITA also restricted freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, and
 movement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kil/ing.-Politically and economically moti-
 vated violence by state security forces and common criminal violence were often in-
 distinguishable. A large number of violent crimes including robbery, vehicle hijack-
 ings, assault, kidnaping, rape, and murder were committed by members of the mili-
 tary and police forces both in and out of uniform. Although most criminal activity
 was committed by poorly and irregularly paid rogue elements of the security forces,
 there were credible reports that some of these attacks were carried out under orders
 from the Government. The Government did not take any effective action to punish
 abusers.
 There were credible reports that the Rapid Intervention Police summarily exe-
 cuted people caught in the act of committing crimes. Frequent gun battles between
 members of the military and police, and fighting among soldiers, police, and bandits
 in streets, suburbs, and open air markets of major urban centers resulted in numer-
 ous civilian casualties.
 There were credible reports that many prisoners died as a result of inadequate
 food and medical treatment (see Section 1.c.).
 The 1995 killing of independent journalist Ricardo de Mello remains unsolved, as
 does the October murder of state-owned television journalist Antonio Casmiro in
 Cabinda (see Section 2.a.). Similarly the 1994 assassination of the Vice Governor of
 Malange province remains unsolved. The results of the investigation into the No-
 vember 1993 death of opposition politician Carlos Simeao were never released. It
 is widely believed that these persons were killed for political reasons.
 UNITA forces continued to kill civilians (see Section 1.g.). It was credibly alleged
 that dozens of prisoners died in UNITA custody (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.).
 In June private demining companies clearing oil production facilities in Soyo,
 Zaire province, uncovered a mass grave site. More than 100 bodies were found, and
 it is likely that many more will be uncovered as dmining work progresses. Credible
 evidence indicates that these killings were committed by UNITA forces during their
 capture of the city in May 1993. UNAVEM observers have not yet concluded their
 investigation into this discovery. Given the aver 500,000 war and war-related deaths
 attributed to Angola's 20-year civil war, it is likely that additional mass graves will
 be discovered.
 b. Disappearance.-The Government and UNITA continued to accuse each other
 of abductions and disappearances of civilians. There are reportedly dozens of
 kidnapings, abductions, and disappearances per month.
 There were no developments in the August 1994 disappearances of two individ-
 uals associated with Africare, Vincent Douma and Oliveira Lembe. The Inter-
 
 
 3
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and U.N. agencies continued searching
 for them throughout the year.
 The ICRC reclassified 78 prisoners of UNITA as "disappeared." There were credi-
 ble allegations that many of these persons died in UNITA custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible firsthand reports that the police committed torture. Prison offi-
 cials employed by the Interior Ministry routinely beat accused individuals in
 Comarca de Viana, a prison on the outskirts of Luanda, to extract information or
 confessions prior to trial. In many cases the police routinely beat and then released
 detainees rather than make an effort to prepare a formal court case. Government
 forces continued to rob and rape civilians (see Section 1.g.).
 A Catholic priest who runs an orphanage in Twambo credibly reported that re-
 gional Ministry of Justice officials made threats against his life, reportedly because
 of is alleged sympathies with UNITA.
 Prison conditions constituted a threat to the health and life of prisoners. The Gov-
 ernment and the National Assembly Committee oA Human Rights have acknowl-
 edged that conditions are inhuman. Cells are overcrowded and ack basic sanitary
 facilities. Many prisons, lacking financial support from the Government, were un-
 able to supply prisoners with adequate food and health care. There were credible
 reports that many prisoners died of malnutrition and tuberculosis. Prison officials
 routinely beat detainees. Prisoners depended on families, friends, and international
 relief organizations for basic support.
 The Government permitted prison visits by UNAVEM human rights monitors.
 UNITA forces continued to rob and rape civilians (see Section 1.g.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the law a person caught in the
 act of committing a crime may be arrested and detained immediately. Otherwise,
 the law requires that an arrest warrant be signed by a judge or a provincial mag-
 istrate. Arrest warrants may also be signed by members of the judicial police and
 confirmed within 5 days by a magistrate. The Constitution provides for the right
 to a prompt judicial determination of the legality of the detention. Under the law
 the prosecution and defense have 90 days before trial to prepare a case, although
 this deadline may be extended by attorneys' general under extenuating cir-
 cumstances. The Constitution also provides prisoners with the right to receive visits
 by family members. However, a scarcity of resources and the lack of qualified and
 motivated personnel in the judicial system limited the exercise of these rights.
 In 1993 the Council of Ministers decided to transfer control of the judicial process
 and prison system from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry. However, this
 transfer had not yet been made by year's end. Interior Ministry personnel continued
 to systematically, arbitrarily, and secretly arrest and detain persons for all cat-
 egories of crime for indefinite periods of time, often without any apparent intent of
 bringing the detainees to trial.
 The number of people detained by the Government and UNITA for political and
 security reasons is u= own.
 The Lusaka Protocol provides for the release, under ICRC auspices, of persons de-
 tained for war-related reasons. As of September 10, the ICRC reported that 535
 prisoners reported by the Government (369) and by UNITA (166) had been released.
 However, the ICRC has reclassified 78 prisoners originally reported to the ICRC by
 UNITA as "disappeared" because UNITA claimed that t ey were no longer in its
 possession. It was credibly alleged that most or all of these individuals died in
 UNITA custody.
 The Government did not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the court system lacked the means, experience, and training
 to be truly independent from the influence of the President and the ruling MPIA.
 The judicial system was largely destroyed during the civil war and during 1996 did
 not function in large areas of the country.
 The court system comprises the Supreme Court at the appellate level, and munici-
 pal and provincial courts of original jurisdiction under the authority of the Supreme
 Court. The President has strong appointive powers, including appointment of Su-
 preme Court judges, with no requirement for confirmation by the National Assem-
 bly. As of September, 12 of the 16 seats on the Supreme Court remained vacant.
 The Court serves as an appellate tribunal for questions of law and fact, but it does
 not have authority to interpret the Constitution. The Constitution reserves this role
 for a Constitutional Court, an entity that had not yet been constituted at year's end.
 The Constitution provides for the creation of an office of the "Provider of Justice,"
 designated by the National Assembly for a 4-year term, to defend citizens rights and
 liberties. This office also had not yet been constituted at year's end.
 
 
 Trials for political and security crimes are handled exclusively by the Supreme
 Court. There were no known political or security trials.
 The Constitution provides defendants the presumption of innocence, the right to
 a defense and legal assistance, and the right of appeal. Amendments to the Code
 for Penal Process in 1991 provided for public trials, established a system of bail, and
 recognized the accused's right to counsel and to testify. However, the Government
 often did not respect these rights in practice. Municipal courts normally deal rapidly
 with routine civil and misdemeanor cases on a daily basis. Judges are normally re-
 spected laymen, not licensed lawyers. The  de and two laymen selected by the full
 court act as jury. Routine cases are normally dispatched by a court within 3 months.
 The verdict is pronounced the day following the conclusion of the trial in the pres-
 ence of the defendant.
 There are credible reports that the Government holds political prisoners; however,
 the number is unknown.
 UNITA has established a military and a civilian court system in territories under
 its control and claims that its civil code is equivalent to the Portuguese Civil Code
 currently used by the Government. UNITA President Jonas Savimbi appoints judges
 personally, and UNITA trials are not open to the public. Juries consist of male el-
 ders chosen from the community. The accused reportedly has the right to a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government maintained a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveil-
 lance, monitoring, and wire tapping of certain groups, including journalists, opposi-
 tion part leaders, members and suspected sympathizers of UNITA, National As-
 sembly deputies, and foreign diplomats. The law requires judicial warrants for
 searches of private homes. However, executive orders have been used to override
 normal legal prvisions, as in the case of an executive order authorizing joint armed
 forces and police sweeps to seize weapons held by civilians in major urban areas
 in July and August. In August the Government began a 4-month operation, "Cancer
 II," that expelled over 4,000 Malian, Lebanese, Gabonese, and other foreign resi-
 dents of Angola whose immigration status was deemed irregular. These prisoners
 were often held for more than 72 hours without appearance before a judge, and
 their deportations were carried out entirely within the executive branch without any
 judicial oversight or opportunity to challenge the legality of the decisions of police,
 customs, and immigration officers.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Vlwmations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Consolidation of the Lusaka Protocol peace process resulted in a significant
 decline in the widespread abuses of humanitarian standards committed by both gov-
 ernment and UNITA forces during the previous 20 years. However, government and
 UNITA forces continued to subject hundreds of civilians to robbery, rape, or murder.
 "Bandits" (a term also applied to rogue elements of the armed forces) were also re-
 sponsible for many attacks against civilian populations, with numerous confirmed
 incidents concentrated in the Quilenges, Huila province; and Chongoroi, Benguela
 province; areas. On May 22, armed bandits robbing a civilian truck in Quilenges
 fired on a passing UNAVEM vehicle. While no peacekeepers were hit, five civilians
 were killed and at least six injured.
 Millions of mines, which were planted during the 20-year civil war to gain mili-
 tary advantage and to restrict the free circulation of peope and oods, continued
 tokill and maim thousands of people. Many major roads were demined and re-
 opened as a consequence of Government and UNITA commitments to allow the free
 circulation of people and goods throughout Angola. However, in many areas local
 authorities and military commanders of both parties continued to restrict free and
 safe passage of local populations, humanitarian organizations providing relief assist-
 ance, and United Nations observers. There were isolated incidents in the north-
 eastern Lunda provinces and in Moxico where credible evidence indicates that
 demained roads were newly remined.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press, and specifically provides that the press cannot be subject to
 political, ideological, or artistic censorship. However, the Government does not re-
 spect these rights in practice. Citizens, including deputies in the National Assembly,
 expect reprisals for public criticism of the Government or the MPLA, and the Gov-
 ernment attempts to impede such criticism by monitoring and restricting access to
 political meetings. Journalists are intimidated into practicing self-censorship. The
 Government runs and tightly controls the only daily newspaper, the only television
 station, and the major radio station. It tightly restricts opposition leaders' access to
 these media. While two commercial radio stations and three private weekly and bi-
 weekly newspapers all practice self-censorship, several occasional newsletters are
 
 
 published that are openly critical of government officials and policy. The Govern-
 ment also allows UNAVEM to broadcast free of charge a series of "Roads of Peace"
 television and radio programs each week, although it has denied UNAVEM the
 right to establish its own radio station.
 Media policy and censorship are controlled by a committee composed of the Min-
 ister of Social Communication, the press spokesman for the presidency, and the di-
 rectors of the state-owned radio, television, and newspaper. The state-controlled na-
 tional radio headquarters in Luanda cleared programs broadcast on national radio
 stations in provincial capitals.
 Journalists admitted that they practice self-censorship and that repeated "errors
 in judgment" could result in dismissal and death threats, The January 1995 murder
 of Ricardo de Mello, editor of the independent newsletter Imparcial Fax, remains
 unsolved. It was a major blow to the development of a free press in Angola.
 The Government was less restrictive with foreign news agencies such as the Voice
 of America, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Cable News Network. For-
 eign journalists require authorization from the Minister of Interior in order to ob-
 tain access to government officials or travel within Angola. Both the Government
 and UNITA invited journalists to planned press events and to visit areas under
 their control.
 UNITA runs a tightly controlled radio station whose broadcasts of often inflam-
 matory material are heard throughout Angola. Lusaka Protocol provisions to convert
 this station into a nonpartisan private commercial station have not yet been com-
 pleted. UNITA's newspaper, Terra Angolana, could not be found in government-con-
 trolled areas.
 Academic life has been severely circumscribed by the civil war, but there is aca-
 demic freedom, and academics do not practice self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of association, assembly, and protest, but the Government does not re-
 spect these rights in practice. The Government strictly controls both assembly and
 association, the Rapid Intervention Police were mobilized twice in the capital during
 May to deter planned demonstrations. Legislation allows the Government to deny
 registration to private associations on security grounds, and the Government arbi-
 trarily limits organized activities deemed inimical to its interests. The law also re-
 quires a minimum of 3-days' prior notice to authorities before public or private as-
 semblies and makes participants liable for "offenses against the honor and consider-
 ation due to persons and to the organs of sovereignty" (see Section 2.c.).
 In May Konrad Leibsher, a Catholic priest working with Luanda's poor, was ar-
 rested and tried for "crimes against the security of the state" for displaying placards
 decrying deteriorating economic conditions in Luanda. The government prosecutor
 argued that crowds drawn by the priest's placards violated the law on meeting and
 demonstrations, which requires prior government approval of gatherings which have
 the potential to endanger public order. The defense argument that freedom of
 speech guarantees are enshrined in the Constitution prevailed.
 UNITA did not allow free assembly and association in areas under its control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the separation of church and state, and the Government respects this right in
 practice. The authorities apparently did not enforce a 1995 government order pro-
 hibiting the practice of religion outside of approved locations.
 During the May trial of Catholic priest Konrad Leibsher (see Section 2.b.), the
 government-controlled newspaper published a front page editorial accusing the
 priest of subversive activities, ordering the Church to stay out of social affairs, and
 insisting that sovereignty and order must be safeguarded. The Angolan Catholic
 Church issued a response supporting the priest, calling it the duty of every religious
 minister to confront issues of social Justice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom omovement and residence with-
 in Angola and freedom of exit from and entry into the country, but the Government
 does not respect these rights in practice. As part of the peace process, both the Gov-
 ernment andUNITA committed themselves to allow the free circulation of people
 and goods, but local authorities and military commanders continued to restrict
 movement in many areas. Nevertheless, many major roads were demined and
 opened to traffic, and part of Angola's 850,000 internally displaced persons and of
 the 325,000 refugees in neighboring countries began to return to their homes.
 In a 4-month period beginning in August, the coordinated government operation
 Cancer II expelled more than 4,000 foreign residents whose immigration status was
 deemed irregular (see Section 1.f.).
 Angola is a party to both the United Nations and Organization of African Unity
 conventions on refugees, and the Government cooperates with the U.N. High Coin-
 
 
 missioner for Refugees. The Government provides first asylum to refugees. An eligi-
 bility committee to evaluate asylum claims was established on paper in 1990, but
 was first staffed in 1995, and now meets regularly to evaluate asylum requests.
 There are approximately 9,600 Zairian refugees in Angola, at least 1,000 of whom
 have been officially granted refugee status. There were no reports of the forced ex-
 pulsion of persons with valid claims to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides all adult citizens with the right to vote by secret ballot
 in direct, multiparty elections to choose the President of the Republic and deputies
 of the National Assembly. However, citizens have no effective means to change their
 government.
 The President is elected by absolute majority. If no candidate obtains a majority
 of votes cast, there is a runoff between the two candidates with the highest number
 of votes. The National Assembly consists of 220 deputies, 130 elected on a national
 basis and 90 elected to represent the provinces. Ruling power is concentrated in the
 President who appoints the Prime Minister and other members of the Council of
 Ministers through which the President exercises executive power. The Council can
 enact decree-laws, decrees, and resolutions, thereby controlling most functions nor-
 mally associated with the legislative branch.
 The people exercised their new constitutional right to elect their government in
 September 1992 presidential and legislative elections. President dos Santos won
 49.5 percent of the votes and should have faced UNITA leader Savimbi in a runoff
 elction. UYNITA and other parties accused the overnent of massive electoral
 fraud, but U.N. observers declared the elections generally free and fair and called
 on UNITA to accept the results. The civil war resumed after UNITA rejected the
 election results, and the runoff in the presidential elections was postponed indefi-
 nitely. Subsequently, a small group within the MPLA has succeeded in maintaining
 a monopoly on governmental power. The U.N. is authorized by the Lusaka Protocol
 to declare when requisite condions have been met to hold the second round of pres-
 idential elections. As part of the peace process, the Constitution was amended in
 1996 to extend the mandate of the current Government and National Assembly past
 the November 1996 expiration of their terms to permit a smooth transition to a gov-
 ernment of national reconciliation.
 The National Assembly exercises little meaningful power independent of the rul-
 ing executive structure. Only 5 of 70 UNITA deputies elected to the National As-
 sembly in the 1992 election occupied their seats, although the remainder are ex-
 pected to do so when a government of national reconciliation and unity is formed.
 Several small parties are also represented in the National Assembly; however, few
 opposition deputies participated in National Assembly debate. One vocal opposition
 deputy was striped of his parliamentary immunity by a vote of the MPLA majority
 to face charges of party registration fraud. Some MPLA deputies admitted that Na-
 tional Assembly debate was frequently superfluous, and the Assembly simply
 rubberstamped the presidency's initiatives.
 There are no legal barriers to the participation of women in the political process.
 Only 3 of 19 cabinet ministries are headed by women, and 1 of the 12 Supreme
 Court judges is a woman. Women have been promoted to the rank of subcommis-
 sioner (major general equivalent) in the National Police.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government impedes independent investigations of human rights abuses. Be-
 cause of government suppression, the one functioning Angolan human rights mon-
 itoring group, the Angolan Human Rights Association, was moribund. The Human
 Rights Committee of the National Assembly remains weak and ineffective.
 The UNAVEM Human Rights Monitoring Group (HRMG) held a number of na-
 tional and regional human rights seminars with senior government and UNITA par-
 ticipation. UNAVEM's HRMG and military and civilian police observers were the
 only effective human rights monitors, but they did not make the conclusions of their
 investigations public. Additionally, the Government frequently interfered in
 UNAVEM's attempts to investigate complaints of human rights violations.
 Amnesty International representatives were invited to participate in a June
 human rights seminar for police and prison officials. The Government granted the
 ICRC limited access to prisons in 1996. However, the Government denied the ICRC
 access to people allegedly being held as war-related prisoners (see Section 1.d.).
 UNITA impedes independent investigations of human rights abuses in territory
 that it controls. It frequently interfered in UNAVEM's attempts to investigate com-
 
 
 plaints of human rights violations and denied the ICRC access to persons believed
 to be held prisoner (see Section 1.d).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the Constitution all citizens are equal before the law and enjoy the same
 rights and responsibilities regardless of color, race, ethnicity, sex, place of birth, reli-
 gion, ideology, degree of education, or economic or social condition. The Government
 does not have the ability to effectively enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women was widespread. Credible evidence indicated
 that a significant proportion of homicides were perpetrated against women, usually
 by their spouses. Due to dire economic circumstances, increasing numbers of women
 engaged in prostitution, and the clergy reported that marriages are breaking down
 at an alarming rate.
 Despite constitutional protections, women suffered from discrimination. The law
 provides for equal pay for equal work, but in practice women are not compensated
 equally. Some women held senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical
 field) and civil service, but women were mostly relegated to low-level positions in
 state-run industries and in the small private sector. Adult women may open a bank
 account, accept employment, and own property without interference from their
 spouses. Women also have the right to inherit property. Upon the death of a male
 head of household, the widow automatically is entitled to 50 percent of any estate
 with the remainder divided equally among legitimate male and female children.
 In much of the country women swelled the ranks of the disabled because they
 often set off land mines while foraging in the fields for food and firewood.
 Children.-The Government gave only marginal attention to children's rights and
 welfare. Approximately 20 percent of children attend primary education classes. The
 Health Ministry worked with international donors to coordinate a successful child
 vaccination campaign against polio in September. Also in cooperation with inter-
 national aid organizations, the Ministry of Social Integration has begun working to
 demobilize over 8,000 child soldiers in both government and UNITA armed forces.
 An increase in the number of street children in Luanda and other cities resulted
 from the breakdown of family structure caused by the resumption of the civil war
 in 1992 and the continuing deterioration of the economy. Child prostitution contin-
 ued to be a pervasive sign of social decay in urban areas. Young girls often took
 jobs as domestic servants in private homes while young boys roamed the market
 places and streets. Living conditions in government youth hostels were so poor that
 the majority of homeless children preferred to sleep on city streets.
 The government-sponsored National Institute for Children lacks the capacity to
 adequately assist efforts by international nongovernmental organizations to assist
 dispossessed youth. There are no active private children's rights advocacy groups.
 Medical authorities report that female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely
 condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health, occurs rarely in remote areas of Moxico province, bordering Zaire
 and Zambia. Government health workers sporadically have campaigned against the
 practice.
 People With Disabilities.-The number of physically disabled in Angola includes
 an estimated 70,000 people who required amputations due to mine explosions. While
 there is no institutional discrimination against people with disabilities, the Govern-
 ment is doing little to supplement current demobilization efforts to improve their
 physical, financial, or social distress. There is no legislation mandating accessibility
 for the disabled to public or private facilities, and, given the degradation of the na-
 tion's infrastructure, it is difficult for the disabled to find employment or participate
 in the educational system. There were a number of protests by disabled veterans
 seeking to improve their benefits and force government attention to their plight.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Angola's population includes 1 to 2 percent
 of Khoisan and other linguistically distinct hunter-gatherer tribes scattered
 throughout the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. There
 is no evidence that they suffer from official discrimination or harassment, but they
 do not participate actively in the political or economic life of the country and have
 a marginal ability to influence government decisions concerning their interests.
 The long civil conflict has deep ethnic and urban versus rural roots. Many of the
 small number of white and mixed race Angolans who occupy technical and govern-
 mental positions have strongly backed the MPLA. The Government accuses UNITA
 of exacerbating ethnic tensions by dwelling on the perceived colonial ties of these
 people.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join trade unions, engage in union activity, and strike, but the Government does not
 respect these rights in practice. The Government dominated the National Union of
 Angolan Workers (UNTA), the labor organ of the ruling MPLA. A rival labor federa-
 tion, the General Centrale of Independent and Free Labor Unions of Angola
 (CGSILA) was established in May. The law requires that labor unions be recognized
 by the Government. Restrictions on civil liberties effectively prevent any labor activ-
 ity not approved by the Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and legislation passed in 1991
 provides the legal framework for, and strictly regulates the exercise of, that right.
 T he law prohibits lockouts and worker occupation of places of employment and pro-
 vides protection for nonstriking workers. It prohibits strikes by military and police
 personnel, prison workers, and firemen. The law does not effectively prohibit em-
 ployer retribution against strikers.
 There were strikes against the Government by teachers, doctors, and nurses,
 among others. The Health and Education Ministries negotiated settlements but re-
 peatedly failed to honor them because of lack of resources. On Labor Day, May 1,
 the Government deployed paramilitary police in all public spaces in Luanda to deter
 rumored labor demonstrations.
 Unions have the right to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize, and the law provides for collective bargaining, but the Govern-
 ment does not respect these rights in practice. The Government dominates the econ-
 omy through state-run enterprises. The Ministry of Public Administration, Employ-
 ment, and Social Security sets wages and benefits on an annual basis. The Govern-
 ment failed to honor a February agreement between the teachers' union and the
 Education Ministry to provide teachers an indexed wage. In the small private sector,
 wages are based on multiples of the minimum salary set by the Government. Legis-
 lation prohibits discrimination against union members. Union members' complaints
 are adjudicated in the regular civil courts. Employers found guilty of antiunion dis-
 crimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Current law authorizing forced
 labor for breaches of worker discipline and participation in strikes has been cited
 by the International Labor Organization as a violation of its Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14 years. The Inspector General of the Ministry of Public Administra-
 tion, Employment, and Social Security is responsible for enforcing labor laws. This
 Ministry maintains employment centers where prospective employees register, and
 these centers screen out applicants under the age of 14. However, many younger
 children work oh family farms, as domestic servants, and in the informal economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage set by the Ministry of
 Public Administration, Employment and Social Security was set at roughly $20 per
 month (4 million kwanzas). However, the Government does not enforce this stand-
 ard. Neither the minimum wage nor the average monthly salary, which is $10 ($50
 to $100 in Luanda), is sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 As a result, many wage earners depend on the thriving informal sector, subsistence
 farming, theft, corruption, or support from relatives abroad in order to survive.
 A 1994 government decree established a 37-hour workweek. However, inadequate
 resourcesprevented the Ministry of Public Administration, Employment, and Social
 Security rom enforcing this standard or from enforcing occupational health and
 safety standards. Workers cannot remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to their continued employment.
