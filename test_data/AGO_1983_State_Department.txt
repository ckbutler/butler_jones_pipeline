 ANGOLA
 The People's Republic of Angola is ruled by a small group of
 officials within a single political party, the Marxist Popular
 Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The MPLA has
 established a one-party state with concomitant restrictions on
 freedom of expression and suppression of political opposition.
 All major policy decisions are made by the Party Central Commit-
 tee and Political Bureau. During 1983 the human rights situa-
 tion in Angola was affected by intensified hostilities between
 the forces of the MPLA and those of the, opposition National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The ex-
 pansion of fighting between the MPLA and UNITA to most areas of
 Angola during the course of the year accelerated the deteriora-
 tion in the quality of life through increased civilian casualties
 and disruption of the society. There are indications that the
 deterioration of the security situation and tighter security
 measures by the Government contributed to a greater number of
 abuses of human rights than occurred during 1982.
 When the Portuguese granted independence to Angola on November
 11, 1975, the three major opposition groups which had fought
 Portuguese rule were engaged in a bloody civil war, marked by
 the intervention of both Cuban and South African forces. With
 Cuban and Soviet assistance, the Marxist MPLA succeeded by early
 1976 in ousting the two rival movements from Luanda, the capital,
 and took power. Both rival groups, the National Front for the
 Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and UNITA, have continued to wage
 guerrilla warfare against the MPLA. The PNLA carries out
 occasional guerrilla operations in northern Angola, but does not
 pose a major threat to the Luanda government. UNITA, however,
 apparently has the allegiance of a substantial portion of the
 population, has steadily expanded the scope and level of its
 military operations, and poses a serious challenge to the MPLA.
 UNITA controls approximately one-third of Angola's territory,
 incuding most of Cuando Cubango and Moxico provinces, and has
 expanded guerrilla operations from the southeast into northern
 and western Angola, with the exception of the northwest
 corner of Angola and the Cabinda enclave. While only a rela-
 tively small portion of Angola's population lives in the areas
 controlled by UNITA, UNITA apparently exercises control over a
 substantial proportion of the population in the areas where it
 operates in central and eastern Angola. UNITA has stepped-up
 activity in northwestern Angola and contests areas there.
 UNITA has publicly stated that it favors a government of
 national unity, and has not sought to establish an alterna-
 tive government. The MPLA has not agreed to a political
 compromise or a role in the government for UNITA. In
 addition to UNITA and the FNLA, the separatist Front for the
 Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) continued during
 1983 to conduct sporadic guerrilla operations in the Cabinda.
 *The United States does not maintain diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of Angola, and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel on the spot to monitor human rights conditions or to
 evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 The intensified and expanded civil war in Angola has resulted
 in extensive civilian casualties.
 An estimated 25,000 Cuban combat troops support the MPLA forces
 in their operations against UNITA. The Cubans also man strategic
 locations in central and southern Angola. The MPLA and UNITA,
 which have different ethnic bases of support, compete for the
 allegiance of civilian populations through both persuasion and
 intimidation, and have accused one another of atrocities against
 civilians. Civilians are also caught in the middle of hostili-
 ties between the Southwest Africa People's Organization (SWAPO -
 a Namibian resistance movement with bases in Angola) and South
 Africa, which controls the territory of Namibia on Angola's
 southern border. SWAPO, which the MPLA allows to operate in
 Angola, carries out cross-border guerrilla operations from
 Angola into Namibia, and South African forces regularly conduct
 military operations against SWAPO targets in southern Angola.
 During 1983 South African forces occupied a salient in Cunene
 province in southern Angola. The MPLA and others have from time
 to time alleged that South African forces have committed atroci-
 ties against innocent civilians in Angola, including the use of
 napalm and chemical bombs. These allegations have not been
 corroborated by independent sources.
 The intensified civil war has resulted in large numbers of
 displaced persons in central and southern Angola and has severely
 disrupted the economy and government administration. The low
 prices of oil and diamonds, the two principal sources of Angola's
 revenue, and disruption in food production and transporta-
 tion infrastructure caused by the hostilities, have exacerbated
 this serious economic situation. The intensified civil war has
 forced the Government to devote an even larger portion of its
 financial resources to the military. Both the MPLA and UNITA
 have made efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the
 displaced persons. The MPLA has allowed the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UNICEF to operate in areas
 it controls, and UNITA allows the ICRC to operate in areas it
 controls or is contesting. However, efforts to ameliorate
 human suffering have been severely circumscribed by the expan-
 sion and intensification of hostilities, and the quality of life
 continues to deteriorate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The intensified civil war in Angola has resulted in numerous
 allegations that MPLA, UNITA, and South African forces have
 killed civilians and that the MPLA and UNITA have executed
 political prisoners. While there is little specific sub-
 stantiation of the various claims and counter-claims, circum-
 stantial evidence indicates that all the parties have probably,
 on some occasions, arbitrarily executed prisoners.
 
 
 23
 The intensification of the fighting between UNITA and Cuban-
 supported KPLA forces during 1983 resulted in hundreds of
 civilian deaths. Some of these deaths were inadvertently
 caused by military operations, but others have been deli-
 berately perpetrated by the opposing forces in order to intimi-
 date civilian populations. Roads are mined in many places, and
 civilians have died as a result of guerrilla actions, such as
 attacks on trains. There are no reliable casualty figures.
 UNITA and the MPLA have both publicly repeatedly accused one
 another of practicing terrorism against their respective suppor-
 ters, including killing or maiming civilians. In September,
 UNITA accused the MPLA of executing 36 UNITA supporters. UNITA
 has also charged that Cuban and Angolan forces have used napalm
 and other weapons against civilians in pro-UNITA areas in central
 Angola. No conclusive evidence exists to substantiate these
 claims and counter-claims.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to indicate that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by the MPLA
 security agencies, or by UNITA, although both sides have accused
 one another of such practices.
 The MPLA has not, however, fully cooperated in U.S. efforts to
 locate Donald McGimpsey, an American pilot who disappeared in
 September 1980 while ferrying a civilian aircraft along the coast
 of Angola.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been persistent allegations of torture and mistreat-
 ment in Angolan prisons, but information is insufficient to
 determine the extent to which torture is practiced by the police,
 security services, and armed forces.
 The prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and sanita-
 tion, but these conditions seem to reflect the poor state of the
 economy more than deliberate maltreatment. Some reports have
 alleged that foreigners are not well treated, but Americans
 who have been imprisoned in Angola have been well-treated and
 have had access to available medical care.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the treat-
 ment of prisoners, with rules governing the treatment of prisoners
 either lax or non-existent. There are widely varying standards
 of treatment, with treatment of political prisoners at the
 prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security reportedly
 harsher than treatment in the regular prisons. Mistreatment
 reportedly includes solitary confinement, confiscation of
 personal effects, physical intimidation, including beatings and
 threats, and prolonged interrogation with the use of force.
 Prison visits apppear to be arbitrarily restricted in many
 instances. Foreign advisers, including Cubans and East Germans,
 are involved in assisting the MPLA security services and may be
 involved in helping to run state security prisons. State
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 3
 
 
 24
 security detention centers are scattered throughout the coun-
 try, and very little information is available on conditions
 at these facilities. Captured UNITA supporters have been put on
 public display by the PRA.
 UNITA holds a number of foreign and NPLA prisoners, captured
 in the course of military operations, in makeshift facilities
 in Its areas of contol in southeastern Angola. Prisoners
 have been required to make long marches from the areas where
 they have been captured in central and northern Angola to
 UNITA-controlled areas in the southeast, but there are no
 reports that UNITA has mistreated foreign or MPtA prisoners.
 Press reports based on reporters' conversations with UNITA
 prisoners and other evidence indicate that UNITA treats prisoners
 humanely. During the past year UNITA cooperated with the ICRC in
 releasing numerous foreign prisoners it held.  This included the
 release of 12 nuns, missionaries, and ICRC workers in February,
 10 Portuguese and 45 Czechoslovak prisoners in June, three
 Brazilians in June, and 23 Portuguese in September. None of
 those released alleged that they had been mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges
 of human rights violations in Angola have been arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment without due process. Numerous reports allege
 that individuals are arrested and imprisoned on suspicion or
 denunication by others and, in some cases, held for years without
 being notified of the charges against them.
 In late 1982 four persons were arrested for alleged activities
 prejudicial to the party and State. While three of those
 arrested were released in February of 1983, the prominent
 writer Fernando Costa de Andrade "Ndunduma' remains imprisoned.
 The Angolan press has stated that Ndunduma was arrested for
 improper use of his right to criticize the party and Government
 and for insulting the head of state. Amnesty International has
 adopted Ndunduma as a prisoner of conscience.
 Under the terms of Angolan law, persons suspected of committing
 serious acts against the security of the state may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial period
 of three months, renewable for a further period of three months.
 Such detainees are not presented to a judge within 48 hours of
 their arrest as stipulated in the code of criminal procedure, and
 apparently have no right to challenge the grounds of their
 detention by invoking provisions of the code concerning habeas
 corpus. After six months' detention without charge, the detainee
 is supposed to be informed of the accusations against him, with
 the state security service either informing the public prosecutor
 of the case against the suspect or releasing him. Once the
 case is presented to the public prosecutor, there does not
 appear to be a specific time limit within which the suspect
 must be brought to trial. Many political prisoners have reportedly
 been held for years without being tried, but the exact number of
 political prisoners is not known.
 
 
 25
 The deterioration of the security situation as a result of the
 stepped-up fighting between the MPLA and UNITA has contributed
 to abrogation of judicial safeguards and due process. At the end
 of July, the MPLA established regional military councils through-
 out much of Angola. The councils, responsible directly to
 President Dos Santos, have the authority to restrict the movement
 of people and goods as well as to requisition people and goods
 without compensation, and to try crimes against the security of
 the state. The Angolan press reported that, in August, the Direc-
 torate of Criminal Investigation drew up important measures aimed
 at fighting crime by "outlaws and antisocial elements," but the
 nature and practical effect of these measures is not known. This
 was followed in November by creation of "people's vigilance
 brigades" for urban areas. The powers of the vigilance brigades
 are not clear, but they are tasked with general administration
 and organization responsibilities, and the implementation of
 tasks aimed at "protecting the people and ensuring public order
 and stability."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution states that no citizen shall be arrested and
 brought to trial except under the terms of the law, and guaran-
 tees the right of the accused to defense, but there is insuffi-
 cient evidence to determine to what extent these rights exist in
 practice. The right of appeal exists in some cases, but it is
 not known whether this provides a practical safeguard for the
 accused. Judicial lines of authority are unclear, especially in
 light of the fact that the recently appointed regional military
 councils have been given responsibility for the trial of offenses
 against the security of the state. It is not known which trials
 are public and under what rules of procedure the various military
 and civilian courts operate. The Constitution provides for a
 People's Supreme Court, but its area of jurisdiction is not
 known. Prolonged and arbitrary detention noted above indicates
 that fair public trials are denied in many cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home and privacy of correspondence, arbitrary searches of homes
 have been alleged, and there is some interference with private
 correspondence, either through censorship or interruption of
 delivery of mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 People's Republic of Angola." Censorship exists, however,
 
 
 and the Government runs the media. Opposition views are not
 aired. As noted above, the Angolan writer Ndunduma was arrested
 in late 1982 and is still being detained for "improper use of the
 right of criticism" because he wrote and had performed a play
 critical of the President.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. Angola has since independence in 1975 restricted
 the travel of foreign correspondents to Angola, and has occasion-
 ally expelled foreign reporters. The Agence France Press reporter
 based in Luanda was expelled from Angola in mid-1983. Angola,
 together with the other Front Line States (this term includes.the
 states of Kozambique, Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and
 Angola which border on or are in close proximity to South Africa),
 endorsed the Radoma Declaration in July of 1983, banning the
 travel of South Africa-based correspondents to the Front Line
 States. The circulation of Western journals and periodicals in
 Angola is tightly restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or movement
 other than the MPLA. All other political movements have been
 banned. The Angolan media frequently announces the arrest of
 UNITA sympathizers. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of opposition movements or
 alternative political systems. The recently-established people'-s
 vigilance brigades and martial-law climate throughout the country
 tend to further restrict freedom of assembly and association.
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the National Union of
 Angolan Workers,which is controlled by the party.   Traditional
 labor union activities and rights are tightly controlled by the
 Government. Strikes are prohibited by law as a crime against the
 security of the state.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief, and provides for separation
 of church and state, the KPLA publicly emphasizes the importance
 of propagating "atheism," and has been critical of religious
 activities. The overwhelming majority of the Angolan population
 is Christian, however, and the MPLA has not moved to close down
 churches. Church services are regularly held and there is
 widespread attendance. Foreign and Angolan missionaries are
 allowed to carry out activities.
 UNITA has publicly stated its support for freedom of religion
 and allows religious liberty in the areas it controls and
 in which it operates. The ability of religious personnel to
 carry out activities has, however, clearly been circumscribed
 by the intensification of the civil war.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the intensification of the civil war, the Govern-
 ment is acutely security conscious and has tightly restricted
 travel. There is a pass system within Angola, and foreigners are
 generally prohibited from travelling outside the principal
 cities. The new regional military councils are empowered to
 restrict the movement of people and goods. Early in 1983,the
 Government announced a ban on travel by foreigners beyond 40
 kilometers from Luanda. UNITA has publicly warned that it
 considers all of Angola with the exception of Zaire, Uige,
 Luanda, and Cabinda provinces to be war zones and that it cannot
 guarantee the safety of persons travelling in war zones.
 UNITA has taken a number of foreign nationals prisoner in
 the course of military operations this year. Foreign nationals
 have been inadvertently killed when caught in the midst of
 military engagements between UNITA and the MPLA.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel is
 carefully controlled by restrictions on passport issuance and
 exit visas, and by currency restrictions. Emigration is restricted.
 The Government limits travel to Angola through a selective and
 stringent visa policy.
 Angola is a signatory to the U.N. "Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees," and has allowed refugees to enter
 Angola. There are approximately 70,000 Namibian refugees (some
 members of SWAPO), 20,000 Zairian refugees (some members of the
 anti-government Front for the National Liberation of the Congo),
 and 6,000 South African refugees (some members of the anti-South
 African Government African National Congress) in Angola. Since
 mid-1980 between 120,000 and 150,000 former Zairian refugees in
 Angola returned home under the auspices of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees.
 The Government has offered amnesty to members of the opposition
 FNLA, and eight former FNLA leaders surrendered to MPLA'authori-
 ties in April. It is not known how these former FNLA leaders
 have been treated. The right of voluntary repatriation for those
 who continue to support opposition movements does not exist in
 practice, and there have been reports of the arrest and harassment
 of former. FNLA sympathizers who have returned to Angola. Anyone
 formerly associated with an opposition movement who returned
 to Angola would have to fear persecution. Both as a result of
 this fear of persecution and as a result of flight from hostili-
 ties, approximately 200,000 Angolans have taken refuge in Zaire
 since 1975, and an estimated 73,000 have taken refuge in Zambia.
 There were indications early in 1983 that the Government was
 pressing for the forcible repatriation of Angolan refugees in
 Zambia who are UNITA sympathizers, but this did not take place.
 Of the 400,000 Angolans who have left the country since indepen-
 dence, the Government claims that 180,000 have returned, but this
 claim cannot be verified.
 
 
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens To
 Change Their Government
 The People's Republic of Angola is ruled by a small group of
 officials within the party apparatus of the ruling MPLA-Workers'
 Party, which the Constitution describes as the vanguard of the
 working class and a Marxist-Leninist party. The Constitution
 provides for popular participation in the political process,
 but the MPLA is the only legal party, and activities by all
 opposition groups have been banned. Citizens, therefore, do
 not have the right to change their government.
 In effect, political activity the political process is limited
 to participation in the MPLA party or to one of its controlled
 and sanctioned organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan
 Women's Organization, or the trade union movement.
 The MPLA Government has established political institutions
 consistent with its ideology, with political power centered
 in the Party's 11-member politburo and 65-member central commit-
 tee. Party membership is very restricted, with under 30,000
 members out of a population of seven million, according to the
 MPLA media. The Constitution provides that the popularly-elected
 national People's Assembly, established in 1981, is the supreme
 organ of state power. There are also People's Assemblies at the
 provincial and local level. Only candidates chosen and endorsed
 by the party are elected to the People's Assemblies, and key
 members of the party also hold leadership positions in the
 People's Assemblies. The People's Assemblies endorse measures
 proposed by the party at the national and local levels.
 Angolan citizenship is denied to those individuals with claims
 to another nationality, who have committed homicide, opposed
 the "liberation struggle,* or joined clandestine organizations
 opposed to the *decolonization process." Citizens 18 years of
 age or older are entitled to vote and hold office.
 Women participate in the MPLA, not only in the Angolan Women's
 Organization, but also in the higher levels of the party.
 Social, cultural and traditional factors tend to limit the
 participation of women at the highest level of the party. Only
 three members of the MPLA central committee are women.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of support --
 the MPLA among the Kimbundu, and UNITA among the Ovimbundu.
 While both movements have with mixed success worked to broaden
 their support beyond their tribal group, both groups show political
 favoritism towards their own ethnic group. There are no formal
 ethnic or racial restrictions on participation in the political
 process, and whites and mesticos occupy a number of high-level
 positions within the MPLA.
 
 
 29
 Section 4: Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International stated in its 1983 report that it is
 concerned about the imprisonment of people for criticizing
 government policies or officials, long-term detention without
 trial, unfair political trials, and mistreatment of prisoners.
 Amnesty International has adopted the imprisoned writer Ndunduma
 as a prisoner of conscience, and stated in its 1983 report that
 it is aware of other long-term detainees accused of supporting
 opposition movements. Amnesty International also stated that it
 appealed for commutation of death sentences imposed by the
 People's Revolutionary Tribunal and military courts. In Kay,
 Amnesty International issued a report concerning its continuing
 concerns regarding extra-judicial executions and disappearances
 during 1977-1978. In September, the MPLA media criticized
 Amnesty International for its statements on Angola, especially
 regarding alleged disappearances, claiming that these were
 intended to demean the Angolan revolution. Freedom House rates
 Angola "not free.*
 The ICRC has helped arrange the release of foreign nationals
 held by UNITA and has occasionally been allowed to visit pri-
 soners held by UINITA. The MPLA has not allowed the ICRC to visit
 political prisoners. In January, 1983 UNITA and the ICRC reached
 an agreement under which UNITA would permit the ICRC to carry out
 its humanitarian relief activities in central Angola.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Although Angola is potentially one of the richest countries
 in Africa, its economy has been severely damaged as a result
 of the continuing civil war, the decline in the prices of
 oil and diamonds, its two principal sources of revenue, and
 by the exodus of skilled manpower. Of the approximately 500,000
 Portuguese residents prior to independence, only 30,000 remain.
 The intensification of the fighting between the MPLA and UNITA
 has devastated the country's infrastructure and has forced the
 Government to divert most of its assets to the military.
 Payments to the Eastern Bloc for military equipment and for
 the Cuban combat troops have heavily burdened the economy.
 Although thousands of civilian Cuban and East European advisors
 are working in technical and professional positions, Angola still
 faces a critical shortage of skilled manpower. UNITA's declared
 policy of targeting economic installations and its warning that
 foreigners working in Angola do so at their own risk have exacer-
 bated the general economic problems. The expansion and intensifi-
 cation of the fighting in Angola has made virtually impossible
 further economic development, except the exploitation of off-
 shore oil resources which UNITA has not attacked to date.
 
 
 The fighting between the MPLA and UNITA coupled with the
 severe economic problems have had a disastrous effect on the
 population. Agricultural production has been largely
 disrupted, forcing Angola to import most of its food require-
 ments, and the distribution system for foodstuffs has also
 been disrupted. Travel by road in most areas of Angola is
 dangerous. The deterioration of the security situation in
 central Angola due to intensified MPLA-UNITA hostilities
 has periodically forced the ICRC to suspend its extensive
 food relief and medical programs. Relief activities under
 the auspices of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
 have been negatively affected. The 200,000-500,000 persons
 in central, eastern, and southern Angola who have been
 displaced from their homes as a result of the combination of
 civil strife and drought are suffering from severe malnutrition
 and, in numerous cases, starvation. Many rural inhabitants
 have abandoned the countryside to seek food and safety in
 urban areas. As a result of this rural exodus, crops are
 not being planted. Major urban centers such as Luanda have
 been overwhelmed by the influx from rural areas. There are
 severe food shortages in urban areas, and public services
 are severely taxed. As a result, the health of the Angolan
 population as a whole has deteriorated.
 The Government is not indifferent to the plight of these dis-
 placed persons, but lacks the capability to respond. During 1983
 the MPLA continued efforts to obtain food assistance from Western
 countries and various international organizations. A number of
 Western countries provide economic and technical assistance. The
 United States has continued to provide humanitarian food assis-
 tance under the Food for Peace program through shipments of
 foodstuffs under the auspices of UNICEF. The United States also
 contributes to the ICRC program for Africa, over one-half of
 which is used in Angola for the ICRC's food distribution program
 in central Angola. Thousands of civilians have fled into UNITA-
 controlled areas in eastern and south-eastern Angola. This has
 placed a considerable strain on UNITA resources, but UNITA has
 endeavored to meet the needs of these displaced people, in part
 by seeking assistance from the ICRC and humanitarian organizations.
 UNITA maintains an educational and health care system in the
 areas which it controls.
 Although the Constitution states that it is the duty of the
 state to provide conditions for social development, work,
 health care, and education, the intensified hostilities and
 exodus of trained personnel have severely hampered the Govern-
 ment's ability to meet Angolans' basic economic and human needs.
 For example, although physicans from several countries are
 serving in Angola under assistance programs, the number is
 insufficient to supply minimum health care to more than a
 small fraction of the total population. Available data high-
 lights the poor quality of life. The population growth rate is
 2.6 percent, with high infant morality of 147.4 per 1,000 live
 births, and life expectancy at birth is only 42 years. Gross
 
 
 31
 national product per capita is approximately $787. The Government
 has concentrated efforts on improving the educational system.
 There is 82 percent enrollment in primary school. The Government
 has had some success in expanding its basic literacy program, but
 the current literacy rate is estimated at only 30 percent.
 A thriving and extensive black market is known to exist.
 Despite government controls on prices, the severe scarcity of
 nearly all goods has caused the inflation rate to skyrocket.
 The MPLA has established as its goal the transformation of
 Angola into a "socialist" economy, and the major sectors of
 the economy--oil, diamonds, and banking--have been nationalized.
 The right to private property is, however, guaranteed by the
 Constitution, and a small portion of the economy, mainly in the
 agricultural sector, still operates under private ovinership.
