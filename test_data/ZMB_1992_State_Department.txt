 ZAMBIA
 President Frederick Chiluba's victory over Kenneth Kaunda in the multiparty
 election of October 1991 ended the long era of one-party politics in Zambia. The new
 President and the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) dominated the polit-
 ical scene in 1992, including in Parliament, where the MMD holds 125 out of 150
 seats. In addition to the MMD and the former sole party, the United National Inde-
 pendence Party (UNIP), a number of small parties operated freely throughout the
 year and participated in the local elections. Although voter turnout was very low,
 these elections were free and fair and resulted in the MMD winning 80 percent of
 1,190 local government councillor seats. The Constitution of Zambia's Third Repub-
 lic, negotiated in the twilight of the Kaunda regime, provides for a strong presidency
 and for extensive human and civil rights, including the right to the full protection
 of the law and freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and political choice.
 The Zambian police divided into regular and paramilitary units and operating
 under the Ministry o? Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order. The volunteer vigilante force, which was under police supervision
 and was widely viewed as an arm of UNIP, the former ruling party, was disbanded.
 The police often ignore procedural requirements and engage in abusive and brutal
 behavior, including beating and at times killing criminal suspects and detainees.
 However, victims occasionally seek redress through the courts, and abusers found
 guilty are punished. Zambia's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for
 which the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analy-
 sis, were $65 million. The Government has undertaken public discussions on reduc-
 ing military spending, but it has not yet implemented any plan to do so.
 The Zambian economy has declined steadily for over a decade. President Chiluba
 has committed his Government to free-market policies, but agricultural reforms im-
 plemented during 1992 failed to produce all of the expected benefits because of the
 massive Southern African drought. The price of maize, a basic food commodity, has
 risen 900 percent in nominal terms since the Government removed controls to stim-
 ulate production. Inflation remained high in 1992, on the order of the previous
 year's 118 percent, due principally to rising commodity prices and large salary in-
 creases for the military and civil service. The copper industry, which is critical to
 the economy, remained under the control of a state-owned mining conglomerate
 (ZCCM) but improved its production markedly during the year.
 Following the historic gains of 1991, most fundamental human rights were re-
 spected in law and in practice in 1992. Public discussion of issues involving police
 excesses, corruption, and political change typified the public discourse. While the
 press still practiced self-censorship, the media was active in the political dialog and
 provided broad coverage of the local elections in November. The Government pub-
 licly acknowledged that the judicial and prison systems needed urgent policy and
 resource attention, but there was little indication of reform action by the end of the
 year. In 1992 police brutality remained the most serious human rights problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGiITS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra udicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings during the year. Seven UNIP members accused of killing four MMD officials
 during the 1991 election campaign were on trial in the Ndola High Court at year's
 end.
 Extrajudicial killings by regular and paramilitary police remained a serious prob-
 lem during 1992. According to reports in the Zambian press 23 persons were killed
 by police under various circumstances between April 1 and September 30. During
 the same period 3 persons died while in police custody. According to police, in most
 cases suspects are shot during the commission of a crime or while allegedly fleeing
 a crime scene. Such incidents appear to be investigated rarely, but in some in-
 stances police are arrested and tried, as in the cases of a paramilitary officer who
 shot a 19-year-old street vendor to death during a demonstration in July and a po-
 lice officer who shot and killed a 14-year-old student in September. Also, in Septem-
 ber police opened fire on a crowd of students gathered in front of the Lusaka Mag-
 
 
 istrate Court, killing one person. Eight policemen were detained for questioning in
 connection with this killing, but all were subsequently released (see Section 2.b.).
 Reacting to a wave of violent crime throughout the country, Home Affairs Min-
 ister Newstead Zimba instructed police on Auguat 19 to shoot criminals on sight.
 This statement was immediately condemned by the Law Association of Zambia
 (LAZ) and disavowed by Attorney General Ali Hamir, who stressed that police must
 only resort to the use of firearms in extraordinary cases to protect their own'lives.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of government-inspired disappear-
 ance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1991 Constitution prohibits torture. Nevertheless, members of the police and
 security forces regularly use excessive force when apprehending, interrogating, and
 holding criminal suspects or illegal aliens. The press highlighted a number or such
 occurrences, including the case of a former Zambia National Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion (ZNBC) announcer, who is.suing police for false imprisonment and alleges that
 officers beat him repeatedly during 3-days in detention. The press also reported that
 a Lusaka trader suspected of illegal currency dealing was whipped with an electric
 cable while in police custody and that a man charged with robbery reported in the
 Ndola High Court that he had been forced to confess in exchange for medical treat-
 ment for injuries he had received in police custody. An April 27 letter to the Zambia
 Daily Mail alleged that police had arbitrarily "rounded up" 20 to 30 people, beating
 those who resisted and extorting fines for "loitering." Independent sources reported
 similar examples of police brutality, including the rape of a 12-year-old girl while
 in police custody. Threats of force were also common practice in police investiga-
 tions. Judges sometimes allow forced or pressured statements or confessions in legal
 proceedings, but a clear legal precedent has yet to be established.
 The problem of police brutality came under increasing public scrutiny during
 1992. Victims of police brutality may and do sue the Government for redress, and
 judgments in favor of plaintiffs do occur.-In June Attorney General Hamir acknowl-
 edged publicly that the beating of suspects by police was widespread. He said that
 the Government had dispatched lawyers to the Lilayi Police Training School to lec-
 ture policemen on human rights and procedural requirements. As the year ended,
 however, cruel treatment by police continued to be a problem, and most violations
 continued to go unpublicized and the violators unpunished.
 Conditions in Zambian prisons are harsh and life threatening. Tuberculosis, ane-
 mia, and chest infections are rampant due to low protein diets, lack of clean water,
 substandard food, severe overcrowding, and poor sanitation and medical facilities.
 According to a press report, 17 prisoners died at Kamfinsa Prison, near Kitwe in
 a 2-month period. The victims had succumbed to a variety of diseases, including
 cholera, dysentery, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and malaria. In May Home Affairs
 Deputy Minister Chanda Sosala admitted that conditions in Zambia's prisons were
 appalling, and a Sunday Times article, citing prison sources, said that jails designed
 to hold 3,000 inmates now hold over 18,000. In September a Prisons Headquarters
 public relations official said that to relieve overcrowding inmates serving short sen-
 tences would be transferred to "open air" prisons in the countryside. However, con-
 ditions at these lightly guarded prisons, where inmates are sometimes employed in
 farming, are reported to be poor. Vice President Levy Mwanawasa on two occasions
 underscored the Government's commitment to improve prison conditions, but by
 year's end no new funds had been allocated.
 In previous years, the African National Congress (ANC) maintained detention
 camps in various countries, including Zambia, with the permission of host govern-
 ments. At these camps, ANC security personnel tortured, mistreated, and in some
 cases extrajudicially executed ANC-defector detainees and alleged South African
 government spies. Reports issued in 1992 by the ANC commission of inquiry and
 Amnesty International document extensive physical abuse by the ANC's security de-
 partment while the organization's headquarters were in Zambia, near Lusaka. The
 ANC maintains that all detention camps outside South Africa have been closed.
 Thus far there has not been-a free and independent inspection of ANC camps. Fur-
 ther, there is no evidence that those responsible for these abuses have been held
 accountable.
 The Zambian authorities detained a South African national, Katiza Cebekhulu, in
 1991 at Lusaka Central Prison. Reportedly, he had been accused of murder and kid-
 naping in the trial of Winnie Mandela and others in South Africa. He claimed that
 he had been taken from South Africa by members of the ANC to prevent him from
 testifying in the trial. Ccbekhulu remains in protective custody in Zambia, which
 has been unsuccessful in finding another country willing to grant him refuge.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Following the July 1990 release of politi-
 cal prisoners and detainees, no political detentions or imprisonments have occurred.
 
 
 303
 President Chiluba has vowed that no one will be detained for political reasons dur-
 inghis term of office.
 arious security laws provide broad powers of detention, and in practice adminis-
 trative detentions are widespread. Foreigners, principally from neighboring coun-
 tries, are regularl apprehended as illegal aliens and detained until they can be de-
 ported. At times these detentions last months or years.
 In regular criminal cases, a detainee must be charged and brought before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours, but there are delays at each step of theprocess, and dea-
 lines are frequently missed due to police inefficiency or lack of transportation to
 bring a suspect before a magistrate. The transport shortage is particularly acute in
 Copperbelt Province, according to the LAZ. Magistrates there regularly criticize the
 police for failing to bring suspects to court on schedule, but no legal action was
 taken against the police in 1992. Further, according to LAZ, police hold suspects on
 extremely flimsy evidence for extended periods on grounds that an investigation of
 the crime is continuing.
 Street children charged with "loitering' or disorderly conduct often find them-
 selves detained with unruly adults and, unable to raise bail or pay fines, are fre-
 quently held for a week or more.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judicial system consists of the Supreme
 Court, with appellate powers, and a series of lower courts, of which the High Court
 is the most important. In ordinary criminal cases, the law provides a number of pr-
 tections for defendants, including protection during interrogations. Members of the
 legal community maintain that if a lawyer can be obtained, defendants can expect
 to receive a fair trial. However, many defendants are either too poor to retain a law-
 yer or unaware of the few nongovernmental citizen advocacy groups that might help
 them. The Government's Legal Aid Department is severely understaffed, and
 Zambians entitled to legal aid often appeared in court during the year only to find
 themselves without representation. This resulted in numerous court adjournments,
 prolonging the time suspects remain in custody until their cases are heard.
 Delayed processing of appeals has also continued to plague the judicial process.
 In one case in 1992, two men who won an appeal against an aggravated robbery
 conviction were released from custody but only after having spent 12 years in prison
 before their appeal was heard. In another case, a prisoner under a death sentence
 has been waiting since 1984 for the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.
 Thus far, the MMD Government has respected judicial independence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Respect
 for privacy and the inviolability of the home is provided for in the Constitution and
 is generally respected in practice. Exceptions continue to be police round-ups of sus-
 ected ill al aliens and black marketeers. On two occasions during the year, former
 President Kaunda was the target of what government critics labeled as harassment,
 but which the Government defended as legitimate law enforcement exercises. In
 March police searched a warehouse where Kaunda's books were stored, purportedly
 seeking government property unlawfully removed from State House during
 Kaunda's tenure as president. The search produced only five books of questionable
 ownership, and UNIP parliamentarians argued that the search warrant used by the
 police was not valid. In June police conducted an early morning search of the
 Lusaka homes of Kaunda's two sons, purportedly looking for weapons. None was
 found. The chairman of LAZ, Isaac Chali, publicly criticized the 4 a.m. search as
 smacking of intimidation.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-For the first time in 27 years there exists a de-
 bate, much of it in the public arena, on the role of the media in Zambian society.
 But despite liberalization of former restrictive practices, regulations that limit press
 freedom still exist. For example, all working journalists must be accredited through
 tha Zambia Information Services rather than the publication they represent. The
 Government has also retained legislation restricting freedom of speech and press,
 including the President's power to ban any publication, which President Chiluba
 used in November to overrule his Legal Affairs Minister and declare that no porno-
 graphic publication would be printed in Zambia.
 The two gvernment-owned dailies regularly run editorials and articles critical of
 the Government, and the government-owned broadcast media produce news stories
 and current affairs programs with reasonably balanced viewpoints, reflecting the
 Government's commitment to a hands-off editorial policy. Des pit these positive de-
 velopments, editora and reporters continued to practice self-censorship, and the
 media took its cue on which issues to cover from government pronouncements.
 Moreover, media criticism was selectively directed at certain ministers, notably
 
 
 304
 those who were formerly in the UNIP government. As in the past, the newspapers
 avoided criticizing the President on any policy he personally endrsed.
 This cautious a pproach by the official media was due in part to residual attitudes
 from the past, when the press was more tightly controlled by the Government, to
 continuing legal restrictions, and to the Government's coolness towards the inde-
 pendent press. Of the several independent newspapers launched in 1991, only two,
 both weeklies, remained at year's end. (The disappearance of the others was due to
 economic factors.) Although the Government has publicly committed itself to remov-
 ing legal barriers to the establishment of independent newspapers and broadcasting
 stations, government officials refused to talk with the independent press and regu-
 larly excluded the two independent weeklies from invitations to press events. A po-
 litical columnist for one of the independent weeklies was detained by the police for
 questioning after he wrote a satirical column about President Chiluba. The reporter
 was criticized in public by several ministers and warned in the government-owned
 newspapers that Ucriticizing the President is still a crime."
 In an example of self-censorship, the media did not cover the sit-down strike by
 28 journalists at the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). The jour-
 nalists were suspended after protesting a managerial appointment at the station.
 They were not reinstated until they apologized and accepted the appointment in
 writing. Although the story was seen as newsworthy by a number of journalists
 from all media, it was never reported because of the fear of reprisals.
 In 1992 the Government's hand was also seen in personnel decisions at the ZNBC.
 Of the three newsreaders who supported UNIP before the 1991 elections, two have
 been shifted to covering minor cultural programming since January.
 Academic freedom is respected in Zambian society, and educators are outspoken
 in their opposition to political influence on the educational system. The University
 of Zambia Lusaka campus, closed by President Kaunda in 1991, reopened early in
 1992. While there was no reported government interference in university affairs, the
 academic year wan severely disrupted by a variety of protests (see below), job ac-
 tions, and boycotts by bth students and teachers, principally over salaries and sti-
 pend.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association are provided fur in the Constitution and were generally respected
 by the Government during 1992. Under the Public Order Act of 1955, persons or
 organizations wishing to hold an assembly, public meeting, or procession must first
 apply fr a permit. Government use of the Public Order Act to regulate demonstra-
 tions and protests generated considerable controversy during the year. In February,
 32 University of Zambia students were arrested for allegedly; partici pating in an un-
 lawful prcession. The students eventually pleaded guilty to the car, but were
 later released by a Lusaka magistrate. In March students attending Evelyn Hone
 College were refused a permit to conduct a march to the Vice President's office to
 hihh=ght campus grievances. The students elected to proceed with the march, and
 eight were arrested and charged with "riotous behavior.' In September the Univer-
 sity of Zambia Student Union (UNZASU) applied for and was granted a permit to
 conduct a rally in downtown Lusaka. Police subsequently withdrew the permit, how-
 ever, announcing that the official who had granted it did not have the requisite au-
 thority. UNZASU elected to proceed with the rally, and some 140 students were ar-
 rested by po   l lice.
 The leading opposition party, UNIP, alleged throughout the year that it was a vic-
 tim of harassment by government and MMD officials. The party wan unable to hold
 its national congress at its traditional site in Kabwe because the Government de-
 manded rental payments, and t pr  d     to hold the congress at an isolated farm
 outside of Lusaka. In addition  overnment officials have threatened punitive ac-
 tions against UNIP supporters. While addressing an MMD raly in May, for exam-
 ple, Minister of Local Government and Housing Michael Sata threatened to evict all
 UNIP members from their market stalls and revoke their trading licenses. At about
 the same time, the Deputy Minister of Copperbelt province issued an order-never
 implemented-banning UNIP from obtaining permits to hold public meetings in the
 province.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and is generally respected in practice. Although President Chiluba in December
 1991 aroused controversy when he declared at a State House ceremony that Zambia
 was a Christian nation, the Government took no action on the issue. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses are prohibited by law from proselytizing, but they functioned openly dur-
 ing 1992, and their freedom to refrain from participating in various secular activi-
 ties such as voting, singing the national anthem, and saluting the flag was re-
 spected.
 
 
 305
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution guarantees citizens the right to move freely through-
 out Zambia, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart from andreturn to
 the country without restriction. After its October 1991 election victory the MMD
 Government abolished police road blocks. They were reintroduced in 1992. however,
 as a measure to combat increasing criminal activity. As in the past, some police
 manning the road blocks abused their authority by extorting money from motorists
 or stealing goods.
 On November 26, 1991, the Supreme Court ruled that a passport is not a privilege
 but a right to which every Zambian citizen is entitled. In January 1992, a Lusaka
 High Court judge ordered the Director of Public Prosecutions to return the passport
 of the former governor of the Bank of Zambia, which had been confiscated the pre-
 vious year when the governor was charged with corruption. In March the Deputy
 Minister of Foreign Affairs threatened to press for the seizure of former President
 Kaunda's passport in retaliation for Kaunda's personal involvement in international
 affairs. The passport was not confiscated, however.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 140,000 refugees in Zambia in 1992, the majority Ango-
 lans, Mozambicans, Zairians, and South Africans. The repatriation of Angolans fi-
 nally started in the summer of 1992, but only 1,291 refugees were flown home be-
 cause of questions about the safety at transit centers inside Angola. Later in the
 year, rencwed fighting and uncertainty in the wake of the disputed Angolan presi-
 dential election resulted in a halt to repatriation. The number of South African refu-
 gees has declined considerably since repatriation began in 1991, and UNHCR esti-
 mates there are only about 800 still living in Zambia.
 In 1992 there were increased efforts to round up and deport illegal aliens. Police
 sweeps netted hundreds of persons, principally West Africans and Zairians, who
 were arrested and deported, usually without screening by UNHCR. In January the
 UNHCR Resident Commissioner protested the detention of refugees who were under
 UNHCR care and protection. Various refugees have been detained, including five
 who were held early in the year for 3 weeks despite being in possession of UNHCR
 permits.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 With the introduction of a multi party system in 1990, the adoption of a new Con-
 stitution in 1991, and the defeat of the long-ruling UNIP pa7 by the MMD in free
 and fair elections in October 1991, Zambians in 1992 enjoyed the right and ability
 peacefully to change their government. Under the Constitution the President wields
 broad authority, but Paiament ratifies major appointments and must approve the
 establishment of government ministries or departments. Despite its constitutional
 powers, Parliament during 1992 passed few laws and remained generally subser-
 vient to the Executive. There was an important exception in June when Parliament
 passed a bill authorizing the privatization of state-owned companies and setting up
 an agency to run the program.
 The ruling MM   controls the executive branch and 125 of 150 seats in Par-
 liament. President Chiluba aiThrmed his administration is committed to a durable
 multiparty democracy. Numerous opposition political parties, although extremely
 small and weak in comparison with the ruling MMD, operated freely throughout the
 year in p reparation for often delayed elections to select local government councils.
 Held on November 30, the elections involved universal adult sufrg and secret-bal-
 lot voting procedures. In generally free and fair elections, the MMDJ. swept most
 areas of the country while winning 80 percent of the 1,190 councillor seats. Voter
 turnout, however, averaged only 5 to 10 percent of those registered. Of the opposi-
 tion parties, UNIP and the United Democratic Party (UDP) won seats. In adtion,
 22 candidates running as independents were elected.
 Government and opposition leaders, including President Chiluba, have encouraged
 women to become involved in the political p recess. In April, however, Chiluba sharp-
 ly criticized demands by the Women's Lobby Group for a greater role for women in
 the Government and for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights. At
 yeai's end there were four women in President Chiluba a Cabinet-one Minister and
 three Deputy Ministers. Of the 150 elected Members of Parliament, 7 are women,
 and about 50 of the 1,190 local government councillors are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Aleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights and civic organizations operate without hindrance.
 These include the LA; the Women's Lobby Group, which seeks to safeguard the
 
 
 306.
 
 legal and societal rights of women; and the Foundation for Democratic Process
 (FODEP), the successor to the Zambia Elections Monitoring Coordinating Commit-
 tee. In late 1992, FODEP organized a nationwide campaign to monitor the Novem-
 ber 30 local government elections. In July the:LAZ established a special committee,
 chaired by Supreme Court justice Ernest Sakala, with a mandate to examine judi-
 cial procedures in order to recommend ways to reduce delays in rendering judg-
 ments. The Government is receptive to inquiries or visits by international human
 rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion;,Language, or Social Status
 The Zambian population of about 8 million comprises more than 70 Bantu-speak-
 ing tribal groupings. Economic and social needs are met on a generally nondiscrim-
 inatory basis. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex,
 place of origin, marital status, political opinion, color, or creed. Members of the
 Asian community, which includes many shopowners, have complained of harass-
 ment by government officials and of hostility from other Zambians.Under civil and
 constitutional law, women are entitled to full equality with men in most areas. In
 practice, Zambian women remain subordinate to men in many ways. Government
 statistics show that women are severely disadvantaged compared to men in formal
 employment and education. According to a leading women's right advocate, women
 who are single or pregnant experience particular difficulty in obtaining employment.
 Married women who are employed often suffer from discriminatory conditions of
 service; allowances for housing and children and tax rebates to which they as em-
 ployees are entitled often accrue to their husbands. Similarly, women have little
 independent access to credit facilities- in most cases they remain dependent on hus-
 bands, who are required to sign for loans. As a result, few women own their own
 homes.
 In March a member of the Women's Lobby Group filed suit in Lusaka High Court
 against a major hotel that refused to allow her entry to the hotel bar because she
 was unaccompanied by a man. The Women's Lobby Group asserted that the hotel
 policy violated constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of movement and pro-
 tection from discrimination. A decision had not been rendered by year's end.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage despite various constitutional and legislated
 provisions. Under traditional customs, all rights to inherit property rested with the
 deceased man's family. The Intestate Succession Act, passed in 1989, guarantees
 widows a 20-percent share and children a 50-percent share in the inheritance of a
 deceased man's property. Despite this legal provision, ignorance, apathy, and fear
 render the enforcement of the law generally ineffective. Most divorced women re-
 main unaware that under the maintenance law, ex-husbands can be compelled by
 magistrate's courts to provide for their families.
 There are no reliable statistics on the extent of violence against women, including
 wife beating. Domestic assault is a criminal offense, but in practice police are often
 reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating or other forms of abuse. In addition,
 women are ofen ignorant of their rights, and there is substantial societal pressure
 on women not to prosecute cases of domestic violence. In June Attorney General
 Hamir publicly condemned husbands who assault their wives and urged women to
 seek assistance from the LAZ, which has a section handling cases of domestic vio-
 lence. In February the police officer-in-charge at the University Teaching Hospital
 in Lusaka reported that cases of rape in the capital had increased dramatically. Ac-
 cording to the officer, many of the victims are under the age of 15. The law provides
 that, in crimes against women where rape, serious injury, or death occurs, men-
 including husbands-may receive sentences up to, and including, the death penalty.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Zambia has a history of strong labor union organiza-
 tions, dating from the establishment of the copper mines in the 1930's. Approxi-
 mately 60 percent of Zambia's 300,000 formal sector workers are unionized. The
 country's 19 large national unions are organized by industry or profession. Until the
 passage in January 1991 of the amended Industrial Relations Act (IRA), only one
 union per industry was legal and all unions were members of the Zambia Congress
 of Trade Unions (ZCTU). The ZCTU is democratic and regularly conducts open elec-
 tions to select its leadership. It is independent of any political party and the Govern-
 ment, and the ZCTU and other union leaders frequently criticize MMD government
 policies on such issues -as wages, economic policy, and conditions of service. After
 the elections, the ZCTU was accepted as a member of the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 307
 The 1991 IRA allowed for the formation of competing unions in already unionized
 industries or professions and required existing unions to disaffiliate from the um-
 brella ZCTU. In March a tripartite meeting of the Government, ZCTU, and the
 Zambian Federation of Employers (ZFE) agreed that the IRA would be revised to
 endorse the "one industry, one union" principle that had been abolished under the
 1991 law. These revisions have not been completed, but in the meantime a number
 of groups wishing to organize new or breakaway unions applied for recognition
 under the provisions of the existing IRA. The new organizations requesting recogni-
 tion included organizations representing miners, bankers, secondary school teachers,
 technical college staff, and civil servants. The Government, while not denying the
 new unions' right to organize, has yet to reco ize them as legal entities. The ZCTU
 and the existing unions, for their part, see the new unions as threats to their own
 standing. By year's end, work on the revised IRA continued, and the controversy re-
 mained unresolved.
 Under both the old IRA, passed in 1971 and the 1991 law, all workers have the
 right to strike except those in the Zambia defense force, judicial service police force,
 prison service, and security intelligence service. Strikes were commonplace through-
 out the year as the workers' salaries and conditions of service were undercut by
 harsh economic conditions and sharp increases in the cost of living. Under existing
 legislation, strikes are permitted only after all other recourse has been exhausted.
 In practice, virtually all strikes are illegal, since they almost always commence be-
 fore the mandatory process of mediation has run its course. In June, however, work-
 ers at the Kafue Textiles of Zambia mill went out on a strike that was acknowl-
 edg.ed by the Minister of Labor as legal. In the case of far more common illegal
 strikes, the Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued medi-
 ation, and most strikes end with increased wage settlements without government
 action against the unions. However, in a number of cases in 1992 striking workers
 were dismissed.
 Labor unions are permitted to affiliate with international labor groups. The ZCTU
 is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively with employers is cdiied in law. The 1991 IRA was
 condemned by bth workers and employers, however, as being designed to cripple
 trade unions and employer organizations. The legislation gave the Government more
 power to control the creation and dissolution of unions collection of dues, and oper-
 ation of workers councils. The law also reduced the ZdTU's jurisdiction over the in-
 ternal affairs of a union and perpetuated the role of works councils in dealing with
 such issues as conditions of service, recruitment, salary assessments, transfers, bo-
 nuses, and safety issues. These provisions are likely to be reviewed as the Govern-
 ment, workers, and employers consider how best to revise the controversial law.
 In June Vice President Mwanawasa told Parliament that the Salaries and Condi-
 tions of Service Act, passed under the previous UNIP government, inhibited the
 right of employees to bargain collectively with employers.1B3y year's end, Parliament
 was still considering repeal of the Act, which arbitrarily tied salary and wage in-
 creases in the private sector to those of civil servants. Both the ZCTU and ZFE have
 condemned the Act because it allegedly undermined the spirit of collective bargain-
 ing. There are no export prcessing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Slavery and involuntary servitude
 are prohibited by the Constitution. Forced labor is prohibited, except as a con-
 sequence of a judicial sentence or court order, by members of the military, by con-
 scientious objectors in lieu of military service, during wartime or other national
 emergency, or in the conduct of communal or civic obligations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 16. This and other age restrictions apply to the industrial sector,
 where, because of adult unemployment, there are few employees under age 16. The
 Labor Commissioner effectively enforces the law in industry. There is, however, lit-
 tle enforcement for the vast majority of Zambians who work in the subsistence agri-
 cultural and domestic service sectors, where persons under age 14 are often em-
 ployed. In urban areas children commonly engage in street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 the Government established a mini-
 mum monthly wage rate for all employees, except professionals, plus housing and
 transportation allowances. However, each industry may also set its own minimum
 wage rates above the legal floor through collective bargaining. In industries where
 collective bargaining is not effective, the Minister of Labor and Social Security sets
 the minimum wage rate for employees in positions such as delivery assistants, gen-
 eral workers, and office orderlies. These "minimums" are insufficient to provide an
 adequate standard of living. Moat Zambian workers must supplement their incomes
 through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the extended family. The
 
 
 normal workweek is 40 hours, but it is not a legal maximum. The legal maximum
 for nonunionized workers is 48 hours. The minimum for full-time employment is 40
 hours. Maximum limits for unionized workers vary. For example, the legal maxi-
 mum for unionized guards is 72 hours per week. There are legal requirements for
 annual leave (2 days-per month of service).
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards in any industrial
 undertaking. Enforcement of industrial safety in the mines is the responsibility of
 the Department of Mines. Factory safety is handled by the Inspector of Factories
 under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chronically limit enforcement ef-
 fectiveness, and in April the Chief Inspector described safety conditions in many fac-
 tories as poor.
