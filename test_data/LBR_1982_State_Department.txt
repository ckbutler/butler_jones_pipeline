 LIBERIA
 On April 12, 1980, a small group of military enlisted men
 killed President William R. Tolbert, Jr. and took control of
 the Government as the People's Redemption Council. Supreme
 executive and legislative authority now is vested in the
 Council. The Council is dominated in turn by its chairman,
 Head of State Samuel K. Doe. All formal political activity
 is banned by decree.
 At the time of the coup, wealth, arable land, and political
 power were concentrated in the hands of a narrow though
 expanding elite. In sharp contrast to that elite, the
 majority of the population was living at the subsistence
 level. Even in the modern sector of the economy, wages
 could not support the spiralling demands of urban living.
 Real Gross National Product (GNP) had scarcely grown under
 the Tolbert regime, though for reasons largely outside the
 Government's control. There had been no significant new
 investment in Liberia since 1973; in fact there had been
 some disinvestment. Development was uncoordinated, with
 much of the upcountry area isolated from modern social
 services.
 During the past year, Liberia's human rights record improved
 with the release of all political prisoners, a general am-
 nesty for Liberians in exile, the establishment of a process
 and date for return to civilian rule, and greater control
 over arbitrary arrest and harassment. There remain problems
 of corruption, secret military trials, and lack of institu-
 tionalized protection for civil and political rights. The
 economic situation in the country has declined as a result
 of the world recession and a sharp downturn in the markets
 for Liberia's major exports, iron ore and rubber.
 Liberia now holds no political prisoners. A curfew imposed
 after the coup was lifted in May 1982. Doe has pledged to
 return personal and real property confiscated after the
 coup to its rightful owners, with the exception of property
 belonging to the families of several executed officials of
 the former regime. A marked liberalizing trend has seen
 increased press freedom--although self-censorship is prac-
 ticed. Arbitrary arrests have fallen off and harassment of
 businessmen and individuals prominent under the former
 government has been sharply curbed, with offenders, in-
 cluding some Council members, publicly punished. Doe
 followed up on his appointment of a constitutional com-
 mission in 1981 by pledging to return Liberia to civilian
 rule by the fifth anniversary of the coup, April 12, 1985.
 The commission made significant progress in its mandate to
 draft and promulgate a new Constitution and oversee elec-
 tions leading to civilian rule. Public hearings were held
 in all of Liberia's nine counties to gather opinions on what
 form the new Constitution should take. Subsequently, a
 
 
 171
 draft Constitution was prepared and was scheduled for
 release within the next few months. The schedule for transi-
 tion to civilian rule calls for convening of a constituent
 assembly in 1982 to review the draft prior to a national
 referendum.
 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 In the aftermath of the People's Redemption Council seizure
 of power, the new Government executed 13 former top govern-
 ment officials for alleged "crimes.against the people."
 During the same period, soldiers, apparently acting without
 the sanction of the Government, murdered several members of
 the dispossessed Americo-Liberian elite.
 The Liberian Government has executed a small number of
 alleged coup plotters. The secrecy of the tribunals makes
 it impossible to know to what extent due process was ob-
 served in these cases. Not all alleged coup plotters have
 been executed; a few have been acquitted or sentenced to
 prison. Some in the latter category have been pardoned,
 and in some cases reinstated to high government positions.
 There have been no murders by quasi-official or private
 groups acting with the implied sanction of the Government.
 In January 1982, six students who challenged a ban on
 political activity were convicted and sentenced to death
 by firing squads they were pardoned within days by the
 Head of State. The death penalty can be imposed for some
 criminal violations.
 b. Disappearance
 Hundreds of persons with connections to the former regime
 were arrested and detained for varying periods of time in
 prisons and military stockades after the Council's seizure
 of power in 1980. While no lists of those arrested or
 released were made public, interested persons were able to
 learn of the detentions and in many cases to visit those
 detained. By late 1981 all but approximately 20 political
 prisoners had been released. Following a December 23, 1981
 order by Head of State Doe, all remaining political prisoners
 were freed.
 In 1982, there were several instances of arrest and detention,
 without public acknowledgement, of persons suspected of plot-
 ting to overthrow the Government, incite public disorder, or
 violate the tenets of a Council decree banning all forms of
 political activity. In each case, those arrested were either
 released shortly thereafter without formal charge, or charged
 and subsequently tried. Arrests are made by official military,
 security, or police forces--there have been no known instances
 of arrest, abduction, or clandestine detention carried out by
 quasi-official or other elements.
 
 
 172
 c. Torture
 Torture apparently is not condoned by the Government in
 Liberia, although isolated instances of torture have been
 alleged. Some mistreatment of suspects and prisoners has
 occurred in the Liberian judicial and penal system, even
 though the use of mental or physical pain to obtain con-
 fession or information, or to punish or intimidate suspects
 or prisoners is specifically prohibited. Several cases of
 security officials disciplined for violating that prohi-
 bition were reported in 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 One case of mistreatment was reported in 1982. A government
 agency employee reportedly was arbitrarily apprehended by
 police, beaten with a belt, and released without being charged.
 Under the Peoples Redemption Council Government, there has been
 a serious effort to curb mistreatment of prisoners and suspects,
 and security personnel have been disciplined for mistreating
 prisoners. Prison conditions are inadequate by international
 standards, with the notable exception of the National Palace
 of Corrections in Zwedru.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In late December 1981, Head of State Doe ordered the immediate
 release without exception of the approximately 20 detainees
 remaining from the mass arrests which followed the coup.
 Liberia now holds no political prisoners. There have been
 instances, however, of Council members, all of whom are military
 officers, ordering the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of
 civilians for brief periods. Doe warned several times in
 1982 that harassment of civilians by the military, including
 Council members, would not be tolerated. Some Council members
 have been disciplined for acts of harassment. Harassment has,
 in fact, been curbed but not entirely eliminated. In November
 1982, the Minister of Defense ordered off-duty soldiers to
 turn in arms in an effort to further reduce harassment.
 Habeas corpus was suspended by the Council in 1980 when it
 took power and declared martial law. Arrests are made in
 some cases without warrants, and there are delays between
 arrest and trial, but bail is generally available.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The core of the civilian court system has remained in place
 under the current Government, with significant modifications.
 Liberia uses Anglo-American common law, and US and British
 court cases can be cited as precedents. Civilian trials are
 public. Decisions of the circuit court can be appealed
 to the Supreme Court. The military Government added a third
 court, the Peoples Special Theft Court, whose panel of three
 judges renders verdicts which cannot be appealed to the
 Supreme Court. While due process procedures are respected
 in civilian courts, allegations exist of political influence
 in some sensitive cases; for example, in those of government
 officials charged with corruption. More damaging than polit-
 ical interference to the impartiality of the judicial system
 is corruption. Reports abound of lawyers acceptinq fees from
 
 
 173
 both parties to a case, and of judqes requesting and accept-
 ing bribes even in open court. Head of State Doe severely
 criticized the judiciary in September over reports of
 corruption, and a judicial conference in October examined
 these allegations.
 The military court system features a permanently standing
 three-Judge Supreme Military Tribunal whose authority extends
 not only to the security forces but also to civilians charged
 with engaging in political activity. Military trials can be
 public or closed. In the case of the most recent trial of
 coup plotters, the trials were closed.
 The Head of State has the authority under the present Govern-
 ment as under the previous Government to appoint civilian
 and military justices and to review, modify, or reject court
 decisions. In practice, this latter prerogative is rarely
 exercised.
 q. Invasion of the Rome
 Under martial law currently in effect in Liberia, warrants
 are not required to enter a private residence. There have
 been no cases reported in 1982, however, of residences
 forcibly entered by military, security, police, or other
 government forces. No instances have been reported of
 technical surveillance or other abuses of rights.
 After the revolution, 34 individuals or families had their
 real and personal property (except for homestead rights)
 confiscated due to alleged involvement in corruption or
 for failure to return to Liberia. At least one of these
 families had its property reinstated after family members
 returned to Liberia in 1981, and in 1982 the Head of State
 committed the Government to an eventual return of most
 confiscated properties. Progress in implementing this
 has been slow, however. In September 1982 the Government
 confiscated three private buses to ease a transportation
 breakdown, postponing until later the question of compen-
 sation.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Preedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press were
 suspended after the coup d'etat, and decree 2-A outlaws all
 "actions of individuals, political parties, or interest
 groups that seek to control, influence, oppose, castiqate,
 or deride actions or policies taken or promulgated by the
 Government of the People's Redemption Council.* The decree
 mandates death by firing squad for offenders, but in the
 only two convictions under the decree, both in 1980, those
 convicted were pardoned by the Head of State. The press is
 more open, spirited, and critical than might be expected
 given the penalty specified, perhaps reflecting a Liberian
 tradition of press independence.
 
 
 174
 One daily and three weekly independent newspapers compete
 with the government-owned daily newspaper. While self-
 censorship is practiced, and criticism of specific Council
 policies or individuals in high government positionsis
 usually not direct, lively debate over national problems and
 priorities characterize letters to the editor and opinions
 columns. Accurate reporting of questionable actions by
 government members is allowed. Advice critical of previous
 or current actions or policies is freely offered to the
 Government. In 1982, no government actions were taken
 against the press. In August the "Daily Observer" won a
 libel suit filed against it by a Council member in connection
 with an article accurately reportng the Council member's
 temporary detention by order of the Head of State.
 The Government runs the television station and several radio
 stations while private missionary radio stations take their
 news from the government news agency, Voice of America, and
 British Broadcasting Corporation. The electronic media are
 not as free in debating national issues as the print organs,
 but the government news agency reports government actions
 accurately without much self-congratulation or distortion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The prohibition on political activities does not hinder
 unions, professional bodies, civic associations, religious
 groups, self-help development committees, and similar organ-
 izations from meeting and conducting activities without
 government interference or control. Political parties and
 other organizations of an overtly political nature, however,
 are proscribed. Unions are independent of Government, but
 the People's Redemption Council anti-strike decree remains
 in effect. A substantial proportion of the non-subsistence
 work force is unionized. Most unions belong to the Liberian
 Federation of Labor Unions, an affiliate of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. All three iron ore mines
 are unionized as are several large plantations, including
 the Firestone Plantations Company, Liberia's largest private
 employer. The present Government has allowed union orqaniz-
 ing on plantations for the first time in Liberian history.
 The Government is redrafting Liberia's labor law to conform
 more closely to International Labor Organization standards.
 Despite the anti-strike decree, several work stoppages took
 place in 1982. In all cases the workers were persuaded to
 return, and no punitive action was taken.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or officially favored religion in Liberia.
 The suspended Constitution mandated religious tolerance and
 separation of church and state. Numerous Christian denomi-
 nations flourish, but the majority of Liberians continue to
 practice traditional animist religions. About 15 percent
 of the population is Muslim. There is no official or
 unofficial policy of religious discrimination in Liberia.
 The new Constitution is expected to stress continued sepa-
 ration of church and state and freedom of worship.
 
 
 175
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic movement nor foreign travel is impeded,
 although exit'visas are required for travel abroad and
 may be bureaucratically time-consuming to obtain. There
 are no restrictions on residence in any part of Liberia,
 country or city. A number of military roadblocks that
 had hindered free movement since the advent of military
 rule were dismantled in 1982. Emigration is unrestricted,
 but immigration, especially from neighboring African
 countries, is somewhat resented in the society at large
 because of the perception that natives of other countries
 are taking employment away from Liberians. African expa-
 triates in Liberia can be subject to arbitrary dismissals
 from Government positions or demands for bribes or other
 favors in exchange for continued permission to remain in
 the country. Citizenship is restricted to Negroes or
 persons of Negro descent. Citizenship is sometimes revoked,
 on occasion with apparently Ill-founded legal basis, for
 naturalized Liberians from other African countries. Self-
 exiled Liberians, most associated in some way with the
 overthrown regime, have been encouraged as a matter of
 official policy to return home. A general amnesty was
 declared in December 1981 and in 1982 the Council Govern-
 ment committed itself to returning properties confiscated
 from former regime fioures to their rightful owners. While
 a significant number of Liberians who fled abroad after the
 coup have returned, 'nanv old regime figures remain abroad.
 Returnees have not suffered harassment or persecution;'
 two, in fact, have been appointed deputy ministers in the
 Government.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since martial law decrees expressly proscribe political
 activity, there is no formal popular participation in the
 political process. Work is underway, however, by the con-
 stitutional commission to prepare a transition to civilian
 rule. In 1981 commission members were granted immunity
 from prosecution for their activities and statements. In
 1981 and 1982 they conducted a series of hearings at which
 all citizens were invited to air their views on problems
 with the suspended constitution and suggestions for a new
 charter. These opinions, say commission members, have
 helped to quicken the drafting of the new Constitution,
 which is scheduled for publication in draft form within
 the next few months. This is expected to be followed by
 the convening of a constitutent assembly to review the
 document and a national referendum. In 1982 the Head of
 State supported the commission's work and reaffirmed on
 several occasions his intention to return the country to
 civilian rule by April 1985.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Riqhts
 A private human rights international organization directed
 one inquiry to Western embassies in 1982 concerning the
 location of a former Council Government official who had
 
 
 176
 left the country and refused to return. The official claimed
 he would have been subject to persecution or harassment had
 he remained in Liberia, but the validity of his allegations
 seemed in doubt. No other inquiries, visits, resolutions
 or other activities by international human rights organiza-
 tions are known to have occurred in 1982. The 1982 Freedom
 House Yearbook qraded Liberian political and civil rights at
 level six on a scale of one ("free") to seven ("not free")
 and listed its status of freedom as "not free". The Amnesty
 International (AI) 1982 report listed among its concerns in
 Liberia the ill-treatment of detainees in 1981. There is no
 official or unofficial policy opposing or hinderina the work-of
 international human riqhts investigating organizations. The
 Council Government is apparently confident of its record in
 improving human rights, and no harassment, persecution or
 intimidation of individuals or groups attempting to document
 human rights conditions has been alleged to date.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Founded in 1822 by blacks who were seeking the fundamental
 liberties then denied them in the United States, Liberia,
 the oldest republic in Africa, retains strong cultural and
 political ties to the United States.
 Liberia has a mixed economy with government participation in
 such public service corporations as the Liberian Electricity
 Corporation and the Liberian Produce Marketinq Corporation.
 The present Government is a strong advocate of private enter-
 prise, and most businesses are in private hands. Foreign
 investors own most iron ore, rubber and timber firms that
 account for nearly all of Liberia's export earnings.
 Liberian women provide the majority of the labor in food
 production, and allocate the, distribution of food, whether
 it is for household consumption or for market sale. It has
 been estimated that 80 percent of Liberia's retail trade is
 controlled by non-Liberians, principally Lebanese and Indian
 merchants. Per capita gross national product was estimated
 at about U.S.$400 in 1981. While this represents a nominal
 increase over the U.S.$260 estimated in 1970, it is nonethe-
 less a major decline in both real and nominal terms from
 U.S.$524.80 in 1980, when taking the estimated 15 percent
 inflation into account. Manufacturing is about eight percent
 of the gross domestic product, excluding ore and rubber proc-
 essing facilities. Income distribution is greatly skewed,
 with 50 percent of total household income claimed by the
 top five percent of families and the remaining 95 percent of
 households sharing the other 50 percent. About 70 percent
 of the population is employed in subsistence agriculture.
 Corruption continues to be a problem in Liberia, but an
 anti-corruption campaign continued and intensified in 1982,
 under which arrests and convictions were made against
 several officials who had misappropriated funds.
 Access to the benefits of economic development has been
 limited in Liberia by the relative isolation of the bulk
 of the population as 1.3 million of the total population of
 1.89 million (1980) live in rural areas. It is estimated
 that 20 percent of the population has access to safe water,
 (64 percent of the urban population and only six percent of
 rural dwellers). According to the most recent estimates
 
 
 177
 (1977), .average Liberian consumption of calories stands at
 104 percent of nutritional requirements, but again distri-
 bution is skewed. While the majority of the population
 continues to live at the subsistence level, only 23 percent
 of all urban residents are below the absolute poverty line.
 Liberia has a literacy rate of 25 percent. School age.
 population is approximately 855,000, while the total number
 of students is approximately 335,744 (39 percent). The low
 literacy rate is attributed to a lack of access to educa-
 tional facilities and the low quality of education nationally.
 According to the suspended Constitution, all Liberian women
 are guaranteed equal rights with men and afforded special
 protection through provisions that grant a dower's right in
 property the husband owned at the time of his death, and that
 provide for the security of property owned in their own right.
 The reality is not as clear-cut as in many cases these rights
 have been denied to women. While statutory marriage is seen
 as a contract between individuals, customary marriage is one
 between families. With payment of dowry under the customary
 marriage system, a woman is considered the property of the
 man and his family. Upon his death, the marital contract
 continues with the family, who have certain obligations and
 responsibilities to the widow, if she remains with the family
 as wife to another relative. Because of this family obligation,
 a woman is not usually entitled to inherit from her husband or
 to administer his estate. Many Liberian women now straddle
 both the traditional and statutory legal systems. In the
 modern sector, Liberian women have held important positions,
 such as ambassadors, ministers, supreme court justice, and
 Judges.
 The right to own real estate is restricted to Liberian
 citizens. There are no additional formal restrictions on
 the right to own or transfer real property.
