 BAHAMAS
 The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II, the nominal
 
 
 Head of State, is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister
 Hubert A. Ingraham s Free National Movement (FNM) has controlled the Govern.
 ment and Parliament since 1992.
 The plice and the small Bahamas Defence Force answer to civilian authority and
 generally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there continued to be
 credible reports that police occasionally abuse detainees.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for over two-thirds of
 the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also a major source of revenue. While some Bahamians enjoy
 relatively high average income levels, the official unemployment level is reported at
 over 13 percent; there is also considerable underemployment and some poverty.
 Bahamians enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. The
 principal human rights problems centered on occasional police abuse of detainees,
 harsh and overcrowded conditions at the only prison, delays in trials, violence and
 discrimination against women, violence against children, and the occasional practice
 of administering corporal punishment prior to the period allowed for appeal.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by the Government or domestic political groups. In September an
 off-duty policeman in Nassau was killed and his body dumped on a nearby island.
 Investigators later discovered that he had been shot while entering a car occupied
 by two fellow off-duty officers. The officers involved did not have authorization to
 possess firearms, were dismissed from the force, and currently face murder charges.
 A civil suit is still pending over the May 1994 death of a detainee in police cus-
 tody in which the coroner's court jury found that police were negligent for failing
 to provide necessary medical care. A police officer was acquitted of murder charges
 stemming from an October 1994 incident in which he, while off duty, allegedly shot
 at five men during an altercation, killing one. Two police officers convicted in 1994
 of manslaughter in the 1989 beating death of a suspect were acquitted in March
 on appeal.
 b. Disappearance.-here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-
 ishment, but corporal punishment, abolished in 1984, was reinstated in 1991. Local
 human rights monitors protested that in some instances the authorities adminis-
 tered punishments prior to the proper period allowed for appeal, and without legal
 representation for the defense. Corporal punishment retains broad public support.
 Human rights monitors and members of the general public expressed concern over
 continued instances of police abuse against criminal suspects. Many of the charges
 of abuse involved beatings in order to extract confessions.
 The police Complaints and Discipline Unit, which reports directly to senior police
 officials, is responsible for investigating allegations of police brutality. Police offi-
 cials disciplined or dismissed some police officers as a result of complaints, although
 some alleged victims also claimed that police officers threatened them after they
 had filed a complaint. An immigration officer convicted of assault in the beating of
 a Jamaican attorney at Nassau International Airport in 1994 lost his initial appeal,
 and appealed his case further.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, the only prison, improved modestly, but remained harsh
 and overcrowded. The men's prison, originally built in 1953 to house about 500 in-
 mates, holds over 1,100 prisoners. Male prisoners are crowded into poorly ventilated
 cells which generally lack running water and adequate sanitation facilities. There
 are no separate facilities for inmates being held on remand, although some are
 eventually segregated to a medium security wing after being processed through
 maximum security. In July an inmate being held on remand in maximum security
 on minor theft charges was found severely beaten in his cell. He died a short time
 later at the public hospital. The authorities charged another inmate in his death.
 A second inmate died of natural causes resulting from his infection with AIDS. Pris-
 on officials estimate that about 13 percent of the incoming prisoner population is
 infected with the HIV virus. Most prisoners lack beds, many sleep on concrete
 floors, and most are locked in their cells 23 hours per day. Facilities for women are
 less severe and have running water.
 Local and international human rights groups visited the prison during the year.
 Organizations providing aid, counseling services, and religious instruction have reg-
 ular access to inmates. Despite fiscal constraints, prison officials continued modest
 
 
 321
 
 but measurable steps to improve prison conditions and develop prisoner rehabilita-
 tion programs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The authorities conduct arrests openly and, when re red, ob-
 tain judicially issued warrants. Serious cases, including those of suspected narcotics
 or firearms offenses, do not require warrants where probable cause exists. Arrested
 persons appear before a magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next business day
 for cases arising on weekends and holidays) to hear the charges against them. They
 may hire an attorney of their choice. The Government does not provide legal rep-
 resentation except to destitute suspects charged with capital crimes. Police some-
 times deviate from prescribed procedures, however, and act arbitrarily. The Govern-
 ment respects the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrests.
 Judges tend not to grant bail to foreign suspects, particularly on more serious of-
 fenses, since the authorities consider foreign offenders likely to flee if released on
 bail. Judges sometimes authorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on minor charges,
 but in practice, foreign suspects generally prefer to plead guilty and pay a ine rath-
 er than pursue their right to defend themselves, given the several months' backlog
 of court cases and harsh conditions at Fox Hill Prison.
 The authorities detain illegal migrants, primarily Haitians and Cubans, at the
 Carmichael Road Detention C enter until arrangements can be made for them to
 leave the country. Ilegal migrants convicted of crimes other than immigration viola-
 tions are held at Fox Hill and remain there for weeks or months, pending deporta-
 tion after serving their sentences, unless they can arrange privately for their repa-
 triation. Due to security concerns, the authorities earlier in the year temporarily
 transferred groups of Haitian and Cuban detainees from the Detention Center to
 Fox Hill Prison after fighting broke out. These detainees have all since been re-
 leased or deported.
 Exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 Camiael oFair Public niaLC-The justice asstem derives from English common
 law. The  diciary, appointed by the executive branch onthe th  ice oe Judicial
 and Legalmervies Comhrion, has always been independent.
 Trials are fair and public; defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the
 right to appeal However, an overburdened judicial sstem must handle a steadily
 increasing caseload, which results in excessive retria detention and delayed justice
 for victims. The opening of new courts by the overnment has reduced the backlog
 of cases, particularly in domestic dispte uteut criminal cases can still be delayed
 in excess of 2 years before defendants receive a trial.
 There weg no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure and the Government gen-
 erally respects these prohibitions in practice. The law usually requires a court order
 for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector or more senior
 police official may authorize a search without a court order where probable cause
 of a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize te search of a
 person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling) without a
 court order should probable cause of drug possession exist. The Government neither
 censors mail nor restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects the constitutional pro-
 vision for the right of free expression, and the political opposition criticizes the Gov-
 ernment freely and frequently. Two daily and several weekly newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, including vary-
 ing deprees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers and
 magzines are readily available.
 Two radio stations, both privately owned, compete with a government-run net-
 work and include lively political debates in their programming. The country's sole
 television station, the state-owned Broadcasting Corporation of the Bahamas, pre-
 sents a variety of views, although opposition politicians claim with some justification
 that their views do not receive as extensive coverage as those of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association, and the authorities respect these rights
 in practice. The law permits private associations, but groups must obtain permits
 to hold public demonstrations. The authorities grant such permits almost without
 exception.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-he Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 
 
 322
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 Following the restoration of President Aristide in Haiti, the Bahamas reestab-
 lished diplomatic relations with Haiti and negotiated a repatriation agreement,
 whereby 800 Haitians residing illegally in the Bahamas could be returned to Haiti
 every month over a period of 1 year. The Bahamas offered free transportation and
 limited financial incentives to induce Haitians to depart voluntarily, though far
 fewer than expected did so.
 Reports from the initial roundups of Haitian  mants in February and March
 claimed that police and immigration officials physiclly mishandled some detainees,
 but reports since that time uniformly state that rep atriation procedures are proceed-
 ing smoothly and without incident. The presence of an estimated 35,000 Haitian mi-
 grants in the Bahamas remains a sensitive social, economic, and political issue.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with two major politi-
 cal parties and general elections at least every 5 years. An elected Prime Minister
 and Parliament govern. The political process is open to all elements of society, and
 citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to register and vote; voting is by secret
 ballot. In the 1992 elections, slightly more than 92 percent of registered voters cast
 valid ballots. The two principal political parties are the ruling Free National Move-
 ment and the opposition Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country
 for 6 years of internal self-government from 1967 to 1973, and held power under
 Prime Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling from independence in 1973 to 1992.
 The FNM holds 32 of 49 seats in the House of Assembly, and the PLP holds 17.
 Both the ruling party and the opposition name members to the upper house, the
 Senate, in compliance with constitutional guidelines. Although it does pass legisla-
 tion, the Senate is primarily a deliberative body that serves as a public forum to
 discuss  national problems   and   policies  to  address  them. Women    are
 underrepresented in the legislature. The Parliament has four elected female mem-
 bers, including the deputy speaker of the House, and three appointed female Sen-
 ators, including the government leader in the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Individual human rights monitors, several local human rights groups, as well as
 representatives of international human rights organizations operate freely, express-
 ing their opinions and reporting their findings on alleged human rights violations
 without government restriction. The Government allows them broad access to insti-
 tutions and individuals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government generally respects in practice the constitutional provisions for in-
 dividual rights and freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion,
 creed, or sex. However, both the Constitution and the law discriminate against
 women in several respects.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women continued to be a serious problem,
 with independent women's support groups reporting that many women sought shel-
 ter at the private, but government-supported, crisis center in Nassau. The domestic
 court, dealing exclusively with family issues such as spousal abuse, maintenance
 payments, and legal separation, received a significantly increased volume of cases
 this year. Officials attribute the increase to the greater willingness of victims to pur-
 sue their claims as a result of the court's decreased backlog, rather than to any in-
 crease in actual offenses. The court installed a one-way mirror this year to help
 shield victims from being identified by suspects. The court can and does impose var-
 ious legal constraints to protect women from abusive spouses or companions.
 The Constitution d      nates against women by not providing them with the
 same right as men to transmit citizenship to their foreign-born spouses. Addition-
 ally, the law makes it easier for Bahamian men with foreign spouses to confer citi-
 zenship on their children than for Bahamian women with foreign spouses. Some in-
 heritance laws also favor men over women. For example, when a person dies with-
 out a will, the estate passes to the oldest legitimate son, or in cases where there
 is no son, the closest legitimate male relative.
 
 
 323
 Women participate fully in Bahamian society and are well represented in the
 business and professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and the Government.
 The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Janet Bostwick, who was formerly the Minister of
 Justice, is personally responsible for the office known as the Government's Women's
 Affairs Unit.
 Children.-The Government places priority on maintaining adequate expenditures
 for child welfare and education. However, child abuse and neglect remain serious
 problems. The law requires that anyone having contact with a child they believe to
 be sexually abused must report their suspicion to the police. The same reporting re-
 quirement does not apply to cases of physical abuse, which also are increasing. The
 olice refer reported cases of sexual and physical abuse to the Department of Social
 Services, which investigates them and can bring criminal charges against perpetra-
 tors. The Department may remove children from abusive situations if the court
 deems it necessary.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the 1973 National Building Code mandates
 certai accommodations for the physically disabled in new public buildings, the au-
 thorities rarely enforce this part of the Code. Private buldings are also not routinely
 accessible. The Disability Affairs Unit of the Ministiy of Scial Development and
 National Insurance works with the Bahamas Council or the Disabled, an umbrella
 organization for groups offering services for the disabled, to provide a coordinated
 public and private sector approach to the needs of the disabled. A mix of govern-
 ment and private residential and nonresidential institutions provides a range of
 educational, training, and counseling services for both physically and mentally dis-
 abled adults and children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that labor unions have the
 right of free assembly and association. Private sector and most public sector workers
 may form or join unions without prior approval. Members of the police force, defense
 force, fire brigade, and prison guards may not organize or join unions. Workers exer-
 cise the right of association extensively; almost one-uatr of the work force (and
 one-half the workers in the important hotel industry) belong to unions.
 The country's two major umbrella labor organizations, the National Workers
 Council of Trade Unions and Associations and the Trade Union Congress (TUC)
 and individual labor unions all function independent of government or politicai
 party control. In October six trade unions signed a National Congress of Trade
 Unions constitution. The new constitution will provide a unified forum for over
 27,000 workers from the Musicians and Entertainers Union, Taxi Cab Union, Mari-
 time Port and Allied Workers Union, Commercial Stores and Supermarkets Union,
 Public Service Union, and the Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union
 (the country's largest).
 The Industrial Relations Act requires that, before a strike begins, a simple major-
 ity of a union's membership must vote in favor of a motion to strike. The Office of
 Labor must supervise the vote. The Minister of State for the Public Service and
 Labor may also refer a dispute involving employees of an "essential service" to the
 Industrial Relations Board for settlement, if the Minister determines that the public
 interest requires such action. The Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers
 Union conducted a number of work stoppages and strikes at resort hotels during
 the year. In September the Airport, Airlines and Allied Workers Union staged a
 "sick-out" against Bahamasair in an unsuccessful attempt to gain salary increases.
 All labor unions have the right to maintain affiliations with international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers freely exercise their
 right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, and the law protects it.
 Unions and employers negotiate wage rates without government interference.
 The Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 tion by employers. The Act requires employers to recognize trade unions. The Indus-
 trial Relations Board mediates disputes between emp oyees or unions and their em-
 ployers. Mechanisms exist to resolve complaints, including filing a trade union dis-
 pute with the Ministry of State for the Public Service and Labor or bringing a civil
 suit against the employer in court. The Act requires the reinstatement of workers
 fired for union activities. Employers may dismiss workers in accordance with appli-
 cable contracts, which generally require some severance pay. The Government en-
 forces labor laws and regulations uniformly throughout the country. The Bahamas
 has two small free trade zones. Labor law and practice in these zones do not differ
 from those in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor does not exist in practice.
 
 
 324
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of children under the age of  years for industrial work, work during school hours,
 or work at night. There is no legal minimum age for employment in other sectors,
 and some children work part time in light industry and service jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for one 24-hour rest period weekly. The act
 requires overtime payment (time and a hal) for hours beyond the standard. The act
 permits the creation of a Wages Council to recommend the setting of a minimum
 wage. To date, however, the Bahamas has not established such a council or a mini-
 mum wage.
 The Ministry of State for the Public Service and Labor, responsible for enforcing
 labor laws, has a team of inspectors who conduct on-site visits to enforce occupa-
 tional health and safety standards and investigate employee concerns and com-
 plaints, but inspections occur only infrequently. The Ministry normally announces
 inspection visits in advance, and employers generally cooperate with inspectors to
 implement safety standards. In September the Government, in conjunction with the
 International Labor Organization and the TUC, sponsored a 4-day seminar on occu-
 pational safety and health and the environment in order to promote greater aware-
 ness and enforcement of worker health and safety standards.
 The national insurance program compensates workers for work-related injuries.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to find suitable alternative em-
 ployment for employees injured on the job but still able to work. The law does not
 provide a right or worers to absent themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
