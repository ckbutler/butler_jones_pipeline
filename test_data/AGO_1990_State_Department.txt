 ANGOLA*
 
 The People's Republic of Angola (PRA) is controlled by the
 sole legal political party, the Marxist-Leninist Popular
 Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Workers Party
 (MPLA-PT). President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is both Head of
 State and chief of the MPLA-PT. All major policy decisions
 are made by a small group within the party, which also
 controls all means of mass communication. Dos Santos has
 voiced his commitment to constitutional reforms that may
 permit other Angolan political parties in the future.
 The PRA's armed forces (FAPLA) total approximately 100,000.
 FAPLA is backed by a lightly armed People's Militia, which is
 used for counterinsurgency and defensive duties at the local
 level. The armed opposition, the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA), is estimated to have a regular
 force of about 30,000, as well as a comparable number of
 irregular troops. It has the allegiance of a substantial
 portion of the population, especially among Angola's largest
 ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, as well as the Ganguela and the
 Lunda-Chokwe.
 UNITA controls the southeastern quarter of Angola and took
 control of portions of northern Angola during 1990. UNITA
 operates in guerrilla bands in central and northern Angola,
 including the outskirts of Luanda, the capital of the PRA.
 The United States supports UNITA in the Angolan conflict and
 has provided it with assistance. The PRA receives extensive
 military assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of
 materiel (estimated at $500 million in 1990) and over 1,000
 advisers and technicians. As of October 1, 1990, 38,000 of
 the estimated 50,000 Cuban combat troops who were stationed in
 the country in support of the Luanda regime had been withdrawn
 in accordance with the New York accords of December 22, 1988.
 Under these agreements, Cuba is committed to withdraw all its
 troops from Angola by July 1, 1991.
 In December 1989, the PRA, with the help of Soviet advisers,
 launched a new military offensive into UNITA-controlled areas
 of southeastern Angola. When the offensive stalled in early
 April 1990, the PRA's interest in negotiations was renewed.
 Both sides accepted a Portuguese proposal to sponsor direct
 talks, and the two antagonists held their first meeting in
 late April. In late September, U.S. and Soviet technical
 experts joined in the fourth round of Portuguese-sponsored
 direct talks, and preliminary discussions were held on a
 cease-fire agreement as well as on the political principles
 which would serve as the framework for an overall settlement.
 Despite further progress during November and December, the
 year ended without agreement on a cease-fire or the basis for
 a political settlement.
 The civil war, which has ravaged Angola since 1975, combined
 with the PRA's Communist command-style economy, has devastated
 the country's infrastructure, led to a return to barter in
 many areas, and forced the PRA to divert much of its revenues,
 mainly from oil exports, to the military, including payments
 to the Soviet Union for military equipment and to Cuba for
 military personnel. The PRA, in response to the generally
 *The United States does not recognize or maintain diplomatic
 relations with thq People's Republic of Angola and has no
 diplomatic personnel in Angola to monitor human rights
 conditions or-evaluate allegations of abuses.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 critical economic situation, announced its intention to
 institute some market-oriented economic reforms, but by the
 end of 1990 little concrete progress had been made in
 implementing them. The expenditure of hard currency for
 weapons and the disruptive impact of war on Angolan
 agriculture, coupled with 2 years of drought in central and
 southern Angola, have created chronic food shortages in both
 the cities and the countryside.
 The civil war has resulted in widespread human rights abuses
 by both sides and many civilian casualties throughout the
 country. In 1989 the human rights group Africa Watch
 estimated the total number of civil war victims at 200,000
 Angolans killed, more than 20,000 children orphaned, and
 20,000 to 50,000 Angolans left as amputees due to the
 widespread use of land mines by both sides. Since then, the
 war has claimed more civilian casualties, many from starvation
 in early 1990 as both sides prevented humanitarian food aid
 from reaching affected populations. In August a United
 Nations team reported that a major famine was imminent.
 Spurred by growing international concern, the PRA and UNITA
 agreed in late September to a United Nations emergency relief
 plan to provide food and other humanitarian supplies to
 civilians on both sides of the conflict. Cross-line and
 cross-border relief deliveries began in early November, with
 the hope that 118,000 tons of food would reach affected areas
 during the initial 6 months of the program. On December 21,
 however, the U.N. temporarily suspended its relief operations
 after the PRA revoked its permission for assistance to be
 delivered to UNITA-held areas.
 Across-the-board abuses of human rights ranged from extensive
 violence against civilians and mistreatment of prisoners to
 arbitrary detentions, absence of fair trials, and restrictions
 on freedom of speech, press, association, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Both the PRA and UNITA continued to accuse each other of
 extrajudicial killings, both in combat areas and in the form
 of summary executions of prisoners. Both publicly and
 repeatedly accused each other of practicing terrorism against
 their opponents, including killing, torturing or maiming
 civilians. The fighting also resulted in civilian deaths,
 some of which may have been deliberately perpetrated by
 opposing forces to intimidate civilian populations.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information either to confirm or to deny that
 secret arrests or clandestine detentions are practiced by PRA
 security agencies or by UNITA, although each side has accused
 the other of such practices.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment appear to have some
 basis in fact   In its 1990 report, Amnesty International (AI)
 
 
 ANGOLA
 included reports of PRA prisoners tortured with electric shock
 at Luanda's Catete Road prison and the torture and beating of
 detainees in Luanda and the provinces of Benguela and
 Namibe.   Reports that UNITA mistreats some prisoners could
 neither be confirmed nor disproved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under laws enacted by the PRA, persons suspected of committing
 serious acts against "state security" may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial
 period of 3 months, renewable for a further period of 3
 months. Such detainees need not be presented to a judge
 within 48 hours of their arrest, as stipulated in the Code of
 Criminal Procedure for persons suspected of other kinds of
 crime, and apparently have no right to challenge the grounds
 of their detention. After 6 months in detention without
 charge, the detainee must be informed of the accusations, with
 the State Security Service either informing the public
 prosecutor of the charges or releasing the suspect. Once the
 case is presented to the public prosecutor, there does not
 appear to be a specific time limit within which a suspect must
 be brought to trial.
 The PRA has established regional military councils throughout
 much of Angola. They are responsible directly to President
 dos Santos and have broad authority to restrict the movement
 of people and goods, to requisition people and goods without
 compensation, and to try crimes against "state security." The
 PRA has also created "People's Vigilance Brigades" in urban
 areas, whose powers are not clear but which include general
 administration and "protecting the people and ensuring public
 order and stability."
 During 1990, press accounts repeated earlier allegations that
 UNITA has detained or executed opponents of Dr. Jonas Savimbi,
 UNITA's president.   As in previous years, these allegations
 could not be independently verified.
 The number and breakdown of political detainees and criminal
 and military prisoners held by both sides at the end of 1990
 was estimated in the thousands. The PRA released more than
 700 political detainees/prisoners in 1989, but made no
 announcements about further releases in 1990. According to an
 October announcement from the National Association for Human
 Rights in Namibia, the PRA holds about 100 South West Africa
 People's Organization and Koevoet prisoners, as well as UNITA
 supporters.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the PRA Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, in practice the judiciary follows MPLA-PT party
 guidelines. The Constitution also states that no citizen
 shall be arrested and brought to trial except under the terms
 of the law, which provide for a public trial and the right of
 the accused to legal counsel. There is, however, insufficient
 information to determine if, or to what extent, these rights
 are observed in practice in regular criminal and civil cases.
 The deterioration of the security situation has exacerbated
 the general decline in judicial safeguards and due process.
 Judicial lines of authority are unclear, especially since the
 PRA's regional military councils have been given
 responsibility for the trial of offenses against "state
 
 
 ANGOLA
 security," including "economic crimes." It is not known which
 trials are open to the public and under what rules of
 procedure the various military and civilian courts operate.
 The PRA Constitution also provides for a People's Supreme
 Court, but no information is available about its jurisdiction.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 the home and privacy of correspondence, the PRA conducts
 arbitrary searches of homes, inspects private correspondence,
 and monitors private communications.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The PRA military offensive launched in December 1989 led to
 intense fighting around Mavinga, a UNITA population and
 agricultural center, during the first 4 months of the year.
 UNITA counterattacked in the northwest and sabotaged Luanda's
 public water and electricity facilities. These military
 actions extended the scope of the war in 1990 and inevitably
 created further hardships for civilians.
 The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance of the Agency
 for International Development estimates that between 1 and 1.5
 million persons, a substantial proportion of the Angolan
 population of 8 to 9 million, have been displaced internally.
 In August the United Nations estimated that 460,000 displaced
 persons were located in drought-affected areas, but this
 figure may be substantially greater. Many estimates range
 closer to 1 million. Africa Watch reported that the PRA has
 forcibly displaced thousands of civilians, in part to deny
 UNITA a social base, and that UNITA has captured thousands of
 civilians and forced them to work on UNITA farms.
 The PRA throughout much of 1990 blocked humanitarian food
 shipments into UNITA-controlled areas, but both parties agreed
 in late September to a United Nations relief program which
 will provide assistance to affected civilians on both sides of
 the conflict. Prior to this time, UNITA actions had also
 prevented food shipments into some famine-threatened areas
 under PRA control. In late December the United Nations
 temporarily suspended its relief program when the PRA revoked
 its assent for deliveries in UNITA-held areas. The total
 number of civilian deaths in the civil war, due to fighting
 and starvation caused by the fighting, may have reached
 225,000 by the end of 1990. but no reliable figures are
 available.
 The PRA and UNITA have accused each other of placing land
 mines in footpaths to agricultural fields as part of a
 strategy to deny food to civilians in contested areas.
 Thousands of civilians on both sides of the conflict have lost
 limbs as a result of the widespread use of land mines.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the PRA Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression, there is censorship, intimidation, and government
 control of the media. AI reports that a.brewery worker is
 serving a 2-year sentence for a critical reference to a senior
 
 
 ANGOLA
 police official following the arrest of a colleague. The PRA
 is especially sensitive to criticism in the foreign press. It
 controls the travel of foreign correspondents to and within
 Angola, and the circulation of foreign publications in
 PRA-controlled Angola is tightly restricted. Similarly,
 foreign correspondents who have traveled in UNITA-controlled
 Angola have been accompanied by UNITA escorts, and there is no
 free press in those areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the PRA Constitution calls for freedom of assembly,
 it is denied to any political group or movement other than the
 MPLA-PT or its associated mass organizations. All other
 political movements are banned under the current Constitution
 and the formation of nonpolitical civic groups has been only
 selectively authorized. In July and October meetings of the
 Central Committee and at the December Party Congress, the PRA
 made conditional commitments to a multiparty system and to
 revising the national Constitution during 1991.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the PRA Constitution provides for the inviolability
 of freedom of conscience and belief and for separation of
 church and state, the authorities have been critical of
 religious activities in the past. Approximately 85 percent of
 the Angolan population is either Roman Catholic or Protestant,
 while the remainder practice a variety of animist beliefs.
 The PRA has eased its antireligious stance but has failed to
 restore all church properties previously confiscated and has
 often criticized religious leaders' calls for a multiparty
 political system. Church services are held regularly, and
 there is wide attendance. Foreign and Angolan religious
 workers are allowed to carry out normal activities. In 1990
 the PRA sought help from the Catholic Church to revive and
 rebuild Angola's educational system. UNITA respects freedom
 of religion in the areas it controls and provides limited
 administrative support to both Catholic and Protestant
 churches.
 The PRA refuses to recognize smaller religious sects that it
 deems subversive, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the
 Tocoist Church, founded in Angola in 1949, which has a
 syncretic blend of Christian beliefs and indigenous religious
 practices. The PRA authorities banned the Church in 1977. In
 1988, 19 members of the Tocoist Church were convicted and
 jailed for homicide and crimes against state security.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the fighting and the widespread use of land
 mines by both sides, travel by road in most areas of Angola is
 dangerous. The Luanda authorities are acutely sensitive about
 security and have tightly restricted travel. The PRA has also
 instituted a pass system within Angola, and foreigners are
 generally prohibited from traveling outside the principal
 cities. UNITA has publicly warned that it considers all of
 Angola to be a war zone and that it cannot guarantee the
 safety of persons traveling there.
 Some Angolans are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel is
 carefully controlled by the PRA's restrictions on issuance of
 passports and exit visas and by currency restrictions.

 ANGOLA
 Emigration is restricted, and the PRA limits travel to Angola
 through a selective and stringent visa policy.
 There was little change in the refugee situation during the
 year. There are approximately 9,700 Zairian refugees and
 another 1,100 South African refugees in Angola. Some 400,000
 Angolan refugees are still resident in neighboring countries.
 Approximately 300,000 Angolans are refugees in Zaire, and an
 estimated 97,000 are in Zambia. The developing famine in
 southern Angola, in which at least 250,000 persons faced
 immediate danger of starvation at the end of 1990, could force
 a major migration if relief efforts are not timely. Although
 Namibia is considered the most likely haven for these
 prospective refugees, there were no signs of such forced
 migration as the year ended.
 From September 1989 through March 1990, the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees repatriatied
 6,213 Angolan refugees from Zaire and 3,036 Zairians from
 Angola. An estimated 3,000 Angolan refugees who crossed into
 Namibia in early April had returned to Angola by the end of
 June. Another 35,000 to 40,000 Angolans are considered to be
 "self-settled" in Namibia by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Angolans do not have the right to change the PRA regime. Most
 of Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the
 party apparatus, especially the Politburo and Central
 Committee of the ruling MPLA-PT. The PRA Constitution
 provides for public participation in the political process,
 but political activity in 1990 was still limited to
 participation in the MPLA-PT or in one of its controlled and
 sanctioned organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan
 Women's Organization, or the trade union movement. Party
 membership is very restricted, with fewer than 30,000 members,
 largely urbanized Mesticos and members of the Mbundu tribe.
 In October the MPLA-PT announced its intent to implement a
 multiparty system by March 1991, to revise the national
 Constitution, and to hold multiparty elections within 3 years
 after a cease-fire has been reached. Although the December
 1990 Party Congress ratified these decisions, they had not
 been implemented before the end of the year.
 UNITA dropped its demands in 1990 to be included in a
 transitional government, but it continued to insist on a firm
 commitment to a multiparty system and to free elections in
 which it could participate as a legalized political party.
 The PRA Constitution provides for a popularly elected National
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, and people's
 assemblies at the provincial and local levels. Only
 candidates chosen and endorsed by the MPLA-PT have been
 elected. Key members of the party also hold leadership
 positions in the provincial and local assemblies.
 Both the MPLA-PT and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA-PT among the Mbundu and urbanized Mesticos,
 and UNITA among the Ovimbundu, Ganguela, and Lunda-Chokwe.
 Although members of all of Angola's ethnic groups and
 religions participate in both organizations, non-Mbundu groups
 
 
 ANGOLA
 are greatly underrepresented within the MPLA-PT Central
 Committee and Politburo. Mesticos (Angolans of mixed racial
 background numbering only about 1 percent of the population)
 remain the most highly skilled and educated group in Angola
 and are influential-politically, culturally, and
 economically--beyond their numbers in the PRA.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The PRA has not responded to various appeals for information
 concerning numerous political detainees, and neither the PRA
 nor UNITA would let Africa Watch researchers into the country
 in 1989 or 1990. Both the PRA and UNITA have allowed various
 organizations to provide food and other humanitarian
 assistance in areas they control, but neither has fully
 responded to International Committee of the Red Cross requests
 for access to all persons arrested in connection with internal
 events and the military situation in the country. In October
 both parties began to cooperate with United Nations-sponsored
 efforts to deliver humanitarian relief to victims of drought,
 famine, and civil conflict throughout central and southern
 Angola.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Because of the disturbed situation prevailing in most of
 Angola, there is little information available on the existence
 or extent of discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. There is also no
 information available on the extent of violence against women
 in.Angola.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Angolan workers do not have the right to form independent
 trade unions. The sole, legally recognized, trade union
 organization in PRA-administered Angola is the National Union
 of Angolan Workers (UNTA), which was formed in the late 1950's
 as an appendage of the MPLA-PT and became the ruling party's
 official labor wing after Angolan independence in 1975. The
 preindependence labor centers of rival liberation
 organizations ceased to exist soon after the MPLA-PT took
 control of most of the country. The monopoly situation of the
 UNTA is ensured by the statutory basis of the single-union
 structure. In addition, the activities of the labor central
 and its affiliates are tightly controlled by the MPLA-PT.
 Strikes are illegal and considered to be a crime against
 "state security." The UNTA is affiliated with the
 continent-wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to bargain collectively,
 although the PRA has ratified Interhational Labor'Organization
 (ILO) Convention 98 on the right to organize and collective
 bargaining. The Luanda regime, through its Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security, controls the process of setting wages and
 benefits, but it coordinates its actions with UNTA and
 employers. There are no export processing zones in Angola.
 
 
 ANGOLA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Existing PRA legislation authorizes compulsory labor for
 breaches of labor discipline and participation in strikes. On
 the basis of this legislation, the ILO in 1984 first cited the
 Luanda regime for being in violation of ILO Convention 105,
 which prohibits forced labor. Again in 1990 the ILO Committee
 of Experts cited the PRA for its failure to bring its
 legislation into conformity with Convention 105, which the PRA
 ratified in 1976. Both the PRA and UNITA accuse each other of
 relying on forced conscription of young males for recruitment
 into the military forces.,
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no information available on this subject apart from
 the fact that in 1976 the PRA ratified ILO Convention 6
 governing night work of young persons and Convention 7
 regarding the minimum age for employment at sea.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 According to a decree issued in 1982, the normal workweek is
 limited to 44 hours. The workweek is limited to 34 hours and
 6 days a week for persons aged 14 to 16, and to 38 hours and 7
 days a week for persons aged 16 to 18. This decree applies to
 all state institutions, to state, semipublic, private, and
 cooperative undertakings, and to mass and social organizations.
 Angola does have a minimum wage rate system, but it contains
 no requirement that minimum wages be adjusted as a function of
 cost-of-living increases. There is no recent information
 available on current minimum wage rates or on the extent of
 their application.
 The PRA has ratified none of the ILO's safety and health
 conventions, although it has ratified several conventions
 ensuring-compensation to workers-who suffer from occupational
 injuries or diseases. No information is available on the
 existence or adequacy of national occupational health and
 safety standards nor on actual practice with respect to any
 labor standards.
