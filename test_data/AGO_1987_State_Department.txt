 ANGOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola, the regime established in
 Luanda upon the withdrawal of the Portuguese in 1975, is ruled
 by the only legal political party, the Marxist-Leninist
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is both Head of State and
 chief of the MPLA. His rule was reconfirmed by the MPLA's
 Second Party Congress in December 1985. All major policy
 decisions are made by a small elite in the MPLA, which also
 controls all means of mass communication. Open political
 dissension is not tolerated. Now in its 12th year, the
 internal conflict between the Government and the main
 opposition force, the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA), again dominated events in 1987.
 The Angolan armed forces (FAPLA) total approximately 100,000.
 FAPLA is backed by a lightly armed Peoples' Milita, which is
 used only for defensive duties within their localities.
 UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, is estimated to have a regular
 force of about 30,000, as well as a comparable number of
 irregular troops. It has the allegiance of a substantial
 portion of the population, especially among Angola's largest
 ethnic group the Ovimbundu. UNITA controls the southeastern
 quarter of Angola's territory. The Angolan Government receives
 extensive military assistance from the Soviet Union--well over
 $4 billion since 1975 and $1 billion in the last year alone--
 and in 1987 an estimated 1,500 Soviet and East German advisers
 continued to play an important role in planning and directing
 military operations. An estimated 40,000 Cuban military
 personnel, a number which increased during 1987, provide
 logistical support, training, and advice to government forces
 as well as garrison key strategic population and economic
 centers. UNITA has stated it favors a government of national
 unity and has not sought to establish an alternate government.
 The Government for its part repeatedly has stated that it will
 not negotiate with UNITA, although it has offered amnesty to
 UNITA rebels who lay down their arms. The United States
 supports UNITA in the Angolan conflict and has provided its
 forces with appropriate assistance.
 The fighting has devastated the country's infrastructure,
 forced a return to barter in some areas, and has led the
 Government to divert much of its assets to the military,
 including payments to the Soviet Bloc for military equipment
 and Cuban combat troops. Although foreign exchange earnings
 from Angola's oil exports increased in 1987 (to $1.8 billion),
 the continued reduction of commercial food imports, and the
 impact of war on the productivity and distribution networks of
 Angolan agriculture are reportedly creating a serious food
 emergency in both the cities and the countryside. At the end
 of 1987, efforts were underway by international relief
 agencies and donor governments to assist in preventing
 famine. The Government, in response to the generally critical
 situation, announced on August 17 its intention to institute
 economic reforms, but had not done so by the end of 1987. The
 Government also has applied for admission to the International
 Monetary Fund.
 *The United States does not maintain diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of Angola and thus has no diplomatic
 personnel there able to monitor human rights conditions or
 evaluate allegations of abuses.

 ANGOLA
 In 1987 human rights abuses continued as the fighting increased
 in intensity. In November UNITA forces finally stopped a major
 government campaign leaving many hundreds of casualties. Each
 side accused the other of killing civilians and committing
 atrocities. Some recent estimates indicate that about 700,000
 of the 8 to 9 million population have been displaced
 internally, in addition to some 400,000 refugees resident in
 neighboring countries. South Africa announced in November
 that it had given military support to UNITA-during the'fall
 campaign. A numberof deaths also occurred inside Angola in
 the course of hostilities between the Southwest Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO--a Namibian resistance movement with bases
 in Angola) and South Africa, which controls the territory of
 Namibia on Angola's southern border.
 .RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of.the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of unconfirmed political killings on the part of the
 Government and UNITA, both within the combat-areas and in the
 form of summary executions of prisoners, persisted in 1987
 (see Section l.g.). A number of.members of a religious sect
 were killed by security forces in Luanda in February (see
 Section 2.c.).
 b. Disappearance.
 There is no- information to confirm that secret arrests or
 clandestine detentions are practiced by government security
 agencies or-by UNITA, although each side has accused the other
 of.-such practices.
 c. -Torture and-Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment'or Punishment
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment made by both sides
 appear to have some basis in fact, but torture of opponents
 does not appear to be a systematic practice of either the -
 Government or UNITA.
 Angolan prison conditions are-poor, with substandard diet and
 sanitation. There are some unconfirmed reports that foreigners
 are notwell treated, but Americans who have been imprisoned
 in Angola appear to have been treated adequately and to have.
 had access to medical care.
 Prison authorities, reportedly have wide latitude in the
 treatment of prisoners. Treatment of political prisoners at
 the prisons controlled by the Ministry of State Security
 appears to be harsher than treatment in the regular prisons.
 Mistreatment includes beatings, threats, and prolonged
 interrogation with the use of force. Amnesty International's
 1987 Report stated that the most commonly reported form of.
 torture involved severe and repeated beatings. Prison visits
 appear to be arbitrarily restricted in many instances.
 Foreign advisers, including Cubans and East Germans, are
 assisting Angolan state security services and may help in
 operating.-state security prisons. The Government continues to
 put captured UNITA supporters on public display.

 ANGOLA
 Very limited information is available on the situation and
 administrative structure within UNITA-held areas. It is
 known, however, that UNITA captures foreign and government
 prisoners in the course of military operations and holds them
 in makeshift facilities in its areas of control in southeastern
 Angola. In September 1987, UNITA took three Swedish aid
 workers prisoner during an assault on a military convoy. One
 of them was wounded during the attack and subsequently died;
 the two remaining prisoners were released in December.
 Following their release, the two told reporters they were not
 mistreated but that the third prisoner might have survived had
 he been given adequate medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Two of the most frequently reported charges of human rights
 violations have been arbitrary arrest and imprisonment without
 due process. Numerous reports allege that persons are
 arrested and imprisoned by the Government on suspicion or
 denunciation by others and, in some cases, held for years
 without being notified of the charges against them. In its
 1987 Report, Amnesty International stated that there continue
 to be few safeguards against the arrest and detention of
 political suspects by Government security services.
 Under Angolan law, persons suspected of committing serious
 acts against the security of the State may be held by the
 Ministry of State Security without charge for an initial
 period of 3 months, renewable for a further period of 3
 months. Such detainees need not be presented to a judge
 within 48 hours of their arrest, as stipulated in the code of
 criminal procedure for persons suspected of other kinds of
 crime, and apparently have no right to challenge the grounds
 of their detention. After 6 months in detention without
 charge, the detainee must be informed of the accusations, with
 the state security service either informing the public
 prosecutor of the charges or releasing the suspect. Once the
 case is presented to the public prosecutor, there does not
 appear to be a specific time limit within which a suspect must
 be brought to trial, and many political detainees--the exact
 number is not known but may be several hundred--have been held
 for years without being tried.
 The deterioration of the security situation has exacerbated
 the general decline in judicial safeguards and due process.
 The Government has established regional military councils
 throughout much of Angola. They are responsible directly to
 President Dos Santos and have broad authority to restrict the
 movement of people and goods, to requisition people and goods
 without compensation, and to try crimes against the security
 of the State. The Government has also created "people's
 vigilance brigades" for urban areas, whose powers are not
 clear but include general administration and "protecting the
 people and ensuring public order and stability."
 The most important person to accept the Government's offer of
 amnesty was Daniel Chipenda, who had seriously challenged the
 late President Neto for leadership of the MPLA in 1974.
 During 1987 both sides accused each other of relying on forced
 conscription of young males for recruitment into the military
 forces.  In 1984 the Angolan Government was cited by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) for being in violation
 of ILO Convention 105, which prohibits forced labor. The
 
 
 ANGOLA
 basis of this citation is Angolan legislation providing for
 compulsory labor for breaches of labor discipline and
 participation in strikes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution states that no citizen shall be arrested and
 brought to trial except under the terms of the law, and it
 provides for the right of the accused to a-defense. There is,
 however, insufficient evidence to determine to what extent
 these rights are, observed in practice. In its 1987 Report,
 Amnesty International expressed concern that trials of
 government opponents, notably in military tribunals, do not
 conform to internationally recognized trial standards. In
 particular, defendants reportedly were not given adequate
 opportunity to present their defense or appeal their cases.
 Judicial lines of authority are unclear, especially since the
 regional military councils have been given responsibility for
 the trial of offenses against the security of the State,
 including "economic crimes." It is not known which trials are
 open to the public and under what rules-of procedure the
 various military and civilian courts operate. The Constitution
 provides for a People's Supreme Court, but its, jurisdiction is
 not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although-the--Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 the home- and-privacy of correspondence, the Government
 conducts- arbitrary searches of homes, censors private
 correspondence, and.monitors private communications.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 The civil war reached a new level of intensity in 1987, with
 modern weaponry in usa by both sides. The escalation of the
 war resulted in numerous allegations that government, UNITA,
 and South African forces killed civilians and that the MPLA
 and UNITA executed political prisoners. While it is difficult
 to substantiate the various claims and counterclaims,
 available evidence suggests that both government and UNITA
 forces have on occasion arbitrarily executed prisoners. The
 fighting also probably resulted in hundreds of civilian
 deaths. While some of these deaths were inadvertently caused
 by military operations, others appear to have been deliberately
 perpetrated by opposing-forces to intimidate civilian
 populations, The MPLA and-UNITA have publicly and repeatedly
 accused each other of practicing terrorism against their
 respective opponents, including killing or maiming civilians.
 UNITA has additionally charged that Cuban forces have been
 involved in-attacks on civilians. Civilians also have died as
 a result of guerrilla actions, such as attacks on ground
 transportation and other economic targets. There are no
 reliable casualty figures,,but the international press focused
 on the lbrge number of civilian casualties due to the extensive
 use of landmines. Upwards of.I0,000 persons may have lost
 limbs as a result of the widespread use of landmines.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution -provides for freedom of expression "in the
 context of the achievement of the basic objectives of the
 
 
 10
 ANGOLA
 People's Republic of Angola." In fact, the Angolan people
 live under censorship, intimidation, and Government control of
 the media. Opposition views are not tolerated, and critics
 such as Bartolomeu Dias Fernandes, who was accused of
 "insulting the Head of State," have been sentenced to long
 prison terms.
 The Government is especially sensitive to criticism in the
 foreign press. But in 1986 the Government began to allow the
 travel of foreign correspondents to Angola in a controlled
 flow, a practice that was continued in 1987. Angola subscribes
 to the "Front Line" states' ban on visits by South Africa-based
 news correspondents. The circulation of Western journals and
 periodicals in Angola is tightly restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political group or
 movement other than the MPLA. All other political movements
 have been banned. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of opposition movements or
 alternative political systems. The people's vigilance
 brigades, which have some law enforcement authority in urban
 areas, and the martial law climate throughout the country tend
 further to restrict freedom of assembly and association.
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the National Union
 of Angolan Workers, which is controlled by the MPLA and is a
 member of the continent-wide Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. Traditional labor union activities are tightly
 controlled by the Government, and legislation ensures only a
 single trade union structure. Strikes are prohibited by law
 as a crime against the security of the State.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for the inviolability of
 freedom of conscience and belief and for separation of church
 and state, the Government publicly emphasizes the importance
 of propagating atheism and has been critical of religious
 activities. The overwhelming majority of the Angolan
 population is Christian, however, and the Government has not
 moved to close down officially recognized churches. Church
 services are held regularly, and there is widespread
 attendance. Foreign and Angolan missionaries are allowed to
 carry out their normal activities. Reportedly, UNITA respects
 freedom of religion in the areas it controls. In the past,
 UNITA several times captured foreign missionaries, releasing
 them unharmed after publicly warning them of the dangers of
 being caught in the combat zone.
 The Government refuses to recognize smaller religious sects
 that it deems subversive. In February 1987, for reasons that
 are unclear, Angolan security forces in Luanda killed a number
 of members of a subsect of the Tocoist Church called the 18
 Classes and 16 Tribes. The Tocoist Church, founded in Africa
 in 1949, is a syncretic blend of Christian beliefs and
 indigenous religious practices. The Government banned the
 Church in 1977.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the increased fighting, the Government is
 acutely sensitive about security and has tightly
 
 
 ANGOLA
 restricted travel, Travel by road in most areas of Angola is
 dangerous. The Government has instituted a pass system within
 Angola, and foreigners are generally prohibited from traveling
 outside the principal cities. *UNITA has publicly warned that
 it considers all'of Angola to be a war zone and that it cannot
 guarantee the safety of persons traveling-there.
 Angolan citizens are allowed to travel abroad, but this travel
 is carefully controlled by restrictions on issuance of
 passpo-rts na exit visas and by currency restrictions.
 Emigrationis restricted. The Government limits travel to
 Angola through a selective and stringent visa policy.
 Angola-is a party-to the U.N. Protocol Relating to the Status
 of RdfugeesV-Thete are'currently approximately 70,'000
 Namibian, -.3,00 Zairian7, and 10,000 South African refugees or
 displaded persons in'-Angola. Since-mid-1980, between 120,000
 and 140;000 fotmer Z~irian displaced persons in Angola returned
 home unddt the auspices of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 Approximately 300,000 Angolans are still refugees in Zaire,
 and an estimated 94,000 are in Zambia. The Government claims
 that 180,000 exiles have returned to Angola over the years,
 but this dlaim cannot be Vdrified.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change the Government.
 Angola is ruled by a small group of officials within the party
 apparatus of the ruling MPLA. The Constitution provides for
 popular participation in the political process, but political
 activity is limited to participation in the MPLA or in one of
 its controlled and sanctioned organizations such as its youth
 wing, the Angolan Women's Organization, or the trade union
 movement. -Political power is centered in the elite membership
 of the Politburo and the somewhat larger Central Committee.
 Party membership is very restricted, *ith fewer than 30,000
 members out of a population of 8 to 9 million, according to
 the official media.
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected National
 People's Assembly, established in 1981, and people's
 assemblies at the provincial and local level. However,
 despite recent suggestions from President Dos Santos that the
 powers and membership of the National People's Assembly be
 broadened, as of the end of 1987 only candidates chosen and
 endorsed by the party have been elected. Key members of the
 party also hold leadership positions in the people's
 assemblies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has allowed the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) and United Nations International Children's
 Emergency Fund to provide food and medical assistance in areas
 it controls, and UNITA allows the ICRC to conduct similar
 operations in areas it controls or is contesting. The
 Government has not responded to ICRC requests for access to
 all persons arrested in connection with internal events and
 the military situation in the country.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Because of the disturbed situation prevailing in most of
 Angola, there is little information available on the existence
 or extent of discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status.
 Both the MPLA and UNITA have primarily ethnic bases of
 support--the MPLA among Kimbundu speakers, and UNITA among the
 Ovimbundu. Members of all of Angola's ethnic groups and
 religions, as well as women, participate in both organizations,
 some at high levels of the party. However, non-Kimbundu groups
 are greatly underrepresented in the small group within the
 ruling MPLA Central Committee and Politburo. Mesticos
 (Angolans of mixed racial background numbering only about 1
 percent of the population) remain the most highly skilled and
 educated group in Angola and are influential--politically,
 culturally, and economically--beyond their nuinbers. Women and
 blacks were given more positions in the top leadership by the
 1985 Second Party Congress.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no information available on working conditions in
 Angola.
