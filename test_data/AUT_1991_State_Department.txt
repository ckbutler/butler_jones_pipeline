 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary dembcracy. A
 coalition government (Social Democratic Party and People's
 Party), formed originally after the 1986 national election,
 continued in office after the October 1990 election. The
 liberal/nationalist Freedom Party and the loosely united Green
 Party comprise the opposition.
 The police and security organs are subordinated to the
 executive and judicial authorities. The Interior Ministry
 during 1991 took several steps to respond to allegations of the
 mistreatment of detainees while in police custody.
 Austria has a developed economy, and its citizens enjoy a high
 standard of living.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria, and individual
 rights and political freedoms are provided for in the
 Constitution and generally protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings either
 by government authorities or opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no political abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution.
 In 1991 discussion of police brutality continued in the wake of
 reports charging that persons who file complaints against the
 police risk being charged with slander by the accused officials.
 In response, the Interior Minister issued a report in January
 stating that there were 2,622 allegations of police brutality
 between 1984 and 1989. In 1,142 cases of criminal complaints,
 33 police officers were convicted. Investigations of 120
 officers resulted in disciplinary measures being taken against
 26 of them.
 Among the Government's interim measures to mitigate the
 ill-treatment of detainees was the Interior Ministry's issuance
 of a leaflet to be given to any person arrested or detained by
 the police. It stipulates the person's right to call a lawyer
 or "person of confidence" and his or her own doctor if a
 medical examination is required. A new police law, passed in
 October and scheduled to enter into effect in May 1993 (to
 allow sufficient time to train police officers in the new
 regulations), stipulates more clearly the limitations on police
 conduct during investigations and limits to 7 days the time a
 person may be held on charges of "aggressive behavior" without
 being brought before a magistrate. During this time, arrested
 persons may appeal their arrest to."administrative senates"
 composed of independent judges.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. In
 criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial
 detention for up to 48 hours (except in cases in which
 "aggressive behavior" is charged, as noted above) by which time
 an investigative judge must decide on the legality of continuing
 the detention. Provided the investigative judge agrees, the
 accused may be held pending completion of an investigation for
 a maximum of 2 years. Grounds for investigative detention are
 enumerated in the law, as are conditions for release on bail.
 The law is respected and closely followed in practice.
 e . Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. Trials are public. Judges are
 appointed for life. Jury trials are prescribed for major
 offenses (those for which a sentence of over 5 years might be
 passed), and those convicted have the right of appeal. Written
 charges must be presented to the accused, who has the right to
 be represented by a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data collected,
 processed, or transmitted by government agencies, public
 institutions, or private entities. Constitutional provisions
 also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone. Following
 the restructuring of the state police as a result of a 1990
 scandal involving the unauthorized monitoring of private
 citizens by police, a new federal police law has been written
 (see Section l.c.) that will introduce parliamentary control
 over the state police and the military secret service on a
 permanent basis. Separate parliamentary subcommittees will
 have authority for these organs.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and multifaceted
 press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public safety. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected. Austria's well-
 established democratic political system, its active and
 independent press, and its effective judiciary combine to
 assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 Austrian radio and television are government monopolies, but
 are also multifaceted. There have been no complaints of subtle
 or direct attempts at censorship. Cable television is widely
 available, allowing Austrians access to broadcasts from the
 United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, among others.
 Austrians also listen to private radio broadcasts from other
 European countries.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Public demonstrations require a permit from the
 police authorities, who may consider only the public safety
 aspect of the proposed demonstration and not its political
 purpose. Permits are routinely issued.
 The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 makes an exception to freedom
 of association in the case of Nazi organizations and activities.
 The Constitutional Law of 1945, amended in 1947, also prohibits
 Nazi organizations and activities. The law on the formation of
 associations stipulates that permission to form an association
 may be denied if it is apparent that the organization will
 pursue the illegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is provided for in the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, wnich also is a constitutional provision,
 restricts this freedom to the practice of religionc that are
 compatible with public safety and morality. In order to qualify
 as a recognized religious organization under Austrian law,
 religious groups register with the Government. Although 88
 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, most of the world's
 major religions are represented.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement within
 the country or the right to change residence or workplace.
 Austrian residents are free to travel abroad and to emigrate.
 Citizens who have left the country have the right to return.
 As a result of the democratization process in Eastern Europe,
 Austria's traditional role as a country of asylum for refugees
 has changed. As political refugees from Eastern European
 countries have been replaced by economically motivated
 imigrants seeking work, the Austrian Government has taken
 measures to stem the flow. These have included introducing
 visa requirements for Romanians and Poles (the visa requirement
 for Poles was lifted on September 1) and the use of the armed
 forces at the frontier with Hungary to prevent illegal
 immigrants from Romania from entering Austria. During the
 summer and fall of 1991, several thousand Yugoslavs fled to
 Austria as a result of civil war in their country.
 Between January and August 1991, 16,500 persons applied for
 asylum in Austria, an increase of 420 over the same period in
 1990. By the end of 1991, this number had reached 27,000.
 Because of increasingly restrictive asylum policies, in 1991
 the Austrian media and human rights groups, along with the
 office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in
 Vienna, repeatedly warned that Austrian authorities are in many
 cases violating the right to apply for asylum, the right of
 asylum seekers to reside, while their applications are pending,
 in the country where they filed their application, and their
 right to care and maintenance while their applications are
 processed.
 Reliable reports indicate that more than 100,000 persons were
 prevented from entering Austria or were forced to leave the
 country (generally by expulsion at. the original point of entry)
 in 1991, a substantial number of whom may have qualified for
 
 
 1055
 
 AUSTRIA
 refugee status. In the spring of 1991, the Interior Ministry
 ordered that, as of April, refugee applicants from Romania or
 Bulgaria-who form the great bulk of asylum seekers-no longer
 be taken into federal care since "political persecution no
 longer exists" in these countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary system.
 Under the Constitution, national elections must be held at
 least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly draw
 high levels of participation. There is universal suffrage for
 those over 19 years of age.
 The national elections of 1990 resulted in the continuation of
 a coalition government composed of the two largest political
 parties. No party won an absolute majority. The Social
 Democratic Party,-which won 80 seats in Parliament, went into
 coalition with the People's Party, which won 60 seats. Two
 other parties are represented in Parliament: the liberal/
 nationalist Freedom Party won 33 seats, and the Greens won 10.
 Several small parties participating in the elections, including
 the Communist Party, did not receive sufficient support to
 elect candidates to the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the
 authorities are discussed and investigated by the press, public
 groups, and private individuals without government hindrance.
 Both international and local human rights groups operate freely.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg for enforcing the European Convention
 on Human Rights. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters, especially the human rights
 situation in Eastern Europe.,
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits of
 which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. In employment and in other areas, there is legal
 protection against discrimination because of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. In practice, there is no
 pattern of such discrimination.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been abolished.
 Women are entering the work force in increasing numbers and
 have made substantial progress toward economic equality in the
 postwar.era. Nevertheless, in practice, inequality still
 exists in political, economic, and social fields, where women
 are generally underrepresented.
 The number of reported rapes in Austria has risen significantly
 over the past 3 years. While 336 charges were filed in 1988,
 the number rose to 533 in 1990. In response, police
 authorities have issued information brochures on how women can
 better protect themselves against rape. In 1989 the Government
 passed a law making spousal rape a criminal offense and
 providing an expedited procedure for barring husbands from
 
 
 1056
 AUSTRIA
 their homes for 3 months when they had threatened their wives
 with violence. The latter procedure is available even in the
 absence of a divorce action, a significant change from previous
 law. There has been no significant expression of concern by
 women's groups about the issue since passage of the law.
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are fully respected.
 While the subject of Slovene-language instruction for the
 Slovene minority in Carinthia has been an issue in past years,
 this question has largely been resolved through the
 establishment of such language courses. Occasional calls are
 still made for extending these rights, by, for example, setting
 up bilingual village signs in Carinthia.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form and join unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization. This right is protected
 under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice, Austrian trade unions have an
 important and independent voice in the political, social, and
 economic life of the country.
 In 1991, 60 percent of the work force was organized in 15
 national unions, each of which is a member of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organization has a strong,
 centralized leadership structure. Individual unions and ATUF
 are independent of government or political party control,
 although there are formal factions within these organizations
 that are closely allied with political parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly guaranteed by
 the Constitution, it is universally recognized as a right of
 the workers. Strikes in the postwar period have been
 comparatively few and usually of short duration. There were
 three strikes in 1991 (by the Printers' Union, the Media Union,
 and the Public Employees Union). High on the list of reasons
 for Austria's record of labor peace is the system of "social
 partnership"--Austria's nearly unique unofficial forum for
 cooperation among labor, management, and government. At the
 center of the system is a Joint Parity Commission for wages and
 prices, chaired normally by the Federal Chancellor, which has
 an important voice on major economic questions.
 The ATUF and its members have affiliations with all three world
 labor federations.
 b.   The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 The labor movement enjoys widespread acceptance and almost all
 large companies, private and state owned, are strongly
 organized. Worker councils representing all workers in a unit
 operate at the enterprise level, and workers are entitled by
 law to elect one-third of the members of the boards of major
 companies. Collective agreements are negotiated by the ATUF on
 behalf of its member unions with the National Chamber of
 Commerce and its associations, representing the employers
 within a framework of wage-price policy guidelines set by the
 Joint Parity Commission. A 1973 law imposes on employers the
 obligation to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by
 antiunion discrimination. The Committee of Experts of the
 International Labor Organization reiterated in 1991 its earlier
 
 
 1057
 AUSTRIA
 requests that the Government take the necessary measures to
 protect workers in enterprises with fewer than five employees
 against acts of antiunion discrimination and bring its
 legislation into conformity with ILO Convention 98 on the right
 to organize and collective bargaining.
 Workers are further protected by membership in the Austrian
 Chambers of Labor, to which all employees except civil servants
 belong. These Chambers fulfill several functions that are
 handled-by trade unions in other countries, such as carrying
 out studies and preparing legislative proposals. As of
 September, the Chambers are also obliged to provide free legal
 assistance, including a lawyer, to any employee requesting it..
 Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees
 regarding job-related matters are handled by a special
 arbitration court for social affairs. The ATUF is exclusively
 responsible for collective bargaining. The leaderships of both
 the Chambers and the ATUF are elected democratically. Austria
 has no export processing zones.
 c.   Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 15. The law is effectively
 enforced by the labor inspectorate of the Ministry for Social
 Affairs. Compulsory school education in Austria comprises ages
 6 through 14,. and virtually all school-aged children attend.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated national minimum wage in Austria.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set
 minimum wage rates by job classification for each industry. A
 worker whose annual income falls below the established poverty
 line is eligible to receive'social welfare benefits. The
 average Austrian has a high standard of living, and even
 workers at the low end of the wage scale have a relatively
 decent minimum standard. Although the legal workweek has been
 established at 40 hours since 1975, more than 50 percent of the
 labor force is covered under collective bargaining agreements
 setting a maximum workweek at 38 or 38.5 hours.
 Austria has enacted extensive legislation setting occupational
 health and safety standards, under which a labor inspectorate
 attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs conducts inspections,
 and it ensures the effective protection of workers in these
 areas. Inspectors have the authority to "tag" an observed
 safety or health risk without a court order, an action that
 effectively shuts down the affected machinery or process until
 it comes into line with mandated safety standards. Workers may
 file complaints anonymously with the labor inspectorate, and
 the inspectorate may bring suit against the employer on behalf
 of the employee. In practice, this option- is rarely exercised;
 workers normally rely instead on the Chamber of Labor, which
 files suits on their behalf.
