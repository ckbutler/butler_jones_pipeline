 India, a secular republic, is the world's largest democracy.
 Its multiparty political structure is a composite of Indian
 political traditions and aspects of the British parliamentary
 system. Free elections are held regularly at national and
 state levels. National elections held the last week of
 November resulted in the replacement of the former Congress
 (I) Government with a minority National Front Government
 supported from outside by rightwing and leftwing parties.
 Prime Minister V.P. Singh's National Front holds 26 percent of
 seats in the Lok Sabha (lower house) against 36 percent held
 by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) party.
 The National Front holds 17 percent of the seats in the Rajya
 Sabha (upper house) against 56 percent held by Congress (I).
 Congress (I) still controls the legislatures of 14 of the 25
 states and participates in the ruling coalition of 2 more.
 The National Front controls the legislatures of 4 states.
 State Assembly elections in 10 states are due in early 1990.
 By the end of 1989, "President's rule" (direct rule from New
 Delhi) was in force only in the state of Punjab.
 The internal security apparatus includes both national and
 state-controlled paramilitary and police forces. While the 25
 states have the primary role in m~intaining law and order, the
 central Government has responsibility for protecting the
 fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, both in
 law and practice. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs
 controls the nationwide Indian Police Force, the paramilitary
 forces, and the intelligence bureaus. The state governments
 control their own police forces, the provincial armed
 constabularies, and some specialized police forces. Over the
 past four decades since India's independence, control of law
 and order operations has moved increasingly under the Home
 Ministry. This tendency stems in part from the rapid growth
 of the intelligence bureaus, which function with little
 reference to the state governments, and in part from the
 increased use of paramilitary forces against armed radicals in
 disturbed areas. These forces are deployed in the northeast
 states, Punjab, and Kashmir.
 In India's mixed economy, agriculture, nonfinancial services,
 consumer-goods manufacture, and some heavy industry are
 private. The states or the central Government own and run
 banking and insurance, air and rail transport, public
 utilities, and key heavy industries. Regulation of private
 economic activity is being relaxed, but resource and balance
 of payments constraints pose problems for rapid deregulation.
 India's 800 million population is growing at over 2 percent
 annually. According to a 1989 United Nations Children's Fund
 report, 40 percent of the urban population and 51 percent of
 the rural population live below the poverty'leVel.
 Positive human rights developments during the year included
 the release of most Golden Temple detainees from Jodhpur jail;
 the release of a number of prominent Sikh political figures
 who had been held in detention for several years without
 trial; the lifting of restrictions on travel by foreigners to
 Punjab; the peaceful holding of national elections in Punjab;
 and the initiation of negotiations between Bodo revolutionaries
 and the Government. At year's end, the new Government
 initiated several positive human rights measures that
 demonstrated a willingness to seek a negotiated solution to
 the Punjab crisis. India is a basically democratic polity
 with strong and legally sanctioned safeguards for individuals,
 a vigorous free press, and action-oriented voluntary
 
 
 1382
 organizations. Nonetheless, significant human rights abuses,
 many of them generated by severe social tensions (including
 casteism and often violent ethnic, sectarian, linguistic, or
 tribal communal politics), remained. The severity of human
 rights problems varied considerably from state to state.
 Problem areas included: extrajudicial "encounter" killings by
 the police (see Section l.a.), particularly in Punjab and
 Andhra Pradesh; incommunicado detention for prolonged periods
 without charge under antiterrorist laws; torture and deaths of
 suspects in police custody; lack of prosecution of police
 accused-of abusing and raping detainees; uneven implementation
 of laws affecting women's rights; the increase of "dowry
 deaths" (wife murder); the significant exploitation of
 indentured and child labor; separatist terrorism in Punjab and
 Kashinir; and unchecked intercaste and communal violence,
 notably in Bihar.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government does not condone political killing, and
 stringent law and order policies were pursued, particularly in
 the states of Punjab and Kashmir and in the northeast, to curb
 political or communal violence. On the other hand, local
 political leaders in various parts of India were often
 involved openly in communal or caste-related violence that
 resulted in killings.
 Law and order in the Indian system is primarily each state's
 responsibility. The willingness of authorities to institute
 judicial proceedings in cases of politically related violence
 and the evenhandedness of the police, however, vary from state
 to state. While the Government enhanced law and order
 measures in some areas in the face of violent radicals or
 communal tensions, human rights groups in India continued to
 attribute political and extrajudicial killings to the
 suppression of legal safeguards contained in security laws and
 the failure to institute criminal proceedings against police
 personnel accused of misdeeds. Critics have accused the
 police throughout India, particularly in the northeast, Andhra
 Pradesh, and Punjab, of staging fake "encounters" with
 terrorists to cover up deaths in detention and of wrongly
 attributing causes of deaths of persons in police custody.
 Such killings are so widespread that the Human Rights Watch
 and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, in a report issued
 in 1989, characterized them as constituting a "pattern of
 extrajudicial killings." No security officials, as far as can
 be ascertained, were convicted of "encounter" killings or
 deaths in custody during 1989.
 Punjab remained the most intractable of India's ethnic
 regional problems. While complete government statistics are
 unavailable, the press reported fewer deaths by separatist
 terrorists in Punjab in 1989 than the previous year; human
 rights observers, however, believe the figures may in fact be
 higher than the 1988 figures. Press statistics compiled from
 January to late September show 1,255 deaths by terrorist
 violence, 595 terrorists killed, and 1,584 arrested. In
 addition, 89 security force deaths were recorded. The
 Government reported that, in the 6 months ending June 1989,
 564 persons had been killed as a result of terrorist violence,
 
 
 1383
 336 terrorists killed, and 1,593 arrested. Most central
 security forces in Punjab are non-Sikhs; the majority of state
 police are Sikhs, as are the militants. Most victims of the
 violence are unarmed Sikhs, although a number of Hindu
 civilians have also been caught in crossfire.
 In the 6 weeks following the January 6 execution by hanging of
 Kehar Singh, convicted of conspiring to assassinate Indira
 Gandhi, 169 persons were killed in Punjab, including 12
 persons hanged to death by terrorists, according to a
 government statement. Prominent politicians killed by
 terrorists in 1989 include Rajinder Kaur, the leading woman
 political figure in Punjab. In June terrorists shot and
 killed 19 members of a militant Hindu group who were meeting
 at a park in the Faridkot district. Two security personnel
 were killed in a subsequent bomb explosion at the site.
 In Punjab, separating deaths caused by politically-motivated
 terrorists from deaths as a result of common crime is
 difficult, because neither the press nor the Government makes
 a careful distinction between the two. Police at the local
 level have been accused by critics of subsuming common-crime
 under terrorist crime to avoid or delay investigations of
 police actions. The Government publicly admitted that police
 officials in the most terrorist-prone districts have been
 heavyhanded.
 The Government announced it was taking steps to prosecute
 those involved in the anti-Sikh riots centered in New Delhi
 that followed Mrs. Gandhi's assassination in October 1984, in
 which an estimated 3,000 persons died. Formal charges were
 filed against 2,300 persons in 225 cases. More than half of
 these cases remain before the courts. In the 11 cases
 decided, 80 persons were sentenced to prison, 6 for life.
 Critics charge, however, that the principal instigators of the
 riots are protected from prosecution by their high political
 office and that none of those arrested were major figures in
 the anti-Sikh rioting.
 Political militancy in India's only Muslim majority state,
 Kashmir, rose markedly in 1989. In mid-1989, two major
 terrorist organizations, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation
 Front (JKLF) and the People's League, began killing moderate
 politicians, including three major political figures. In
 December the JKLF kidnaped the medical-student daughter of the
 new Home Minister and only released her when five jailed
 Kashmiri militants were released in exchange. Terrorists also
 stepped up use of bombs in public places. The militants'
 grievances had both political and economic roots. Augmented
 powers given to the police aimed at controlling the violence
 appeared instead to escalate it. In August paramilitary
 troops entered the Jama Masjid, Srinigar's largest mosque,
 after they were allegedly shot at by militants who fled into
 the mosque complex. According to journalists, four people
 were killed in the shooting that ensued. Press reports
 indicated that about 150 of those arrested remain in
 interrogation centers. On August 27 in Leh, Kashmir state,
 police opened fire on a crowd of rock-throwing Buddhists
 agitating against the state government's administration.
 Three local people were killed and two dozen wounded.
 In the eastern state of Bihar, communal and intercaste
 killings continued, despite state deployment of paramilitary
 forces. In April in Hazaribagh, Bihar, at least 19 people
 were killed after a religious procession inflamed communal
 
 
 1384
 IND~IA
 tensions. Press reports cited Bihar police complicity in
 attacks by Hindus on Muslims. On July 18, the government of
 Bihar rejected a demand for a judicial inquiry into the
 Hazaribagh riots.
 In late October, processions of Hindu fundamentalist groups in
 Bhagalpur, Bihar, triggered communal violence that resulted in
 hundreds of casualties over the following days. Official
 figures give the death toll as 404, but press figures indicate
 over 1,000 bodies were found in Bhagalpur and 150 surrounding
 villages. For 3 days, until the Army took over, the violence
 continued while local, overwhelmingly Hindu police stood
 back. At nearby Chandeli village, nearly 100 Muslims believed
 to be under police protection disappeared overnight. Press
 sources report the villagers-were murdered by criminal
 elements and their bodies thrown into a river. At least 25
 bodies were found in the village well. In the wake of the
 killings, 35,000 persons were evacuated to relief camps. A
 citizens' group filed a writ petition in the Patna high court
 accusing the superintendent of Bhagalpur police of failing to
 use the police to protect the victims. The superintendent of
 police was transferred. The Chief Minister of Bihar announced
 on December 16 that two high court judges would run special
 courts to deal with the 500 criminal cases registered by
 victims of the Bhagalpur riots. In addition, a commission of
 inquiry has begun work to probe the killings.
 Links between politicians, criminal gangs, and landlords
 prevail in rural areas of such states as Bihar, where "senas"
 (private armies) and local police are used to resist demands
 for social and economic reform. In central Bihar and in a few
 tribal areas, some "Naxalites" (a loosely applied term for
 several leftist militant groups) joined the electoral process
 through association with the Indian People's Front (IPF).
 This contributed to a lessening of violence. The IPF won one
 seat in the Lok Sabha in the November national elections. The
 Bihar police confront a difficult situation in which political
 violence and counterviolence are commonplace. Police
 personnel implicated in excesses are rarely identified or
 brought to justice.
 In Assam, to the northeast, where ethnic and communal
 rivalries continued to fester, the United Tribal Nationalists
 Liberation Front (UTNLF) in September called for a judicial
 inquiry into the massacre of 29 tribal people at Borkajuh.
 The UTNLF claims the killings were planned by nontribal
 criminal elements in connivance with local police. The
 judicial inquiry was rejected, and the results of an official
 investigation were not released by year's end.
 Thioughout the year, violence broke out as nontribal Assamese
 encroached on Bodo tribal lands. The All Bodo Students' Union
 (ABSU), agitating for a separate state for the plains tribals
 of Assam, was accused of calculated killings of nontribals,
 including functionaries of the ruling Asom Gana Parishad. The
 ABSU dedied involvement. Strong police countermeasures
 resulted in the killing of an unknown number of Bodo
 civilians, many of whom reportedly had nothing to do with the
 agitation. No charges have been lodged in the deaths.
 Tripartite talks initiated on August 28 in New Delhi between
 the Indian Government, the ABSU, and the Assam government
 reached agreement on several issues. A panel was appointed to
 look into the grievances of the Bodos in Assam. The state
 
 
 1385
 began to release 1,500 detained Bodo militants (the ABSU
 claims 5,000 Bodo militants are in detention) and announced a
 policy of "minimum force" against the militants as a measure
 to normalize the situation. The militants have responded by
 suspending their agitation.
 Politically motivated killings showed an upward trend in West
 Bengal. The Director General of West Bengal police is
 reported to have said that almost all major political parties
 are involved in the violence.
 The largest riot in western India occurred in February in
 Bombay, Maharashtra, over Salman Rushdie's book "Satanic
 Verses." Though the Government had banned the book to avoid
 violence, young male Muslims took to the streets, destroying
 property. The police restored order at a cost of at least 12
 dead and over 100 injured. The Chief Minister and media
 commended the police for preventing further violence.
 In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, police and Naxalites
 continued to engage in violence and counterviolence. The most
 militant of the Andhra Naxalites, the People's War Group
 (PWG), escalated its attacks on rural state government
 functionaries in 1989. In June it kidnaped and subsequently
 murdered a popular official of the ruling Telegu Desam Party
 (TDP) in retaliation for the detention and disappearance of
 two PWG members. At the same time, the Andhra Civil Liberties
 Committee, a private group, accused the police and the TDP of
 staging over 200 fake "encounters" with Naxalites to cover up
 deaths in police custody. In June the state government, in an
 effort to reduce violence, declared a virtual amnesty for
 Naxalites who surrendered to state authorities. Approximately
 240 took advantage of the Government's offer, although the
 hard-core Naxalite strength remained intact.
 In Madhya Pradesh in October, a procession of about 30,000
 Muslims celebrating the birth of Mohammed turned violent,
 leaving more than 50 persons dead. The communal rioting in
 the city of Indore razed a portion of the Hindu commercial
 center and several nearby Muslim ghettos.
 b. Disappearance
 Indian law provides safeguards against disappearance by
 requiring an arrested person to be brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours of arrest. These safeguards are not always
 applied in practice. In addition, they do not apply to
 persons arrested under national security laws. The right to
 judicial determination of the legality of the detention can be
 sought from the higher courts to redress unlawful detention
 but is often unavailable to the families of poor or uneducated
 victims. Reports of disappearance in Punjab and elsewhere
 remain difficult to investigate because access to independent
 observers is severely restricted. Amnesty International (AI)
 stated in a July 1989 report, "India: Some Recent Reports of
 Disappearances," which covered 1987-88, that disappearances in
 India are frequently not reported. The report noted that
 several dozen cases remain unresolved.
 A May editorial in a national daily noted frequent reports in
 Punjab of young men being arbitrarily detained, interrogated
 under duress, and held incommunicado for weeks at a time
 without notification of relatives. The AI report on
 disappearances cited the case of tanjit Singh and Jatinder Pal
 Singh, arrested by plainclothesmen in Mohali, Punjab, in early
 
 
 1386
 INDIA
 January and subsequently seen in detention at the end of the
 month by other detainees. Police informed relatives that the
 two were not in police custody; persistent attempts to
 establish their whereabouts have yielded no information to
 date.
 In January 1989, the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or
 Involuntary Disappearance recorded it had informed the Indian
 Government of 33 cases of disappearance, many of which
 concerned the May 1987 events in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, in
 which 80 unarmed men., women, and children were killed. The
 state paid compensation to the families of 13 of the victims
 of the killings, but officials continue to deny that the
 Provincial Armed Constabulary was responsible for the deaths
 and refused to publish the findings of the official inquiry
 into the deaths and disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment or punishment are prohibited by
 law in India. Confessions or information extracted by force
 cannot, by law, be admitted in court. Significantly, however,
 under Section 15 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities
 (Prevention) Act (TADA) of 1987, a confession made to a police
 officer is admissible in evidence, provided the police have
 "reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily." The
 frequent press accounts of police brutality in obtaining
 confessions from detainees under this law have fed widespread
 charges of police excesses.
 The press and human rights groups continued in 1989 to
 document allegations of abuse of detainees by police in many
 Indian states. In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI referred
 to widespread reports of torture in India and noted that in a
 few cases the courts had granted compensation to torture
 victims. The Minister of Home Affairs reported March 9 that
 five persons had died in police custody in Delhi in the
 previous year. He said that in at least one case police
 officials, including the station house officer, were found
 responsible for causing injuries that resulted in the
 detainee's death. The case was pending trial in the court at
 year's end. He also stated 13 cases of beatings of detainees
 by police personnel in Delhi had been reported during the
 current year. In one case, a policeman was transferred to a
 nonsensitive post, and, in another, three policemen were
 placed under suspension.
 The Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights
 reported a number of lockup deaths in the state of West Bengal
 (19 in 1988). In Bihar, there were 50 such deaths in the past
 4 years. Since the majority of those allegedly killed
 belonged to poor or socially backward sections of society,
 without political affiliation, their deaths did not raise a
 public furor. Following the death in Hasnabad jail on June 3
 of an active Communist Party member under indictment, the
 officer-in-charge of the Hasnabad police station was arrested
 on charges of murder, then released on bail. By year's end,
 he had not yet been brought to trial.
 In the northeast, the police and paramilitary have been
 accused of torturing suspected radicals in Assam. Under the
 Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in force in the northeast,
 security personnel are not held accountable under civil law
 for their acts. In the state of Manipur, AI expressed concern
 
 
 1387
 INDIA
 over continuing police intimidation and torture of witnesses
 and a lawyer now involved in court hearings. The court is
 examining evidence about earlier allegations of torture and
 reprisal killings by members of the paramilitary Assam Rifles,
 who deny all allegations.
 Scheduled castes and tribes (the lowest levels of Indian
 society, listed on "schedules" to receive special protections
 and safeguards under the Indian Constitution) are particularly
 vulnerable to police violence. A report in July by the
 People's Union for Civil Liberties estimated that
 approximately 90 villages in Bastar, Madhya Pradesh, were
 raided from 1985 to May 1989 by armed police. The report
 states the tribal possessions were looted, villagers killed,
 and over 250 persons detained. There have been numerous
 allegations of the mass rape of female members of the
 scheduled castes and tribes by the police. An officer accused
 of such actions is rarely tried but more commonly is suspended
 temporarily or reassigned to another post. In May the All
 Bodo Students' Association claimed that about 100 tribal
 women, including teenage girls, were gang-raped by Assam
 police. The Bodo People's Action Committee submitted a
 complaint to the governor, but there was no official inquiry
 and no arrests.
 Press reports about prison conditions include charges of
 sexual abuse of prisoners and the use of prisoners by prison
 officials for domestic labor. At least 20,000 children and
 youngsters under 18 years old are reported to be in jail,
 comprising nearly one-eighth of the prison population.
 Although Parliament passed the Children's Law in 1960 to
 safeguard young prisoners against abuse and exploitation, most
 states have not followed suit with their own laws to implement
 it; consequently, nearly 40 percent of the 390 districts in
 India are without a children's law. The Supreme Court has
 criticized the states for not providing separate facilities
 for children in jails and for not constructing reformatory
 institutions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed
 of the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must
 either be remanded for further investigation or released.
 These provisions have been upheld by the Supreme Court and are
 generally respected.
 Despite such legal safeguards, there were continuing reports
 in 1989 of arbitrary arrest or detention. A well-known human
 rights activist, Dr. K. Balagopal, General Secretary of the
 Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committees (APCLC), was
 abducted in August by plainclothesmen, reportedly as a hostage
 for two policemen held by the People's War Group. Indian
 press reports commented that his arrest was prompted by the
 -prominent role he played in the APCLC exposure of police
 excesses. Dr. Balagopal was released several days later,
 following a public outcry. He stated he had been held by the
 Special Task police forces but was not brought before a
 magistrate or charged.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws in the event of threats to public welfare and national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 
 
 1888
 INDIA
 detention (up to 2 years) and for judicial review of such
 detention. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA).permits detention of security
 risks; police anywhere in India can charge suspects under NSA
 provisions. For a detainee to be released under this law, a
 court must determine that all grounds for detention are
 invalid. Under the NSA's strong special and preventive
 detention provisions, a person may be detained for up to one
 year without charge or trial (2 years in Punjab) on loosely
 defined security grounds, but must be brought before a Defense
 Ministry advisory board within 7 days of arrest; at this time
 the detainee may be released on the basis of "insufficient
 grounds." No official figures were available on the number of
 people in detention under NSA provisions in 1989. Human
 rights groups claim that no accurate record is kept of the
 many people held without charges, so they have no way of
 making accurate estimates of the numbers of persons in
 detention. A large number of detainees were, however,
 released in 1989.
 The TADA, though enacted to fight terrorism in Punjab, is
 applicable throughout India. Fourteen state governments
 currently have invoked the TADA. In designated areas,
 incommunicado detention is permitted pursuant to the TADA.
 The Act permits maximum detention of 2 years but also provides
 the right of review and access to legal counsel. The Home
 Minister announced that between the Act's institution in 1987
 and March 1989, 7,969 persons had been arrested under the TADA
 in Punjab. Following application of the TADA to Gujarat in
 1987, 4,491. people were arrested under the Act through June
 1989-. As with the NSA, .accurate estimates for all detentions
 under the TADA are not available.
 In early March, the Prime Minister proposed a special package
 of measures to help normalize the political situation in nine
 districts of Punjab. The package included the release of the
 187 remaining detainees held in Jodhpur jail since 1984 on
 charges of waging war against the State. Seventy-eight were
 subsequently rearrested on criminal charges; 4 remained in
 jail at the end of 1989. In addition, the Government
 announced the withdrawal with respect to the nondisturbed
 areas of Punjab of the special detention provisions of the
 National Security Act and the removal of restrictions on
 travel by foreigners to the region. Before leaving office,
 Gandhi ordered all charges to be dropped against S.S. Mann and
 three others accused of conspiracy in the assassination of
 former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. (Mann had spent 5 years
 in detention awaiting legal action on earlier charges of
 subversive activities.) At the same time, former Punjab Chief
 Minister P.S. Badal and the president of a major Sikh
 political-religious organization, G.S. Tolira, were also
 released after several years in detention. In one of his
 first acts after taking office, Prime Minister V.P. Singh paid
 an informal visit to the Sikh Golden Temple in Amritsar along
 with senior members of his Cabinet to indicate that resolving
 Punjab tensions is a high priority for the new Government. He
 followed up with an all-party meeting of leaders across the
 political spectrum aimed at shaping a national consensus for a
 political solution to the Punjab situation.
 The Lok Sabha of the Parliament voted on December 28 to repeal
 the controversial 59th Amendment to the Constitution. The
 opposition voted with the Government, and Raja Sabha approval
 is likely to follow quickly. The amendment had annulled the
 
 
 1389
 INDIA
 Constitution's guarantees of the right to life and liberty
 during an emergency and permitted President's rule in any
 state for up to 3 years without prior parliamentary approval.
 Exile is not practiced as a punishment in India.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial in
 most cases but allows the judiciary, under certain
 circumstances, to hold closed proceedings. Such circumstances
 include pruceedings involving official secrets, trials in
 which statements prejudicial to the safety of the State might
 be made, or trials under provisions of national security
 legislation such as the TADA. Sentences must, however, be
 announced in public.
 India's legal procedures generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor.
 Defendants have the right to choose counsel from an Indian bar
 that is fully independent of the Government. The Indian bar
 has a record of vigorously protesting infringements of human
 rights. Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of the
 judicial system.
 The judiciary is independent from the executive branch.
 Judges are selected by the Law Ministry following
 consultations with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
 Some aspects of personal law, such as marriage, divorce,
 succession, and child custody, are regulated by the
 traditional laws and practices of the Hindu, Muslim, Parsi
 (Zoroastrian), Christian, and Jewish religions. The
 Government's declared policy is not to interfere in the
 personal laws, particularly of the minority communities, with
 the effect that discriminatory personal laws, often against
 women, are upheld.
 The Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act of
 Parliament (TAAA) permits the establishment of special courts
 sitting in camera and allows the identity of witnesses
 testifying before a special court to be kept secret. Under an
 unusual provision of the TAAA, a defendant charged with
 "waging war" carries the burden of proving his innocence.
 Civil rights groups charge that these special rules are
 contrary to the presumption of innocence customary in Indian
 law.
 In 1989 the judicial authorities in Punjab failed to bring to
 trial a number of alleged terrorists who had been charged, as
 well as some police offenders. As justification for continued
 detention, Government officials claim they are unable to find
 witnesses to testify against terrorists.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches
 and seizures. In a criminal investigation, police may conduct
 searches without a warrant if obtaining a warrant would cause
 undue delay, but they must justify such searches in writing.
 Under the Disturbed Areas legislation, the authorities
 continue to have special powers in Punjab to search and arrest
 without a warrant and to shoot to kill under certain
 circumstances. They have also been granted a significant
 
 
 1390
 INDIIA
 expansion of telephone surveillance powers.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping of
 telephones and intercepting personal mail without judicial
 warrant, is authorized under the Indian Telegraph Act "on the
 occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of the
 public safety or tranquillity." These powers have been used
 by every state government, generally in a low-key manner and
 specifically, rather than generally, targeted. The Postal
 (Amendment) Bill, passed by Parliament but never signed into
 law, empowers the Government to censor mail in certain
 circumstances, such as in a public emergency. At year's end,
 the new Government promised to withdraw the Postal Bill.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and expression are protected by the Constitution,
 and newspapers vigorously reflect a variety of public, social,
 and economic beliefs. -The Government controls the allocation
 of newsprint and the placement of Government and public sector
 advertisements, however, and has been accused of using these
 means to exert influence over the press. National television
 and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the
 Government. At year's end, the Government announced it will
 introduce legislation to give statutory autonomy to radio and
 television.k
 Under the Official Secrets Act, the Government can restrict
 publication of the most sensitive security stories. Several
 major national publications regularly publish investigative
 reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a-whole champions human rights causes and criticizes
 perceived government lapses. At year's end, the Government
 said it will amend the Official Secrets Act to give people
 greater access to information.
 An.event widely perceived as threatening press freedom was the
 Kashmir government's effort in August to enact the "Special
 Powers (Press) Bill, 1989." Concerned about growing violence
 and press coverage of terrorists, the state government claimed
 that the bill was necessary to prevent the press from
 publishing secessionist writing in the state. The bi]l would
 give power to the state assembly "to regulate and control
 printing and publication of certain materials in the interest
 of public order and the security of the State," with penalties
 of up to 1 year in prison and stiff fines. The bill was
 passed by the State Assembly in August, but action by the
 second house, the State Legislative Council, was deferred
 following strong public criticism. The proposal was referred
 ultimately to the Press Council for its recommendations. In
 October the state government withdrew the bill, accepting the
 Council's view that the government had sufficient powers to
 deal with cases of objectionable writing.
 Journalists in Bihar have had a running feud with the local
 police, whose misdeeds they attempted to bring into the open.
 In July the Dhanbad police allegedly beat up members of the
 press after charging them with offenses ranging up to
 "attempted murder." The journalists were produced handcuffed
 in court, and those sent for medical treatment were shackled
 to their hospital beds. All were subsequently release by
 order of the Bihar Chief Minister. A 2-day bandh (strike)
 
 
 1391
 INDIA
 organized in August in protest succeeded in focusing public
 attention on police ill-treatment of the journalists.
 In Punjab there have been occasional reports of journalists
 being harassed and intimidated by terrorists, local leaders,
 and special interest groups. Several vendors of the Hind
 Samachar group of publications were killed by terrorists who
 objected to the group's editorial policies which condemned
 extremism.
 Films are reviewed by the film censorship board before being
 licensed for distribution. The board deletes material deemed
 offensive to either public morals or religious or communal
 sentiment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations. These rights are respected.
 Government authorities sometimes require permits and
 notification prior to permitting parades and demonstrations.
 At times of civil tension, local governments can ban public
 assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily, local governments
 respect the right to protest peacefully, including such
 traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which an
 official or his office is surrounded by protesters who allow
 no movement, and sitdowns blocking public thoroughfare.
 In Sukinda Valley, Orissa, mine workers of the largest chrome
 ore deposit in Asia have alleged police harassment of their
 peaceful protests against mechanization. AI has expressed
 concern with regard to the situation of those workers.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India remains a religious mixing bowl, with all faiths
 enjoying freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor
 any religious group. Nevertheless, communal tensions over
 religious differences continue to be a social problem and pose
 challenges to the secular nature of the Indian polity. For
 example, the Bombay-based Shiv Sena has made militant Hinduism
 its only political plank.
 There is no bar to proselytizing by Indian Christians, but the
 Government limits the number of foreign missionaries and laws
 in some states discourage them from openly proselytizing. In
 Bihar, confrontations have persisted between Christian
 missionaries and Hindu fundamentalists. Indian religious
 organizations may maintain communications with coreligionists
 abroad. Financial contributions from abroad are subject to
 scrutiny and licensing by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 Despite laws in various states removing obstructions to the
 exercise of religious freedom, Harijans (the lowest, formerly
 "untouchable," level of Indian society) are still prevented
 from entering Hindu temples in some areas.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Ordinance
 makes it an offense to use any religious site for political
 purposes or the use of temples for harboring persons accused
 or convicted of any crime. While specifically designed to
 deal with Sikh places of worship in the Punjab, the ordinance
 
 
 1392
 technically applies to all religious sites. In general, the
 Government has been careful to avoid placing restrictions on
 Sikh religious practices or on the management of Sikh places
 of worship.
 A full bench of the high court in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, has
 been called to decide five suits relating to the Ram
 Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, which centers on whether
 Hindus can build a temple on a sacred site where a Muslim
 mosque now stands. Court proceedings over who rightfully
 controls the disputed site were continuing at year's end.
 Prime Minister V.P. Singh placed a settlement, either judicial
 or negotiated, as one of his Government's highest priorities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the
 country, except in certain border areas where, for security
 reasons, special permits are required. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. Millions of
 people of Indian origin live abroad. Foreigners (including
 diplomats) must obtain special permission to visit Assam and
 other sensitive border areas. In March Prime Minister Gandhi
 reopened. Punjab to foreigners in general. (It had previously
 been open to accredited foreign journalists.)
 India admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons at
 the time of partition in 1947 and granted them citizenship,
 integrating them fully into Indian society. Subsequent
 migration to India has largely been the result of upheavals in
 nearby countries, and some of the refugees in these migrations
 have not been granted citizenship or fully integrated. In
 some cases, both the refugees and their hosts consider their
 stay temporary, although it may be for a long time.
 The most recent migrations have been of Chakmas and other
 tribals and nontribals from Bangladesh (estimated at about
 70,000 by the Government) into the northeastern states,
 especially Tripura, and Tamils from Sri Lanka into Tamil
 Nadu. Chakmas who have been offered.the opportunity to return
 to Bangladesh have generally chosen not to do so, despite
 reports of scarce resources in the camps located in Tripura.
 Elsewhere in the northeast, the Assam state government is
 committed to identifying "foreigners" who have entered that
 state from neighboring Bangladesh with a view towards
 repatriating them, though to date it has forced few to leave.
 Tamils from Sri Lanka in Tamil Nadu are provided shelter and
 subsistence by the Government. The 1987 accord between India
 and Sri Lanka, aimed at settling the Sri Lankan ethnic
 conflict, calls for repatriation of these refugees. Under the
 repatriation scheme, some 40,000 refugees were returned to Sri
 Lanka by 1989; another 12,000 are estimated to have returned
 on their own. Over 80,000 are still in India, however,
 accordihg to the Minister of State for Home Affairs. There
 are reports of a renewed flight of some Tamils to India now
 that agreement has been reached for a staged total withdrawal
 of the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) from northeast Sri
 Lanka. These Tamils fear that disorder will follow the
 departure of the IPKF.
 Several thousand Afghans have entered India since the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Many have been resettled
 elsewhere, outside India. In 1989 the refugee population more
 
 
 1393
 INiDIA
 than doubled when fears of war in Kabul impelled Afghans to
 leave for India after the Soviet withdrawal. About 5,000
 currently are being protected and assisted by the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 In addition, nearly 2,000 Iranian refugees are under the
 UNHCR's protection. Many were studying in India when the
 Iranian revolution came in 1979, but most had either arrived
 from Iran on tourist visas or.fled on fraudulent documents to
 join Zoroastrian, Bahali, or Christian communities in India.
 Although India is not a signatory to the U.N. Convention and
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Government
 allows the UNHCR to operate normally, grants the refugees
 renewable residence permits, and otherwise behaves as a
 signatory.
 India continues to provide humanitarian assistance and
 protection to the large Tibetan refugee communities in
 Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and elsewhere -in India, whose
 members number in excess of 90,000.
 There are reports that the Government, after initially
 offering sanctuary to Burmese students fleeing the political
 turmoil in Burma in 1988, may have subsequently deported some
 of the refugees. Many have returned voluntarily, but the
 border is porous and access to the border area is restricted,
 making it difficult for observers to assess the present
 situation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India is governed under a complicated but democratic
 parliamentary system. The Constitution provides for full
 adult suffrage; the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in
 1989. Elections are held regularly, involving multiple
 parties. A parliament can be constituted for not more than 5
 years, except under constitutionally defined emergency
 situations.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President can declare
 President's rule, or a state of emergency, in any state in the
 event of war, external oppression, internal disruption, or
 collapse of the constitutional machinery in the state. Under
 President's rule, the central Government, through the
 Parliament and the President, directly administers the state
 by replacing the elected state government with an appointed
 governor. President's rule is for 6 months and must give way
 to new elections, unless it is extended by Parliament for an
 additional 6 months. In 1989 Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, and
 Nagaland held state elections and are no longer under central
 control. In August the Government declared President's rule
 in Karnataka, where the ruling opposition party lost a
 significant part of its support in the state assembly; central
 control ended following state elections held in November.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The central Government, while tolerant of dissent within
 India, is sensitive to international allegations of human
 rights violations. India's ambassador to the United States
 stated in May that, "as a sovereign and democratic nation,
 India cannot permit investigations by foreign governments or
 
 
 1394
 organizations into any aspect of her domestic affairs."
 Despite the reopening of Punjab to foreigners, AI
 representatives continue to be denied permission to
 investigate human rights problems there. In September India
 invited a U.S. congressional delegation to, visit Punjab for
 first-hand information on human rights.
 In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI said that it had
 informed the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Special
 Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions of its concerns
 regarding India and that its reports were also submitted to
 the Indian Government but that it had not replied. The Indian
 Government stated in March that it was examining Al's report
 on human rights violations in Bihar; various incidents.of
 alle~ed human rights violations were being investigated, and
 appropriate action has been taken by the law enforcement
 agencies, according to the Government spokesman. Also in
 March, then Minister of State for External Affairs Natwar
 Singh reacted publicly to the State Department's 1988 Human
 Rights Report on India to the U.S. Congress, stating that the
 Government does not accept the veracity of all the Report's
 findings.
 Independent Indian human rights organizations are active and
 vocal. They include Citizens for Democracy, the People's
 Union for Civil Liberties, the People's Union for Democratic
 Rights, and the Indian People's Human Rights Commission, all
 of which send out teams to study specific allegations of human
 rights abuses and publish reports on their findings.
 India is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. It
 will host the World Congress on Human Rights in April 1990,
 the first time the conference will be held in Asia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Several provisions in the Constitution promise equality before
 the law and prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender.
 Legally sanctioned gender discrimination is manifested,
 however, in various family, marriage, and inheritance laws.
 In reqent years, severpl changes have been made in personal,
 criminal, and labor laws governing women, including the Dowry
 Prohibition Act, the Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of
 Immoral Traffic Act, and the Sati (Prevention) Act Deeply
 rooted traditions, often tied to religious or social practice,
 mean, however, that these laws are unevenly enforced (more
 enforced in urban areas, less in the countryside). An
 estimated 80 percent of India's women for whom these laws are
 designed live and work in the rural areas. According to a
 government-sponsored report by the National Commission on
 Self-employed Women ("Shramshakti"), most rural women are
 employed as agricultural labor in the unorganized sector,
 where they are vulnerable to exploitation. Traditional
 practices relating to-asset and land ownership give women
 little 6ontrol over land use, retention, or sale. The Hindu
 Succession Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu
 women, although in practice married daughters are not always
 given a share in parental property. Inheritance rights for
 Muslim women are regulated by traditional Islamic law, which
 provide less than what a male heir would receive; in practice,
 women seldom get even that portion. Under the tribal land
 system, notably in Bihar, tribal women do not have the right
 to own land; the practice of putting women to death there as
 "witches" is closely linked to the denial of property rights.
 
 
 1395
 Female bondage, forced prostitution, child marriage, and
 relative neglect of female children still remain common in
 parts of Indian society.
 The Government has under consideration a draft National
 Perspectives Plan for Women whose main objectives would be to
 remove gender bias in the law. Among other proposals, it
 suggests more emphasis on the training of women and includes
 recommendations on matrimonial property issues.
 Women's rights groups point out that the burden of providing
 an adequate dowry for girls is a factor in making female
 births less desirable to the parents. There is some evidence
 that female infanticide may be practiced in some sectors of
 the society. Health care and nutrition for female infants
 tends to be of a lower priority than for boys. The marked
 disparity between the lower mortality rates of male versus
 female infants in the 0-5 age group has resulted in the
 unusually low ratio in the Indian population of 933 females
 per 1,000 males (the ratio varies considerably among the
 states).
 An Indian government study shows that violence against women,
 including molestation, rape, kidnaping, and wife murder, has
 followed an upward trend in the past decade. This may be due,
 in part, to growing consciousness by women of their legal
 rights so that more report crime. The claim that dowry deaths
 (usually by burning) of young married women result from their
 inability to meet their husbands' families' property demands
 has been challenged by women's rights groups, who state that
 insufficient dowry is often used as an excuse for societally
 condoned violence against married women. Dowry crimes are a
 complex issue involving attitudes of parents to daughters, the
 social and economic status of women, defects in the law, and
 the failure of police to implement existing law. Figures
 given in the lower house of Parliament in July 1989 indicate
 that between 1986 and 1988, registered cases of dowry deaths
 nearly doubled, from 1,319 to 2,152, despite the strengthening
 of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The actual total may be
 substantially higher as much domestic violence goes unreported
 or is not registered by the police, according to women's
 groups. By law, every unnatural death of a woman which occurs
 in the first 7 years of marriage must be investigated by the
 police and a magistrate. However, a member of the Indian
 police on the Union-Public Service Commission stated in March
 that about 95 percent of registered cases of dowry death end
 in acquittal as corrupt police and medical officers tamper
 with crucial evidence.
 The "Shamshakti" report notes that 94 percent of Indian women
 work in the unorganized sector, not controlled by labor laws.'
 In spite of a statutory minimum wage fixed in each state,
 contractors set their own lower wage when employing women.
 This is so even though one-third of all households are
 supported solely by women, while in another third, they make
 50 percent of the financial contribution. The report points
 out that even those women covered by labor laws are not
 adequately protected because the laws are unevenly enforced.
 About 150 women's organizations in India are active in working
 for social justice and economic advancement of women and in
 linking women's problems to larger social concerns.
 The Government has initiated programs to improve the lot of
 the lower-caste Hindus who make up 15 percent of the
 
 
 1396
 population and the tribal minorities who constitute a further
 7 percent. The reservation system, whereby lower castes
 ("scheduled castes," "scheduled tribes," and "other backward
 communities") are offered preference in areas of employment
 and admission to educational institutions, attempts to
 strengthen the legal protection accorded to these
 underprivileged and often victimized groups. The system has
 met with limited success. The overall literacy rate among .
 scheduled castes and tribes is 21 percent. The literacy rate
 among scheduled caste women is much lower; in some regions it
 is estimated at less than 2 percent.
 In some cases, higher-caste communities have mobilized against
 policies of reserving jobs and other privileges for the
 disadvantaged, with violence sometimes resulting. Political
 controversy surrounds the question of whether lower castes,
 tribes, and classes should be given preference in education,
 employment, and housing when the program is perceived as
 threatening the economic position of higher-caste groups. In
 several states, the system of reservations for disadvantaged
 groups is manipulated for political gain by local party
 leaders; preference is sometimes given illegally to persons
 who are not disadvantaged.
 The number of crimes reported against Harijans and tribals was
 recorded up to 1986 at an annual rate of 15,000 a'year,
 although this figure is low, as most such crimes go
 unreported. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
 (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, adds to the 1976 Civil
 Rights Protection Act by specifying a new range of offenses
 and by providing stiffer sanctions and special courts. The
 Act obligates all states to-take actions to prevent atrocities
 and to restore the feeling of security among the scheduled
 groups. Such humiliating actions as forced feeding of
 obnoxious matter, public parading-of unclothed victims,
 forcible eviction from abodes, and denial of access to public
 places now legally constitute atrocities punishable by a jail
 sentence of up to 5 years. Economic offenses such as bonded
 labor and dispossession of lands are also criminalized.
 Assault against women in the scheduled groups is an offense,
 as is use of foTce to affect voting behavior. Special courts
 are empowered to try cases under the new act.
 Notwithstanding legal provisions for their welfare and
 protection, tribal people are frequently uprooted from forests
 to make way for various development projects, e.g., dam
 building, or following flooding, and are not provided with
 proper recovery assistance.
 Minority religious groups continue to charge that they are
 victims of discrimination. Terrorist actions have increased
 violence and distrust between Hindu and Sikh communities in
 Punjab. Although they are treated equally under the law,
 Sikhs, particularly young males, continue to be subjected to
 more rigorous security precautions than others in certain
 circumstances.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Indian workers have the full constitutional right of
 association as defined by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO). Indian workers are guaranteed the right to form and
 join unions of their own choosing, including in export
 
 
 1397
 IND~IA
 processing zones. Trade unions have the legally protected
 right to strike. Unions represent less than 25 percent of the
 total of industrial workers. Most Indian workers (estimated
 at over 70 percent) are in the agricultural sector,
 traditionally unorganized, although recently trade unions have
 begun organizing efforts in that sector as well. Indian trade
 unions are independent of the Government. Most trade unions
 have some form of ties to a political party, national or
 local. Nevertheless, trade unions are usually adamant about
 preserving their formal independence from political parties,
 and in practice they have been known to differ from their
 respective political parties on labor-related issues. Major
 trade union organizations are affiliated with recognized
 international confederations, such as the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Workers enjoy the right to strike in principle but, under the
 Essential Services Maintenance Act, the Government can ban
 strikes and require conciliation or arbitration in specified
 essential industries. Legal mechanisms exist for challenging
 the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope of
 this act. The only major industrial strike in 1989 was
 conducted by the port and dock workers. According to
 provisional government figures, there were 750 strikes from
 January to September, accounting for 9.6 million man-days
 lost. Figures for the last 10 years show the number of
 strikes and lockouts have been declining.
 The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA) in early
 1989 reported on allegations by a Communist trade union
 federation that management had incited police and thug
 repression of union members on Assam tea and plywood estates.
 Another case, brought by the same complainant, alleging
 violence against union members in Tripura, was considered by
 the CFA at its May-June session. The Government, which denied
 all the allegations, was urged to promote a climate free from
 violence, pressure, or threats against trade unionists.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize (including protection against antiunion
 discrimination) and to bargain collectively has existed in
 Indian law for decades. Trade unions carry out these
 activities independently and without government or, in
 general, employer attempts to interfere. Police and judicial
 authorities are generally quick to protect peaceful union
 activities. However, as noted in Section 2.b., mine workers
 in Sukinda Valley, Orissa, alleged harassment by the police of
 their peaceful protests against mechanization.
 In addition to the availability of normal civil and criminal
 courts, a system of specialized labor courts exists to hear
 and adjudicate labor-related complaints. New legislation
 seeking to modernize and streamline the bargaining process and
 the internal organization of unions was introduced in the
 Parliament in 1988, but, pending consultations with trade
 union and employers' organizations, it has ndt been acted upon.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of reaching
 industrial relations agreements and settling disputes, and
 trade unions are usually vigorous in defending worker
 interests in this process. Where collective bargaining fails
 to establish locally equitable wage levels, the Government may
 set up tripartite boards, including trade union
 representation, to determine them. Export processing zones
 
 
 1398
 exist at several locations in India but are not particularly
 active at present. Physical access to such zones is
 ordinarily limited, including to union organizers. Unions do
 not appear to be active in the *zones, but collective
 bargaining rights-apply within them.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Indian Constitution, and
 legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of
 "bonded labor." A Supreme Court decision has defined "forced
 labor" as work at less than the minimum wage (minimum wages
 are usually set by~the states, not the central Government).
 Under this unique definition, "forced labor" is widespread
 throlughout India, particularly in rural areas. "Bonded
 labor," although illegal (subject to imprisonment for up to 3
 years) and actively opposed by the Government, also occurs in
 agriculture and construction. It is the result of a private,
 contractual relationship whereby a worker incurs or inherits
 debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt, plus*
 extensive interest. Since most of these workers are
 illiterate, these bonds may continue indefinitely, especially
 if the contractor lends them subsequent small amounts "on
 account."
 The Government estimates, based on reports from the states as
 of March 31, 1989, that there were 242,532 bonded workers in
 the country, of whom 218,272 had been "rehabilitated" by
 government authorities. The Gandhi Peace Foundation, however,
 estimates the number at 10 times the government figure.
 Private social organizations. such as the Council for
 Advancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Technology (CAPART)
 and Action for Welfare and Awakening in Rural Environments
 (AWARE), and some trade unions are active in identifying cases
 of bondage and pursuing them with relevant (usually state)
 officials. Even with better coordination and greatly
 increased resources to overcome the complicated jurisdictional
 division between the state governments and the central
 Government, the eradication of bonded labor is likely to be
 slow. ILO committees have also examined the issue of bonded
 labor and-have requested the Government to continue its
 efforts to put its practices in conformity with ILO Convention
 29 on Forced Labor, which India ratified in 1954.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 It has been estimated that one-quarter of the world's child
 labor is attributable to India, where poverty and the lack of
 compulsory education make it an especially serious problem.
 According to a Labor Ministry survey, 1 out of 4 Indian
 children between the ages of 5 and 15 is working. Government
 statistics put the total at 17.5 million in 1985. Other
 figures put it as high as 44 million.
 In 1986..legislation was enacted banning the employment of
 children under 14 in hazardous occupations and regulating
 their employment in others, and in 1987 the Labor Ministry
 announced a crackdown in 10 of the most blatantly abused
 sectors. In 1988 the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee
 requested that the Government consult with outside experts to
 set up educational programs for child workers and to change
 parental attitudes, to carry out "exemplary punishment" of
 erring employers, and to harmonize the various existing
 legislative controls on the practice. In 1989 the Prime
 Minister proposed a special tax on employers of child labor.
 
 
 1399
 INDIA
 Five hundred nev child welfare projects were inaugurated in
 1989, including health and -nutritional programs. A Small
 Child Labor Division within the Labor Ministry has been
 created. Nevertheless, progress has been slow. Some
 employers of child labor have been openly defiant about
 continuation of the practice and resisted attempts by the
 Labor Ministry at enforcement. As in the case of bonded
 labor, the central Government often points to the division of
 jurisdiction between the state governments and the central
 Government in dealing with the practice, and urges private
 organizations (including trade unions) to do more. Although
 almost all child labor abuses occur in sectors outside the
 traditional reach of labor organizations, trade unions have
 recently become more active in this field, often concentrating
 on "consciousness-raising" among women workers who work
 alongside their children. Despite all these efforts,
 enforcement of existing law appears inadequate to cope with
 the dimensions of the problem. The 1989 central government
 budget allowed only $2 million for all child welfare programs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 While the basic minimum wage, and its enforcement, varies
 according to the state and sector of industry, most
 "organized" workers receive much more than the minimum wage,
 especially when legislatively mandated bonuses and other
 .benefits are included. The prescribed minimum wage in the
 unorganized sector for-Delhi is about $50 per month for
 unskilled workers. Daily wage rates for construction workers
 range :frmm.$1.74.for unskilled workers to $2.34 for skilled
 workers. !Uhe minimum wage, without bonuses or benefits, is
 considered adequate only for the most minimal standard of
 living.
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour
 workweek, and various standards for working conditions. These
 standards are generally enforced and accepted (indeed,
 improved upon by various enlightened employers and aggressive
 unions) in the modern industrial sectors but are less often
 observed in older, smaller, and less economically robust
 industries.
 Occupational safety and health..measures also vary widely,
 although this is an'area-in which both Government and trade
 unions have-become more active. Governmental resources
 devoted to inspection!-and enforcement of standards are
 generally recognized to.be inadequate. Several international
 organizations and foreign government agencies, including the
 U.S. Agency for International Development, are working with
 the Government of India on various occupational.safety and
 health projects.
