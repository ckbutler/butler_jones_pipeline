 ZIMBABWE
 Human rights practices in Zimbabwe were dramatically affect-
 ed by the political transformation of Rhodesia into Zimbabwe
 in 1980. A new constitution was adopted; the Rhodesian
 civil war ended; elections contested by nine parties were
 held under British.supervision; a new majority-rule govern-
 ment, pledged to non-racialism, assumed power in Salisbury
 and was recognized by the international community.
 The Emergency Powers Act, which restricted many political
 and civil liberties during the war, was extended until
 January 1981, but was amended to rescind nearly all provi-
 sions not directly connected to maintenance of law and
 order under the still-shaky security conditions prevailing
 in Zimbabwe.
 Among the governmental powers repealed were authority to
 seize property, impose curfews or martial law, censor publi-
 cations or press reports, and prohibit aid to opposition
 political groups. The principal extra-constitutional power
 retained by the government is the power to detain people
 deemed security threats, and these cases are subject to
 judicial review.
 From the time of first European settlement in 1890 until
 the so-called internal settlement of 1978, white settlers,
 never numbering more than five percent of the population,
 monopolized political and economic power in Rhodesia. Even
 after the accession to power of a black Prime Minister,
 Bishop Abel Muzorewa, in the April 1979 election which was
 not recognized by the international community, the two
 parties based in Mozambique and Zambia which made up the
 Patriotic Front continued and intensified the guerrilla war
 to bring down a regime they believed still served mainly
 the white minority.
 The two parties in the Patriotic Front, the Zimbabwe
 African National Union (ZANU-PF) led by Robert Mugabe,
 and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (PF-ZAPU) headed
 by Joshua Nkomo, agreed in September 1979 to a British
 proposal to meet with a delegation representing Muzorewa's
 Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government in London to attempt to
 negotiate a settlement. The conference, at Lancaster
 House, was chaired by the British Foreign Secretary and
 lasted more than three months. Against a background of
 fifteen years of unsuccessful British and international
 efforts to return the breakaway colony of southern Rhodesia
 to legality, the Lancaster House initiative, with support
 from the United States, the Commonwealth and the southern
 African Front-Line states (Angola, Botswana, Mozambique,
 Tanzania and Zambia), reached agreement on a constitution,
 a cease-fire and transitional arrangements under a British
 governor, Lord Christopher Soames, who arrived in Salisbury
 in December 1979, with a British army *monitoring force.'
 Soames' arrival reinstated legality under British rule.
 Mandatory economic sanctions, in effect against Rhodesia
 since 1968, were repealed by the United Nations Security
 Council.
 The cease-fire, involving the movement of approximately
 36, 000 guerrillas into "assembly points", held. Soames
 released most political prisoners, legalized most banned
 political organizations, notably ZAPU and ZANU, and set
 ground rules for a two-month campaign leading to elections
 on February 27-29, 1980.
 
 
 320
 Tense conditions and charges of intimidation and bias
 characterized the campaign period, but international observers
 concluded that the voting was reasonably free and the results
 representative of the people's will. Mugabe's ZANU-PF won
 63 percent of the vote and 57 of the 80 black seats at
 stake. Nkomo's PF-ZAPU won 24 percent and 20 seats, while
 Muzorewa's UANC won eight percent and three seats.
 Soames asked Mugabe to form a government. Mugabe, whose
 support came from the majority Shona tribe, chose a coali-
 tion with Nkomo, who is the leading political figure of the
 minority Ndebeles, and included two whites to the Cabinet.
 In parliament, the 80 black Members of Parliament joined 20
 Rhodesia Front party members who had won the 'reserved"
 white seats in a separate election, as provided in the
 constitution to assure white representation.
 The new government inherited a country with British legal
 and political traditions, a highly-developed economic
 infrastructure, and strong cultural, social, legal and
 religious institutions. The government affirmed its
 socialist ideology, but set out to build on and develop
 the existing system as the best way to extend economic
 benefits to the poor majority. Prime Minister Mugabe and
 members of his government emphasized racial, tribal and
 political reconciliation and the need for whites to stay
 in Zimbabwe. He also promised scrupulous observance of
 the rights guaranteed by the constitution agreed on at
 Lancaster House (hereinafter called the constitution),
 and assured whites that jobs and property would be secure.
 The predominantly white civil service and judiciary were
 retained, with qualified blacks promoted or hired to fill
 vacancies which occurred. The new government granted
 amnesty to 11,000 prisoners, reduced the regressive sales
 tax, eliminated tax on food staples, set the first national
 minimum wages ($110 per month for industrial and commercial
 workers), began a land reform program, and voted funds to
 allow free primary education and free health care for the
 vast majority of the population.
 The remnants of the war, however, and its animosities persisted
 to some extent as small dissident groups took the law into
 their own hands to settle old scores or harass political
 opponents. The government has been unable to eliminate this
 sort of vigilante activity by its own supporters or opponents,
 though the situation seems gradually to be improving.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Section 15 (1) of the constitution states wno person
 shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading
 punishment or other such treatment.* There have been no
 accusations of torture or of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 punishment by the Zimbabwe government. Occasional allegations
 of torture or degrading treatment by ex-guerrillas or
 political factions have been the subject of criminal
 charges and judicial proceedings.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no summary executions or severe physical
 punishments administered as sentences for crimes. Racial
 
 
 321
 discrimination in the treatment of prisoners practiced
 by previous governments has been eliminated and conditions
 for black prisoners were improved. One of the first acts
 of the new government was to grant amnesties to appproximately
 half of the prison population.
 Prison conditions are spartan but not unusually harsh.
 Diet, clothing and exercise are governed by regulation;
 and deprivation of necessities is not used as a disciplinary
 measure. Living conditions are sometimes crowded, with
 as many as one hundred prisoners sharing one large room.
 The new government has ordered that all prisoners sleep on
 cots or bunks with mattresses rather than reed mats and
 blankets on the floor which was the norm in former times.
 The provision of adequate beds is nearly complete. Many
 prisoners are required to do manual or farm labor at prison
 facilities.
 C.    Disappearances
 There is no pattern of abductions, secret arrests or"
 detentions. A small number of abductions by political
 factions have been the subject of criminal charges with
 sentences handed down.
 d.    Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There has been no allegation of arbitrary arrest or impris-
 onment. Section 13 of the constitution guarantees that no
 person shall'be arrested or detained except by court order
 or 'reasonable suspicion of his having committed or being
 about to commit a criminal offense." Under the Emergency
 Powers Act, approximately 200 people are being detained.
 These are armed ex-guerrillas who were, absent from designa-
 ted assembly points or commands. All political detainees
 were released during the transitioniperiod in late 1979.
 Suspects must be informed of the charges against them
 'as soon as reasonably practicable* after arrest or detention
 of the charges against them (Section 13-3); and are entitled
 to compensation for unlawful arrest or detention. (Section
 13-5).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Section 18 of the constitution outlines rights of defendants
 in the Zimbabwe court system. The accused is guaranteed a
 "fair hearing within a reasonable time by an independent
 and impartial court," the presumption of innocence, the
 right-to counsel of his choice, clear and detailed charges,
 the right of .cross-examination of witnesses, the right of
 appeal, fEeedom from double jeopardy and the right to
 refuse to testify at his own trial.
 Section 18,(10-13) requires that all trials and verdicts
 be public, e-ceptiwhere.the interests of justice, the
 national interest or the~private lives of people involved
 would be unnecessarily prejudiced. In- practice, there
 has been no denial of fair public trial in Zimbabwe, though
 a shortage of judicial officials has resulted in some
 backlog of court cases. ZANU leader and Manpower Minister
 Edgar Tekere, was arrested on a murder charge, in spite of
 Tekere's wide political following, especially among armed
 guerrillas, and his political prominence. The government
 allowed the judicial process to take its course and inter-
 vened neither for nor against Tekere. Tekere was ultimately
 released by the court under the terms of a now-repealed law
 designed to protect officials of the Smith regime.
 
 
 322
 There have been allegations, often substantiated, of
 "kangaroo courts" established in rural areas by party
 officials or guerrillas to try and punish political oppo-
 nents. The government has condemned and prosecuted organi-
 zers of these illegal tribunals. There are also "kangaroo
 courts" dealing with non-political cases which originated
 during the war when one guerrilla aim was to inhibit or
 close down official local courts. As a general rule, the
 Ndebele chiefs and institutions are stronger than their
 Shona counterparts, so the substitution of party committees
 or ad hoc judgments was much more prevalent during the
 war in Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA)
 areas than those controlled by Zimbabwe People's Revolution-
 ary Army (ZIPRA). This has continued since independence,
 mostly in those areas where political committees had in-
 formally replaced tribal councils and courts during the
 war. Although without legal standing, this system of
 justice deals with a wide range of civil and minor criminal
 disputes in those areas where it is established, including
 perhaps half of Tribal Trust Lands (TTL) areas of Mashona-
 land. The vast majority of judgments are either accepted by
 the parties or the losing parties fear retaliation and do
 not seek redress through the formal legal system. In
 perhaps two dozen cases, the informal party courts have
 convicted suspects of major crimes, meted out severe
 punishment or have shown favoritism to an extent where the
 victim or police brought the case into the formal court
 system, where the "kangaroo court" personnel responsible
 were prosecuted and usually convicted and sentenced. In
 1980 the Ministry of Justice announced plans to present
 legislation in January 1981 which would establish a national
 system of primary courts to replace both the customary
 courts and kangaroo courts. The new system would give
 local councils a voice in determining the makeup of bodies
 for deciding civil disputes in each area, and provide for
 training personnel to preside at these courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Section 17 of the constitution protects citizens from
 arbitrary search or entry. Entry without a warrant is
 permitted when "reasonably justifiable" in the interests
 of "defense, public safety, public order, public health
 or town and country planning," when authorized by law.
 There have been no allegations of abuse of this   authority
 by government officials in Zimbabwe.
 2.    Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Mugabe government has taken significant steps to
 improve the status and living standard of the seven
 million blacks in Zimbabwe, though considerable inequality
 and poverty continue. The government posits   that more
 equal distribution of wealth and public services will come
 through economic growth, international aid, and budget
 shifts, without reducing the living standard of the white
 community of 210,000, which had enjoyed legal and economic
 privileges.
 Gross domestic product per capita was at $530 in 1978. The
 mean income of white, Asian and "colored" workers was
 $9,840, while for employed blacks it was $940.
 In real terms, gross domestic product (GDP) grew about two
 percent per annum during the past decade, but the per
 capita level has dropped steadily from a peak in 1974.
 
 
 323
 Real growth is estimated at three to five percent for
 1980. Population growth in excess of three percent per year
 has meant that the economy, restricted by international
 economic sanctions during 1968-1979, could not keep pace
 in providing jobs and benefits.
 In 1979, 990,000 people were formally employed in Zimbabwe
 33 percent in agriculture, 15 percent in manufacturing,
 11 percent in private domestic service and 6 percent in
 mining. Most of the approximately two million adults of
 working age who are not employed in the formal sector make
 their livelihood by subsistence farming in the Tribal Trust
 Lands. From 1970 to 1979, formal sector employment grew by
 1.6 percent, much more slowly than population. Both employ-
 ment and per capita GDP fell during the intensification
 of the war during the 1975-79 period.
 Twenty percent of the population of 7.21 million lives in
 urban areas. The civil war not only accelerated migration
 to cities, but also destroyed or crippled many of the
 public services which had been available to rural people,
 such as education and health care. The government, with
 international assistance, has placed a high priority on
 rebuilding rural infrastructure, but major inequalities
 continued throughout 1980 between services and facilities
 provided to rural residents and those provided to urban
 residents.
 Socio-economic differences are also reflected in other
 statistics:'life expectancy for whites is estimated at 70
 years; for blacks, 50. Nearly 100 percent of the white,
 Asian and "colored" population is literate, but only 43
 percent of blacks. Another fourteen percent of the black
 population is classified "semi-literate". Zimbabwe is
 self-sufficient in food, and although dietary differences
 exist among different groups, government distribution
 programs have prevented malnutrition.
 The first budget of the new government was presented in
 July 1980. The largest percentage increases were for
 a consumer price subsidy of basic food staples, for
 health and for education. White farmers also received
 enhanced guaranteed prices. The $2.2 billion national
 budget, 24 percent larger than the 1979-80 budget, reflected
 the change in priorities. Expenditures for defense fell
 from 29.1 percent of the total budget to 23.6 percent. The
 share devoted to police activity fell from 10.6 to 8.0
 percent. Health rose from 4.6 percent of total expenditures
 to 6.0 percent. The education appropriation accounts for
 15.4 percent of the 1980-81 budget, compared to 10.0
 percent the previous year.
 During 1980, free universal primary and secondary education
 was instituted, health care was made free for anyone
 earning less than $109 per month, a national minimum wage
 was established and over 300,000 acres of land was legally
 acquired by the government, and which plans to redistri-
 bute to returning refugees and to peasants from overcrowded
 Tribal Trust Lands who pledged to develop the land.
 Laws which placed raciai restrictions on ownership of
 land had been repealed by the previous (internal settle-
 ment) government, and the right to own, develop and
 dispose of property is strictly protected in Section 16
 of the constitution. As required by the constitution,
 fair compensation, probably in the form of bonds, has
 been paid for all land acquired by the government for
 its resettlement program.
 
 
 Section 11 of the constitution guarantees women equal
 civil rights, but women do not enjoy equality under the
 traditional law which governs most property and family
 matters in the Tribal Trust Lands, where the majority of
 the black population live. Married women are considered
 minors under this law, and cannot own property or enter
 into contracts. Although legal equality in the non-
 traditional sector is granted women, discrimination in
 credit availability, salaries and employment persists.
 The new government has announced its commitment to women's
 equality and advancement, and has appointed three women to
 senior governmental positions.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Sections 19, 20 and 21 of the constitution guarantee
 freedom of religion, assembly and association. The
 previous government's censorship of the print media was
 terminated, though foreign journalists are required to
 have temporary employment permits. Foreign books, films,
 and periodicals considered pornographic or excessively
 violent are prohibited. Grounds for banning or prohibition
 were narrowed in July 1980, to exclude political censorship.
 Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU party has its own newspaper, which
 is frequently critical of the government. White opinion,
 often diametrically opposed to government actions, is
 given prominent coverage in the nation's two daily papers,
 and speeches or parliamentary statements by opposition
 politicians are printed regularly. The government radio
 and television report statements unfavorable to the govern-
 ment, mostly those made in parliamentary debate, but
 generally base programming on government press releases and
 official versions of events. The government has appointed
 officials to broadcast media who can be counted on to
 promote coverage favorable to its ideology and policy.
 ZAPU has complained about the predominance of coverage
 given ZANU-PF on radio and television.
 There has been no interference with intellectuals or
 academic work, and expression of contrasting points of
 view at the university and at government-sanctioned
 seminars and conferences has been encouraged.
 There are no restrictions on peaceful public assembly.
 Anti-government demonstrations which have taken place have
 prompted no particular retribution by the government.
 Section 141 of the Industrial Conciliation Act prohibits
 both strikes and lockouts and requires that parties
 negotiate disputes and refer them to arbitration by a
 court if various bodies created by that law cannot get
 the parties to agree.
 If a union rejects the final arbitration decision, it
 may, after 30-day cooling-off period, signal its intention
 to strike. Since independence, labor disputes have never
 reached that stage. No one has been prosecuted under the
 Industrial Conciliation Act for striking, despite numerous
 walkouts in late 1980, some sponsored by labor unions.
 Strikes have accomplished their purpose of highlighting
 grievances and achieving wage and benefit increases. It
 has been government policy to take no action against
 these labor actions, though at least one employer, a taxi
 company, dismissed all striking workers and was not
 required to reinstate them.
 
 
 325
 The government has been attempting to organize an umbrella
 labor body, but some within the local labor movement
 believes that the new organization might limit the existing
 freedom of labor groups to organize independently.
 A plethora of voluntary association and professional
 organizations operate with no restrictions by the govern-
 ment.
 Religious freedom is strictly upheld. Over 100 Christian
 denominazions, Jewish and Muslim congregations practice
 freely in Zimbabwe. Criticism of organized religion is
 also allowed.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of internal and foreign travel, emigration,
 and immunity from expatriation are guaranteed by Section
 22 of the constitution. Foreign exchange restrictions
 limit the amount of money a traveller or emigrant can
 take from the country, and restrictions on travel to
 areas of Zimbabwe deemed insecure are still in effect
 under the Emergency Powers Act. The government maintains
 a list of prohibited immigrants, but all names put on the
 list by previous governments for political reasons have
 been removed, and over 100,000 Zimbabweans who had left
 the country during the Ian Smith regime returned during
 1980. The government is trying to encourage white
 citizens to'stay in Zimbabwe, and has appealed to
 citizens living abroad to return.
 The right of voluntary repatriation has been abridged in
 only one instance, that of Lt. General Peter Walls.
 Walls was legally excluded under the Emergency Powers Act
 because he had made remarks to the press in South Africa
 criticizing the government, questioning its legitimacy
 and predicting civil war, after resigning as Commander of
 the government's force integration exercise.
 Approximately 25 South Africans have sought and been
 granted political refuge in Zimbabwe since April 18.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The February 1980 election which brought Robert Mugabe
 and his ZANU-PF party to power was held on a one-man,
 Qne-vote basis, with over 90-percent participation. Nine
 parties contested the election, and all were given free
 media time-and held campaign rallies. Most of those
 parties continue to exist, as do the Rhodesian Front, the
 leading White party, and the National Unifying Force,
 which had been the white opposition party during Rhodesia
 Front rule. There are no restrictions on meetings,
 public statements, or publications of these groups.
 Party politics, switches of allegiance and the fortunes
 of various leaders are topics of animated conversation and
 media coverage throughout Zimbabwe.
 During the election campaign allegations of intimidation
 were frequent and often substantiated by British transi-
 tion and election officials. Strong pressure by armed
 supporters of all three main candidates, (Robert Mugabe,
 Joshua Nkomo and Abel Muzorewa) was put on undecided or
 opposition voters. Election observers, including British,
 Commonwealth and unofficial American teams, concluded that
 the intimidation did not have a significant effect on the
 ultimate result of the electipn, that the principle of
 
 
 326
 secret ballot was understood and upheld by the voters and
 that the election was a fair test of the popular will.
 Local government elections held in November 1980 in most
 cities were won by ZANU.
 Property and residence qualifications disqualify farm and
 domestic workers living on their employer's property,
 from voting, but the campaigns were hard-fought and the
 balloting secret in most areas.
 Parliamentary debate is lively and frank. Opposition
 criticism, daily questioning of government ministers
 and points raised in legislative debate often influence
 government action and public perceptions of the govern-
 ment. Both black and white parliamentarians take their
 role as elected representatives seriously, frequently
 travelling to their constituencies and bringing up local
 and national grievances in the parliament. Local party,
 community and professional groups can petition parliament
 or the government if they feel they have been mistreated or
 if they oppose a particular policy.
 Opinions expressed in parliament are given due attention by
 the appropriate officials. Section 107 of the constitution
 establishes an independent ombudsman with power to investigate
 any government administrative act alleged by a citizen to
 be unjust. This office was not yet filled at the end of
 1980.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of. Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Investigations for alleged violations of human rights by
 the new government of Zimbabwe have not been sought by
 any international or non-governmenal organization.
