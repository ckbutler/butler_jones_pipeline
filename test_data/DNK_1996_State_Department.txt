 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary democratic rule. Queen
 Margikethe If is Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the unicameral Par-
 liament (Folketing), leads the Government. A minority three-party coalition took of-
 fice in September 1994 following national elections, but dropped to only the Social
 
 
 925
 Democrats and Radical Liberals in December with the withdrawal of the Center
 Democrats from the coalition.
 The national police have sole responsibility for internal security. The civilian au-
 thorities maintain effective control of the security forces.
 Denmark has an advanced, market-based industrial economy. One-half of the
 work force is employed in the public sector. The key industries are food processing
 and metal working;, the leading exports are a broad range of industrial goods. The
 economy provides residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them. The Government responded to a 1994 Amnesty International report by sus-
 pending police use of leg locks as a method of restraing detainees.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 dArbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system consists of a series of local and regional courts, with the Su-
 preme Court at the apex.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigor-
 ously enforces this right.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech
 and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-aThe Constitution provides for reigious freedom and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is religious instruction in the
 schools in the state religion, the Evangelical Lutheran Chnurh, but any student may
 without sanction be excused from religion classes with parental permission.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Forein Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum (and provided it to approximately 5,800 persons
 in 1996). There were no reports of forced expulsion of refugees to a country where
 they feared persecution or of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The territories of Greenland (whose population is primarily Inuit) and the Fae
 Islands (whose inhabitants have their own Norse language) have democratically
 elected home rule governments with powers encompassing all matters except foreign
 affairs, monetary affairs, and national security. Greenlanders and Faroese are Dan-
 ish citizens, with the same rights as those in the rest of the Kingdom. Each territory
 elects two representatives to the Folketing.
 In the current Government, 7 of 20 ministers are women.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government's operations and extensive public services do not discriminate on
 the basis of any of these factors. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex, and it is effectively enforced by the Government. Discrimination on the basis
 of race is at present covered by two laws, which prohibit racial slander and denial
 of access to public places on the basis of race. Human rights organizations such as
 the Antidiscrimination Center have criticized the Government for failing to expand
 legislation to other areas of potential discrimination. The rights of indigenous people
 are carefully protected.
 Women.-An umbrella nongovernmental organization reports that in 1995, wom-
 en's crisis shelters were contacted 11,516 times, and 2,060 women stayed at shel-
 ters. There were 795 sexual assaults including 270 rapes. The law requires equal
 pay for equal work, but some wage inequality still exists. The law prohibits job dis-
 crimination on the basis of sex and provides resources, such as access to the Equal
 Status Council, for those so affected. Women hold positions of authority throughout
 society, although they are underrepresented at the top of the business world. Wom-
 en's rights groups are effective in lobbying the Government in their areas of con-
 cern, e.g., wage disparities and parental leave.
 Chi/dren.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Sections within theMinistries of Social Affairs, Justice, and Education oversee
 implementation of programs for children. There is no societal pattern of abuse
 against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. Building regula-
 tions require special installations for the disabled in public buildings built or ren-
 ovated aWter 1977, and in older buildings that come into public use. The Government
 enforces these prvisions in practice.
 Indigenous People.-The Iaw protects the rights of the inhabitants of Greenland
 and the Faoe Islands. The Greenlandic legal system seeks to accommodate Inuit
 customs. Acordingly, it provides for the use of lay people as judges, and it sentences
 most prisoners toldin-g- centers (rather than to prisons) where they are encour-
 aged to work, hunt, or fish dur  the day. Education in Greenland is provided to
 the native population in both the nitand Danish languages.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The inflow of ethnically and racially diverse
 refugees and i     rants has provoked a degree of tension between Danes and im-
 migrants (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, and Sri Lankans until late 1992; refugees
 are now overwhelmingly former Yugoslavs and Somalia). Recent publicity on the in-
 volvement of foreigners in street-level drug daling has increased these tensions to
 the point that Par        is ebating' mandatory deportation for those convicted. In-
 cidents of random, racially motivated violence do occur but are rare. The Govern-
 ment effectively investigates and deals with cases of racially motivated violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing. ApproXimately
 80 percent of wage earners belong to unions that are independent of the Govern-
 ment and political parties. The Social Democratic Party and the Danish Confed-
 eration of Trade Unions, at their respective conferences, severed their historic for-
 meal link. They no onger have representation on each other's governing boards but
 maintain close informal ties. Unions may affliate freely with international organiza-
 tions, and they do so actively. All unions except those representing civil servants
 or the military have the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge each other's right to organize. Collective bargaining is protected by law
 and is widespread in practice. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers, and there are mechanisms to resolve
 disputes. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In the private sector, salaries, benefits, and
 working conditions are agreed upon in biennial or triennial negotiations between the
 various employers' associations and their union counterparts. If the negotiations
 
 
 927
 
 fail, a national conciliation board mediates, and its proposal is voted on by manage-
 ment and labor. If the proposal is turned down, the Government may force a legis-
 lated solution on the parties (usually based upon the mediators' proposal). The
 agreements, in turn, are used as guidelines throughout the public as well as the pri.
 vate sector. In the public sector, collective bargaining is conducted between the em-
 ployees' unions and a government group, led by the Finance Ministry.
 Labor relations in Greenland are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark.
 Greenlandic courts are the first recourse in disputes, but Danish mediation services
 or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 There is no umbrella labor organization in the Faroes, but individual unions en-
 gage in periodic collective bargaining with employers. Disputes are settled by medi-
 ation.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, which the Government effectively enforces.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for full-time
 employment is 15 years. The law prescribes specific limitations on the employment
 of those between 15 and 18 years of age, and it is enforced by the Danish Working
 Environment Service (DWES) an autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but national labor agreements effectively set a wage floor. The lowest
 wage paid is currently about $13 (DKr 75) per hour, effective n September 1995,
 which is sufficient for a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The law
 provides for 5 weeks of paid vacation per year. A 37-hour workweek is the norm,
 established by contract, not by law. lawlaw does, however, require at least 11 hours
 between the end of one work period and the start of the next.
 The law also prscribes conditions of work, including safety and health; duties of
 employers, supervisors, and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off;
 and medical examinations. The DWES ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations or arms production
 without jeopardizing their employment rights, and there are legal protections for
 workers who fie complaints about unsafe or unhealthy conditions.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Faroes, except that
 their workweek is 40 hours. As in Denmark, this is established by contract, not by
 law.
