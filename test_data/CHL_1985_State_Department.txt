 CHILE
 Chile has been ruled by the military since a coup in 1973
 interrupted a forty-two year period of democratic government.
 Since independence in 1810, Chile has experienced periods of
 authoritarian regimes, but parliamentary rule under a
 democratic system of elections and respect for political and
 human rights generally prevailed. The current Government
 includes both civilian and military officials and operates
 under the Constitution adopted by plebiscite in 1980. A
 military junta exercises limited legislative functions, and a
 separate judicial branch carries out judicial duties, but
 primary authority resides with the Commanding General of the
 Army and President, Augusto Pinochet. Under the 1980
 Constitution, President Pinochet's term of office expires in
 1989, when a plebiscite will be held on a presidential
 candidate to be selected by the military commanders in chief.
 There are no constitutional restrictions on President
 Pinochet's being that candidate. If approved, the Junta
 candidate would serve until 1997. If rejected, open and
 direct presidential elections would be held.within one year.
 The Constitution also provides that the junta will continue to
 serve until congressional elections are held in,1990. In
 August eleven democratic political parties came together in a
 "National Accord for a Transition to Full Democracy" but the
 Government has refused to agree to a dialogue on the moderate
 proposals for a democratic transition contained in this Accord.
 Chile has a vigorous private sector, an economic system based
 largely on the free enterprise system, and social programs
 which absorb over half the government budget. The steep
 decline in Chile's terms of trade since 1970, compounded by
 one of the region's highest per capita levels of debt, has not
 allowed Chile to benefit as much as might be expected from the
 Government's generally responsible economic policies.
 Most fundamental political freedoms are severely limited, and
 human rights conditions are strongly affected by the lack of
 progress toward a transition to democracy and by terrorist
 violence. While the military has indicated an intention to
 carry out the provisions of the 1980 Constitution, political
 parties function without the protections of legal status and
 electoral laws have not been established. Rights of private
 property, freedom of religion and minority rights are
 respected, but "states of exception" to constitutional
 guarantees imposed severe restrictions during 1985 on freedom
 of association and assembly, freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 exile, and freedom of speech and the press.
 The Government has maintained significant discretionary
 authority by use of one or more of the four states of
 exception provided for under the transitory articles of the
 1980 Constitution which progressively limit civil liberties
 otherwise provided for by the Constitution. All four may be
 in force concurrently, but the most restrictive state of
 exception, the State of Assembly, has never been implemented
 by the Government. For most of the first six months of 1985
 the country was under a State of Siege which expanded
 jurisdiction of military courts and permitted the Government
 to "suspend" the right of freedom of information. Removal of
 the State of Siege on June 17 partially restored freedoms of
 speech, assembly, association and the press and increased the
 authority of the courts, which during 1985 showed independence
 and diligence in investigating several important cases of
 major human rights violations involving the security forces.
 
 
 CHILE
 However, there remained in effect throughout 1985 a State of
 Emergency and State of Danger of Disturbance of Internal Peace
 under which the Government maintained authority to detain
 individualsup to twenty days without judicial review, to
 expel individuals, to assign enforced residence for ninety
 days, and to restrict the right of assembly and freedom of
 information. The existence of these provisions engender a
 large degree of uncertainty among Chileans. The Government
 authorized several hundred additional exiles to return to
 Chile in 1985 and permitted the UN Special Rapporteur on the
 situation of human rights in Chile to visit in December.
 Reliable and documented reports of torture and mistreatment of
 those detained by the authorities continue to be received by
 human rights organizations, and there was an increase in
 charges by human rights groups and government opponents of
 temporary kidnappings, beatings and torture by persons
 frequently reported to be agents of the security forces.
 There continued to be a high level of far left terrorism, to
 which was attributed the murders of military and police
 officers and civilians, as well as the bombing of
 installations identified with the Chilean Government or the
 United States, such as Mormon churches, U.S.-owned companies
 and binational centers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A total of 72 persons were killed and many others injured in
 apparently politically-related acts of violence in 1985. The
 deaths and injuries resulted from both deliberate and random
 actions by government forces and by left and right-wing
 terrorists. The following paragraphs illustrate some of the
 specific instances.
 A student under detention in February by the Carabineros
 (uniformed police) .in the town of Quintero, after having been
 arrested for possible involvement in a terrorist school, died
 from mistreatment. Three individuals associated with the
 Chilean Communist Party were kidnapped from a public Santiago
 street in March by unidentified civilians, and their bodies
 were discovered with throats cut the following day in a field
 outside of Santiago. In April a university student
 demonstrator died after having been shot by Carabineros while
 distributing leaflets. Terrorist actions killed three women
 in two separate bomb attacks against city office buildings in
 the towns of Lo Prado and Conchali in May. A terrorist car
 bomb exploded across the street from the U.S. Consulate in
 Santiago in July, killing a passerby. Five civilians died in
 November as the result of a terrorist fire bomb attack against
 a supermarket in Vina del Mar.
 Demonstrations in early September associated with the
 traditional date of presidential elections (September 4) and
 the anniversary of the 1973 overthrow of the Allende
 government (September 11), deteriorated into several days of
 violent, scattered clashes between demonstrators and the
 authorities. Ten people were killed during these clashes,
 several under unclear circumstances in which armed civilians,
 
 
 450
 CHILE
 driving vehicles without license plates, were reportedly
 shooting people at random in areas where violent clashes had
 occurred.
 The Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, which is linked to the
 Chilean Communist Party, and the Movement of the Revolutionary
 Left, another leftist terrorist group, continued to pursue a
 policy of violent confrontation with the military Government
 both during the State of Siege and after its removal,
 rejecting efforts by democratic sectors to encourage a
 peaceful transition to democracy. There were 936 separate
 terrorist bombing attacks throughout the nation, leaving 451
 persons killed and injured during the first eleven months of
 the year. There is considerable evidence of Soviet, Cuban,
 Nicaraguan, Libyan, and East European training and other
 support for the terrorist groups.
 b. Disappearances
 There were no substantiated reports of disappearances during
 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and police brutality continue to be serious problems.
 At least four people died in 1985 apparently as a result of
 mistreatment while in the custody of the authorities. The
 Chilean Medical Association continues to investigate cases of
 doctors who are reported to have been involved in torture, and
 in August 1985 suspended an army physician for his indirect
 support in the mistreatment of a young woman detained by the
 National Information Center (CNI) in 1982.
 The Constitution prohibits "use of all illegal pressure" and
 "guarantees to all persons the right to life and to the
 physical and psychological integrity of the individual."
 Government officials deny that use of torture is authorized
 and note that members of the uniformed services are being
 investigated by the civilian and military judiciary systems
 for their possible involvement in deaths due to apparent
 mistreatment. At the end of 1985 two Carabinero officers were
 still in custody pending the results of a judicial
 investigation into the death of a 19-year old student in
 February under detention by Carabineros. Five Carabinero
 members have been implicated in the May 26, 1985 death of a
 young man who had earlier been arrested for driving under the
 influence of alcohol. Other cases of official mistreatment
 continue under investigation by the courts. At the end of
 1985, five Carabinero officials, including two colonels,
 remained under detention in connection with the judicial
 investigation of the March 1985 murders of three Communist
 party leaders.
 Government officials have stated on several occasions that all
 cases in which complaints have been registered over abuse or
 torture by the authorities are investigated, and have declared
 that officials found to have participated in abuses are
 brought to justice. Human rights groups assert that many of
 these complaints are not actively investigated, but note that
 during the latter half of 1985 the courts have pursued more
 such cases than in the past. In July 1985 the Chilean
 Interior Minister and Minister of Defense issued a directive
 
 
 451
 CHILE
 to all security forces prohibiting the mistreatment of
 prisoners, but there were credible reports of new cases of
 torture subsequent to this order.
 Accusations of torture declined in the second half of 1985 but
 there was a marked increase in the number of reports of people
 being temporarily detained or kidnapped by unknown individuals
 and of being physically abused while held. In 1985 there were
 564 reports of such kidnapping incidents having occurred, as.
 compared to 402 in 1984 and 212 in 1983. Most victims, which
 include students, professionals, lower-level political
 activists or their families, journalists, and social workers,
 claimed to have suffered physical and mental abuse, including
 in some instances rape. Some also suffered superficial knife
 wounds in the shape of a cross. Several victims were
 subjected to more than one assault, with one 18-year old
 student alleging to have been assaulted on three different
 occasions. The reasons for such assaults are not given. Most
 appear to be attempts to intimidate those involved in human
 rights organizations, church-based community organizations, or
 political activities.
 In 1985, 84 persons filed complaints in court alleging torture
 or cruel and unusual punishment by security forces compared
 with a total of 84 in 1984, 77 in 1983, 57 in 1982, 68 in
 1981, and 100 in 1980. Most of these individuals state that
 they were subjected to beatings, electric shocks, or threats,
 particularly during the first days of detention. In 1985 an
 increasing number of incidents of physical abuse took place
 while the person was held by unidentified assailants. While
 the Chilean courts have been investigating several torture
 cases in 1985, as of the end of the year no security personnel
 had been found guilty in any of these cases.
 U.S. consular officials have received complaints from several
 U.S. citizens who were detained in Chile of torture or threats
 of torture, always within the first few days following their
 detention, and prior to notification of the U.S. Embassy and
 the initial visit from a U.S. consular official. There have
 been no reports from U.S. citizens of torture or threats of
 torture subsequent to that initial visit.
 Although the Government asserts that security and military
 forces are under strict control, reports of incidents of
 deliberate and random police brutality continued throughout
 1985. While most detainees do not file formal claims of
 mistreatment, some persons detained during protest
 demonstrations or on other political grounds have complained
 of being beaten or otherwise mistreated. Observers note,
 however, that in the final six months of 1985 the uniformed
 security forces used considerably less violent means of
 controlling demonstrators.
 Since January 1981, all persons officially charged with or
 convicted of violations of internal security laws have been
 lodged in the same penal facilities as other offenders. They
 have rights of visitation and communication with family,
 friends, legal counsel, and representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross. These rights are
 subject to limitation by Transitory Article 24 of the 1980
 Constitution, which restricts visitation rights in the first
 days of detention before prisoners are remanded to the court
 system.
 
 
 452
 CHILE
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Among the more serious areas of human rights violations in
 Chile has been the continued use of arbitrary arrests,
 detentions and internal exile. Under the State of Siege
 massive police round-ups and collective arrests took place
 with some frequency; 764 were detained in 1985 in such
 operations before June. After the lifting of the State of
 Siege, massive police round-ups no longer occurred, but since
 June at least 4,007 persons were temporarily detained for
 participating in unauthorized demonstrations. Of the 5,401
 people detained for investigation in 1985, either individually
 or as members of large groups, 310 were eventually charged
 before the courts for a variety of security law violations,
 and 32 were held on unspecified terrorist charges.
 Transitory Article 24 of the 1980 Constitution, under which
 the Government may order detention of five days without rights
 of Amparo or for as much as 20 days in cases where terrorist
 acts may be involved, was in effect throughout 1985.
 Prisoners were often held incommunicado during the initial
 period of investigation. Once formal charges are issued and
 the case brought before the court system, defendants are
 allowed a lawyer of their own choosing; lawyers affiliated
 with human rights groups are made readily available by those
 groups without charge. However, many of those held under this
 Article are never charged with any specific violations. For
 example, in September, after several days of sporadic clashes
 between the authorities and demonstrators, 64 people were
 detained in early morning raids on their residences. After 10
 days of detention, 34 were banished for 90 days to remote
 sites in Chile. The others were released to return home. No
 trials were held, no charges were made and those banished were
 not provided with the reasons for this decision.
 Chilean law stipulates that those banished be sent to urban
 areas. Members of the September group banished were generally
 sent to towns of five thousand or less (with several going to
 towns of 500 or less).   While living in these locations, the
 banished people must report at least daily to the local
 carabinero police station. Areas where those banished are
 sent include desert and mountain regions.
 The Government has continued to reduce the list of those
 exiled from Chile. In September 1984 the Government published
 an official list containing 4,942 names of individuals not
 permitted to return to Chile. By September 1985 this list had
 been reduced to 3,878 names and in December another 30 exiles
 were removed from the list. The list is determined by
 administrative decree and is not subject to judicial review.
 According to government officials, approximately 800 of nearly
 7,000 exiles authorized to return to Chile since 1983 have
 actually re-entered Chile, the rest remaining abroad. There
 were reports in 1985 that some exiles not on the official list
 were nonetheless not permitted to return to Chile; however, no
 evidence of such a "secret" list has been found. In 1985 no
 individuals were exiled by judicial decision or under
 Transitory Article 24. By way of comparison, in 1984 eight
 were externally exiled by judicial decisions and another eight
 were exiled under Article 24. In 1985, 168 persons were
 internally exiled for up to three months by administrative
 order under Transitory Article 24 not subject to judicial
 review (compared to 727 in 1984 and 127 in 1983). At the end
 of 1985, there were 29 people under internal banishment
 
 
 453
 CHILE
 orders; they will complete their 90-day sentence in early
 February 1986. Most were sent to distant villages as
 punishment for political activities or because they were
 regarded by authorities to be habitual offenders. In 1985 no
 one was sent into internal exile judicially, compared to 5
 such cases in 1984.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited, and there have been
 no complaints on this issue since the mid-1970's.
 e. Right of Fair Public Trial
 The-.right to a-fair public trial remained limited throughout
 1985, particularly for those detained under Transitory Article
 24. First-instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of
 proscribed political activities lies with regular civilian
 courts. .Chile's civilian judges are career officials and most
 served in-the judiciary before the present Government took
 power in 1973. As-in most civil law systems, trial is not by
 jury, and reliance is on the written record rather than oral
 testimony; .and the judge directs the investigation and finally
 decides innocence or guilt. There is a well-developed
 multi-stage appeal.process leading ultimately to the Supreme
 Court, but defendants detained under the authority of
 Transitory Article 24 do not enjoy full legal rights, such as
 rightto legal counsel of their choice, or to the normal
 appeals system. As in 1984, in 1985 there were fewer
 accusations than in past years that judges failed to
 investigate vigorously charges of government abuses. Judicial
 investigations are proceeding in a number of human rights
 cases from 1985 and-earlier years, including the 1976
 disappearance of 13 people.
 Weapons violations, which often are the basis of charges
 against terrorists, are tried before a military court.
 Appeals may be made to a military court of two civilian judges
 and three professional military judges and, in the last
 resort, to the entire civilian Supreme Court.
 In March the Military Judge for Santiago issued a decision
 that the Council of War Tribunals established under a special
 decree of 1981 had been, in effect, abolished by the
 anti.terrorist law of May 1984. The Council of War Tribunals,
 which were to act only under exceptional conditions (such as
 during a State of Siege), had been empowered to hand down a
 sentence~of either death or life imprisonment, with the right
 of appeal only to the President. The military judge's
 decision moved all cases involving terrorist acts or weapons
 to the normal military judicial system, which has very limited
 authority to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment and
 provides all the normal recourse to appeal available to any
 other defendant.
 In October the Supreme Court held that a civilian judge could
 continue an investigation into the March deaths of three
 individuals, after preliminary investigations had shown that
 several Carabinero officials might be implicated in these
 deaths. Military courts previously had shown reluctance to
 allow civilian courts to try military personnel, but in this
 instance the chief of the military tribunal in Santiago
 refused to accept the cases and turned them over to the
 civilian investigating judge, setting the stage for the
 Supreme Court's decision.
 
 
 454
 CHILE
 At the end of 1985, the Vicariate of Solidarity, the Catholic
 Church's human rights office, which has provided objective
 reports on human rights concerns, reported that 1,070 persons
 in Chile faced prosecution or were convicted and imprisoned
 for politically motivated acts, some of which were violent.
 Of these individuals, as of December 1985: 267 were in jail
 awaiting trial; 43 were serving sentences after convictions;
 672 individuals were free on bail while awaiting trial; 74
 were serving sentences outside of prison on parole; 3 were
 serving sentences in exile, and 11 were considered as
 fugitives.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private verbal or
 written communications are permitted by the 1980 Constitution,
 provided that search warrants are issued by either a civilian
 or military court for specific locations. Wiretapping is also
 permitted subject to issuance of a judicial order. The 1984
 anti-terrorist law provides legal authority for surveillance
 of those advocating political views contrary to the 1980
 Constitution and for interception, opening or recording of
 private communications and documents as well as the
 surveillance of individuals suspected of terrorist crimes. In
 1985 searches of homes were carried out under general warrants
 issued by civilian or military courts. There were reports
 that security forces did not always comply with the legal
 requirements for search warrants or judicial orders.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1980 Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and of
 the press. There are no constitutional provisions for
 official censorship although new periodicals must have
 government approval to begin operations. Nevertheless, in
 1985 the Government exercised considerable control over the
 media under the authority of Transitory Article 24 and the two
 states of exception concurrently in force throughout the year,
 and particularly during the six months the State of Siege was
 in effect. Under the State of Emergency, the President is
 empowered to restrict the freedom of information and opinion.
 Under the State of Siege, he may suspend or restrict the
 exercise of the right of assembly, freedom of information,
 freedom of opinion, the functions of trade unions, and censor
 mail and other communications. While free speech is normally
 respected for private conversations in Chile, human rights
 groups assert that extensive monitoring of mail and telephonic
 communications is conducted by the government security
 services.
 In addition, since 1973, the Government has formally and
 informally advised print, radio and television of acceptable
 norms of coverage for domestic developments. Self-censorship
 is practiced by the media, with most editors adopting a
 cautious approach in formulating commentary. Several major
 media companies are seriously in debt to government financial
 institutions, which provides potential economic leverage to
 the Government over news reporting and editorial content.
 The lifting of the State of Siege in mid-1985 brought
 significant improvements in the area of freedom of the press.
 
 
 CHILE
 Although the Government still had broad authority under the
 states of exception which remained in force, after mid-June
 that authority was generally exercised with restraint.
 Opposition magazines resumed publication. Editors were no
 longer required to submit their copy to government censors for
 clearance prior to publication. The Government, however,
 continued to take legal actions against some members of
 opposition magazines accused of violations of security laws.
 For example, the director of the magazine Mensaje, Jesuit
 priest Renato Hevia, was detained for two weeks in December
 for writing editorials which allegedly libeled government
 officials. Radio and television programs featuring political
 debates appeared regularly in the latter half of 1985. Media
 coverage of political, terrorist and criminal activities
 increased substantially and political gossip columns again
 were in evidence. However, at least two newspaper columnists
 were told during 1985 that their contributions were no longer
 welcome because of offense given to the Government. Even
 after the State of Siege was lifted, several publications
 faced prosecution because of' charges of violating restrictions
 on press activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association continued to be
 restricted in 1985. The states of exception to the basic
 rights provided in the Constitution placed severe restrictions
 on those seeking to redress grievances against the Government
 by means of peaceful demonstrations or public meetings.
 Leaders of opposition groups and trade union organizations
 were arrested for holding, instigating or organizing
 unauthorized demonstrations. The states of exception to the
 Constitution generally have not interfered with other
 activities, including elections, of most trade unions and
 professional associations. Under State of Siege provisions,
 but not the State of Emergency, the Government was empowered
 to restrict the exercise of the rights of association and
 trade union organization.
 Permission for public rallies must be sought from the
 authorities at least five days in advance and is obtained only
 by those organizations or groups which have legal status
 (personeria juridica). Political parties and some national
 trade union organizations are not now authorized under the
 law, so they are unable to demonstrate this legal status.
 Those who organize or call for unauthorized demonstrations are
 subject to arrest and prosecution, as happened in the case of
 trade union, neighborhood committee, and student organization
 leaders arrested in connection with the September protests.
 Most of those arrested in this case were soon released and the
 charges against student leaders were dropped, but several of
 the union and neighborhood association leaders remained in
 prison until December 1985, when all were released
 provisionally pending the results of a judicial investigation.
 The Government authorized the Democratic Alliance, which
 groups together several moderate democratic political parties,
 to hold a public rally in Santiago on November 21. In the
 largest public meeting since 1973, thousands of Chileans
 demonstrated peacefully at the rally, urging a return to
 democracy. The Government permitted purchase of radio and
 television time to advertise the protest, which received
 national television coverage. The Government subsequently
 
 
 456
 CHILE
 denied the Democratic Alliance permission to hold other
 protests in the cities of Antofagasta and Puerto Montt, citing
 terrorist threats.
 Legally recognized unions do not need to seek government
 permission to hold union meetings or conferences and in 1985
 carried out collective bargaining, strikes, and internal union
 elections. Some trade unions have had their premises
 searched,,.usually after union leaders have been detained for
 participating in illegal demonstrations. In 1985 there were
 reports-that individual labor leaders were dismissed under
 circumstances-.suggesting that they lost their jobs because of
 criticism of management or of the Government.
 Trade union leaders and some industrial relations analysts
 continue to hold that the decree-laws known as the "Labor
 Plan" unduly restrict the rights of organized labor. Under
 ,the Labor Plan, workers at units employing 25 or more
 individuals can form a union by majority vote, and elect their
 officers from among-their co-workers. Government recognition
 is easily and quickly obtained. Officers of trade union
 organizations (including federations and confederations) must
 remain employed in their jobs in plants represented by their
 unions but are legally entitled-to specified.paid time off for
 their union work. Trade union leaders-maintain that the Labor
 Plan restricts the development of strong, independent unions
 by-permitting collective bargaining at the plant level only;
 by allowing the-development-of-national federations or
 confederations on an industry-.wide basis only; by limiting the
 right to strike to 60 days; and by allowing management to hire
 strikebreakers while a legal strike or collective bargaining
 is;taking place. Limiting collective bargaining to the plant
 level, they say, prevents the unions from coordinating
 collective bargaining goals and objectives on a national scale.
 The right to strike is prohibited in designated strategic
 industries, primarily the public utilities, government copper
 mines, and the petroleum industry. For these companies,
 failure-to reach agreement during negotiations leads to
 binding arbitration.
 In 1981 the labor courts were incorporated into the normal
 judicial system, but therehave-been complaints from labor and
 management that the system does not work well. During 1985
 progress was made towards-re-establishing separate labor
 courts, and final action is expected in early 1986.
 Government employees are allowed to form associations but not
 unions. Public employees do not have the right to bargain
 collectively or to strike. Professional groups and
 .associations have not been limited by recent decree laws which
 are-aimed at-eliminating closed-shoptype compulsory licensing
 privileges.
 Labor unions are permitted to maintain relations with
 non-Marxist international labor bodies in their fields.
 Chilean worker delegates participating in conferences of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), have had their
 credentials challenged by other Chilean-labor groups. The
 ILO's Credentials Committee has urged the government of Chile
 to consult with all major trade union confederations in Chile
 without exception. There were no-new complaints filed in 1985
 in the ILO against the Government concerning violations of ILO
 conventions relating to freedom of association, employment,
 
 
 CHILE
 forced labor, and unemployment policies. There were, however,
 additional complaints filed against Chile with the ILO related
 to violations by the government of trade union rights during
 the State of Siege.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez, who had tried
 to establish a national union. There were reports in 1983 of
 evidence implicating persons associated with the National
 Information Center (CNI) in this murder. In September 1985,
 however, the investigating judge suspended further
 consideration of the case due to the absence of new
 developments. This decision may be appealed, but prospects
 for pursuing the investigation appear to depend on developing
 new evidence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of religion.
 Although Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on freedom of religion and no official
 discrimination is practiced against any religious group. A
 number of Protestant denominations and other groups are active
 and report full freedom and tolerance, as does the Jewish
 community. Religious belief and adherence appear to have no
 effect on acceptability for government positions in Chile.
 Nonetheless, the political violence apparent in other sectors
 of Chilean society has affected religious institutions as
 well. During 1985 the Catholic Church, which has played a
 major role in attempting to encourage dialogue between the
 democratic political groups and the Government, has been
 subjected to politically motivated attacks, generally by
 unidentified groups. Such assaults have affected Church
 property, officials, and lay workers associated with various
 activities, including the human rights arm of the Church, the
 Vicariate of Solidarity. Churches have been bombed or
 attacked with gunfire, priests physically attacked or
 threatened with death, lay workers kidnapped and mistreated,
 church offices broken into and files relating to church work
 stolen, and anonymous letters and phone calls received
 containing various threats against church officials or
 priests. According to some of the victims of these actions,
 they are often questioned by their assailants concerning their
 work with church groups and the activities of various priests
 or church organizations. Responsibility for these attacks is
 difficult to place, but some appear to be the work of a
 right-wing terrorist group called the Chilean Anti-Communist
 Action (Accion Chilena Anticomunista). Reportedly this
 terrorist organization was formed in 1946 to halt the spread
 of Communism to Chile, and was organized along military
 lines. Some human rights groups have asserted that government
 security forces are responsible for at least some of these
 assaults.
 During 1985, there were at least fourteen bomb attacks against
 the Mormon Church, particularly against church buildings.
 Left wing terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for
 such attacks, which appear to be motivated by the views of
 leftists extremists identifying the Mormon Church with both
 the Chilean Government and the United States. No foreign
 priests were expelled from Chile during 1985, but several were
 detained for short periods for involvement in protest
 demonstrations against the Government.
 
 
 458
 CHILE
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans have full constitutional freedom to move about within
 or to leave their country. As many as one million Chileans
 live abroad, principally for economic reasons. Most of them
 have resided for many years in Argentina. In the judgment of
 international organizations dealing with migrants, the volume
 of skilled and unskilled workers returning to Chile now
 roughly equals the number leaving. Most of the current
 emigrants seem to be motivated by economic rather than
 political factors, and no impediments have been placed in the
 way of their return. There have been no complaints concerning
 the treatment of either political or economic-repatriates.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees from other countries in
 recent years and makes regular, modest financial contributions
 to international organizations aiding refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the Constitution, a plebiscite is to be held before
 March 1989 to accept or.reject a candidate for president to be
 chosen by the military junta. If approved, he will serve
 until 1997; if rejected, there will be open presidential
 elections one year later. Congressional elections are
 scheduled no later than early 1990.. Once a Congress takes
 office in 1990, the military junta will be abolished. Until
 then, the junta exercises legislative authority, subject to
 presidential approval.
 The Government has stated its intention to carry out the
 provisions of the Constitution. In spite of extensive
 discussion and study, no progress was made in 1985 in
 legalizing political parties, establishing the electoral law
 governing elections or reestablishing electoral registers.
 The junta did promulgate an electoral court law on November
 15, after revising it to conform with the ruling of the
 Constitutional Tribunal which declared an earlier version of
 the law unconstitutional. According to the 1980 Constitution,
 any plebiscite to change the Constitution can be held only
 after publication of a new electoral law, which would also
 require reestablishment of electoral registers.
 The Tribunal had held on September 24 that the 1980
 Constitution requires the functioning of an independent
 electoral court in time to supervise any plebiscite called
 during the transition period, including the presidential
 plebiscite of 1989. Some democratic opposition leaders have
 noted that this decision should assist in establishing
 standards for legitimate elections, including open access to
 the media, free expression of public opinions, and the absence
 of political, social and economic pressures restricting a free
 choice among alternatives.
 The political opposition rejects significant elements of the
 1980 Constitution, including the provisions related to
 presidential and congressional elections, the powers of the
 presidency and. military embodied in the Constitution, and
 restrictions on civil liberties, among others. Opposition
 political parties consider the 1980 Constitution
 undemocratic. Democratic opposition parties want the
 Constitution revised or replaced in a process of negotiations
 
 
 459
 CHILE
 with the Government, while undemocratic leftist parties,
 particularly the Communist Party, a faction of the Socialist
 Party and the terrorist Revolutionary Movement of the Left
 (MIR) seek the complete overthrow of the Government, the
 dismantling of the armed forces and the establishment of a
 Marxist regime.   Since the State of Siege was lifted in
 mid-June, opposition groups have participated in
 demonstrations related to the general theme of a return to
 elected civilian government.
 Eleven democratic opposition groups organized in a loose
 coalition signed a "National Accord for the Transition to Full
 Democracy" on August 26 and have joined leaders of the
 Catholic Church in urging the Government to begin serious
 dialogue on this accord. The National Accord document calls
 for an orderly transition to democratic rule through the
 restoration of political rights, free elections for the
 president and the entire congress, and a procedure to allow
 for amendment of the Constitution by plebiscite in case of a
 deadlock between the executive and legislative branches of the
 Government. The document, which was the result of intense
 negotiations under the auspices of the Archbishop of Santiago,
 states that political parties that do not respect democratic
 principles are to be banned by a proposed constitutional
 tribunal. Although there is disagreement among Accord members
 regarding interpretation of several clauses, the National
 Accord implicitly accepts the 1980 Constitution if the present
 Government is willing to modify it in accordance with the
 principles set forth in the Accord.
 In its initial response, the Government noted certain positive
 elements in the Accord, but demanded greater clarity on other
 points. In December, however, the Government virtually
 rejected the Accord, claiming that public statements by the
 Accord signers were contradictory with respect to certain
 points, such as recognition of the 1980 Constitution, a clear
 position on the political proscription of Communists,
 unrestricted respect for private property, and a rejection of
 violence. The Government has not agreed to hold a dialogue
 with the democratic opposition.
 Political parties continue to be proscribed by law but
 function in an open manner, particularly since the State of
 Siege ended. The views and opinions of political leaders,
 including Communists, are published in the media, especially
 their comments on the National Accord.
 University students continued their political activities in
 1985, holding elections for a number of student federations at
 the end of October. Student demonstrations occurred in
 September and October on a number of campuses, often involving
 confrontations between demonstrators and the authorities, as
 student groups sought to reduce government control over the
 universities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government announced on October 18 that it was authorizing
 a visit to Chile by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission's Special Rapporteur, the result of the first
 official and formal contact with the UNHRC since 1979. The
 
 
 460
 CHILE
 Special Rapporteur was provided complete freedom to meet with
 all those concerned with human rights during his visit to
 Chile in December.
 The Government continues to refuse to cooperate with the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission and has denied
 permission for the Commission to enter Chile. A Commission
 report on Chile published in September, which covers the human
 rights situation from 1973 to 1985, was rejected by the
 Government as being biased and inconsistent with the
 Commission's mandate. Human rights groups welcomed the
 report, terming it the most detailed report ever on the human
 rights situation in Chile.
 Visits and investigations by private international human
 rights groups continued to be allowed by the Government.
 Representatives of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross regularly visit Chile to check on prison conditions.
 The American Committee for Human Rights sent a mission to
 Chile in July to investigate the use of torture, the role of
 the medical community in torture, and the psychological impact
 of torture on the general population. The mission was
 undertaken at the invitation of the Medical Association of
 Chile and the Chilean Commission for Human Rights. Amnesty
 International issued a report on Chile in September in which
 it expressed concern over human rights abuses by armed groups,
 particularly the Chilean Anti-Communist Action Group. The
 National Academy of Science Committee on Human Rights and the
 American Psychological and Psychiatric Associations also sent
 fact-finding missions to Chile in 1985.
 The Government contends that virtually all reports produced by
 foreign organizations deliberately distort the scope and
 volume of human rights abuses in Chile. Government spokesmen
 admit that there have-been human rights violations by
 individuals in the security forces but claim that complaints
 concerning such violations are investigated and that legal
 actions are taken against those individuals who are found to
 be involved. Human rights organizations note that government
 investigations rarely lead to fixing responsibility for
 violations and extremely few members of the security forces
 have been punished despite a large number of documented abuses.
 The Catholic Church since 1973 has taken the lead in defending
 human rights and supplying legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuse. Its Vicariate of Solidarity monitors the human rights
 situation from church offices throughout Chile, has issued
 objective monthly reports on human rights violations and has
 protected and defended significant numbers of people since
 1973. The church's activities have resulted in visible
 tensions between the Government and the church hierarchy.
 Some church activists and human rights lawyers have been
 threatened anonymously or have been the Victims of
 intimidation attacks by unidentified individuals. A member of
 the Vicariate staff was one of those kidnaped and murdered in
 March.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, a private
 organization directed by opposition political party figures,
 has also publicized alleged abuses and spoken out strongly
 against them, as well as issuing monthly reports on the human
 rights situation. It has been allowed to maintain
 affiliations with international human rights groups, and has
 
 
 461
 CHILE
 hosted visits by these groups to Chile. It devotes its
 efforts openly not only to human rights issues but also to
 political issues and to bringing about major changes in the
 nature of the Government. On November 29 two armed men broke
 into the offices of the Commission, and, after beating the
 caretaker, stole material related to the work of the
 Commission. There have been no arrests concerning this
 break-in. Human rights groups have expressed concern over the
 use of such methods of intimidation and believe that these
 assaults are an effort to terrorize those who work with or
 assist human rights and political organizations. Human rights
 groups are concerned that these incidents may mark the
 beginning of a "dirty war" by right-wing terrorist groups
 against those opposing the Government. Two of the victims of
 multiple assaults by unknown assailants departed Chile out of
 fear for their personal safety  Official investigations into
 such incidents have yet to produce arrests.
 Amnesty International Report 1985, covering 1984 events,
 expressed concern about the long-standing pattern of human
 rights violations, including the detention of political
 prisoners and the torture of detainees.
 Freedom House rated Chile "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Chile's population of 12.0 million grew at an annual rate of
 1.8 percent in 1985. The per capita gross domestic product
 was $1681.
 Chile suffered a severe recession in 1982 and agreed to a
 two-year standby program with the International Monetary Fund
 in January 1983 to provide essential support for balance of
 payments purposes and orderly external debt servicing. A
 follow-up three-year IMF extended fund facility took effect in
 August 1985. The new program limits the government's ability
 to further stimulate the economy, and to counteract the social
 effects of high unemployment and underemployment.
 Chile achieved a significant real GDP growth of 6.3 percent in
 1984. Tighter fiscal and monetary policies led to a
 government-estimated GDP growth rate of 2 percent for 1985.
 According to Chilean Central Bank statistics for 1985,
 inflation in 1985 was 26.4 percent and real wages declined by
 1.5 percent through October 31. Unemployment equaled 13
 percent down from 14.0 percent at the end of 1984, with the
 unemployment rate in the Santiago metropolitan area 16.3
 percent. Two government financed work projects aimed at
 unemployed people utilize 7.2 percent of the work force, and
 this number is often cited as the level of under employment in
 Chile.
 In 1984, 61 percent of all central budget expenditures went to
 social services. The Government focuses its social programs on
 the 15 percent of the population living below the absolute
 poverty level. Health and nutrition programs in Chile are
 extensive. The infant mortality rate was 21.8 per 1,000 live
 births in 1985, and average life expectancy at birth was 70.6
 years. In 1977, the caloric supply as a percentage of
 nutritional requirements was 105.4 percent. In 1980, 84
 percent of the population had access to safe water. The
 primary school enrollment ratio was 148.2 percent in 1980 and
 the adult literacy rate increased to 94.5 percent in 1984.
 
 
 462
 CHILE
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people between the
 ages of 14 and 15 may only be employed with the permission of
 their parents or guardians and if they have completed their
 schooling, and then only in restricted types of labor. Those
 between the ages of 15 and 18 can be employed in a larger
 variety of labor, and at expanded hours of labor, but only
 with their parents' or guardians' permission.
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health are regulated by law, although there have been
 criticisms that the minimum wage has not been adjusted
 expeditiously to keep pace with inflation. The law permits
 the hiring of apprentices, but has been revised so that a
 "less than minimum" wage may not be paid. The laws covering
 child labor are not abused, but supervision over the
 compliance of these laws is difficult. Regulations covering
 the hours of work are widely publicized, and the need to pay
 overtime is generally acknowledged. Enforcement on compliance
 is difficult due to budgetary restraints; however, no industry
 stands out as an obvious violator of these employment
 standards. There are also complaints that occupational health
 and safety laws are not adequately enforced.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. For
 example, the legal retirement age for women is five years
 lower than that for men. Married women may not conduct major
 commercial transactions unless a separation of goods contract
 is established at the time of the marriage, or through a
 subsequent special one-time authorization. Married women may
 not take children out of the country without the permission of
 the father. On the other hand, inheritance laws provide
 strong protection for wives and favor female over male heirs.
 Women now enjoy greater access to education and employment
 than in the past. In 1983, women made up 48.8 percent of the
 primary school enrollment, 50.5 percent of secondary school
 pupils and 40 percent of university students. In 1970, the
 last year for which a breakdown by sex is available, female
 literacy was 88.2 percent compared with 89.9 percent for
 males. Women have served in such important government
 positions as mayors, agency heads and ministers. Women enjoy
 good access to entry-level and mid-level professional jobs but
 do not hold a proportional number of upper-level positions.
 Minority groups do not suffer any specific legal
 discriminations. The only significant minority group, the
 Mapuche Indians from the southern region of Chile, remains
 partly separated from the rest of the society due to
 historical, cultural, educational, and geographic factors
 rather than official policy. The Government has attempted to
 integrate this group through, among other things, division of
 communal lands into individual land holdings, which has caused
 resistance among some Mapuches. There were no reports of
 members of this group being singled out for detention or
 banishment due to their being Mapuche Indians.
