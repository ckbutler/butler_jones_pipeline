 GUYANA
 Since Guyana became independent in 1966, the People's
 National Congress (PNC) party led by Prime Minister,
 now Executive President, Forbes Burnham has dominated
 the nation's political life. It draws its principal
 support from among the approximately 40 pecent of Guyanese
 of African descent and has declared itself a socialist
 party, operating on Marxist-Leninist principles, with
 the goal of making Guyana a non-aligned socialist cooperative
 republic. In the December 1980 general elections,
 the PNC was returned to power by a majority of 77 percent.
 International observers and many Guyanese have charged,
 with apparent justification, that the elections were
 conducted fraudulently and cannot be considered a free
 and fair test of public opinion.
 Guyanese of East Indian origin, a little over 50 percent
 of the total population, traditionally have backed
 to a great extent the main opposition party, the People's
 Progressive Party (PPP), headed by former Premier Cheddi
 Jagan. The PPP is an orthodox, Moscow-aligned communist
 party. Both major racial groups have supported their
 respective parties more from ethnic loyalties than
 from political conviction.' Both parties have sought
 to exploit racial animosities for political advantage.
 In mid-1979, a smaller, radical socialist group organized
 in 1974, the Working People's Alliance (WPA), was founded
 as a party. The WPA, too, professes tts commitment
 to building a socialist country. A leading WPA activist
 and well-known historian, Dr. Walter Rodney, was killed
 under suspicious circumstances in a bomb explosion
 in June 1980. In addition to these parties, there
 exists a handful of small, generally conservative,
 political groupings.
 Prime Minister Burnham's opponents have accused him
 of manipulating Guyana's Westminster-type political
 system and the judiciary to ensure continued PNC dom-
 ination, despite what they allege is shrinking popular
 support. They charge that Guyana's new constitution,
 promulgated in October 1980, institutes an executive
 presidency dominating the legislative branch, and that
 it is another step towards Burnham's goal of increasing
 and indefinitely retaining his personal political power.
 It is apparent that the new constitution gives legal
 recognition and protection to Burnham's already considerable
 de facto powers.
 It is also apparent that for some time there has been
 a blurring of the distinction between the ruling party
 and the government. This, together with the party's
 access to unaudited public funds and its full use of
 the advantages of incumbency, has reduced the ability
 of the opposition to challenge the government.
 The general Guyanese human rights environment has deteriorated
 in recent years. A worsening economic situation has
 contributed to this process, primarily by fostering
 discontent to which the government has sometimes responded
 with repressive measures. The government also has
 reacted strongly at times to perceived threats from
 an opposition which increasingly despairs of ever taking
 power legally.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The new Guyanese constitution prohibits torture.
 There have been credible charges by opponents of the
 government that the police have subjected persons
 arrested during anti-PNC activities to physical abuse
 such as kicking, punching, and burning with cigarettes.
 The government denies such charges.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The new constitution prohibits such treatment or punishment.
 However, critics have charged that Guyanese prisons
 and the treatment of prisoners fail to meet internationally-
 accepted standards. One knowledgeable official has
 said that inmates have occasionally been sprayed with
 chemical mace and beaten for infractions of prison
 rules. Prisoners usually are allowed visits by relatives
 and attorneys of their own choice. Although prisons
 are overcrowded and conditions are spartan for the
 nation's estimated 1,100 prisoners, the government
 has attempted to provide them with an adequate diet
 and medical care. There is no indication that there
 are political prisoners.
 The opposition repeatedly has charged that arresting
 officers have used excessive force and have refused
 to identify themselves as legally required. Some
 of these allegations appear well-founded. The past
 year has witnessed an increased use of lethal force
 by police. Several persons, including two members
 of the WPA, were killed in confrontations with the
 police. Some of these confrontations have taken place
 under mysterious circumstances, whereas others appear
 to have been defensible cases of appropriate force
 being used against armed criminals. However, no one
 has beeq brought to trial for these shootings. Guyana
 retains the death penalty, but the last execution
 took place in 1968. Since then, all those who have
 been sentenced to death have had their sentences commuted.
 Six persons currently face charges of treason, for
 which the maximum penalty is execution.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no reports of persons having been
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention by official or quasi-official security forces
 during 1980.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that no person may be deprived
 of personal liberty except as authorized by law.
 The right of habeas corpus exists and is generally
 respected. Nevertheless, the past year has seen several
 cases of individuals, usually suspected of links to
 the opposition, detained for short periods without
 charge under the National Security Act. The act permits
 detention without formal charges for up to three months.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 452
 he new ccnstituticn guarantees, the right to a fair trial
 by a court of law. It appears, on the basis of available
 evidence, that the government has respected the indepen-
 dence of the judiciary and the integrity of the judicial
 process, in ordinary civil or criminal cases. In
 cases perceived to be political in nature, the defendant
 does not always enjoy these guarantees. There have
 been no reports of secret trials nor have special
 courts been established for political offenses. Most
 delays in judicial proceedings appear to be due more
 to court backlogs resulting from personnel and material
 shortages than to deliberate design.
 The political opposition has charged that the government
 fails to respect the independence'of the judiciary
 and the integrity of the judicial process in cases
 involving suspected members of the radical opposition.
 In particular, these critics point to the Administration
 of Justice Act of 1978 and the Criminal Law Act of
 1980 as attempts by the government to alter judicial
 procedures to make it easier to convict political
 opponents of various offenses. The opposition and
 the Guyana Bar Association have been especially critical
 of the retroactive nature of certain provisions weakening
 the rules of evidence and increasing thd power of
 magistrates at the expense of judges and juries under
 the Criminal Law Act.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The Security Act allows the police to search for and
 seize illegal weapons, ammunition and explosives without
 a warrant. The past year has seen an increase in
 the number of complaints of searches of homes of suspected
 opponents of the government carried out in violation
 of constitutional guarantees, Police have conducted
 numerous searches of the homes of suspected opponents
 of the government, allegedly looking for weapons,
 and have seized "subversive" literature.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Vital Needs Such as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 In two of the last three years, Guyana's economy has
 experienced negative annual real growth rates and
 balance of payments deficits. Gross domestic product
 per capita and individual purchasing power have steadily
 declined in real terms over the past five years.
 Faced with a large negative level of foreign currency
 reserves (minus $100 million as of May 1980), the
 government has adopted strict import restrictions
 which have caused many popular consumer goods to disappear.
 Shortages of spare parts and equipment also have adversely
 affected the nation's productive capability. Official
 price controls on selected items such as flour, cooking
 oil, and some agricultural products have contributed
 to shortages, and consequently to a thriving black
 market.
 Because of a faulty distribution system which, according
 to the opposition, is characterized by political favoritism,
 the rural, predominantly East Indian areas have suffered
 more from these shortages than have the urban, largely
 black areas. Frequent and lengthy electrical outages,
 
 
 453
 caused by equipment malfunctions, oil shortages, and
 personnel inadequacies in the state-owned electric
 company, also have adversely affected production and
 the general quality of life.
 The poor performance of most of the state-run corporations
 has forced the government to rely heavily upon foreign
 assistance to carry on an ambitious investment program
 aimed at diversifying the economy and, to a lesser
 extent, raising the health and educational standards
 of the population. The government has also engaged
 in heavy borrowing from the domestic banking system.
 Facing the same problems as the rest of the economy,
 the small private sector has generally stagnated.
 The government states that its oft-repeated objectives
 of housing, clothing, and feeding the nation take
 precedence over traditional political rights. It
 has had some success in meeting these goals despite
 the deteriorating economic situation. The government
 has provided some subsidized housing, but less than
 the nation's requirements. Political favoritism in
 the provision of housing also affects the program.
 The trade unions, with modest foreign assistance,
 and the government-owned bauxite industry have provided
 some low-cost housing to Guyanese workers.
 Health care is provided virtually free to the consumer
 but is of poor quality and heavily dependent on foreign
 doctors. It suffers from a grave lack of qualified
 personnel, serious drug and equipment shortages, over-
 crowded and unsanitary facilities, and insufficient
 health-related education. Mental health care is inadequate.
 Much of the country suffers from short supplies of
 potable drinking water.
 Primary school enrollment was 94 percent in 1973,
 the last year for which official figures are available.
 Education through the university level is free, but
 suffers shortages in material and qualified teachers.
 The overall quality of education is deteriorating.
 The literacy rate is about 87 per cent. Although the
 government spends large sums annually to send students
 abroad for training, the opposition has charged that
 the selection process frequently is biased in favor
 of PNC supporters. The government in turn has complained
 that many of those sent abroad fail to return to Guyana.
 Opponents of the regime, pointing as evidence to the
 to sudden transfers of school directors and teachers
 suspected of links'to the opposition, have charged
 that the ruling party and the government seek to politicize
 the education process.
 Life expectancy at birth is 68 years and the infant
 mortality rate is 50 per 1,000 live births. As of
 1975, the population per physician was 3,270 and 190
 per hospital bed.
 The new constitution guarantees women equal rights
 with men removing certain inequities in the area of
 citizenship. Unwed mothers are also guaranteed equal
 rights with married mothers. Women tend to occupy
 the lowest paid jobs in the society, such as domestics,
 store clerks, secretaries, and receptionists. Both
 major political parties have large women's organizations.
 There are few women who are prominent in business
 
 
 454
 or the trade unions. At present there are three women
 cabinet ministers.   There are seven women in a parliament
 of 53 members as of late December 1980, with 12 additional
 representatives to be chosen in January 1981.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although the constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
 press, religion and assembly; the past two years have
 witnessed a significant curtailment of those rights
 by the government. The daily press and local radio
 are government-owned and serve as organs of the ruling
 party. The only private radio station was purchased
 by the government in 1979. Guyana does not have television.
 The government-owned media neither accept paid political
 announcements from the opposition nor carry direct
 criticism of either the prime minister or the PNC,
 although limited air time on the radio was offered
 to the opposition during the 1980 general election
 campaign for the first time in recent years. The
 government's opponents are largely restricted to two
 small weekly publications, the Catholic Standard and
 the organ of the pro-Moscow People's Progressive Party
 (PPP), The Mirror. Both publications appear in reduced
 format due to the regime's continued refusal to allow
 them access to newsprint or to the nationalized printing
 presses. Nevertheless, these papers are freely distributed,
 though in reduced numbers from previous years, and
 carry strongly anti-government news stories and editorials.
 In contrast to the limited access to newsprint by
 the opposition press, the official press, the ruling
 party press, several government-run enterprises, and
 the pro-government Trade Union Congress (TUC) have
 no difficulty in obtaining newsprint. The government
 has not permitted The Mirror to import free newsprint
 offered to it by newspapers abroad. During the past
 year, the government has sought to restrict further
 the population's access to outside news sources.
 It announced that as of July 1, local radio stations
 would no longer carry the BBC World News Service and
 that the state-owned press would cancel its contract
 with the regional Caribbean News Agency (CANA), as
 of January 8, 1981. The government specifically accused
 CANA of taking an anti-government slant and of employing
 WPA sympathizers as correspondents. The BBC service
 continues to be used, however, as no alternative had
 yet been found. The government subsequently announced
 agreements for 1981 with the Associated Press and
 Inter Press Service.
 Outside sources of information remain available to
 Guyanese. The anti-PNC monthly, Caribbean Contact,
 continues to be imported from Barbados and widely
 distributed. Time, Newsweek and other expensive foreign
 magazines appea-in limited numbers. The often-critical
 Radio Antilles and other regional radio stations,
 along with various shortwave broadcasts, are heard
 in Guyana.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed under the constitution.
 The government requires police permission for large
 public gatherings. The opposition holds that only
 
 
 455
 prior notification to the police of the intent to
 hold such a gathering should be required. In the
 past, the police and unidentified thugs, many of whom
 presumably are connected with the pro-government House
 of Israel sect (a group led by an American fugitive
 from justice), have dissolved unauthorized meetings
 and demonstrations, including recent ones by school
 children protesting the transfers of popular educators.
 The government generally has respected the right of
 citizens to practice their religion. A large number
 of religions and sects operate in Guyana. The Guyanese
 Roman Catholic hurch and the government have clashed
 over the Church's accusations of human rights's violations.
 Two foreign-born Jesuit priests were expelled from
 their Amerindian parish this year for allegedly residing
 in the remote region illegally and for fomenting subversion.
 The priests have not as yet been replaced.
 In 1979, a British-born Jesuit working as a photographer
 for the Catholic Standard was murdered before numerous
 witnesses, allegedly by a member of the House of Israel
 sect. This sect has apparently received official
 protection and has strong connections to the PNC.
 Although a suspect was arrested, the case has yet
 to be heard in court. A weekly religious program
 by an American evangelist was banned from local radio
 after the government alleged that the program contained
 slurs against the House of Israel. The opposition
 has accused the sect of providing "hit men" for the
 government. Sect members have participated in breaking
 up anti-regime demonstrations and in 1979 were used
 by the government as strike breakers against the politically
 independent Clerical and Commercial Workers' Union
 (CCWU).
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel,     Emigration and Repatriation.
 Except for some isolated Amerindian areas protected
 by the government, there is freedom to move about
 the country. Opponents of the regime have reported
 being stopped on highways by security forces and subjected
 to searches and harassment. The government has sought
 to prevent certain opposition members from travelling
 abroad by subjecting them to unreasonable searches
 and delays at the airport, occasionally even resorting
 to attempts at physically removing individuals from
 waiting aircraft. These generally unsuccessful attempts
 have been strongly resisted and even challenged successfully
 in the courts in some instances.
 Continued emigration results in a serious loss of
 talented manpower. Nevertheless, in spite of persistent
 rumors to the contrary, the government has not sought
 to interfere with the right to emigrate. Tourist
 and business travel abroad by Guyanese is hampered
 by the nation's strict foreign exchange laws and by
 the difficulties many experience in meeting foreign
 visa requirements.
 There have been no recorded instances of political
 opponents of the government being denied re-entry
 to Guyana. However, the Jamaican-citizen wife of one
 prominent WPA leader was recently refused entry into
 Guyana without explanation.
 
 
 456
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 process
 The parliamentary elections due to be held in October
 1978 finally took place in December 1980. The delay
 was based on, votes in 1978 and 1979 by the PNC-dominated
 parliament to extend its life in order to complete
 the drafting of the new constitution. The December
 1980 elections, in which 82 percent of the registered
 voters allegedly participated and which returned the
 PNC to power with a claimed majority of 77 percent
 of those voting, have been characterized by a private
 international team of observers headed by Lord Avebury
 of the United Kingdom as "not a free and fair test
 of public opinion." Evidence collected by the Lord
 Avebury team and other outside observers leads to
 the conclusion that there were numerous irregularities
 in the conduct of the elections and that little faith
 can be placed in the results which were announced.
 The new constitution creates an executive president
 with powers greater than those legally available to
 the previous figurehead president and to the prime
 minister. The constitution also establishes some
 consultative, parliamentary-type organs with no clear
 powers. The constitution stresses new socio-economic
 rights such as the rights to leisure and employment,
 and the right of youth to fair treatment, rather than
 the traditional political rights of the individual.
 By law, all citizens are eligible to participate in
 the political process, and citizenship may not be
 denied on political grounds. In fact, participation
 in opposition political groups has led to reprisals
 by the government. These reprisals have included
 dismissal from employment, interruption of supplies
 to businessmen, attacks in the official press, police
 harassment, transfers to remote sections of the country,
 and denial of earned promotions and benefits.
 Available information indicates that the government
 was implicated in the June 13 death of WPA activist
 Walter Rodney and in the subsequent removal of key
 witnesses from the country. The extent of the possible
 government involvement in Rodney's death and its exact
 nature remain to be established. In addition to his
 prominent political role with the WPA, Rodney was
 well known throughout the Caribbean as a scholar,
 and his violent death resulted in strong criticism
 from many people in the region. The government has
 claimed that Rodney died when a bomb, illegally in
 his possession, accidentally detonated.
 Guyana's organized labor movement traditionally has
 been active, independent and democratic. The law
 establishes and protects the workers' rights to organize,
 strike, and bargain collectively. The government
 and the major opposition political parties, however,
 each seek to compromise the labor movement's independence.
 They control labor unions and attempt to use them
 to achieve political objectives. There have been
 numerous allegations of official meddling in the internal
 politics of unions, and such charges appear justified.
 The October 1980 Trade Union Congress (TUC) convention,
 for example, was the scene of generally successful
 efforts to make sure that organized labor would be
 
 
 457
 led by safely pro-government and pro-PNC figures.
 The regime has taken actions against specific unions.
 During a solidarity strike in 1979, 82 members of *
 the politically-independent Clerical and Commercial
 Workers' Union (CCWU) were dismissed from their positions
 with various state-owned corporations. Their jobs
 were allocated to supporters of the ruling party.
 The majority of those workers dismissed have not been
 offered reemployment by the government. The government
 claims that it will respect the right to strike by
 unions on purely industrial matters, but that it reserves
 the right to retaliate against unions engaging in
 *political* strikes. Despite requests by the Trade
 Union Congress, the government has failed to provide
 criteria by which strikes will be judged 'political*.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The most frequently heard charge against the regime
 is that the ruling party has rigged all elections
 from 1968 through 1980. Most recently the opposition
 has charged that the December 15, 1980 general elections
 were no different, and that the government therefore
 had closed off the main avenue for peaceful democratic
 change. The government refused to accede to opposition
 demands that the election be supervised and observed
 officially b_ impartial outsiders on the grounds that
 to do so would violate Guyana's sovereignty.
 In 1980, the Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA)
 was founded. The GHRA publishes a newsletter, sponsors
 public discusions, and attempts to document and inves-
 tigate charges against the government of human rights
 violations. The government has not interfered with
 the organization.
 Guyana belongs to several international bodies, including
 the United Nations and Caribbean Common Market, but
 aside from frequent criticism of apartheid in southern
 Africa, it has not been active in international efforts
 relating to the promotion of human rights.
 International observers were permitted to attend the
 trial for arson of three WPA activists (including
 the late Walter Rodney) which began in June 1980.
 Observers came from Amnesty International, the British
 parliamentary human rights group, the National Conference
 of Black Lawyers, the National Council of Churches
 and the United States Embassy in Georgetown. One
 Trinidadian labor union observer well known for his
 opposition to the Guyanese government was expelled
 from Guyana after participating in a pro-WPA rally.
