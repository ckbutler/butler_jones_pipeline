 GUYANA
 The Cooperative Republic of Guyana, a member of the British
 Commonwealth, is a small, multiracial, developing nation on
 the South American continent, which culturally and politically
 is considered to be a part of the Caribbean. A unicameral
 Parliament is chosen by direct election in a multiparty
 political system. The head of the majority party in
 Parliament is elected Executive President. Under the 1980
 Constitution, parliamentary and regional municipal elections
 are held at least every 5 years. The People's National
 Congress (PNC), currently led by President Hugh Desmond Hoyte,
 has dominated political life since the 1964 elections. The
 opposition parties boycotted the December 1986 municipal
 elections, the first scheduled since the early 1970's,
 alleging that they would not be free and fair due to ruling
 party control of the electoral machinery.
 Guyanese society and political life are influenced by ethnic
 differences between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. Urban
 Afro-Guyanese dominate the ruling PNC, the Guyana Police Force
 (GPF), the Guyana Defence Force (GDF), and other security
 forces, while Indo-Guyanese predominate in the agricultural
 and business sectors. President Hoyte has continued efforts
 to bring more Indo-Guyanese into party and ministerial
 positions.
 The Guyana Police Force has primary responsibility for
 maintaining law and order throughout Guyana. In addition, the
 Customs and Excise Department, and various branches of the
 Special Constabulary, have arrest authority within certain
 well-defined limits. The Police and Constabulary, along with
 the GDF, the Guyana National Service, the Guyana People's
 Militia, Guyana Prisons Service and the Customs and Excise
 Department are directly responsible to the civilian Government.
 Public corporations control two of Guyana's major export
 industries, sugar and bauxite, which employ about 17 percent
 of the work force. The third principal export industry, rice,
 is primarily in private hands, Despite the Government's
 efforts to enhance the role of the private sector and
 encourage private foreign and domestic investment, the economy
 continued to be plagued by external debt, sluggish growth, and
 a deteriorating infrastructure.
 Human rights concerns in Guyana continue to center on police
 abuse of persons arrested, limitations on press freedom, and
 questionable electoral practices. However, the improved
 atmosphere noted since the 1985 change of government
 continued. The 1988 report of the Guyana Human Rights
 Association (GHRA) stated that "the pervading fear which
 enveloped the society during the latter years of the Burnham
 era evaporated." The GHRA cautioned, however, that "certain
 institutional features remain in place which limit the
 enjoyment" of certain freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings are known to have occurred.
 Summary executions do not take place.
 
 
 591
 GUYANA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. However, the
 Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA), in its 1988 "Brief on
 Police violence," expressed its "growing concern" over "the
 use of violence by the police and its apparent acceptance by
 society at large." It also stated its belief that "those
 responsible for excessive violence constitute a small element
 within the force as a whole." The brief included affidavits
 from persons who claimed that they had been assaulted by
 police. Police regulations call for internal investigation of
 all charges, and some police officers have been disciplined or
 fined. In August one case was referred to the Director of
 - Public Prosecution for possible criminal'charges. Civil and
 criminal suits may also be brought against police officers by
 private citizens. Such suits have resulted in sentencing of
 members of the police force in the past, but critics charge
 that police discourage complainants from bringing suit.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person may be deprived of
 personal liberty except as authorized by law, and also calls
 for judicial determination of the legality of detention.
 During 1988 no persons were arrested, detained, or exiled for
 their political views. The National Security Act permits the
 detention without charges for up to 3 months of persons who
 are deemed (by officials at the ministerial level) likely to
 act "in any manner prejudicial to public safety or public
 order or the defence of Guyana." To date, however,.no one has
 been detained under provisions of the Act.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under Guyana's British common law system, the Constitution
 provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is
 respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system,
 and defendants are granted fair public trials. Defendants are
 represented by counsel, court appointed when necessary.
 Timely charges are presented, and appeal can be made to higher
 courts. There are no political prisoners or special courts
 for political security cases. Some opposition figures have
 expressed concern over the courts' rulings in certain cases
 involving government interests, such as in libel suits brought
 by government officials (see also Section 2.a.). Opposition
 lawyers complain that the judiciary is prone to grant lengthy
 postponements in trials affecting the Government or law
 enforcement officials; however, postponements are routinely
 granted to both the defense and prosecution. Delays in
 judicial proceedings are most often caused by shortages of
 trained court administrative personnel.
 A February inquest into the 1980 death in a bomb explosion of
 Walter Rodney, leader of the Marxist Working People's Alliance
 (WPA), concluded that Rodney died by "accident or
 misadventure." The WPA had contended that the Government
 
 
 592
 GUYANA
 placed the bomb. Opposition groups rejected the inquest's
 findings, noting that key witnesses were not able to testify.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respected the right to privacy. Some
 opposition politicians alleged incidents of government
 surveillance. The law permits police of the rank of inspector
 and above to conduct searches for narcotics and arms without
 search warrants but with probable cause. The laws requiring
 judicially issued warrants for all other searches were
 respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitutional provision for freedom of speech is respected
 and Guyanese can, and do, criticize their Government and its
 policies.
 The only public television station, Guyana Television (GTV
 10), was founded in January. Its broadcasting consists thus
 far of a 1-hour program on Sundays, although a nightly
 15-minute news program, which generally presents the
 Government's point of view, is provided to the country's two
 private television stations. The two private stations
 normally broadcast satellite transmissions from the United
 States, including uncensored network news. The country's only
 radio station, the Guyana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), is
 selective in reporting the views and activities of opposition
 parties. Some of the GBC's radio interview and commentary
 programs allow public criticism of the Government, but, in
 general, they reflect government policies. Foreign and
 regional radio stations can be heard on medium and shortwave
 bands.
 In the past the Government, through ownership of the country's
 only daily newspaper and radio station, issuance of import
 licenses for newsprint and printing presses, and control of
 most hard currency, maintained varying degrees of control over
 the media. This control, however, eased in 1987 and 1988.
 The independent Stabroek News, for example, increased its
 publication from once to twice a week in January. Newsprint
 availability remained a problem, but this reflected foreign
 exchange considerations and not political ones. In mid-1988
 government, opposition, and independent reporters, editors and
 publishers resuscitated the long-dormant Guyana Press
 Association.
 Individual members of the Government have sometimes brought
 libel suits against publishers which critics claim was to
 discourage press criticism of the Government. In March
 President Hoyte was awarded $10,500 in libel damages from the
 Catholic Standard newspaper over two articles which were
 published in 1982 (when he was Vice President for Economic
 Planning and Finance). Also, in 1988 libel suits were filed
 by individual police officers against the GHRA over its "Brief
 on Police Violence," and against the independent Stabroek News
 for its reporting on the Brief. On one occasion in late 1988,
 officials of a newspaper were formally warned by a police
 official that there was a possibility of-prosecution arising -
 from a previously published article.
 
 
 593
 GUYANA
 In 1988 the government-owned daily newspaper, the Guyana
 Chronicle, continued to expand coverage of news and
 commentaries that differ from government views. Independent
 periodicals were free to criticize the Government and its
 policies. Information on government activities and operations,
 however, is carefully controlled. In April 1988, Parliament
 passed the Public Corporations Act, which includes clauses
 that provide for the fining and imprisonment of employees of
 public corporations who disclose unauthorized information
 about government activities and operations. By year's end no
 one had been charged under the law. Guyanese can receive
 printed materials from abroad without restrictions, but scarce
 foreign exchange limits their availability. Certain regional
 newspapers and international news magazines, which often
 contain-criticism of the Guyanese Government, are, however,
 regularly available.
 The Government's record on academic freedom continues to be
 good. Several opposition activists in the GHRA and the
 Marxist WPA teach at the public University of Guyana, and
 opposition parties have also organized student groups there.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Public Order Act requires police permits for mass political
 meetings. At his discretion, the police commissioner without
 explanation can refuse permission-for a public meeting. In
 1988 opposition parties organized numerous rallies and marches,
 although they complained that permission to hold such events
 was at times arbitrarily denied. The Government imposes no
 restrictions on joining private associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of thought and religion.
 There is no favored or official state religion. All religions
 in Guyana are allowed to select their places of worship and
 are free to maintain their links with coreligionists in other
 countries. Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and Baha'i communities
 in Guyana practice their religions without restrictions.
 There are no restrictions on travel for religious purposes
 overseas, nor on training of clergy, religious publishing,
 conversion, religious education, or charitable activities. In
 1988 foreign Catholic priests did not encounter the
 bureaucratic delays which they had faced in earlier years in
 obtaining or renewing visas. The Government allowed the
 establishment of a second mission of Mother Teresa nuns, as
 well as the entrance of three Benedictine monks to establish
 Guyana's first monastery.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is provided for in the
 Constitution. Travel to certain Amerindian areas requires
 government permission, a regulation dating from colonial times
 designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation.
 The GHRA, opposition politicians, and some clergy contend that
 permits are routinely denied to missionaries and non-PNC
 politicians, and that the regulations are being used to
 maintain PNC influence among the Amerindians. Guyanese are
 free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to return. Guyana is
 neither a refugee receiving nor generating country. There are
 no forced resettlements or displaced persons, and citizenship
 is not denied on political grounds.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guyanese are free to express their political views and to join
 or support a variety of political parties-. All citizens 18
 years of age or older are eligible to participate in the
 political process and to vote. National and regional
 elections, by secret ballot, are held at least every 5 years.
 The leader of the winning party is elected President and forms
 a Cabinet.
 Opposition parties vigorously criticize the Government and are
 free to field candidates for election. Since 1964, however,
 the People's National Congress (PNC), a predominantly Afro-
 Guyanese Party, has dominated political life through
 questionable electoral practices. Opposition parties regularly
 charge the ruling party with fraudulent practices. Following
 the 1985 elections, opposition parties, including the Communist
 People's Progressive Party (PPP), joined in the Patriotic
 Coalition for Democracy (PCD). The PCD seeks such reforms in
 Guyana's election laws as the counting of ballots at the
 polling places rather than at a central counting place. The
 PCD charges that without such changes the PNC will continue to
 dominate the electoral process and deny the country free and
 fair elections. The Integrity Commission, appointed by the
 Government in 1986 to investigate the need for a Code of
 Ethics for public officials, also called for electoral reform,
 including greater dialog with opposition parties. To date the
 Government has taken no action on this recommendation.
 Political parties are organized generally along ethnic lines,
 a situation that predates independence. President Hoyte has
 appointed a number of Indo-Guyanese to ministerial and other
 government positions and attracted still others to the PNC.
 Although not yet in large numbers, women play some role in
 both the ruling PNC and the opposition parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government regards outside criticism of its human rights
 practices as interference in its internal affairs but has
 taken no action to hamper investigations.  In 1988 the
 government-owned media continued to pay increased attention to
 human rights matters, reporting on charges of abuses and
 subsequent investigations. The GHRA, the most active human
 rights group, functions without government interference. The
 GHRA is a nongovernmental organization formed in 1979 with
 support from trade unions, professional organizations, and
 churches, and it issues periodic press releases and publishes
 an annual report on human rights in Guyana. It also gathers
 information from members, victims of abuse, trade unionists,
 churchmen, other interested parties, official documents, and
 newspapers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for fundamental rights to all
 persons in Guyana. Guyanese society and political life,
 nonetheless, continue to be influenced by ethnic differences
 between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese. The ruling PNC and
 government agencies are dominated largely by Afro-Guyanese
 while Indo-Guyanese dominate the agricultural and business
 
 
 595
 GUYANA
 sectors. Guyana has a small ethnic Amerindian population,
 composed of nine tribal groups, living in scattered
 reservations throughout the country. Relative to most
 Guyanese, their standard of living is low. The GHRA has
 alleged that Amerindians are subjected to government control
 of their leaders and land titles, as well as limitations on
 access to their reservations by priests and other outsiders.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex. Women are found at all levels and in all types of
 employment, but they only infrequently occupy positions of
 major responsibility and authority. Women in Guyana primarily
 fulfill the traditional roles of homemaker and mother but are
 increasingly entering the salaried economy. The Constitution
 provides women the right to equal pay for equal work, but
 average wages for women remain considerably below those for
 men. In 1988 women were allowed for the first time to file
 their own income tax returns, regardless of their marital
 status. There are no discriminatory family laws or
 restrictions on women's rights to own property. There are no
 groups that focus primarily on women's rights.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution
 under a section which specifically enumerates a person's right
 "to form or belong to trade unions." Aproximately 80,000 of
 Guyana's estimated 240,000 workers are organized. Unions are
 free to choose their own representatives, and union elections
 are vigorously contested. The views.nf trade unions and trade
 unionists are widely publicized in both the government-
 controlled and independent media. Unions are free to determine
 policies to represent their members' interests. Workers in
 Guyana have the right to strike; the major strike of 1988 was
 a general strike in the sugar industry which ended
 inconclusively in February after 28 days. The Government has
 the authority to declare any strike "political" or "illegal"
 but has not done so since the late 1970's.
 Political parties, particularly the ruling PNC, wield
 significant influence in a number of unions, and political
 figures often assume dual roles as trade union leaders.
 Seventeen of the 24 unions affiliated with the Guyana Trades
 Union Congress (TUC), the labor umbrella organization, are
 either controlled by or affiliated with the PNC. The largest
 union, the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers' Union, is
 affiliated with the opposition People's Progressive Party.
 There are several independent unions in the TUC, including two
 unions in the bauxite industry and one in the sugar industry.
 The 1988 TUC conference held in September ended in disarray
 when seven unions walked out in protest against heavy-handed
 electioneering tactics by PNC activists who attended the
 conference as delegates. These unions formed a Federation of
 Independent Trade Unions (FITUG) but have not formally left
 the TUC. FITUG has renewed the longstanding call for a reform
 of the TUC to redistribute internal power and safeguard the
 independence of the movement from political influence. As the
 year ended, the Government initiated a number of measures
 which appeared to be an attempt to intimidate the breakaway
 unions: it dismissed the chairman of FITUG from his
 government job; a government-owned bank moved to foreclose the
 mortgage it holds on the headquarters of a FITUG union, the
 
 
 596
 GUYANA
 Guyana Mineworkers' Union; and the Government informed another
 FITUG member, the Guyana Public Servants Union (GPSU), that it
 was suspending government agency collection of dues paid to
 GPSU under a collective agreement.
 The trade union movement has limited influence beyond issues
 directly related to industrial relations. Unionists and their
 property are not specifically protected by law. Under the
 Trades Union Act, property of trade unions is ves-ted in the
 unions' trustees for the use and benefit of the union and its
 members.
 Guyana sent a tripartite delegation to the 74th Session of the
 International Labor Organization Conference in Geneva in June.
 Guyana is not a voting member, however, because of its
 financial arrears to the organization. The TUC is affiliated
 with the Caribbean Congress of Labor and the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Unions freely maintain
 relations with recognized international trade union and
 professional groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain collectively exists in
 law and practice in both the public and private sector. In
 1987, the most recent year for which figures are available
 from the Ministry of Labor, 18 collective bargaining
 agreements were concluded. The 1984 Amendment to the Labor
 Act gave centralized bargaining power to the TUC in
 negotiations in the public-sector. That law, however, was
 overturned by a court decision in 1987, which held that
 constitutionally mandated consultations had not been held
 during consideration of the bill. In February a bill, which
 amended the Constitution, reinstated the Act, but only after
 the centralized collective bargaining provisions had been
 eliminated.
 The Chief Labor Officer and his staff at the Ministry of Labor
 provide consultation services. Disputes are frequently
 settled through consultation and dialog without resorting to
 industrial action. During the sugar industry strike, however,
 this process did little to help resolve the dispute. There
 were no known cases of antiunion discrimination. There are no
 special areas or industries where collective bargaining is
 impeded or discouraged; labor laws and regulations are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist in Guyana. Section
 140.(l) of the Constitution provides for freedom from slavery
 or servitude, and Section 140.(2) for freedom from forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Minimum age laws are set out in the Factories Act and the
 Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act. Under
 the law, no person under 14 years of age shall be employed in
 any industrial undertaking and no person under 16 shall be
 employed at night, except under regulated circumstances.
 Government policy, however, is stricter: no one under 18 can
 be employed outside the family. In addition, the terms
 "industry* and "factory" as used in the law have been
 interpreted by the Ministry of Labor to encompass nearly all
 
 
 597
 GUYANA
 workplaces except offices and retail shops. According to the
 law, children under age 14 may be employed only in enterprises
 in which members of the same family are employed. The Ministry
 of Labor monitors compliance with minimum age laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hours of employment are set under the Factories Act and vary
 by industry and sector. Most workers work an 8-hour day and a
 40-hour week. The Ministry of Labor monitors compliance with
 laws on maximum hours. Occupational health and safety
 standards are also treated under the Factories Act. The
 Occupational Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of
 Labor conducts factory inspections and investigates charges of
 substandard workplaces and conditions. The Ministry of Labor
 report for 1987 states, however, that this division has been
 hampered by understaffing and inadequate funding.
 The 1987 agreement between the Government and theTUC, which
 established the minimum wage at the equivalent of $2.35 per
 day at the prevailing official exchange rate contained an
 automatic 5 percent increase for 1988, making the current
 minimum wage the equivalent of $2.49. This wage is considered
 inadequate to support workers and their families, primarily
 because inflation has outstripped wage increases.
