 ALGERIA
 
 Algeria is a developing country whose people and leaders
 have been deeply affected by the crucible of a long, bitter
 struggle for independence. Notwithstanding the Algerian
 constitution, political and civil liberties are restricted;
 and the closed nature of Algerian society makes obtaining
 accurate information difficult. Since the advent of Chadli
 Bendjedid's presidency in February 1979 political prisoners
 have been released from house arrest and prison, and former
 President Ahmend Ben Bella has been moved to a comfortable
 villa, where he enjoys some local freedom of movement and is
 subject to fewer restrictions.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law, and there are few known cases
 of its use in Algeria since independence. There have been
 reports during the past year that torture upon occasion has
 occurred, but these reports are not specific and details are
 lacking.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although punishment for security related crimes may be
 severe and include the death penalty or life imprisonment,
 there are no reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment. A State Security Court sentenced to death three
 people in March 1976 as part of an "international anti-
 Algerian subversive network" in connection with an attack on
 the office of the state controlled newspaper El Moudjahid.
 In May 1976 a foreigner was sentenced to death in absentia
 for "economic espionage". Eventually these sentences were
 commuted by President Boumediene to life imprisonment. In
 May 1978 a Spanish citizen was sentenced to death in
 connection with an assassination attempt against Antonio
 Cubillo, leader of the Movement for the Autonomy and
 Independence of the Canary Archipelago, but this sentence
 has been commuted to life imprisonment.
 There have been several instances where death sentences have
 been commuted and the prisoners later released. Those
 released have included Major Mohammed Mellah and his
 colleagues, who plotted a coup against President Boumediene
 in 1967 and who were released in April 1979.
 Prison conditions vary from primitive to modern. In the
 primary civil prison in Algiers (El-Harrach) prisoners are
 jammed into cells and sanitary conditions are poor. Better
 conditions are found in some reopened smaller outlying
 prisons and jails.
 All prisons have medical facilities, and each prison has a
 contract with a local doctor who visits the prison regularly
 to treat ill prisoners. Prisoners who are seriously ill may
 be transferred to local hospitals. Prison diet is barely
 adequate, and the prisoners' families often provide much of
 their food. Families are allowed to visit prisoners and, in
 some cases, at the discretion of local prison authorities,
 conjugal visits are permitted.

 Attorneys of prisoners are allowed regular access to their
 clients. Their meetings take place under the visual
 supervision of a guard.
 Prisoners convicted of civil crimes are quartered apart from
 those convicted for crimes such as terrorism, but the
 treatment is generally similar. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross does not have access to detainees or
 prisoners.
 c.   Arbitary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Algerian Constitution of November 19, 1976, states that
 no one can be prosecuted, arrested or held except in cases
 provided for by law and that detention for questioning in
 criminal investigation cases cannot exceed 48 hours. This
 time period can be extended once for another 48 hours after
 which the suspect must be charged or released. The urban
 police and the more rurally oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to this constitutional law. Military Security (SM),
 however, seems to operate under fewer actual restrictions
 and has been known to hold suspects up to a month before
 releasing or charging them.
 SM is authorized to investigate not only military offenses,
 but more importantly, cases involving internal security and
 foreign intelligence collection. It can also investigate
 civil crimes that would ordinarily be under police
 jurisdiction.
 Once charged, an individual can be held under preventive
 detention while his case is being investigated. Given the
 crowded court dockets and number of cases under investigation,
 this period of preventive detention can last many months.
 The Department of State knows of no recent cases where
 people have "disappeared" for protracted periods.
 Since the advent of President Bendjedid, all prominent
 political prisoners have apparently been released. In the
 case of former President Ben Bella, he is free to move
 within the provincial district of M'Sila, 290 kilometers
 from Algiers, but may not leave the country, come to the
 capital, or receive foreign visitors or the press. The
 regime allows him to receive Algerian visitors, however.
 Ben Bella, who had been held incommunicado since the 1965
 coup led by former President Boumediene, has never been
 charged with any crime. Former pre-independence Algerian
 political leaders such as Ferhat Abbas and Ben Youssell
 Benkhedda, who had been placed under house arrest in 1975 by
 former President Boumediene after signing a public statement
 critical of the regime, were released shortly after Bendjedid
 came into power.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The adequacy of trial procedures under the current
 government as yet is unknown. In a recent case, the SM
 detained the mayor of a town near Algiers, who was then
 charged with bribery and corruption. The court's examining
 magistrate carefully examined members of the mayor's staff
 who had given evidence. They admitted that SM had coerced
 them into signing false accusations. The judge eventually
 threw out the case and the mayor remains in office today.
 
 
 Defendants have free access to counsel and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel by the government. As far as
 is known, defendants are made fully aware of the charges
 against them at the time they are bound over for trial. The
 judicial system is divided into three parts: civil courts,
 military courts, and state security courts. The civil
 courts are generally independent of executive or military
 control. Military courts deal directly with offenses
 committed by military personnel such as AWOL and theft, and
 also with espionage. The National Security Court at Medea
 meets for important cases of national security and adheres
 generally to the same standards as regular civilian courts.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the citizen's home is guaranteed by the
 constitution and is generally honored in practice. With the
 exception of SM, police forces may not enter a house without
 a warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating
 magistrate. In addition, police and other security forces
 may not enter a residence during night hours. There are
 occasions, however, when SM has made unauthorized searches.
 It is doubtful that any of the personnel involved in these
 activities have been disciplined.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Algerian economy is largely socialist, with the main
 economic sectors in the hands of the state-owned companies.
 Income distribution is reasonably equitable and the tax
 system is highly progressive. The greater than 3 percent
 national birth rate has placed-a major burden on the
 country's ability to meet its food and social needs.
 Algerian food supplies are essentially controlled by the
 Government. One third of the nation's food needs must be
 provided by imports because of the country's inefficient
 agricultural sector. While food supplies are adequate,
 their cost is high and distribution is irregular and uneven.
 Despite evidence of greater Government concern about
 agriculture, the absence of a new national economic plan has
 delayed the long term priority commitment required to meet
 national needs.
 Housing is in extremely short supply, but efforts to correct
 the shortage are underway. Most health care is rudimentary,
 but free and widely available. Education is free in Algeria
 through university level. It is compulsory between the ages
 of six and thirteen. Educational facilities, however, are
 generally inadequate in both rural and urban areas, despite
 extensive Government efforts to improve the educational
 opportunities of a rapidly growing population. The literacy
 level in Arabic, French, or both is approximately 35 percent
 of the population.
 Corruption exists in Algeria, limited for the most part to
 higher levels of the government. It does not, however,
 appear to hinder development or the fulfillment of vital
 human needs. There are also indications that the Government
 may be planning a campaign against corrupt officials within
 its ranks.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although the constitution guarantees freedom of expression
 and assembly, it states that they may not be used to
 undermine the foundations of the socialist revolution. All
 of the printed and electronic media, including foreign
 publications, are controlled or monitored by the Government.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines have been seized. The
 widely read French language publication Jeune Afrique is
 proscribed.
 Although officially an Islamic country, Algeria protects the
 rights of the small Christian and Jewish minorities, and of
 the ethnic Berber minority. On several occasions, the
 government has intervened to prevent desecration of
 Christian and Jewish cemeteries and places of worship.
 While there are generally no legal impediments to freedom of
 assembly, there is only one legal party, the National
 Liberation Front (FLN), and one umbrella labor union, the
 General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA). These and other
 national "mass organizations" for youth, women, farmers and
 veterans are the primary recognized associations in Algeria.
 Public gatherings are closely watched by security personnel.
 Limited political opposition, such as student demonstrations,
 is tolerated and opposition political tracts circulate with
 almost certain knowledge of the Government. In addition, a
 significant number of workers have successfully used strikes,
 without the sanction of the national union, to win greater
 pay and benefits.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate
 is guaranteed by law and is generally respected in practice.
 One of the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to
 remove the exit visa requirement for Algerians traveling
 abroad. The amount of hard currency which Algerians may
 carry abroad has been doubled but remains the primary
 limitation on foreign travel. These changes have resulted
 in significantly increased Algerian travel abroad. Except
 for diplomats, who must apply for permission to travel
 farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted. Visitors must fill out
 police registration forms if they are staying overnight in a
 locality. The gendarmerie occasionally sets up vehicular
 check points in the countryside to verify ownership and
 physical condition of vehicles and occasionally to impress
 the populace with the Government's vigilance.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Algeria's single party, the FLN, dominates the political
 system and nominates all candidates. Most political
 decisions are taken by the government and party leadership
 headed by President Chadli Bendjedid. Participation in the
 political process is largely limited to the single party,
 and there is little freedom to deviate significantly from
 the path prescribed by ruling authorities.
 
 
 717
 The status of women in Algeria is changing, but tradition
 and culture make it difficult for any woman to follow an
 independent path, including political participation. Women
 are legally equal to men, but in fact exercise less freedom
 than men. The great majority of Algerian women remain in
 "traditional" roles, but their participation in public life
 is growing. There is no educational discrimination per se
 against women. In the cities, there are significant numbers
 of women lawyers, doctors, teachers, and nurses (over half
 the current enrollment in medical schools is female).
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Government has not allowed foreign or international
 organizations to visit Algeria to investigate alleged
 violations of human rights. Because it also has not
 permitted representatives of the United Nations High
 Commission on Refugees to monitor provision of relief
 supplies to western Sahara refugees, the Commission and
 several countries, including the U. S., have suspended
 assistance to refugees. At the same time, however, foreign
 journalists and various "neutral observers" have visited
 these camps. With the relaxation of restrictions on former
 President Ben Bella and other political prisoners, the
 Government has responded to the main criticism leveled
 against it by such organizations as Amnesty International.
