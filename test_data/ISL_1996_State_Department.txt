 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which de-
 termine the distribution of wer among political parties and leaders.
 Elected officials control te police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces
 the laws that ensure protection of human rights.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold pri-
 vate property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading ex-
 port, marine products, accounts for almost 80 percent of export revenues.
 The Government fully respects the human ights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has
 begun to address.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good, but most prisons are
 full, and many are antiquated. The Government has begun a construction program
 to alleviate these difficulties.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this proiition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tial.-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary_, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Ministry
 of Justie administers the lower ourt system, while the Su p reme Court guards its
 independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multjudge panels are common,
 especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defend-
 ants are presumed innocent. They are guaranteed the right of access to legal coun-
 sel of their own choosing in time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable
 to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be
 present at their trial, to confront witnesses and to participate otherwise in the jpro-
 ceedings. No groups are barred from testiyng, and all testimony is treated alike.
 Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants
 have the right to appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Intererence With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this
 right in practice.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights and the Government re-
 setthem    in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid
 claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in
 1996. The Government responded to the UNHCR's request that it take in refugees
 from the former Yugoslavia by accepting 31 in 1996. The Icelandic Red Cross and
 the to0wn of Isordur, where the refgees were settled, made significant efforts to
 begin incorrating them into Icelandic society.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the
 Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.
 There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics. There is an active feminist political party, the Women s List,
 which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of AUeged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their fildings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and
 opposed to discrimination based on any of these Tactors. Government legislation and
 practice generally reflect this attitude.
 Women.-Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting
 from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffening of sentencing for sex offenders.
 The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly
 enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation
 procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns
 that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure victims of such
 abuses proper attention and consideration.
 There is a public women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350
 women and 200 children per year;, these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995.
 There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's oraniza-
 tions; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are
 funded by. national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Rey-
 kavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims.
 During the year the emergency ward reported 76 visits associated with incidents of
 rape or sexual abuse. Hospital officials estimate that only 55 percent of these vic-
 tims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial, attributing this
 to fear of publicity in such a small, tight-knit society.
 The Women's List political movement and the female Mayor of Reykjavik have
 kept women's issues in the forefront of public debate. The 1996 Conservative Inde-
 pendence Party convention focused on increasing the political participation of
 women and on women's issues in general. While major political institutions and
 businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legis-
 lation requiring equal pay for equal work. The 20 percent gap in earnings between
 men and women in comparable jobs narrowed somewhat nationally but dropped sig-
 nificantly in Reyljavik to 10 to 15 percent.
 Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a
 special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations
 to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the commit-
 tee.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The
 Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily sub-
 sidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 per-
 cent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed com-
 letely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's
 Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, in-
 
 
 terests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, gov-
 ernment decision., andpublic attitudes. The Parliament ratified the  ague Conven-
 tion on Child Abduction which entered into force in December. This action is ex-
 pected to facilitate the handling of international child custody cases.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination
 in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has
 legislated accessibility to publfc buildings for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Workers make extensive use of the right to establish
 organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders
 and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled
 neither by the Government nor any single political party. Unions take active part
 in Nordic, European and international trade union-bodies. With the exception of
 limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to
 public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.
 Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no impediments to
 union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to
 bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically
 negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and spe-
 cific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions. The Government often
 plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order
 to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over
 contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and In-
 dustrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to
 prove.
 In May the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing
 them into compliance with the European human rights convention.
 There are no export processing or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law requires children to at-
 tend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under
 that ag in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard
 labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be
 employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their
 workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupa-
 tion. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regu-
 lations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although there is no minimum wage law,
 union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts af-
 ford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living
 for themselves and their families.
 Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as
 well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reason-
 able working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work
 exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are en-
 titled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.
 Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8,
 and the day off can be   atpned by a week, in which case the worker has a right
 to2additional hours offin the following week.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Aitbing and administered and en-
 forced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health
 Administration.
