 MAURITANIA
 Since 1978 Mauritania has been governed by the Military
 Committee for National Salvation (CMSN). Colonel Maaouya Ould
 Sid'Ahmed Taya, President of the Committee, is Chief of State.
 He assumed power in 1984 after the bloodless ouster of the
 former President, Lt. Colonel Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla.
 All 18 members of the Military Committee hold ministerial
 portfolios or occupy other key military or government
 -positions. The Committee functions as a legislative body,
 whereas the President, assisted by a few close advisers,
 wields the executive power. Political and opposition parties
 are not allowed in Mauritania. The Government uses a quasi-
 political organization, the Structure for the Education of the
 Masses (SEM), to mobilize the people to carry out local
 improvement projects, to relay policy statements, and to serve
 as a channel to discuss grievances. SEMs are found at all
 governmental levels down to villages and neighborhoods.
 The security forces number about 13,000 and, in addition to
 the regular armed forces, include the national guard, the
 gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and
 the police. The national guard, gendarmerie, and police all
 have internal security functions.
 Mauritania continues to face massive economic and social
 problems: Droughts and desertification, the Western Sahara
 conflict,-ethnic tensions, massive unemployment, one of the
 highest per capita debts in Africa, poor infrastructure,
 inaddquate health and educational systems, and a mass exodus
 from rural areas. Although adequate rains fell in recent
 years, the prior drought years forced large numbers of nomads
 into towns. This forced migration resulted in urban refugee
 camps, a weakenedotraditional Maur nomadic culture, and a
 severe strain on government resources. According to one
 report, 20 years.ago 85 percent of the population was
 nomadic. In 1987 only 15 percent remained in the desert.
 President Taya has publicly advocated a harmonious,
 multiethnic society; but in 1987, as in 1986, there was
 agitation among Mauritania's Toucouleur black ethnic group,
 who alleged discrimination by the ruling Arab-Berber
 population; In the wake of the 1986 unrest, the Government in
 1986 and 1987 arrested, tried, and sentenced 39 Toucouleurs on
 charges of sedition and threatening national unity. In October
 1987, following the discovery of a coup plot reportedly led by
 Toucouleur military personnel, the Government detained over
 200 Toucpuleur, and 51 were charged with sedition, with the
 remainder-being released. The 51 received a trial in the
 course of which the Government respected the accepted norms of
 Mauritanian justice. At the end of the trial, the Special
 Court of Justice sentenced 3 defendants to death, 18 to life
 imprisonment, and 17 to lesser sentences. Seven defendants
 were acquitted. The death sentences were carried out 3 days
 later. Following the executions, street clashes broke out for
 several-days between groups of Maur and Toucouleur students
 and youths'in Nouakchott. The Government briefly detained
 about 100 youths. The Government also detained more than 20
 Toucouleur adults whom it suspected of masterminding some of
 the street disturbances. Many blacks interpreted the
 Government's actions to mean a continued domination by white
 Maurs in all levels of social, economic, and especially
 governmental life.

 MAURITANIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 According to the laws of Mauritania, torture is not allowed.
 There are, however, recurring and credible reports that
 security forces beat suspects to extract confessions.
 Conditions in Mauritanian prisons are generally grim. In
 Rosso, for example, at least two prisoners died of heat
 exhaustion in early 1987 after being forced into overcrowded
 cells. (Following the incident, authorities improved the
 ventilation of the prison's cells.)
 Toucouleur prisoners arrested in 1986 reported that they were
 initially denied proper medical care and family visits and
 also stated that the food was poor. Family protests and
 intervention by the Mauritanian Human Rights League in 1987
 resulted in written assurances from the Minister of Interior
 that the prisoners would receive regular family visits and
 proper health care. In October 1987, however, prior to the
 coup attempt, sources close to the Toucouleur prisoners
 circulated an open letter in which the Toucouleur inmates
 maintained that they still did not have family visits or
 adequate health care. In the letter, the prisoners also
 reported that they had been tortured during their
 interrogations.
 The Toucouleur military personnel and civilians who were
 detained immediately after the foiled 1987 coup plot and
 subsequently released were denied family visits during their
 period of detention. Apparently, however, they were not
 mistreated during their stay in custody. Most of the 51
 Toucouleurs who were tried by the Special Court appear to have
 been treated properly during arrest, interrogation, and trial,
 although there are reports that one or two were beaten when
 they were first arrested. In mid-December 1987, the Government
 transferred the 44 defendants who had been sentenced to prison
 on December 3, 1987, as well as the 39 Toucouleurs who had
 received prison sentences in the wake of the 1986 Toucouleur
 unrest, to the remote desert towns of Tichitt and Oualata.
 According to eyewitnesses, these prisoners were transported in
 manacles overland by truck, having to remain confined in
 cramped quarters for the duration of the 20- to 30-hour trip.
 Most of these prisoners' families will be unable to visit them
 in Tichitt or Oualata, since these are among the most remote
 locations in the country.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Mauritanian law assures expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal. In practice,
 however, the Government does not always respect this right.
 In the fall of 1987, the Government dismissed and arrested
 
 
 183
 MAURITANIA
 Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Salem Ould Lekhal,
 Minister of Fisheries and Maritime Economy Sidi Ould Cheikh
 Abdellahi, and Central Bank Director Dieng Boubou Farba. The
 Government suspected the three menof collusion with Hmeida
 Bouchraya, one of the country's leading businessmen, in his
 illegal transfer of large sums of money out of the country.
 Reportedly the Government has detained these three former
 -government officials in the remote desert town of Ouadane
 since late September, without, however, filing any charges
 against them.
 Based on legislation enacted before the 1978 coup, the
 authorities have the right to detain, without trial or appeal,
 anyone judged to be a threat to national security. Colonel
 Moulaye'Ould Boukhreiss was arrested and held incommunicado in
 August 1987 for allegedly conspiring and conducting a
 propaganda campaign against'the Government. After
 interrogating-him for several weeks, the Government exonerated
 him from any wrongdoing and released him in September. At no
 point during Boukhreiss' arrest was he formally charged.
 Detainees are sometimes confined to their residences; however,
 Mauritania maintains prisons in Nouakchott, Jereida, and
 elsewhere for more serious crimes.
 The Government justified the large-scale arrests and detentions
 of Toucouleurs in 1986 and early 1987 on the grounds of
 national security. Government sources maintained that these
 militants were members of a clandestine subversive group,
 FLAM, which was planning a campaign of terrorism and
 assassination. After the October coup attempt, the Government
 detained more than 200 persons, of whom more than 20 were
 still in custody at the end of 1987 without specific charges
 having been brought against them. Nevertheless, by the end of
 1987 the Government's actions had led to widespread discontent
 in the Toucouleur community. Most Toucouleurs interpret the
 latest arrests as a further sign that the military Government
 will take whatever steps are necessary to thwart the
 aspirations of the non-Maurs, especially in sharing political
 power.
 Internal exile is a method of removing opposition figures from
 the public eye. Former President Haidalla and five of his
 associates, who were arrested during the 1984 coup but never
 formally charged, remain in internal exile in remote locations.
 The subject of forced labor is tied to the vestiges of slavery
 which exist in some areas of the country. Slavery in
 Mauritania was officially abolished in 1980. Nevertheless,
 some persons whose ancestors for generations have worked
 without pay for a particular family still occupy positions of
 servitude in 1987, in part because of the economic hardships
 which they would encounter upon leaving their positions.
 In an effort to eradicate the last vestiges of slavery, the
 Government invited United Nations' assistance, began a mass
 media educaiion campaign which utilizes-rural radio and
 television to promote public awareness of the problem, and
 provided small-scale financial assistance to former slaves for
 agricultural and handicraft businesses. The Taya regime
 also made an effort to appoint members of slave castes to high
 government and military positions as a visible indication of
 the end of slavery.

 MAURITANIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In September 1986, the Taya Government arrested some 30
 prominent black Toucouleurs, mainly professionals, for
 protesting white Maur domination of the political and economic
 systems. They had circulated a political treatise, "Manifesto
 of the Oppressed Negro-Mauritanian," in which they articulated
 grievances against Arabization, concerns about the adverse
 effects of recent land reform law by which white Maurs have
 appropriated large tracts of valuable land from their
 traditional black owners, as well as complaints about the
 underrepresentation of blacks in government and the
 undemocratic nature of the Mauritanian Government. In one
 passage the document advocated the use of violence to prevent
 the appropriation by Maurs of land belonging to blacks.
 Twenty-one of the 30 were brought to trial on September 25,
 1986, and charged with spreading falsehoods and hatred, holding
 unauthorized meetings, distributing seditious material, and
 calling for civil disorder. In a trial that lasted 1 day, the
 21 were convicted on all charges. Four received light
 sentences, while 16 were given sentences of 4 to 5 years in
 prison to be followed by 5 to 10 years in internal exile and
 loss of civil rights. Subsequently, in 1987 but prior to the
 October coup attempt, another 18 Toucouleur militants, who had
 been arrested at the time of the 1986 agitation, received
 similar sentences.
 The Toucouleurs hired civilian lawyers for the 1986 trial, but
 the lawyers resigned collectively prior to the trial because
 they had not had time to prepare the cases and, in particular,
 to review the prosecution dossiers. While the court
 subsequently appointed lawyers for the defendants, the entire
 episode raised serious questions about the fairness of the
 trial. Amnesty International in its 1987 Report stated that
 the trial was "marked by serious inadequacies."
 The Taya Government continues to function under the Shari'a
 (Islamic Law), put in place during the Haidalla regime. The
 Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs plays the major role
 in administering the Shari'a and selecting judicial personnel.
 The Shari'a applies to most crimes and offenses, with the
 exception of commercial and banking offenses, as well as
 traffic violations. The Taya administration, however, has
 urged the Islamic judges not to use extreme physical
 punishments such as amputations, which occurred during the
 Haidalla regime. The Taya Government inherited a number of
 unqualified Shari'a judges who were appointed during the
 Haidalla years. Judges cannot be tenured before 7 years by
 virtue of a recent government decision. Consequently, the
 Minister of Justice has the power to dismiss them and is
 slowly eliminating unqualified officials.
 One result of the use of Shari'a has been that Western-trained
 lawyers are unable to practice in most cases unless they are
 retrained. Many only work in specialized areas such as
 banking, insurance, and traffic accidents, where Islamic law
 does not apply.
 In September 1987, the Government tried eight "Baathist"
 supporters on charges of unlawful assembly, criminal
 conspiracy, corruption of juveniles, and illegal restraint.
 Despite the state prosecutor's request for stiff sentences for
 the defendants, the court acquitted two and gave the others
 light suspended sentences. Two of those convicted were members
 
 
 185
 MAURITANIA
 of the Mauritanian Human Rights League. Many Mauritanians
 hailed this decision as the sign of a fair trial, but some
 observers stated the convictions violated the right of
 assembly.
 On December 3, 1987, the Special Court of Justice sentenced to
 death three of the Toucouleur military officers accused of
 plotting the overthrow of the regime. The sentences were
 carried out shortly thereafter. A number of Mauritanians,
 however, do not believe that these death sentences were
 justified under Mauritanian law. According to the Mauritanian
 legal code, any attempt to overthrow the Government by armed
 force is punishable by death. The Government maintains that
 at the time of the plotters' arrest, approximately half a day
 before 'the coup was supposed to occur, they had taken specific
 measures, including preparing armored vehicles and placing
 conspirators in strategic locations, that amounted to the
 beginning of the implementation of the takeover. But many
 Mauritanians, including most of the defendants' lawyers,
 dispute this interpretation. In their view, these actions did
 not amount to implementation, and the accused were merely
 guilty of plotting a coup instead of actually conducting a
 coup attempt. In Mauritanian law, simply planning a coup is
 punishable by a prison sentence, not by death.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in.private affairs, except in
 instances where treason is suspected, is limited. Reflecting
 the nomadic penchant for privacy and the sanctity of
 confidences, the lack of sophisticated equipment to undertake
 surveillance, and the isolation of many parts of the country,
 the Government normally limits its surveillance to patrols on
 major highways and customs check points, occasional nighttime
 inspections of vehicular traffic, and inspections of mail
 suspected of containing currency or prohibited items.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is restricted. Many Mauritanians
 criticize government policies in conversations with friends
 and relatives. The Government, nevertheless, is quick to
 react to any comments it thinks pose a threat to the security
 of the State, as evidenced by the 1986 crackdown on Toucouleur
 dissidents. In particular, any expression of racial or ethnic
 tension, or questioning of government legitimacy draws a sharp
 government response. Private discussions within the family or
 tribe are active and used as a vehicle to present dissenting
 views on issues. Moreover, President Taya invites the views
 of traditional local leaders during his visits to the rural
 areas.
 Mauritania's only newspaper and radio and television station
 are government owned and operated. In the past the Government
 has not allowed any criticism of government policies or
 authority. Recently, however, the Government has begun to
 experiment with interview formats by which a government
 official is invited to air views on television with a panel.
 In these broadcasts the authorities have tolerated limited
 criticism of government decisions and policies. International
 newspapers and magazines are readily available, although the,
 Government occasionally censors issues that contain material
 
 
 186
 MAURITANIA
 it considers to be objectionable. The November 1986 edition
 of Jeune Afrigue, which contained an article critical of the
 Government's treatment of blacks, was allowed to be sold. The
 populace actively follows shortwave broadcasts and Senegalese
 television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since 1978, and meetings
 with political themes are generally prohibited, as in the case
 of the "Baathist" supporters (Section l.e.). The Government
 allowed large but controlled demonstrations and rallies to
 take place in late 1986 during the campaigns for local
 municipal councils. In the wake of the arrests in September
 1986 of the Toucouleur activists, sporadic antigovernmsnt
 protests occurred. The demonstrations were quickly suppressed
 by armed police with the use of tear gas. During the latter
 half of 1986, the Government cracked down on the Toucouleur
 community by banning meetings of black self-help groups and
 cultural organizations and even checking large Toucouleur
 family gatherings such as weddings. In early December,
 following the execution of the three Toucouleurs sentenced by
 the Special Court of Justgce, fights broke out in Nouakchott
 high schools and market places between groups of Toucouleur
 and Maur youths. Government security forces broke up these
 disturbances, sometimes detaining those involved for a few
 hours before letting them go.
 Local unions are the only remaining organizations with any
 semblance of political influence following the 1978 coup.
 Labor unions can organize nationally, but they must be
 affiliates of the Mauritania Workers Union (UTM), by law the
 country's only central labor body. Union officials state that
 the UTM has some 30,000 members. The annual membership fee of
 $4 is imposed on members but, in addition, the Government
 frequently finances UTM operations. The UTM is associated
 with regional and international labor organizations and its
 officials attend many international labor meetings, where they
 are free to air views on labor consistent with Mauritanian
 policy.
 Wages are set through an informal bargaining arrangement
 between individual unions, the employers, the Government, and
 the UTM. Strikes are theoretically possible, although they
 are discouraged by the Government and rarely take place.
 Disputes over labor issues are heard before special
 three-person labor courts which are overseen jointly by the
 Ministries of Justice and Labor. These courts are regarded by
 labor union leadership as unbiased and effective.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania, and the country's
 official name is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. Virtually
 all citizens are Muslim. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and the
 construction of Christian churches and other non-Islamic houses
 of worship are prohibited without government permission. The
 Roman Catholic community in Mauritania was permitted in several
 instances to build churches which operate freely as long as
 they restrict their services to resident foreigners.
 Mauritanian Muslis are prohibited from entering non-Islamic
 houses of worship and from converting to another religion.
 
 
 187
 MAURITANIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are generally no restrictions on movement within this
 large nomadic country, although travelers are frequently
 subjected to routine police and customs checks along major
 highways and at the country's international and domestic
 airports. Years of drought have caused many nomads to migrate
 to the urban areas, thus increasing the urban populations and
 creating shantytowns. Movement has been controlled in the
 past during emergency situations by imposing curfews, as
 occurred briefly following the 1984 coup.
 The requirement that Mauritanians have an exit visa before
 traveling abroad was ended in 1985. Those political leaders
 who fled thecountry since the overthrow of the civilian
 Government in 1978 have been invited back, and almost all of
 them have-returned.
 As a result of the.ongoing conflict in neighboring Western
 Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a small number
 of displaced persons from the Western Sahara have entered
 Nouadhibou and other northern towns. There are, however, no
 acknowledged political refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All pplitical power rests in the hands of the military regime.
 The Military Committee for National Salvation remains the
 "custodian of the nation's sovereignty." All executive and
 legislative functions reside with the Committee. Membership
 is limited to military officers and is automatically conferred
 on incumbents of ministerial positions and important military
 and security posts. Therefore, in practice, citizens of
 Mauritania are unable democratically to change their government
 at the national level. The CMSN is predominantly Maur,
 although several-blacks are members. The most prominent black
 on the CMSN lost his position in the wake of the 1986
 Toucouleur unrest.
 A limited move toward increased popular participation in
 government occurred in December 1986 when communal council
 elections took place in Nouakchott and the country's 12
 regional capitals. In most cities,. two or more lists of
 candidates competed for the electorate's votes. The
 Government stipulated that each list contain at least 30
 people from various regions, ethnic groups, and tribes. The
 campaigning was vigorous and candidates were allowed to use
 the media to spread their views. Most candidates were Maur
 civil servants, wealthy merchants, or professionals with the
 necessary skills and connections to mount a successful
 campaign. Each candidate was required to deposit the
 equivalent of $570 (10 times the monthly salary of an average
 worker) in order to participate. Black activists complained
 that this factor, and the Government's arrests of black
 activists in September 1986, limited black participation as
 candidates. Despite these shortcomings, during their first
 year of operations the newly elected municipal councils became
 genuine decisionmaking bodies that handled most municipal
 issues with little or no central government interference.
 
 
 188
 MAURITANIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Taya Government is sensitive on the issue of human rights
 and has cooperated with the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 Working Group on Slavery by allowing a representative to come
 to Mauritania to obtain information on this issue. The
 Government has also permitted representatives of Amnesty
 International to visit Nouakchott for discussions on the
 Toucouleur issue. As a result of the President's public
 commitment to an ethnically harmonious society and a return to
 basic human rights, the Mauritanian Human Rights League was
 formed in 1986. The League is staffed by volunteers who work
 within the government framework to address such concerns as
 eradicating the last vestiges of slavery, ensuring the uniform
 application of the Shari'a law, promoting the status of women,
 and preventing abuses such as arbitrary arrest and torture.
 While constrained by a lack of financial resources and careful
 not to antagonize the Government, the League has nonetheless
 insisted that the rights of all persons detained for political
 offenses be respected.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the
 divide between the nomadic Arabic-speaking Maurs of the north
 and the sedentary blacks of the African south. The interaction
 of these two groups produces the complex cultural diversity
 which fuels ethnic and racial tensions inherent in Mauritanian
 society. Recent movements of nomads to the south as a result
 of the drought have exacerbated tensions, culminating in the
 1986 Toucouleur agitation and the subsequent arrest of
 Toucouleur activists. Historically, and since independence in
 1960, the Arabic-speaking white Maurs have dominated the
 political and economic system. Taken together, however, the
 Arabic-speaking black Maurs and Mauritania's sedentary black
 African groups (Toucouleur, Soninke, and Wolof) constitute a
 clear majority of the population. Many of these blacks
 believe that they are entitled to more political
 representation. The black population is represented at all
 levels of government, but is underrepresented in terms of its
 proportion of the population. Many Toucouleurs also believe
 that white Maur domination in government, state enterprises,
 business, and religious institutions is a result of racial
 discrimination. Their grievances include such isues as
 language (Arabization rather than continued use of French),
 limitations on educational opportunities, and misapplication
 of the law on land reform. They view the Government's new
 land reform law as a means of allowing wealthy white Maurs
 access to potentially productive tracts of land in
 traditionally Toucouleur areas. The loss by some sedentary
 African blacks of large tracts of land in the Senegal River
 Valley area has resulted in a scramble by Toucouleurs to
 register their land with the appropriate authorities, an alien
 practice for people who traditionally have looked upon land as
 community property.
 Women in conservative, Mauritanian Muslim society are, for the
 most part, limited to traditional roles, especially outside
 the few urban areas. Only half as many women as men avail
 themselves of educational opportunities. Nevertheless, the
 Government is encouraging the participation of women at all
 levels of occupational activity, including in government and
 
 
 189
 MAURITANIA
 business. A woman was recently appointed as Minister of
 Mines, and a number of others have moved into senior or
 ,midlevel government positions. Ineaddition, the Government
 has been opening up new opportunities for employment in work
 traditionally reserved for men, e.g., certain jobs in
 hospitals. The Government reportedly is considering allowing
 women to serve in the armed forces as support personnel.
 Although few women were on the lists of candidates, large
 numbers of women turned out for the election rallies in
 support of their candidates.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Mauritania has one of the lowest standards of living in the
 world. It has a population of 1.9 million people and an annual
 growth rate of 3 percent. Most of its modern economic
 activities are concentrated in the northern and central regions
 where mining and fishing operations take place. The chief
 economic activities in the South, where the majority of the
 black population is located, are farming and livestock raising.
 Figures for unemployment range from 50 to 90 percent, but do
 not necessarily represent an accurate reflection of labor
 employment.
 Education is not compulsory in Mauritania; however, by law no
 child may be employed before the age of 14 in the agricultural
 sector without the peimission of the Minister of Labor and
 National Labor Council, or before the age of 15 in
 nonagricultural sectors. The lw provides that employed
 childrenfrom-14-16'years should receive 70 percent of the
 minimum  aqe, and those from 17-18 receive'90 percent of the
 minimum wage. Although there are no figures available, child
 labor (except in the family-owned agriculture sector) is not
 thought to be widespread.
 The guaranteed minimum wage for adults is $70 per month. The
 standard nonagricultural workweek in Mauritania is not to
 exceed 40 hours or,0 days per week without adequate overtime
 compensation which is paid'at the following rates: 41st to
 48th hours, 115 percent; '49th to 54th hours, 140 percent; and,
 55th hour and over, 150 percent of the base wage. However,
 information on actual wage levels is scanty and often
 unreliable. Enforcement of the labor laws is the
 responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, Ministry of Labor,
 but in practice is limited by the shortage of trained
 personnel.
