 MALDIVES
 Maldives is a far-flung country of 153,000 people spread over
 some 1,200 islands in the Indian Ocean. The capital, Male' is
 400 miles from its nearest neighbor, Sri Lanka. Although
 ethnically similar to the Indic peoples of Sri Lanka and India,
 Maldivians also have had centuries-old contacts and
 interrelationships with the Arab world. The influence of Islam
 and the isolation of their island civilization have been key
 elements in determining the Maldivian character and the course
 of Maldives' development.
 The country was governed as a hereditary sultanate for
 centuries and was a British protectorate from 1887 to 1965.
 Maldives in the past several decades has experimented with
 various forms of government, including an elected sultanate and
 republicanism. The present system provides for a strong
 executive president, assisted by a council of ministers, and an
 elected parliament, called the Majlis, with legislative
 powers. Economic and political powers are concentrated in the
 hands of a small traditional elite.
 Personal and authoritarian rule has historically been the norm,
 and Maldives' Islamic society traditionally has been governed
 by the principles of Shariat law (Islamic Code). The more
 modern Constitution of 1968 guarantees basic human rights, but
 in the political sphere in particular these concepts are new to
 Maldives and their practice is in a state of evolution.
 In July 1981, President Gayoom suggested a model for a new
 constitution formulated by scholars and foreign legal experts.
 The President's submission was in compliance with a motion
 passed by the Majlis in 1979 seeking a new constitution which
 would meet the requirements of a more modern society and more
 accurately define the powers of the President and the
 separation of powers among the presidency, the Mailis, and the
 judiciary. The 90-member special Majlis appointed to review
 the draft Constitution is currently debating its provisions.
 It now appears that the target date for implementation --
 December 22, 1982 -- will slip, however, and the Majlis is not
 expected to complete its work until mid-1983. By proceeding
 with the implementation of the new Constitution and engaging in
 necessary development projects, the Government believes that it
 is both safeguarding the basic rights of Maldivians and
 enhancing their prospects for a brighter future.
 Given the authoritarian history of government and society in
 Maldives, and the Government's desire to pursue economic
 development in an organized, centrally-directed manner, there
 is little likelihood that the human rights situation in
 Maldives will be considerably changed during the next few
 years. However, President Gayoom, in a recent press interview,
 stated that the new Constitution will "clearly spell out the
 fundamental rights of the people .... and the relationship
 between the citizens and the state." In addition, despite the
 essentially autarchic nature of the Government in Male' the
 individual atolls and islands have enjoyed considerable
 autonomy in historic times and continue to do so today.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 
 1212
 a. Killing
 Killing for political motives or by the Government or
 opposition political organizations is unknown in Maldives.
 Murders of any kind are, in fact, virtually unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances or allegations of abductions,
 secret arrests, clandestine detention, or permanent
 "disappearance" by official or quasi-official security forces
 or by terrorist organizations.
 c. Torture
 Under the Maldivian Constitution, no person may be penalized
 except as convicted under Shariat law or on conditions
 specified by law, and "under no circumstances can an injury be
 inflicted." The Government does not condone or practice
 torture. There were no known allegations of torture during
 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no prisons in Maldives; there is a "detention
 center." Crimes of violence are relatively rare. Common forms
 of punishment for crimes are fines, payment of compensation,
 house arrest, and banishment to a sparsely inhabited island
 where the person must earn his own living under the watchful
 eye of authorities. Severe forms of corporal punishment
 provided for in Shariat law are not imposed in Maldives. As
 far as can be determined, all prisoners are treated the same in
 confinement or in banishment. The President does exercise his
 option to pardon convicted criminals or to curtail their
 sentences; this was done in April when President Gayoom
 released two prisoners and reduced the sentences of 29 other
 convicted persons, and again on November 11 when the President
 granted amnesty to 329 persons. A number of those granted
 amnesty had already served most of their sentences; 105 were
 under house arrest in the atolls and 6 were under house arrest
 in Male  In addition, the President reduced by half the
 sentences of 22 persons convicted on drug charges this year.
 There was no amnesty or reduction of sentence, however, for any
 person convicted of participating in a coup against the
 Government.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 According to law, a suspect may be detained for two weeks or
 placed under house arrest while a case is being investigated.
 By authority of the President, detentions may be extended
 another month. The legal time limits for pre-trial detention
 are not strictly enforced. About a dozen suspects rounded up
 in connection with the unsuccessful 1980 coup attempt were
 imprisoned without trial for several months. Eventually, they
 were tried, convicted, and sentenced.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system of Maldives is derived from traditional
 Islamic law, but a body of civil law is developing to meet
 circumstances of modernization. The system is administered by
 secular officials: a Chief Justice, lesser judges and legal
 officials known as qazis, who are trained in Male'and assigned
 to islands throughout the country. The Government has
 
 
 1213
 established a high court to try major cases. Legal officials
 are appointed by the President and function under the Ministry
 of Justice; there is also an Attorney General. The Maldivian
 custom is for the accused to defend himself; normally witnesses
 are called to speak on behalf of the accused. While lawyers
 are not expressly forbidden, the legal profession is virtually
 unknown in the islands, and lawyers are not a normal part of
 this process; nor are they provided by the court. The
 prisoners held in connection with the coup attempt of 1980 did
 employ lawyers and were not prevented from using them. The
 judiciary is not regarded as very independent in Maldives, as
 judges are appointed by the Government and have no clear right
 of tenure.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 According to the Constitution, private premises and dwelling
 places shall be respected and shall not be trespassed, save
 under conditions stipulated by law. There are no reports of
 practices to the contrary.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Maldivian Constitution provides that every person has
 freedom of speech and press so long as provisions of Shariat
 and civil law are not contravened. The number of newspapers in
 Maldives is limited; there is no prior censorship, although all
 publications must be registered with the Government. There is
 no official press, and it is the policy of the present
 Government to avoid the development of an official press. The
 press is legally free, but restrained by tradition from being
 too critical of the Government.  Newspapers exercise
 self-censorship, since journalists are subject to prosecution
 if articles are deemed to contravene such laws as one
 prohibiting arousal of ill feelings against a lawfully formed
 government. There have been instances when journalists or
 editors have been questioned about particular articles
 appearing in the press. These are generally the result of
 misunderstandings, which are then satisfactorily resolved.
 With a long tradition of authoritarian rule behind them,
 Maldivians are careful about what they say to strangers and are
 reticent on political subjects.'
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While the Maldivian Constitution provides for freedom of
 assembly and association, there does not appear to be a
 tradition of exercising certain of these freedoms. It appears
 that the only rallies permitted are those sponsored by the
 Government and addressed by officials and religious leaders.
 Associations such as clubs, parties, and companies which do not
 contravene rules of behavior prescribed by Shariat and civil
 law are permitted, but must register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions in Maldives. Labor unions are
 neither expressly permitted nor expressly prohibited under
 Maldivian law. Until recent years, the overwhelming majority
 of Maldivians were either self-employed or held government
 jobs; thus the motivation to form labor unions was absent.
 Reportedly, sailors of the Maldivian shipping line recently
 tried to form a labor union to press for wages consistent with
 those paid internationally. For a number of reasons, among
 
 
 1214
 them the economic impact on the company, this attempt at
 unionization was quashed by the Government. On November 11,
 the Government created a Department of Public Works and Labor
 to regulate labor practices and reportedly to respond to worker
 grievances in the tourist resorts.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Maldives is an Islamic state. A Maldivian citizen is, by
 definition, a Muslim; other religions are not proscribed, but
 there are no places of worship for religions other than Islam.
 The lack of houses of worship does not appear, however, to have
 deterred Hindus and Buddhists from neighboring India and Sri
 Lanka from coming to Maldives and establishing businesses and
 filling educational and technical positions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of those who have been convicted and
 sentenced to banishment on one of the outer islands, Maldivians
 are free to travel within and outside their country. The
 Government discoirages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence primarily in order to contain growth in
 over-populated Male', where more than 20 percent of the
 population now lives. Wide dispersal of population is
 economically inefficient and makes provisions of services
 difficult, but the Government is determined not to mandate
 consolidation of the far-flung Maldivian population on larger
 islands. Instead it hopes to attract voluntary relocation
 through making the islands more attractive and bringing
 services to the people. In July, the Government reimposed
 regulations suspended in 1975 requiring non-residents of Male"
 to register with the authorities in order to stem the
 uncontrolled infusion of people from other islands. The
 Government is particularly concerned that over-crowding, poor
 housing, and inadequate sanitation in Male'will lead to
 epidemics that spread to other islands. A severe epidemic of
 dysentery in May-July resulted in several dead and hundreds
 seriously ill.
 Passports are freely available to Maldivian citizens; it is
 believed that normal restrictions on travel apply to persons
 such as convicted criminals. Generally, a citizen can travel
 overseas and is not required to obtain an exit permit.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no organized political parties in Maldives. There
 has never been a concerted attempt to form a political party in
 Maldives, although it is not expressly forbidden to do so.
 President Gayoom, in a recent press interview, stressed the
 homogeneous nature of Maldivian society and observed that,
 "Most political parties are formed because certain sections of
 the people think they are deprived of certain rights and
 privileges and would like to defend or acquire them. These
 circumstances do not exist in our country." Maldivians seem
 generally to share the President's view that political parties
 are neither appropriate nor necessary in the Maldivian context.
 Candidates stand for election to the Majlis and campaign on the
 basis of personal appeal. Political rallies are not the
 custom. The Majlis has "camps" or "factions" which coalesce
 around certain views or certain individuals. Participation in
 the political system is open to all citizens 21 years of age or
 
 
 1215
 older. The presidency is limited to men, and the President is
 chosen by the Majlis and then confirmed or rejected in a
 national referendum by secret ballot.
 Islamic and Maldivian traditions limit women's role in society
 and the political process, but the present Government is making
 an attempt to elevate the position of women. Of eight persons
 appointed by the President to the Majlis in 1979, two were
 women. There are three women in the 90-member special Majlis
 considering the new draft Constitution. A woman holds the
 position of special assistant to the President for protocol and
 foreign relations. The President recently created a national
 women's committee to work for greater participation by women in
 the development of the country.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no known requests for outside investigations of
 any alleged violations of human rights in the Maldives. There
 are no local human rights organizations. Amnesty International
 has expressed, in its 1982 report, its concern about procedures
 used in the cases of those arrested following the 1980 coup
 attempt.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Maldives' socio-economic situation is largely determined by the
 relative isolation of not only the nation as a whole from the
 other countries of South and West Asia but also by the
 isolation of the inhabitants of individual islands from each
 other and from the political and economic capital of Male'
 Development of Maldives in the past was concentrated in the
 capital, to the detriment of the far-flung atolls across the
 512-mile length and 81-mile breadth of the Maldives
 Archipelago. The Government of President Maumoom Abdul Gayoom,
 who came to power in 1978, has attempted to rectify the
 imbalance between the capital and the hinterlands and spreading
 the benefits of development as widely as possible.
 While encouraging the production of Maldives' basic
 commodities, fish and coconuts, the Government has made
 judicious use of other favorable characteristics of the islands
 and has encouraged significant growth in the field of tourism
 (on islands near Mal6) and garment manufacturing (on Gan Island
 in Addu Atoll). Capitalizing on its beautiful islands,
 Maldives has boosted tourism and has seen it grow from 29,000
 tourists per year in 1978 to a claimed 60,000 during the, past
 twelve months. The garment industry in Gan has provided
 valuable employment and is helping to redress a serious problem
 which resulted when a British base on Gan was closed in 1976.
 Many of the workers who lost their jobs at that time
 congregated in Maler, thus creating serious overcrowding and a
 rising crime rate. The government is trying to encourage some
 inhabitants of Male to return to their native islands, and this
 can be successful only if work and jobs are found for them
 there.
 The year 1982 was important for the improvement of health
 services in Maldives. Formerly the only medical care available
 was in the Central Hospital Male', which was fairly
 well-equipped but depended on doctors assigned from time to
 time by the World Health Organization. With funds and
 
 
 1216
 te]hnical assistance provided by UNICEF, the first regional
 hospital in a northern atoll was opened by President Gayoom in
 March; during the same month the foundation for the second
 regional hospital was laid in southernmost Addu Atoll. The
 Government anticipates having a total of four regional
 hospitals. Much remains to be done in the health field, as
 evidenced by the relatively low life expectancy at birth (47
 years) and high infant mortality rate (121 per 1000 live
 births). only 15 percent of the total population of Maldives
 (54 percent in urban areas) is considered to have access to
 safe water. The population growth rate is high at 3.1 percent
 per year.
 According to a recent government report, rapid progress has
 been made in the field of education since President Gayoom
 assumed power in 1978. While in 1978 there were only three
 government schools (all of them in Male'), now there are 32
 government schools spread throughout the atolls. The three
 secondary schools are all in Male'. Despite these advances,
 many of the remote islands lack educational facilities. While
 literacy is 82 percent overall (according to the 1977 census),
 the percentage of those who are considered to read at
 "satisfactory" or "very good" levels is 44 percent for men and
 41 percent for women. The adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio is 36.2 percent. As there is no university in Maldives,
 the Government has an active program of seeking scholarships
 for promising students to continue their higher education at
 universities in the Middle East, India, and the United
 Kingdom.
 Maldives' status as one of the least developed countries is
 borne out by its per capita GNP of $258 (1980), up from $160
 four years earlier. With an economy which still depends on
 traditional fishing (involving about 30 percent of the male
 populatiop), harvesting coconuts (for coir rope), and
 rudimentary subsistence farming in some atolls, there is need
 for further development of new areas of employment.
