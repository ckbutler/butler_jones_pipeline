 ERITREA
 Eritrea became an independent state in 1993, following an internationally mon-
 itored referendum in which citizens voted overwhelmingly for independence from
 Ethiopia. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which led the 30-year war
 for independence, has controlled the country since it defeated Ethiopian armed
 forces in 1991; its leader, Isaias Afwerki, serves as the President. The People's Front
 for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), the core of the former EPLF, which split off from
 the Government in 1994, is the sole political party. The Government continues to
 delay its stated program to hold elections. Elections originally scheduled for 1997,
 and later delayed until 1998, were postponed indefinitely due to the outbreak of a
 border conflict with Ethiopia. The Constitution provides for democratic freedoms,
 but it has not been implemented. The judiciary remains independent but weak.
 The police are responsible for maintaining internal security, although the Govern-
 ment may call on the 40,000-member armed forces, the reserves, and demobilized
 soldiers in response to both domestic and external security requirements. In May
 fighting broke out between Eritrean armed forces and Ethiopian militia along the
 border. Eritrea responded to an escalating military conflict by calling up reserves
 and increasing its armed forces to approximately 100,000 to 120,000 soldiers. In ad-
 dition to the border conflict, the army has been forced to deal with the Eritrean Is-
 lamic Salvation (EIS), a small, Sudan-based insurgent group that has mounted ter-
 rorist attacks in the north and west since 1993. Some members of the security forces
 committed human rights abuses.
 The border conflict has interfered with Eritrea's transition from a deteriorating
 centrally planned economy to a market-based economy through the privatization of
 formerly state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of investment and trade.
 While trade, services, and manufacturing provide the greatest portion of gross do-
 mestic product, the rural economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, with
 more than 70 percent of the population of 3.6 million involved in farming and
 
 
 herding. The small industrial sector consists mainly of light industries, many using
 outmoded technologies. International economic assistance has accounted for a sig-
 nificant portion of external revenues, with loans replacing grants. The country is ex-
 tremely poor, with-an annual per capita income of less than $238 (1785 nakfa).
 The Government human xights record worsened in several areas; and serious
 problems remain. Citizens donot have the -right to change their Government, which
 is dominated by the PFDJ. Although a constituent assembly ratified a new constitu-
 tion, the Government has not yet fulfilled its stated program for a transition to de-
 mocracy. Eritrean forces killed Ethiopian civilians-with artillery fire, during artil-
 lery exchange with Ethiopian forces. Security forces on occasion abused and mis-
 treated persons, and soldiers reportedly raped several women. The Government gen-
 erally does not permit prison visits, and arbitrary arrest and detention is a problem.
 An unknown number of persons suspected of association with the Ethiopian
 Mengistu regime, radical Islamic elements, or terrorist organizations remain in pro-
 longed detention. However, after. the outbreak of conflict with Ethiopia, the Govern-
 ment began to grant representatives of the International Committee for the Red
 Cross (ICRC  broad access to prisoners and detainees, but not to Ethiopian pris-
 oners of war (POW's). The Government's actions were prompted in large measure
 by Ethiopian allegations of substantial human rights violations of Ethiopians resi-
 dent in Eritrea. The Government released 71 prisoners captured during the conflict
 with Ethiopia, coordinating the repatriation'of POW's to Ethiopia with the ICRC.
 The still developing judicial system limits the provision of speedy trials, and the use
 of military courts limits due process. There were some infringements on the rights
 to privacy. The Government restricts press freedom, including the rights of the reli-
 gious media, and limits freedom of association. The Government restricts religious
 freedom and freedom of movement. There were several reports that the Government
 arrested government critics, including a memberof Jehovah's Witnesses. There is
 one domestic human rights group, Citizens for Peace. Societal discrimination
 aganst women is a problem, and emae enital mutilation (FGM) remains wide-
 spread despite official government discouragement of the practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As the result of a border conflict
 that began in June, Eritre and Ethiopia exchanged artillery fire and engaged in
 air attacks leading to numerous civilian casualties. In June Eritrean forces bombed
 the Ethiopian town of Mekele and killed 47 civilians, including children. In June
 and again in November, Eritrean forces fired artillery shells at the Ethiopian town
 of Adrigat, killing six persons and wounding several others.
 Ethiopian media alleged that the Government was responsible for the extrajudical
 killing of Ethiopians in Eritrea; however, investigation of these allegations by inter-
 national human rights groups, and local and foreign officials revealed no evidence
 to substantiate the charges.-
 Approximately 200_ persons were injured or killed in incidents involving
 unexploded ordinances including land mines. There are an estimated 150,000 to
 200,000 land mines in the country, mostly laid by Ethiopia during the 1961-1991
 war in which Eritrea fought for independence. On occasion, new mines were laid
 by the EIS.
 In June Ethiopian forces killed one civilian during an air strike on the Asmara
 airport.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 During the border conflict with Ethiopia, Ethiopian media alleged that Ethiopians
 in Eritrea had disappeared. Investigation by international human rights groups,
 and local and foreign officials of the Ethiopian allegations revealed no evidence to
 substantiate the charges.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Ethiopian Penal Code, as modified by the transitional Penal Code of Eritrea,
 prohibits torture, and there were no reports that the authorities employed it. How-
 ever, members of the security forces on occasion physically abused, beat, and mis-
 treated persons. There were reports that Eritrean soldiers raped several Ethiopian
 womenin the immediate aftermath of Ethiopia's bombing of the Asmara airport.
 The women later returned to Ethiopia. There were incidents of security forces phys-
 ically abusing and mistreating Ethiopian nationals, particularly after the bombing
 of the Asmara airport. In other instances, there was clear police harassment of some
 Ethiopians, including the improper searches and detention of Ethiopian diplomatic
 vehicles (see Section 1.f.). The Ethiopian Embassy reported that locally hired staff
 members were beaten by the police and subjected to periodic harassment and ques-
 
 
 tioning. There was no investigation into any of these abuses or prosecution of those
 responsible. Ethiopian media alleged that Ethiopians in Eritrea were tortured. In-
 vestigation by international human rights groups, and local and foreign officials of
 the Ethiopian allegations revealed no evidence to substantiate the charges.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. The Government restricts visitation privileges and
 does not permit prisoners to correspond with family or friends. There were no con-
 firmed reports that any prisoners died due to lack of proper medical care. However,
 there was a report that some prisoners were beaten. Juvenile offenders are often
 incarcerated with adults.
 The Government generally does not permit prison visits. However, the Govern-
 ment began to permit some independent monitoring of conditions in detention facili-
 ties after the conflict with Ethiopia began in May, although the ICRC was denied
 access to Ethiopian POW's.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention is a prob-
 lem. The Penal Code stipulates that detainees may be held for a maximum of 30
 days without being charged with a crime. In practice the authorities sometimes hold
 persons suspected of crimes for much longer periods. In May the Government ar-
 rested approximately 1,000 Ethiopians suspected of su porting Ethiopia in the bor-
 der conflict. Most were released after a few days, but less than 20 remained in de-
 tention at year's end. In 1995, on the second anniversary of independence, the Gov-
 ernment pardoned and released 91 detainees who had been held for up to 4 years
 for collaboration with the Mengistu regime. An unknown-number of additiona sus-
 pected collaborators remain in detention without charge, despite a statement by
 President Isaias in 1995 that their cases would be considered soon. An unspecified
 number of persons associated with radical Islamic elements or suspected terrorist
 organizations also remained in detention without charge. There were unconfirmed
 reports that the Government arbitrarily holds several Eritrean Liberation Front
 members. Military authorities sometimes arbitrarily arrest and detain former com-
 batants who violate the military's unwritten code of conduct (see Section I.e.).
 Four members of Jehovah's Witnesses have been detained without trial or charge
 for over four years (see Section 2.c.).
 In December the Government released an Eritrean journalist detained without
 trial since March 1997 for inaccurate reporting and leaking confidential information
 (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government generally does not use exile as a means of political control. How-
 ever, immediately following the outbreak of hostilities with Ethiopia the Govern-
 ment expelled approximately 1,000 Ethiopians from Eritrea, many or alleged secu-
 rity concerns. Since that time, several thousand Ethiopians have left Eritrea, but
 the large majority chose to leave voluntarily due to the negative economic impact
 of the conflict.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent but weak, although
 there were no known incidents of executive interference in the judicial process dur-
 ing the year.
 The judiciary consists of village courts, subregional courts, regional courts, and a
 High Court that serves as an appellate court. The still developing judicial system
 suffers from a lack of trained personnel, inadequate funding, and poor infrastruc-
 ture that in practice limits the State's ability to grant accused persons a speedy
 trial. However, there was progress in establishing courts as 16 new, staffed court-
 houses were completed during the year. At independence the Government chose to
 retain the Ethiopian legal system. Under this Code, simple crimes are brought to
 village courts and subregional courts. More serious offenses are argued before re-
 gional courts, and cases involving murder, rape, and other serious felonies are heard
 by the High Court. All cases except those argued before the High Court are heard
 by a single judge: on the High Court, panels of three judges hear cases. Defendants
 have access to legal counsel, usually at their own expense.
 Although there is no formal public defender's office, the Government has re-
 quested successfully that attorneys work without fee to represent defendants ac-
 cused of serious crimes who are unable to afford legal counsel. Defendants may ap-
 peal verdicts to the High Court, which is composed of a president and five judges.
 As a result of the lack of legally trained personnel, the Ministry of Justice was
 unable to process a large volume of civilian corruption cases, which were handled
 by the Ministry of Defense. In 1997 the press reported that 2,431 civilians had been
 tried by special military courts. Approximately half were fined and imprisoned,
 while 360 were found not guilty. There was no information available on the remain-
 ing 850 civilians. A smaller number of cases concerning embezzlement, corruption,
 and theft were tried in the special military courts during the year. In military
 courts there are usually no defense lawyers and no right of appeal. The continued
 handling of civilian cases by these military courts raised problems of due process
 
 
 because of the absence of defense counsel and denial of the right to appeal. Denial
 of due process has been a problem on occasion for critics of the Government (see
 Section 2.a.).
 There was considerable progress in obtaining qualified legal personnel. The law
 school at the University of Asmara graduated its first class of 25 in May. Of the
 25 graduates, 21 were given jobs in the Ministry of Justice, where they are receiving
 training in alternate dispute resolution techniques. The other four graduates re-
 mained at the University to pursue advanced coursework. The University expects
 to graduate 38 lawyers in 1999 and 25 each year thereafter.
 Since the population is largely rural, most citizens only have contact with the
 legal system through the traditional village courts. Village judges, appointed by a
 panel of government magistrates, provide justice in civil matters. Criminal cases are
 transferred to magistrates versed in criminal law. Many local issues-for example,
 property disputes and most petty crimes-are adjudicated by local elders according
 to custom or, in the case of Muslims, Shari'a law. The traditional courts cannot im-
 pose sentences involving physical punishment. The Ministry of Justice also is offer-
 ing seminars in alternative dispute resolution for handling petty criminal and civil
 cases.
 Crimes involving corruption, theft, and misuse of government authority allegedly
 committed by former members of the guerrilla forces during the war for independ-
 ence are handled by military courts. Senior former fighters often are held to a strin-
 gent unwritten code of conduct, and violations of this code are handled within the
 governing circle outside the normal judicial process. Former fighters accused of vio-
 lating this circle of trust have been arrested and held without formal charge. Some
 senior government officials have been relieved summarily of their duties for over-
 stepping their role or making mistakes, although generally they have not been mis-
 treated and often have retained salary and certain other privileges.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, warrants are required in routine searches and seizures, except in cases
 where authorities believe individuals may attempt to escape or destroy evidence.
 However, there were cases of improper searches. In several instances, Ethiopian
 diplomatic vehicles-clearly bearing diplomatic or consular plates-were subjected
 to improper searches and detentions. Warrants also are required before the Govern-
 ment can monitor mail, telephones, or other means of private communication. There
 is no evidence that the Government monitored private mail service, but there is evi-
 dence that the Government monitored some international telephone calls. The Gov-
 ernment does not allow access to the Internet through its telecommunications sys-
 tem. The Government has the authority to ban the import of any foreign publica-
 tion; however, it has not yet done so (see Section 2.a.).
 There were reports that a small number of Ethiopians were expelled from their
 homes in Eritrea near the Ethiopian border. There were also reports that police har-
 assed some Ethiopians. A significant but unknown number of Ethiopians were fired
 or lost their jobs due to their nationality. However, in a number of cases, this was
 due to the fact that Ethiopians were working for Ethiopian businessmen who left
 the country or who found that their enterprises were no longer viable because they
 had lost their Eritrean clients. Hundreds of Ethiopians, who can no longer pay rent,
 are sleeping in rough conditions at the outskirts of Asmara.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, in practice, the Government restricts these rights. Indi-
 viduals must be cautious in stating their views in public since the Ministry of Inter-
 nal Affairs has detained or arrested persons whose remarks it considered inappro-
 priate. The June 1997 arrest of an Eritrean-American citizen for remarks allegedly
 made while in the United States underscored the authority of the Ministry to arrest
 persons based on suspicion. There were reports during the year that the Govern-
 ment arrested persons-including a member of Jehovah's Witnesses-for criticizing
 the Government.
 The Government controls almost all media, which include three newspapers, one
 radio station, and one television station. Two independent newspapers flourished
 during the year, and one, Setit, rivaled the circulation base of the government press.
 The Government has the authority to ban the import of any foreign publication, al-
 though it has not yet done so. The press proclamation issued in 1996 forbids the
 local reprinting of articles from banned publications. The Government continued to
 restrict the rights of the religious media to comment on politics or government poli-
 cies. In theory nonreligious print media -are free to criticize the Government. None-
 theless, criticism tends to be limited and fairly mild. Although there is no formal
 
 
 censorship body, the media practice self-censorship. The arrest and detention with-
 out trial in March 1997 of an Agence France Presse correspondent and PFDJ mem-
 ber for allegedly falsely reporting remarks made by President Isaias raised further
 doubts about press freedom. Government officials state that the journalist was ar-
 rested for violating the law against inaccurate reporting and her obligation as a gov-
 ernment official to protect classified government materials. Nevertheless, the open-
 ended jail sentence the reporter received without a trial denied her due process. The
 journalist was released in December.
 The Government's press proclamation allows individuals to publish newspapers,
 and private newspapers and magazines began publishing at the end of 1997. There
 were five independent newspapers and magazines operating at year's end. The suc-
 cess of Setit, the leading independent newspaper, marked a step towards the devel-
 opment of a free press. However, the press proclamation does not allow private own-
 ership of any broadcast media or foreign ownership of any media. The Proclamation
 requires that all newspapers obtain a license from the Ministry of Information be-
 fore publication and that all reporters register with the Ministry. The Government
 also may punish "whosoever insults, abuses, defames, or slanders the Government
 or one of the constituted legislative, executive, or judicial authorities," and forbids
 the publication of any matter that contravenes general morality. There were no re-
 ports of arrests or prosecutions under this authority; however, this authority has
 dered the development of print or broadcast media critical of the Government.
 There are some restraints on academic freedom at the one institution of higher
 education, the University of Asmara. University administration exercises hier-
 archical control over most aspects of university life. For example, student majors are
 chosen by the University, not the students, and some faculty expressed frustration
 that their research activity was constrained by the administration.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government requires a
 permit from the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a public meeting or demonstration.
 In general permits are granted freely for nonpolitical meetings or gatherings, and
 although no political demonstrations have occurred, there were no reports that per-
 mits for political demonstrations were denied.
 The Constitution states that every citizen shall have the right to form organiza-
 tions for political, social, economic, and cultural ends. However, the PFDJ has stated
 its opposition to the formation of any religiously or ethnically based parties.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, the Government restricts this right in practice. The Constitution provides for
 the "freedom to practice any religion and to manifest such practice" and Islam and
 Christianity are widely practiced and tolerated throughout the country with persons
 free to worship at the church or mosque of their choice. However, the Government
 persecuted members of the small community of Jehovah's Witnesses continued. In
 1994, the Government revoked the trading licenses of members of Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses and dismissed most of those who worked in the civil service. This govern-
 mental action resulted in economic, employment, and travel difficulties for members
 of Jehovah's Witnesses, especially former civil servants and businessmen. One
 woman was denied a passport when, upon questioning at immigration, she informed
 officials of her religious affiliation. In April 1997, the Government Labor Office
 issued a form to all employers in Asmara and the surrounding area requesting in-
 formation on any personnel who were members of Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Members of Jehovah's Witnesses have refused universally on religious grounds to
 participate in national service or vote in a referendum. This spurred widespread
 criticism that the members were shirking their civic duty. Although other individ-
 uals reportedly have been punished for failure to participate, only members of Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses have been subject to dismissal from the civil service, had their trad-
 ing licenses revoked, and been denied passports due to their refusal to participate
 in national service. In addition to these measures, members of Jehovah's Witnesses
 also are denied identification cards, trading licenses, and government housing uni-
 versally, unless they hide their religion. Several members of Jehovah's Witnesses
 were arrested for failure to comply with the National Service Law and some were
 tried, although there is no information available regarding the verdicts or sentences
 in these cases. Four members of the Jehovah's Witnesses have been detained with-
 out trial or charge for over four years. However, members of Jehovah's Witnesses
 are not barred from meeting in private homes.
 The Government has banned religious organizations from involvement in politics.
 The Government has discouraged foreign religious groups and nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) from proselytizing, as it believes that this could create unneces-
 sary friction in the delicate balance between the Muslim and Christian populations.
 In a 1995 proclamation, it described specific guidelines on the role of religion and
 religion-afiated NGO's in development and government, stating that development,
 
 
 politics, and public administration are the sole responsibility of the Government and
 citizens. As a result, religious organizations may fund, but not initiate or implement
 development projects. The proclamation also sets out rules governing relations be-
 tween religious organizations and foreign sponsors. In May the Government shut
 down the health clinic of a Presbyterian Church and refused to renew the visas of
 foreign church members, effectively ending the mission work' of the church. The
 Government restricts the right of the religious media to comment on politics or gov-
 ernment policies (see Section 2.a.).
 Authorities informed the Catholic Church in April that all Catholic schools would
 be incorporated into the public school system. At the time, it was not made clear
 whether the clerical authorities would continue to administer the curriculum with
 government oversight or whether the school faculty would be absorbed into the Min-
 istry of Education. However, no action was taken to implement this initiative be-
 cause of the outbreak of the border conflict with Ethiopia. In January religiously
 affiliated organizations were prohibited from running kindergartens.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the rights of movement and emigration.
 In general citizens may live where they choose and travel freely throughout the
 country. However some areas are restricted for security reasons. The border with
 Ethiopia was closed in May due to the outbreak of conflict, although Eritreans de-
 ported from Ethiopia crossed the border and were allowed to resettle in Eritrea. The
 deportees were provided with a $200 (1500 nakfa) grant from the Eritrean Relief
 and Refugee Commission, and, if they wished, placed in villages with frfends or fam-
 ily. Those who no longer had connections in Eritrea were placed temporarily in refu-
 gee camps before being settled in the general population. In order to facilitate the
 deportees' integration into society, the Government has provided them with docu-
 mentation of Eritrean citizenry. However, Ethiopians who wish to leave Eritrea en-
 countered a slow and frustrating process for the granting of exit visas. There was
 a report that Eritrean soldiers at a border post turned back busloads of fleeing Ethi-
 opians who claimed to have paid the required departure fee and been authorized
 to leave.
 Clashes between government forces and EIS members in 1997 led the Govern-
 ment to restrict travel along much of the border with Sudan. Some areas remain
 heavily mined, a legacy of the war for independence, and occasionally new mines
 are set by the EIS, leading to additional travel restrictions (see Section L.a.).
 Citizens are largely free to travel outside the country,- although members of Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses (see Section 2.c.), former ruling party members, those who have not
 completed national service, and intending emigrants have been denied passports or
 exit visas. In general citizens have the right to return. Instances in which citizens
 living abroad have run afoul of the law, contracted a serious contagious disease, or
 been declared ineligible for political asylum by other governments are considered on
 a case-by-case basis.
 Approximately 250,000 Eritreans have been internally displaced as a result of the
 conflict with Ethiopia.
 The law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylee status in accord-
 ance with the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and its 1967 Protocol. The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum and provided it to Sudanese
 refugees from the conflict in Sudan during the year. The Eritrean Relief and Refu-
 gee Commission, a government agency, is the principal organization for refugee
 issues.
 A pilot refugee return program sponsored by the UNHCR resulted in the repatri-
 ation of 25,000 Eritrean refugees from Sudan in 1995. However, a further 100,000
 of the estimated 136,000 Eritrean refugees remaining'in Sudan were not repatriated
 under the program because of the failure of the governments -of Eritrea and Sudan
 to conclude an agreement on the modalities of such a repatriation. Furthermore, all
 UNHCR foreign staff members were expelled from Eritrea in 1997 because of activi-
 ties that the Government alleged were inconsistent with the UNHCR mandate. Fol-
 lowing the release of an UNHCR survey in May indicating that there are some
 150,000 Eritreans in Sudan who wish to return home, the Government agreed to
 allow UNHCR foreign staff members to return during the year to help oversee the
 development of a coordinated reintegration strategy in May. No progress in repa-
 triating the remaining refugees had been made by year's end.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for this right, citizens have not yet been able
 to change their government in multiparty elections. Credible reports suggest that
 authority within the Government is held very narrowly. The Government is domi-
 nated by the PFDJ, which came to power in the 1993 popular referendum in which
 over 90 percent of voters chose an independent Eritrea managed by a transitional
 government run by the PFDJ rather than electing to remain part of Ethiopia. The
 PFDJ still has not fulfilled the ambitious program that it initially outlined for a
 transition to a democratically elected government in 1997. Elections originally
 scheduled for -1997 were postponed until 1998. However, an electoral commission
 was established in 1997 to draft an electoral code for 1998 elections, but accom-
 plished little because of the outbreak of the border conflict with Ethiopia, and elec-
 tions again were postponed, this time indefinitely. The government leadership also
 stated that public education and institutional structures were needed before
 multiparty democracy would be established.
 In an effort to encourage broader participation by women in politics, the PFDJ
 named 3 women to the party's Executive Council and 12 women to the Central Com-
 mittee in 1997. Women participated in the Constitutional Commission, are rep-
 resented in local assemblies, and hold senior government positions, including the po-
 sition of Minister of Justice.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are jointly
 responsible for handling human rights inquiries. All NGO's also must register with
 the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission. There are no domestic or international
 human rights organizations. In 1997 the Government proclaimed a policy restricting
 NGO activities to supporting the Government in the sectors of health and education.
 One human rights group, Citizens for Peace, was formed during the year to inves-
 tigate and publicize Ethiopia's deportation of Eritreans.
 In 1995 the Government proclaimed that religious organizations, including reli-
 gious-based NGO's, could not engage in development activities. The Government
 also removed religious-based indigenous NGO's completely from relief work in order
 to prevent the development of church-based organizations receiving money from
 abroad (see Section 2.d.). In January religiously affiliated organizations were prohib-
 ited from running kindergartens, and in May the Government announced that all
 schools run by the Catholic church were to be incorporated into-the state system
 (see Section 2.d.).
 A governmental proclamation issued in 1996 required that all private NGO's hire
 only those who have completed their national service. This proclamation was part
 of the Governmenes effort to establish a national service program as a legal obliga-
 tion of all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.
 All foreign staff members of NGO's or any non-diplomatic organization who live
 and work in the country for more than 183 days must pay the highest income tax
 rate, 38 percent of their salaries and allowances. In January the Government or-
 dered the remaining NGO's to close down their programs, allegedly because they
 wasted too much money on administrative costs. Most NGO's left by mid-year, al-
 though several remained at year's end including Dutch Interchurch Aid, Norwegian
 Church Aid, Lutheran Church Aid, and Africare. These NGO's have small offices,
 local staff only and channel money to the Government. Observers believe that they
 face minimal risk of being shut down.
 In July the ICRC opened an office in the country. The ICRC was granted full ac-
 cess to assist those Ethiopians who wished to depart Eritrea and coordinated with
 its counterpart office in Addis Ababa to supervise cross-border exchanges. The ICRC
 also was permitted access to the few Ethiopians who remained in detention. How-
 ever, the ICRC was not permitted to visit Ethiopian POW's (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government expelled all UNHCR foreign staff members for the country in
 1997 (see Section 2.d.); however, in May the Government allowed them to return.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The transitional Civil Code prohibits discrimination against women, children, and
 the disabled, and the Government generally enforces these provisions.
 Women.-The Government has publicly taken a firm stand against domestic vio-
 lence. Health, police, and judicial authorities report that no serious domestic vio-
 lence problem exists.
 
 
 146
 The Government consistently advocated improving the status of women, many of
 whom played a significant role as fighters in the struggle for independence. Since
 independence women have enjoyed a legal right to equal educational opportunities,
 equal pay-for equal work, and legal sanctions against domestic violence. In 1994 the
 Third Party Congress advocated more rights for women, including parity in the
 right to land and other property. However, much of society remains traditional and
 patriarchal, and most women have an inferior status to men in their homes and
 communities. The law provides a framework for improving the status of women, but
 laws are implemented unevenly, because of both a lack of capacity in the legal sys-
 tem and ingrained cultural attitudes. In practice, males retain privileged access to
 education, employment, and control of economic resources, with more disparities in
 rural areas than in cities.
 The law requires that women between the 'ages of 18 and 40 participate in the
 national service program..
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for govern-
 ment policies concerning the rights and welfare of children. The Government in
 1996 created the Children's Affairs Division under the Ministry of Labor and
 Human Welfare. The Children's Affairs Division covers childcare, counseling, and
 probation. Due to a shortage of schools and teachers, half the country's children are
 unable to attend school. Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by
 international health experts as'damaging to both physical and psychological health,
 is widespread, with estimates placing the number of women and girls who have
 been subjected to FGM at 95 percent. FGM is practiced by almost all ethnic and
 religious groups. There is no law prohibiting FGM. The Government, through edu-
 cation programs sponsored by the Ministry of Health and the National Union of Eri-
 trean Women, a government organization, discourages this practice.
 People With Disabilities.-The long war for independence left thousands of men
 and women physically disabled from injuries they received as guerrillas and as civil-
 ian victims. The Government spends a large share of its resources to support and
 train these war disabled citizens, who are regarded as heroes, and does not discrimi-
 nate against them in training, education, or employment. There are no laws man-
 dating access for the disabled to public thoroughfares or public or private buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no government restrictions regarding the
 formation of unions, including in the military, the police, and other essential serv-
 ices. Labor association is encouraged by the Government, which promulgated Procla-
 mation 8 in 1991 providing workers with the legal right to form unions and to strike
 to protect their interests. The National Confederation of Eritrean Workers (NCEW),
 which was part of the EPLF during the war, is independent of both the Government
 and the PFDJ. It represents over 20,000 workers from 129 unions and receives some
 assistance from the ILO, and.foreign union organizations. The largest union is the
 Textile, Leather, and Shoe Federation. There were no strikes reported during the
 year.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, although none attempted to do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The International Labor Or-
 ganization (ILO) provided assistance in 1993 to prepare the draft labor code, which
 prohibits antiunion discrimination- by employers and establishes a mechanism for
 resolving complaints of discrimination. In 1995 the Government indicated its inten-
 tion to ratify several key ILO conventions on labor, but still has not done so. The
 NCEW continues to press for ratification of the ILO conventions, although the Min-
 istry of Labor and Human Welfare indicated that ratification might not occur for
 some time. Wages are determined by the market.
 There are no export processing zones. o
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no law prohibiting forced
 or compulsory labor, but it is not known to occur. All citizens between the ages of
 18 and 40 are required to participate in the National Service Program, which in-
 cludes military training as well as civic action programs. High school students also
 are required to participate in a summer work program, for which they are paid.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 18 years, although apprentices may be hired at age
 16. While the Ministry of Labor andHuman Welfare is responsible for the enforce-
 ment of laws pertaining to the employment of children, there is no inspection sys-
 tem in place to monitor compliance. The Government has not ratified the ILO Con-
 vention on the Prohibition of Child Labor. According to labor officials, 50 percent
 of children are not able to attend school due to a shortage of schools and teachers.
 It is common for rural children who do not attend classes to work on their family
 farms, and in urban areas, some children are street vendors of cigarettes, news-

 apers, or chewing gum. The law does not prohibit forced or bonded labor, including
 at performed by children, but there were no reports that it occurred (see Section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are two systems regulating employment
 conditions, the civil service system, and the labor law system. There is no legally
 mandated minimum wage in the private sector. In the civil service sector wages
 vary from $34 to $400 (250 to 3000 nakfa) per month, with factory workers in gov-
 ernment-owned enterprises earning the highest wages. The minimum wage does not
 provide the average worker and family with a decent standard of living.
 The standard workweek is 44  hours, but many persons work fewer hours. There
 is no legal provision for a day of rest, but most workers are allowed 1 to 1  days
 off per week. The Government has instituted occupational health and safety stand-
 ards, but inspection and enforcement vary widely among factories. Workers are per-
 mitted to remove themselves from dangerous work sites without retaliation.
