 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia made further progress in its transition from a highly centralized, Com-
 munist-led state to a full-fledged, multiparty, parliamentary democracy, although
 the process continues to evolve and these gains still must be solidified. The Prime
 Minister is nominated by the majority party and, with the agreement of the Presi-
 dent, is approved by the State Great Hural (Parliament), the national legislature.
 Mongolia's progress in the development of democratic institutions was demonstrated
 by the unexpected June 1996 election defeat of the Mongolian People's Revolution-
 ary Party (MPRP), which had been in power since 1921. The MPRP accepted its de-
 feat and has entered into its role in opposition. There are 1? political parties, 4 of
 which hold seats in the Parliament.
 Security forces are under civilian control; the Minister of Defense is the first civil-
 ian to hold this post. The national police have primary responsibility for law en-
 forcement. The military forces are responsible for external security, including border
 security. Reduced government spending continued to force downsizing of the mili-
 tary forces. The State Security Agency (SSA), formerly the Mongolian Central Intel-
 ligence Agency is responsible for internal security; its head has ministerial status
 and reports directly to the Prime Minister; a parliamentary committee oversees the
 military forces, the police, and the SSA.
 Despite reforms in the 1990's, most large economic entities remain under state
 control; the Government plans to privatize 60 percent of these entities by 2000. The
 economy continued to expand and strengthen, and inflation dropped below 10 per-
 cent. Mongolia remains a very poor country, with per capita income at approxi-
 mately $380 per year. It relies heavily on foreign economic assistance. The main-
 stays of the economy continue to be copper production and other mining; livestock
 raising, which is done by a majority of the rural population; and related food-, wool-
 ,and hide-processing industries, which meet both local needs and produce goods for
 export. A growing trade and small entrepreneurial sector in the cities provides basic
 consumer goods. Minerals, especially copper, comprise the bulk of export earnings.
 An inadequate energy system, lack of transportation and other infrastructure, legal
 and regulatory deficiencies, petty corruption, and a small domestic market discour-
 age foreign investment.

 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 problems remain including poor prison conditions, restrictions on due process for
 prisoners, occasional government manipulation of the media, official harassment of
 some religious groups that sought to register, and violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-It is suspected that the unsolved
 murder of the Minister of Infrastructure in October was politically motivated.
 There were no other reports of political or extrajudicial killings; however, approxi-
 mately 200 prisoners died in custody during the year, largely due to disease and
 inadequate management by the authorities (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids such practices, and reports of such actions dimin-
 ished, occasional beatings of prisoners and detainees by members of the security
 forces occur in the countryside. Reforms undertaken by the Ministry of Justice upon
 Parliament's recommendation, following reports by international human rights ob-
 servers, have changed significantly the way that accused persons and prisoners are
 treated. The Ministry's Department for the Enforcement of Court Decisions now
 monitors conditions; however, the new laws and procedures have not been widely
 publicized, especially in the -countryside, and- citizens are not aware always of their
 rights with respect to detention and arrest.
 Prison facilities are poor-including insufficient food and heat-and threaten the
 health of inmates. Many inmates entered prison already infected with tuberculosis,
 or contracted it in prison, and almost 80 percent of those who died in prison died
 of this disease. Approximately 200 prisoners died in custody, largely due to disease
 and inadequate management by the authorities. Some 160 of these prisoners died
 from tuberculosis. Although the number of inmates has remained fairly constant,
 the seriousness of crimes has increased. Severe crowding in both prisons and deten-
 tion facilities is common, aggravating management and funding problems. Reforms
 implemented in January increased prison staff, built smaller units, and provided
 better clothing and food, as well as health and hygiene instructions; the police
 stopped the practice of shaving prisoners' heads.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 shall be searched, arrested, detained, or deprived of liberty except by law, but these
 protections have not been fully codified. Under the Criminal Procedures Code, police
 may arrest those caught committing a crime and hold them for up to 72 hours be-
 fore the decision is taken to prosecute or release. A warrant must be issued by a
 prosecutor for incarceration of longer duration or when the actual crime was not
 witnessed. A detainee has the right to a defense attorney during this period and
 during any subsequent stage of the legal process. If a defendant cannot,afford a pri-
 vate attorney, the State will appoint an attorney.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The courts are independent, and there is no evidence that they discriminate
 against any group or that decisions are made for political reasons.
 The court system consists of local courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court. The 17-member Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system, hearing
 appeals from lower courts and cases involving alleged misconduct by high-level offi-
 cials. Local courts hear mostly routine criminal and civil cases; provincial courts
 hear more serious cases such as rape, murder, and grand larceny and also serve as
 the appeals court for lower court decisions. A Constitutional Court, separate from
 the criminal court system, has sole jurisdiction over constitutional questions. The
 General Council of Courts, an independent administrative body, nominates can-
 didates for vacancies on both the supreme and lower courts; the President has-the
 power to ratify or refuse to approve such nominations. The Council also is charged
 with ensuring the rights of judges and providing for the independence of the judici-
 ary.
 All accused persons are provided due process, legal defense, and a public trial, al-
 though closed proceedings are permitted in cases involving state secrets, rape cases
 involving minors, and other cases provided by law. Defendants may question wit-
 nesses and appeal decisions. Citizens made approximately 25 complaints about the
 legal system to the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
 Rights (UNHCHR). Most complaints were about corruption that allegedly resulted
 
 
 1013
 in unfair court decisions. The UNHCHR staff referred the complaints to nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) and the Ministry of Justice.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The State Rehabilitation Commission
 pays a one-time allowance to the families of approximately 29,000 individuals who
 were persecuted from 1922 through the 1960's.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the private beliefs and
 actions of citizens, and the Government generally respects this in practice. The head
 of the SSA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct the
 monitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of such monitoring
 is unknown.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the rights of free-
 dom of speech, press, and expression. The Government generally respects these
 rights in practice. An increasing variety of newspapers and other publications rep-
 resents major political party viewpoints as well as independent views. However,
 both state-controlled and independent media have been manipulated occasionally by
 the State in order to promote government policy. State-controlled media remain the
 largest organizations. Independent media sometimes complain of unequal access to
 government information and officials.
 In August the Parliament adopted a new media law that bans censorship of public
 information and legislation and also bans future legislation that would limit the
 freedom to publish and broadcast. It also bars state ownership of the media or fi-
 nancing of media organizations. The law was scheduled to go into effect on January
 1, 1999.
 Although in the past the Government controlled access to newsprint, all news-
 papers now buy newsprint directly from private suppliers, and neither party-affili-
 ated nor independent news media report difficulty securing an adequate supply. Due
 to transportation difficulties, uneven postal service, and fluctuations in the amount
 of newsprint available, access to a full range of publications is restricted in outlying
 regions.
 Libel laws are very generous to plaintiffs and a pitfall for small media. One nega-
 tive judgment can lead to bankruptcy. The larger, state-owned media can sustain
 such adverse financial judgments more readily.
 There is a government-financed television station with countrywide broadcasting
 capability, a limited-operation international joint venture private television channel,
 a private television station, and several radio stations in Ulaanbaatar. State-owned
 radio is particularly important as the major source of news in the countryside, but
 the one independent raio station broadcasts widely. Both official and private media
 present opposition and government news. Residents of Ulaanbaatar receive broad-
 casts from China, Russia, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United
 States, and other countries by commercial satellite and cable television systems. An
 estimated 50 to 60 percent of households have television.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right both to worship
 and not to worship and explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state. The
 Government generally respects these provisions in practice; however, some groups
 that sought to register faced official harassment. Although Mongolia has no official
 state religion, the Government has contributed to the restoration of several Bud-
 dhist sites. These are important religious, historical, and cultural centers. It does
 not subsidize the Buddhist religion otherwise,
 Under the provisions of a 1993 law on relations between church and state, the
 Government may supervise and limit the numbers of both places of worship and
 clergy for organized religions, but there are no reports that it has done so. Religious
 groups, however, must register with the Ministry of Justice. Proselytizing by reg-
 istered religious groups is allowed, although a Ministry of Education directive bans
 the mixing of foreign language or other training with religious teaching or instruc-
 tion. Contacts with coreligionists outside the country are allowed.
 The Government closed some Christian and Baha'i places of worship for failing
 to register properly- Some groups encountered harassment during the registration
 process, including demands by midlevel city officials that contributions of a set
 value be made in return for securing legal status. Even when registration was com-
 pleted, some religious groups were threatened with withdrawal of approval.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 
 
 1014
 
 as well as the right to travel and return without restriction, and the Government
 generally respects these rights in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees in the small
 number of cases reported in which such status has been claimed. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections by secret ballot and universal suffrage. Presidential,
 parliamentary, and local elections are held separately. In April the Prime Minister
 and his Government were forced to resi  by a voteof the parliamentary majority,
 and in a peaceful transition, within the framework of the Constitution, a new Prime
 Minister andcabinet were selected. The Government resigned again in July because
 of a stalemate with the opposition in Parliament, which obstructed legislative busi-
 ness. A caretaker government remained in charge until December when a new
 Prime Minister was selected. These political changes brought to the surface con-
 stitutional questions concerning, the powers of the president as Head of State and
 the presidenes relationship to Parliament and the government, particularly the
 power to approve the candidate for head of government as proposed by the majority
 party. These questions remain unresolved.                     �
 There are 17 registered political parties; 4 are represented in the Parliament.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women or minorities in
 government and politics. A recent by-election brought the total of female members
 of Parliament to 8 of 76, and Parliament approved the appointment of the first fe-
 male Foreign Minister in December. Women and women's organizations are increas-
 ingly vocal in local and national politics, and actively seek greater representation
 by women in government policymaking.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Humanb-Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 generally are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that. "... no person shall be discriminated against on the
 basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status," and that
 "..men and women shall be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields,
 and family." The Government generally en forces these provisions in practice.
 Women.-Violence against women is a serious problem. Although there are no re-
 liable or exact statistics regarding the extent of such abuse, human rights groups,
 women's groups, resident diplomats, and other observers believe that it is a common
 phenomenon. There is increasing public and media discussion of domestic violence,
 including spousal and child abuse, after many years of government and societal de-
 nial. The large economic and societal changes underway have created new stresses
 on families, including loss of jobs, inflation, and lowered spending on social and edu-
 cational programs. These factors, coupled with the serious problems caused by ex-
 tremely high rates of alcohol abuse, have led to increased instances of family abuse
 and abandonment, and have added to the number of single-parent families, most of
 which are headed by women. Although women's groups advocate new statutes to
 cope with domestic violence, there is no known police or government intervention
 in cases involving violence against women beyond prosecution under existing assault
 laws after formal charges have been filed. NGO's conducted training for police on
 how to deal with domestic violence cases. Rape is illegal, and offenders can be pros-
 ecuted and convicted, but there is no law specifically prohibiting spousal rape.
 The Constitution provides men and women with equal rights in all areas and,
 both by law and practice, women receive equal pay for equal work and have equal
 access to education. Women represent about half the workforce, and a significant
 number are the primary earners for their families. Many women occupy midlevel
 positions in government and the professions and many are involved in the creation
 and management of new trading and manufacturing businesses, but until recentiy,
 women were almost completely absent from the highest leadership levels of both the
 public and private sectors. There is no government agency that oversees women's
 rights. However, women and women's organizations are increasingly vocal in local
 and national politics and actively seek greater representation in government policy-
 making.
 
 
 1015
 There are approximately 36 women's rights groups that concern themselves with
 such issues as maternal and children's health, domestic violence, and equal oppor-
 tunity. The law prohibits women from working in certain occupations that require
 heavy labor or exposure to chemicals that could affect infant and maternal health.
 The Government enforces these provisions.
 Children.-Increased stress on the family structure and throughout society has
 had an adverse effect on many children, and the Government has been unable to
 keep pace with the educational, health, and social needs of the most rapidly growing
 segment of its population. The Government provides children of both sexes with
 free, compulsory public education through the age of 16, although family economic
 needs and state budgetary difficulties make it difficult for some children to attend
 school. In addition there continues to be a severe shortage of teachers and teaching
 materials at all educational levels.
 NGO's made significant efforts to assist orphane d  deserted children, and were
 largely responsible for a nationwide decrease of one-third in the number of street
 children, to an estimated 2,000. The Government is committed in principle to chil-
 dren's rights and welfare, but it provides only minimal support for the few shelters
 and orphanages that exist, and those facilities must turn to private sources to sus-
 tain their activities.
 Mongolia has a long tradition of support for, and often communal raising of chil-
 dren, and this tradition enjoys public support. The Government is now more willing
 to admit the extent of the problem of orphaned children, but lacks the resources to
 improve the welfare of children who have become the victims of larger societal and
 familial changes.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment and education, and the Government provides benefits to the disabled
 according to the nature and severity of disability. Those who have been injured in
 industrial accidents have the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work.
 The Government also provides tax benefits to enterprises that hire the disabled, and
 some firms hire the disabled exclusively. There is no legislation mandating access
 for the disabled. Some disabled citizens groups are lobbying for higher government
 subsidies.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution entitles all workers to form or join
 union and professional organizations of their choosing. Union officials estimate that
 union membership totals over 450,000 persons, about half the workforce. Union
 membership is decreasing as the economy shifts from large state enterprises and as
 increasing numbers of workers either become self-employed or work at small, non-
 unionized firms. No arbitrary restrictions exist on who may be a union official; offi-
 cers are elected by secret ballot.
 Union members have the right to strike. Those employed in essential services,
 which the Government defines as occupations critical for national defense and safe-
 ty, including police, utility, and transportation workers, do not have the right to
 strike.
 Most union members are affiliated with the Mongolian Trade Unions Confed-
 eration, but some are affiliated with the newer Association of Free Trades Unions.
 Both organizations have ties with international labor organizations and confed-
 erations in other countries.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In theory wage levels and
 other employment issues are decided in tripartite contract negotiations between em-
 ployer, union, and government representatives. The Government's role is limited to
 ensuring that the contract meets legal requirements as to hours and conditions of
 work. In practice wages and other conditions of employment are set mainly by the
 employer, whether that employer is a private firm or the Government.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law specifically prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor, including forced labor by children. The Government en-
 forces this law. However, most members of the military forces are required to help
 with the fall harvest. In many cases, prisoners work to support the detention facility
 in which they are held.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law prohibits children under the age of 16 from
 working, although those 14 and 15 years of age may do so with parental consent.
 Those under 18 years of age may not work at night, engage in arduous work, or
 work in dangerous occupations such as mining and construction. Enforcement of
 these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regulations, is the responsibility of
 
 
 1016
 state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These inspectors have
 the authority to compel immediate compliance with labor legislation, but enforce-
 ment is limited due to the small number of labor inspectors and the growing num-
 ber of independent enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage is approximately $14
 (12,000 tugriks) per month. This level applies to both public and private sector
 workers and is enforced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. This is the lowest
 wage for manual labor, such as janitorial work; virtually all civil servants earn more
 than this amount, and many in private businesses earn considerably more. The min-
 imum wage alone is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family.
 An amendment to the Labor Code that took effect on January 1 set the standard
 legal workweek at 40 hours and established a minimum rest period of 48 hours be-
 tween workweeks. For those under 18 years of age, the workweek is 36 hours, and
 overtime work is not allowed. Overtime work is compensated at either double the
 standard hourly rate or by giving time off equal to the number of hours of overtime
 worked. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are prohibited by law from working
 overtime.
 Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health and safety
 standards, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare provides enforcement. According
 to labor law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work sit-
 uations and still retain their jobs. Mongolia's near-total reliance on outmoded ma-
 chinery and problems with maintenance and management lead to frequent indus-
 trial accidents, particularly in the mining, power, and construction sectors. Effective
 enforcement of existing occupational health and safety standards is difficult, but the
 Government increased the number of full-time inspectors to 86 to cover a growing
 number of small enterprises.
