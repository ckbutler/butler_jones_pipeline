 KUWAIT
 Amirs, or princes, from the AI-Sabah family have ruled Kuwait in consultation
 with prominent community figures for over 200 years. The Constitution, adopted in
 1962 shortly after independence, provides for an elected National Assembly and
 enumerates the powers of the Government and the rights of citizens. It also permits
 the Amir to suspend its articles during periods of martial law. The Amir twice sus-
 pended constitutional provisions from 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992 and ruled
 extraconstitutionally during these periods. Kuwait was occupied by Iraq from Au-
 gust 1990 to February 1991, when Iraqi forces were expelled by an international co-
 alition. The National Assembly resumed functioning after the 1992 elections. Na-
 tional Assembly elections were held again in 1996. Legislation passed in 1996 grant-
 ed the judiciary greater administrative and financial independence, but the Amir
 appoints all judges, and renewal of many judicial appointments as subject to govern-
 ment approval.
 The Iinistry of Interior supervises the security apparatus, including the Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two agencies
 that, in addition to the regular police, investigate internal security-related offenses.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.

 Richly endowed with oil, in 1997 the country's estimated gross domestic product
 (GDP) is approximately $17,667 per capita. The decline in per capita GDP from pre-
 vious years reflects a sigmficant increase in resident foreign workers rather than
 a decline in economic activity. Costly reconstruction undertaken to recover from the
 destruction caused by the Iraqi occupation led the Government to incur a cumu-
 lative fiscal deficit of approximately $70 billion, which it covered by liquidating gov-
 ernment-owned foreign assets and increasing the public debt. The Government is
 gradually reducing the deficit and plans to eliminate it by 2000. Due to high oil rev-
 enues in 1997, Kuwait recorded a $1.3 billion budget surplus. Despite its emphasis
 on an open market, the Government continues to dominate the local economy
 through direct expenditures and government-owned companies and equities. The
 Government has initiated a program of disposing of its holdings of stock in private
 companies. According to government statistics, 92 percent of the indigenous work
 force is employed by the Government. Expatriates constitute 94 percent of the pri-
 vate sector work force.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, although serious
 problems remain in certain areas. Citizens cannot change their head of state. Police
 abuse detainees during interrogation. The Government bans formal political parties
 and women do not have the right to vote or seek election to the National Assembly.
 The Government restricts freedom of assembly and association, and places some
 limits on freedom of religion. Journalists practice self-censorship, and the Govern-
 ment uses informal censorship. The Government prevents the return to Kuwait of
 stateless persons who have strong ties to the country. Deportation orders may be
 issued by administrative order, and hundreds of people are being held in detention
 facilities pending deportation. Many have been held for up to 6 years. Discrimina-
 tion and violence against women are problems. Domestic servants are not protected
 by labor law, and unskilled foreign workers suffer from a lack of a minimum wage
 in the private sector, and from failures to enforce labor law.
 Although the Government has not found a solution to the human rights problems
 of the approximately 114,000 stateless people residing in Kuwait known as the
 "bidoon", the Government naturalized a small fraction of the bidoon, and made a
 proposal to consider the naturalization of approximately 10 percent of the bidoon
 population. The Amir commuted the sentences of 12 individuals who were convicted
 of security offenses in 1991 by Martial Law and State Security courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the investigations into the extra- judicial killings
 that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's liberation in February 1991.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There have been no developments since 1994 in the cases of disappearance that
 occurred following Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Iraqi authori-
 ties have not yet accounted for 598 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait, including 6
 women, who disappeared during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. The Government of
 Iraq has refused to comly with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which stipu-
 lates the release of the detainees. Iraq denies that it holds Kuwaiti detainees.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture; however, there continue to be credible reports
 that some police and members of the security forces abuse detainees during interro-
 g ation. Reported abuse includes blindfoldings, verbal threats, slaps, and blows. Po-
 ie and security forces were more likely to inflict such abuse on non-Kuwaitis, par-
 ticularly citizens of other non-Gulf Arab nations and Asians, than on citizens. There
 were credible reports of more serious abuse, including beatings, of several persons
 held in custody, although these appear to be isolated incidents.
 The Government says that it investigates all allegations of abuse and that it has
 punished at least some of the offenders. However, the Government does not make
 public the findings of its investigations or what, if any, punishments are imposed.
 This omission creates a climate of impunity, which diminishes deterrence against
 abuse.
 Defendants have the right to present evidence in court that they have been mis-
 treated during interrogation. However, the courts frequently dismiss abuse com-
 plaints because defendants are often unable to substantiate their complaints with
 physical evidence. Members of the security forces routinely do not reveal their iden-
 tity during interrogation, a practice that further complicates confirmation of abuse.
 
 
 1504
 Prison conditions, including conditions for those held for security offenses, meet
 minimum international standards, in terms -f food, access to basic health care,
 scheduled family visits, cleanliness, and oppotunities for work and exercise. Con-
 tinuin problems, include overcrowding anc the availability of specialized medical
 care.   addition, some minor children of female prisoners -stay in the prison with
 their mothers, where they are provided -some access to educational instruction. In
 January the Government acted to improve prison conditions by removing contra-
 .band in the form of illegal drugs and weapons from the prison population and by
 removing prison officials who were implicated in drug smuggling. Sme Jordanian
 prisoners alleged that they had been abused during -a January search and seizure
 operation.Investigations of the incident by local and international humanitarian or-
 ganizations suggested that it was an isolated event, that the Jordanians were not
 specifically targeted, and that it did not characterize overall prison conditions.
 The National Assembly's Human Rights Committee continues-to monitor prison
 conditions,. and the Government allows the ICRC access to all detention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or -Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest dur-
 ingthe year.
 Police officers must obtain an arrest warrant-from state prosecutors before mak-
 ing an arrest, although in misdemeanor cases the arresting officer may issue them.
 Security forces occasionally detain persons at checkpoints in Kuwait City (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 Under the Penal Code, a suspect may not be held more than 4 days without
 charge. Security officers sometimes prevent families from visiting detainees during
 this confinement. After 4 days, prosecutors must either release the suspect or file
 charges. If charges are filed, prosecutors may remand a suspect to an additional 21
 days in detention. Prosecutors may also obtain court, orders for further detention
 pending trial.
 Approximately 1,800 persons are serving, sentences or pending trial at the central
 prison. Of the 1,800, approximately 200 are being held in the cential prison on secu-
 rity-related grounds. At any. given time, an additional 600. prisoners are being held
 .in the Taha detention facility. pending deportation. Many deportation orders are is-
 sued administratively, without benefit of a trial. The Government may expel nonciti-
 zens (including "bidoon", i.e., stateless residents of Kuwait, some of whom are na-
 tive-born or long-term residents), if it considers them security risks. The Govern-
 ment may also expel foreigners if they are unable to obtain or renew work or resi-
 dency permits. About 10 percent of the detainees awaiting deportation, especially
 Iraqis, stateless Palestinians, Jordanians and bidoon, have been in detention for
 more than 1 year, some for up to 6 years. however, the Government does not deport
 such detainees to their country of. origin against their will. The Government began
 granting bail, upon the sponsorship of a citizen,, to 'prisoners held on non-security
 related charges at Talha deportation center. The Government also improved health
 and nutritional standards at the center. In Novemberthe Government implemented
 an amnesty program that allowed illegal residents, if they had no previous charges
 pending, to depart the country without penalty through December 16 (see Section
 2.d.).
 The law protects citizens from exile, and there are no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution states that 'judges shall not be
 subject to any authority,' and legislation passed in 1996 granted the judiciary great-
 er administrative and financial independence. However, the Amir appoints all
 judges, and renewal of many judicial appointments is subject to government ap-
 proval.
 Judges who are citizens have lifetime appointments, but the Government also em-
 ploys many non-citizens as judges. These non-Kuwaiti judges work under 1- to 3-
 year renewable contracts, which undermines their independence. The Ministry of
 Justice may remove judges for cause, but rarely does so. Foreign residents involved
 in legal disputes with citizens frequently complain that the courts show a pro-Ku-
 waiti bias.
 One court system tries both civil and criminal cases. The Court of Cassation is
 the highest level of judicial appeal. Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have recourse to courts
 of their respective denominations for family law cases; however, there is no Shi'a
 appellate court. Shi'a cases are referred to the Sunni court on appeal.
 Defendants have the right to confront their accusers and appeal verdicts. The
 Amir has the constitutional power to pardon or commute all sentences. Defendants
 in felony cases. are required by law to be represented in court by legal counsel,
 which the courts will provide in criminal cases. In misdemeanor cases, defendants
 have the right to waive the presence of legal counsel, and the court is not required
 to provide counsel to indigent defendants.
 
 
 1505
 Both defendants and prosecutors may appeal court verdicts to the High Court of
 Appeal, which may rule on whether the law was properly applied, as well as on the
 guilt or innocence of the defendant. Decisions of the High Court of Appeal may be
 presented to the Court of Cassation, which will conduct a limited, formal review of
 cases to determine only whether the law was properly applied.
 In the regular court system there are no groups, including women, who are barred
 from testifying or whose testimony is given lesser weight. However, the Islamic
 courts, which have jurisdiction over family law, apply Shari'a (Islamic) law, which
 states that the testimony of two women equals that of one man.
 There are no reported political prisoners. The Government continues to incarcer-
 ate persons convicted of collaboration with Iraq during the occupation. By law such
 collaboration is a felony. Most of the people convicted in the Martial Law Court in
 1991, and the Special State Security Court, which was abolished in 1995, did not
 receive fair trials. In February the Amir commuted the sentences of 12 individuals,
 two Kuwaitis and ten Jordanians, convicted by the Martial Law and State Security
 Courts. This group included 7 of the 16 remaining Jordanian journalists who
 worked for the Iraqi publication A-Nida during the 1990 occupation (see Section
 2.a.). in addition, the Amir pardoned a total of 405 prisoners, the largest group ever,
 and reduced the sentences of 590 more.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. The police
 must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless they are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, or if alcohol or narcotics
 are suspected on the premises. The warrant can be obtained from the state prosecu-
 tor or, in the case of private property, from a judge. The security forces occasionally
 monitor the activities of individuals and their communications.
 By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
 Many citizens comply with this law by validating their foreign marriage certificate
 at a Kuwaiti embassy or consulate. Although the Government may advise against
 marriage to a foreign national, there are no known cases of the Government refus-
 ing permission to marry. The Government also advises women against marrying for-
 eign nationals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution states that "freedom of the
 press, printing, and publishing shall be guaranteed in accordance with the condi-
 tions and manner specified by law." With a few exceptions, citizens are free to criti-
 cize the Government at public meetings and in the media. However, journalists
 practice self-censorship. Several laws empower the Government to impose restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and of the press, but they are rarely invoked. The Gov-
 ernment, through the Ministry of Information, practices informal censorship by plac-
 ing pressure on individual publishers and editors believed to have "crossed the line"
 in attacking government policies and discussing issues deemed offensive to Islam,
 tradition, or the interests of the State.
 Newspapers are privately owned and free to publish on many social, economic,
 and poliical issues and frequently criticize government policies and officials, includ-
 ing the Crown Prince, who is also the Prime Minister.
 The Government ended prepublication censorship in 1992, but journalists still
 censor themselves. The Press Law prohibits the publication of any direct criticism
 of the Amir, official government communications with other states, and material
 that serves to "attack religions" or "incite people to commit crimes, creates hatred,
 or spread dissension among the populace." In April the editor-in-chief and a journal-
 ist from Al Hadath were each fined $250 (75 Kuwaiti dinars) for violating the Press
 Law's prohibition on publishing "immoral or defamatory" material. The case
 stemmed from the publication of comments made by Kuwait University professor
 Alia Shuaib on the prevalence of lesbianism among the student body. In 1995 the
 Government banned publication of one newspaper, Al Anba, for 5 days under a law
 that the media and opposition parliamentarians alleged was unconstitutional. The
 paper took the Government to court, and has appealed an initial court ruling in
 favor of the Government. The case is still pending in the Appeals Court. The Gov-
 ernment is reportedly seeking a settlement.
 In order to begin publication of a newspaper, a publisher must obtain an operat-
 ing license from the Ministry of Information. However, in July, the National Assem-
 bly began printing its own weekly newspaper, Al-Dustour (the Constitution), with-
 out having obtained a license, but without interference from the executive branch
 of government. Publishers may lose their license if their publications do not appear
 for 6 months. This 6-month rule prevents publishers from publishing sporadicaly-
 it is not used to suspend or shut down existing newspapers. Individuals must also
 
 
 1506
 obtain permission from the Ministry of Information before publishing any printed
 material, including brochures and wall posters.
 The Government does not censor foreign journalists and permits them open access
 to the country.
 In February the Amir commuted the sentences of 7 of the remaining 16 Jordanian
 journalists who worked for the Iraqi publication Al-Nida during the 1990 occupa-
 tion. The Jordanians, who were convicted in 1991, argued that their collaboration
 was under duress, in response to Iraqi threats.
 The Government owns and controls the radio and television companies. The Gov-
 ernment does not inhibit the purchase of satellite dishes which are widely available.
 Citizens with such devices are free to watch a variety of programs, including those
 broadcast from Israel.
 The Ministry of Information censors all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and
 other imported publications deemed morally offensive. However, the Ministry has
 censored political topics as well and does not grant licenses to magazines with a po-
 litical focus; The General Organization of Printing and Publishing controls the
 printing, publishing, and distribution of informational materials. In November the
 .Ministry of Information released for sale -at an-international Arab book fair in the
 country 160 books that previously had been censored.
 In May the Government defeated a bill in the National Assembly to ban concerts
 and fashion shows. The Ministry of Information, announced that current regulations
 already prohibit any performance contrary to Islamic tradition, but that the Min-
 istry -would tightly regulate such shows. A ministerial decree issued in July reiter-
 ated this position by forbidding the issuance of licenses for public musical events
 that contradict Shari'a and Kuwaiti traditions.
 There is no government -censorship of university teaching, research, or publica-
 tion. However, academics are subject to the same restraints as the media with re-
 gard to criticism of the Amir or Islam. Kuwait University political science depart-
 ment chairman Ahmad A1-Baghdadi was, charged with violating the Press Law's
 prohibition against insulting the Prophet. He faces a maximum penalty of 6-months
 imprisonment or a monetary- fine if he is found guilty of the offense. In 1996 Al-
 Bbaghdadi was branded an apostate by private individuals for writing an article
 deemed critical of the Prophet. In March a Kuwait University panel recommended
 the dismissal of- Dr. Alia Shuaib, a professor who commented on lesbianism at the
 university. The recommendation requires the endorsement of the Minister of Edu-
 cation, who has thus far refrained from acting on the panel's recommendation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution af-
 firms the right to assembly, the Government restricts this right in practice. Public
 gatherings must receive prior government approval, as must private gatherings of
 more than 5 persons that result in the issuance of a public statement. Political ac-
 tivity finds its outlet in informal, family-based, almost exclusively male, social gath-
 erings known as diwaniyas. Practically every, male adult, including the Amir, hosts
 and attends diwaniyas, at which every possible topic is discussed. The diwaniya con-
 tributes to the development of political consensus and official decision making.
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of association, the Gbovernment re-
 stricts this right in practice. The Government bans political parties. Several infor-
 mal blocs, acting much like parties, exist and were active during the 1996 National
 Assembly elections. The Government has made no effort to constrain these
 groupings, which are organized on the basis of common ideological goals. Many may
 ecategorized as "opposition" groups.
 In May a groupof 75 prominent citizens established a self- declared new political
 grouping, the National Democratic Association (NDA). Claiming to represent Ku-
 waits, moderate "silent majority," the NDA plans to focus on issues such as fran-
 chise expansion, education, unemployment, privatizatian, and other economic issues.
 ,The NDA purports to be the irst political grouping to include a woman on its execu-
 tive bard. The NDA's elaborate launching ceremony was thwarted by the Govern-
 ment's non-response to the group's request for a permit to hold a public meeting.
 As a result, theNDA's opening session nd accompanying press conference were
 moved from a hotel ballroom to a private office.
 All nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) must obtain a license from the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Labor. The Government uses its power to license as a
 means of political control. The Ministry has-registered 55 NGO's, including profes-
 sional groups, a bar association, and scientific bodies. These groups receive govern-
 ment subsidies for their operating expenses. Their members must obtain permission
 from the Ministry before attending international conferences. Since 1985 the Min-
 istry has issued only two licenses. The Ministry has disapproved other license re-
 quests on the grounds that previously established NGO's already provide services
 similar to those proposed by the petitioners.
 
 
 1507
 
 The Prisoners of War (POW) families organization, a new but as yet unlicensed
 NGO, was established in the summer. The license request was still pending at
 year's end.
 The Government generally overlooks the activities of many unlicensed NGO's, de-
 spite a 1993 decree ordering unregistered NGO's to cease activities. No organization
 has challenged the 1993 decree in court.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. The Constitution states that
 Islamic law, Shari'a, is "a main source of legislation." The ruling family and many
 prominent Kuwaiti families belong to the denomination of Sunni Islam. However,
 30 to 40 percent of the population belong to the Shi'a denomination. They are free
 to conduct their traditional forms of worship without government interference. How-
 ever, Shi'a figures claim that the Government has not approved the construction of
 new Shi'a mosques in recent years.
 The Constitution states that "all people are equal in. . . public rights and duties
 before the law, without distinction as to . . . religion," and that "freedom of belief
 is absolute. The state protects the freedom to practice religion in accordance with
 established customs, provided that it does not conflict with public policy or morals."
 There are several legally recognized expatriate congregations and churches, includ-
 ing a Catholic diocese and several Protestant churches. Expatriates who are mem-
 bers of religions not sanctioned in the Koran, e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists,
 may not build places of worship but may worship privately in their homes. The Gov-
 ernment prohibits missionaries to proselytize among Muslims; however, they may
 serve expatriate congregations. The law prohibits religious education for religions
 other than Islam, although this law is not rigidly enforced. The Government does
 not permit the establishment of non-Islamic publishing companies or training insti-
 tutions for clergy.
 Although there is a small community of Christian citizens, the law prohibits the
 naturalization of non-Muslims. A non-Muslim male must convert to Islam when he
 marries a Muslim woman if the wedding is to be legal in Kuwait. A non-Muslim
 female does not have to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim male, but it is to her
 advantage to do so, i.e., failure to do so may mean that the Muslim father will be
 granted custody of children should the couple later divorce.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely within the country and to
 change their workplace as desired. Unmarried women the age of 21 and over are
 free to obtain a passport and travel abroad at any time. However, married women
 who apply for passports must obtain their husband's signature on the application
 form. Once she has a passport, a married woman does not need her husband's per-
 mission to travel, but he may prevent her departure from the country by placing
 a 24-hour travel ban on her. He can do this by contacting the immigration authori-
 ties. After this 24-hour period, a court order is required if the husband still wishes
 to prevent his wife from leaving the country. All minor children must have their
 father's permission to travel outside of the country. Citizens are free to emigrate
 and to return.
 The Government has the right to place a travel ban on any citizen or foreigner
 who has a legal case pending before the courts.
 A serious problem exists in the case of the bidoon, who are stateless persons,
 many of Iraqi or Iranian descent, who resided in Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion.
 The Government argues that many bidoon (the term means "without ") are conceal-
 ing their true citizenship in order to remain in Kuwait, become citizens, and enjoy
 the generous benefits provided to citizens. Some bidoon have had residency ties to
 Kuwait for generations. Others entered Kuwait during the oil boom years. There are
 approximately 114,000 stateless persons in Kuwait, down from a prewar level of
 about 220,000. The Government does not wish the return of the bidoon who de-
 parted Kuwait during the Gulf War and frequently delays or denies issuing them
 entry visas. This policy imposes serious hardships and family separations. In March
 the Government naturalized 111 children of bidoon fathers who died in the service
 of the country during the Iraqi invasion and occupation. In addition, 300 individuals
 were naturalized in July under an article of the Nationality Law that pertains to
 granting citizenship to the children of Kuwaiti mothers and foreign fathers. Credible
 reports suggest that those naturalized in July were bidoon children of Kuwaiti
 mothers. The Government announced in August that approximately 3,400 bidoon
 had "found" their citizenship and were permitted to remain in Kuwait using their
 original passports. This meant that nationals from Gulf Cooperation Council coun-
 tries could remain in Kuwait without residence permits but nationals from all other
 countries had to obtain a residence permit to live and work in the country.
 The Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the number of nationals
 from those countries that supported Iraq during its invasion of Kuwait. The number
 
 
 1508
 of such residents is now only about 10 percent of its prewar total. The Government
 instituted a policy in 1996 to route the residence permit renewals of these nationals
 through the State Security Service. As a result, there has been a sharp increase in
 the number of renewal denials for these nationals, many of whom have no country
 of origin to return to or have fears of persecution upon return.
 The Government permits the ICRC to verify if a deportee objects to returning to
 his country of origin. The Government detains those deportees who have objections
 at the main Talha deportation center. Many have been held for 1 year or more;
 some have been held for up to 6 years.
 Security forces in Kuwait city occasionally set up checkpoints where they may de-
 tain individuals. The checkpoints are mainly for immigration purposes and are used
 to apprehend undocumented aliens. In November and December, the use of roadside
 checpoints increased considerably as authorities stepped up the number of checks
 as part of the illegal resident amnesty program, and in preparation for the 18th an-
 nual Gulf Cooperation Council summit, which was held in Kuwait December 20-22.
 In November the Government instituted an amnesty program, permitting illegal
 residents to depart the country without penalty, provided they had no previous
 charges pending against them. The program was scheduled to_ end o December 15;
 however, the Government extended it Iday The Government announced that more
 than 11,500 illegal foreign residents departed the country and 12,074 legalized their
 status during the amnesty program. Officially registered bidoon were  exempt from
 the program (see Section 1.d.).
 There is no legislation governing refugees, asylees, or firstlasylum, and no clear
 standard procedure for processing a person's claim to be a refugee. The Constitution
 prohibits the extradition of political refugees. The Government states that it does
 not deport anyone who claims a fear of persecution in his home country, but it will
 often keep such persons in detention rather than grant them permission to live and
 work in Kuwat. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 maintains an office in Kuwait and has access to refugees in detention.
 -Section 3- Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change. Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot change their head of state. Women. and citizens naturalized less
 than 20 years earlier may not vote or seek election to the National Assembly. In
 addition, members of the armed forces, police, and other uniformed personnel of the
 Ministry of Interior are prohibited from voting.
 Under the Constitution, the Amir holds executive power and shares legislative
 -power with the National Assembly. The Prime Minister presides over a 14-member
 cabinet. In accordance with the practice of the ruling family, the Prime Minister has
 always been the Crown Prince. The Constitution empowers the Amir to suspend its
 provisions and to rule by decree. The Amir dissolved the National Assembly from
 1976 to 1981, and in 1986 the Amir effectively dissolved the Assembly by suspend-
 ing the constitutional provisions on the Assembly's election. The Assembly remained
 dissolved until 1992, when elections were held. Members serve 4-year terms, and
 -National.Assembly elections were held nn schedule in 1996. The elections were con-
 ducted freely~and fairly among the minority of citizens who are permitted to vote.
 Since-the Government prohibits political parties, Assembly candidates must nomi-
 nate themselves. Nonetheless, informal political groupings are active in the Assem-
 bly. The Constitution empowers the National Assembly to overturn any Amiri de-
 crees made during the dissolution, and the Assembly has done so in some cases.
 Women- are disenfranchised and have little opportunity to influence government.
 In the past, a majority of the members of the National Assembly have expressed
 opinions favoring women's rights to vote. In January four Members of Parliament
 submitted a.bill to grant women the right to vote and stand for election to the Na-
 tional Assembly. As-with women's rights legislation previously submitted, no strong
 parliamentary support currently exists for this law, and the Government has made
 no effort to persuade the National Assembly to pass the legislation. Women's groups
 in Kuwait are divided on the franchise issue.
 Members of the Shi'a minority are generally underrepresented in high govern-
 ment positions. Currently only one member of the Cabinet, 5 out of 50 National As-
 sembly members, and the armed forces chief of staff are Shi'a Muslims.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has prevented the establishment of local human rights groups
 by not approving their requests for licenses (see Section 2.b.). The Government per-
 mits international human rights organizations to visit Kuwait and to establish of-
 
 
 1509
 fices. Several organizations conduct field work and report excellent communication
 with and reasonable cooperation from the Government.
 The National Assembly has a Human Rights Committee, which takes testimony
 from individuals about abuses, investigates prison conditions, and has made non-
 binding recommendations for redress.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, national origin, lan-
 guage, or religion. However, laws and regulations discriminate in some cases
 against women and non-Kuwaitis, who face widesjiread social, economic, and judi-
 cial discrimination.
 Women.-According to some local experts, domestic abuse of women occurs in an
 estimated 15 percent 'of all marriages. Each of the country's 50 police stations re-
 ceives approximately 1 to 2 complaints of spousal abuse each week. Of the com-
 plaints received, approximately 60 percent involve spousal abuse of non-Kuwaiti
 women. The police and the courts generally seek to resolve family disputes infor-
 mally and may ask the offending spouse to sign a statement affirming that he will
 end the abuse. The police refer serious cases to the Psychiatric Department at the
 Ministry of Health. The courts have found husbands guilty of spousal abuse. There
 are reports of rape of female domestic servants by male employers.
 A significant number of employers physically abuse expatriate women working as
 domestic servants. The local press gives the problem considerable attention. In Au-
 gust the press published a report of alleged abuse of three Sri Lankan maids by
 their Kuwaiti employer. Justice officials promised to prosecute the employer if the
 abuse allegations are proved true. Foreign-born servants have the right to sue their
 employers for abuse, but few do so owing to both fear of deprtation and fear that
 the judicial system is biased against them. The Government has designated a police
 station to investigate complaints and provide some shelter for runaway maids. Both
 the police and the courts have taken action against employers when presented with
 evidence of serious abuse.
 Runaway servants seek shelter at their country's embassy, where they seek repa-
 triation or a change in employers. On several occasions, the Philippine and Sri
 Lankan embassies have each sheltered nearly 300 women. Although most of these
 women sought shelter due to contractual or financial problems with their employers,
 many also alleged physical and sexual abuse.
 Women exprience legal and social discrimination. Women are denied the right
 to vote (see Sction 3); their testimony is not given equal weight to that of males
 in the Islamic courts (see Section i.e.), and married women require their husband's
 permission to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d.). By law only men are able to con-
 fer citizenship, which means that children born to Kuwaiti mothers and stateless
 fathers are themselves stateless. Inheritance is governed by Islamic law, which dif-
 fers according to sects. In the absence of a direct male heir, Shi'a women may in-
 herit all property-, Sunni women inherit only a portion. The balance is divided
 among brother, uncles, and male cousins of the deceased.
 Women are traditionally restrained from choosing certain roles in society, and the
 law restricts women from working in "dangerous industries" and trades "harmful"
 to health. However, almost All citizens work for the State in office jobs, and women
 are allowed into most areas of the bureaucracy, including even oil well fire-fighting
 units. Educated women maintain that conservative religious trends limit career op-
 portunities. Nonetheless, an estimated 28 percent of women of working age are em-
 ployed. The law promises "remuneration equal to that of a man provided she does
 the same work." This promise is respected in practice. Women work as doctors, engi-
 neers, lawyers, bankers, and professors. A few have been appointed to senior posi-
 tions in the Ministry of Education and the state-owned Kuwaiti Petroleum Corpora-
 tion. However, there are no female judges or prosecutors.
 In case of divorce, the Government makes family entitlement payments to the di-
 vorced husband, who is expected by law and custom to provide for his children even
 though custody of minor children is usually given to the mother. The law discrimi-
 nates against women married to foreign men. These women are not entitled to gov-
 ernment housing subsidies, which are available to male citizens. The law also re-
 quires women to pay residence fees for their husbands and does not recognize mar-
 riage as the basis for granting residency to foreign-born husbands. Instead, the law
 grants residency only if the husband is employed. By contrast, men married to for-
 eign-born women do not have to pay residency fees for their spouses, and their
 spouses' right to residency derives from marriage.
 Polygyny is legal. A husband is obliged to inform his first wife that he is taking
 a second wife. The husband is obligated to provide the first wife a separate house-
 
 
 1510
 
 hold if that is her preference. It is the second wife's choice to get married. A first
 wife whG objects to a second marriage' can request' a divorce, but the court's deter-
 mination of divorce and child custody would be made on grounds other than the fact
 of the second marriage itself.
 There is at least on active woiien s organization and several other NGO's than
 follow women's rights issues.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Both boys
 and girls receive a free education up to the university level. The Government pro-
 vides free health care and a variety of other services to all children.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 Marriage of girls under the age of 17 is uncommon among the urban population,
 but remains a practice of the Bedouins in outlying areas.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no institutionalized discrimination against dis-
 abled people in employment, education, or in the provision of state services. Legisla-
 tion passed by the National Assembly in 1996 mandates accessibility for the dis-
 abled to all facilities frequented by the public, and provides an affirmative action
 employment program for the disabled. However, this law has not been fully imple-
 mented. The Government pays extensive benefits for disabled citizens, which cover
 transportation, housing, job training, and social welfare.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government's failure to improve the
 plight of the 114,000 bidoon remains a significant human rights abuse. The bidoon
 ave been the objects of hostile government policy since the mid-1980's. Since 1985
 the Government hs eliminated the bidoon from the census rolls, discontinued their
 access to government jobs and free education, and sought to deport many bidoon.
 In 1993 the Government decreed that bidoon males would no longer be allowed to
 enlist in the military service. Those presently in the armed forces are being gradu-
 ally replaced, although the Government in August allowed 800 bidoon sons of Ku-
 waiti mothers to enlist. The Government does not routinely issue travel documents
 to bidoon, and if bidoon travel abroad, they risk being barred from returning to the
 country unless they receive advance permission from the immigration authorities.
 Marriages pose special hardships because the offspring of male bidoon inherit the
 father's undetermined legal status.
 In May the National Assembly reviewed a proposal by the Government to natural-
 ize approximately 10 percent of the bidoon population, i.e., about 10,000 individuals.
 The proposal has not been enacted and there are credible reports that naturaliza-
 tion of the 10,000 could take a number of years. The proposal did not address the
 problem of the remaining approximately 104,000 bidoon. In March the Government
 naturalized a small fraction of the bidoon, primarily children of bidoon fathers who
 served in the military and were killed during the Iraqi invasion and occupation of
 Kuwait. The Government claims that it issues a residency visa, and legal status,
 to any bidoon who presents a passport, regardless of the country of issuance. This
 has led some bidoon to acquire passports from countries with which they have no
 tie, but which have liberal "economic citizenship" programs. There are reports that
 the Government has denied residency visas to some bidoon who obtained passports,
 particularly Iraqis. In some cases the Government has unilaterally decided the
 "real" nationalities of bidoon without a hearing and without possibility of review.
 In August 1996, the Government called on all bidoon to register with the Ministry
 of Interior and issued identification cards valid for 1 year or less. The Government
 announced in September that the cards would be renewed but did not stipulate the
 length of the renewal period.
 Since the end of the Gulf War, government policy has been targeted against work-
 ers from those nationalities whose leaders supported Iraq, especially Palestinians,
 Jordanians, and Yemenis. The Government argues that during the Iraqi occupation
 many residents from these places sided with the Iraqi forces. The Government has
 delayed or denied the issuance of work and residency permits to persons in these
 groups, and in many cases has hindered those workers that are permitted to reside
 in the country from sponsoring their families to join them. Many of these nationals
 have also resorted to the purchase of third country passports in order to gain entry
 to Kuwait or legalize their status in the country. A government policy to route the
 residency visas of these nationals through the State Security Service has led to a
 sharp increase in renewal denials (see Section 2.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, but are not required, to join
 unions. Nonetheless, the Government restricts the right of association by prohibiting
 all workers from freely establishing trade unions. The law stipulates that workers
 may establish only one union in any occupational trade, and that the unions may
 
 
 1511
 
 establish only one federation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has long
 criticized such restrictions.
 Approximately 50,000 people of a total work force estimated at 1,100,000 are orga-
 nized in 14 unions, 12 of which are affiliated with the Kuwait Trade Union Federa-
 tion (KTUF), the sole, legal trade union federation. The Bank Worker's Union and
 the Kuwait Airways Workers Union, constituting approximately 4,500 workers, are
 independent of the KTUF. The Government has shown no sign that it would accept
 the establishment of more than one legal trade union federation. The law stipulates
 that any new union must include at least 100 workers, of whom at least 15 are citi-
 zens. Both the ILO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) have criticized this requirement because it discourages unions in sectors
 employing few citizens, such as the construction industry and domestic sectors.
 The Government's pervasive oversight powers further erode union independence.
 The Government subsidizes as much as 90 percent of most union budgets, may in-
 spect the financial records of any union, and prohibits any union from engaging in
 political or religious activities, which the law does not clearly define. The law em-
 powers the courts to dissolve any union for violating labor laws or for threatening
 public order and morals." Such a court decision may be appealed. The Amir may
 a10 dissolve a union by decree. By law, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor
 is authorized to seize the assets of any dissolved union. The ILO has criticized this
 aspect of the law. Although no union has been dissolved, the law subordinates the
 legal existence of the unions to the power of the State.
 Approximately 955,000 foreigners are employed, constituting most of the work
 force but only 10 percent of the unionized work force. The law discriminates against
 foreign workers by permitting them to join unions only after 5 years of residence,
 and only as nonvoting members. Unlike union members who are citizens, foreign
 workers do not have the right to elect their leadership. The law requires that union
 officials must be citizens. The ILO has criticized the 5-year residency requirement
 and the denial of voting rights for foreign workers. The KTUF says that this re-
 quirement is not enforced and foreigners may join unions regardless of their length
 of stay. The KTUF administers an Expatriate Labor Office, which is authorized to
 investigate complaints of foreign laborers and provide them with free legal advice.
 However, these services are not widely utilized. Any foreign worker may submit a
 grievance to the Labor Office regardless of union status.
 The law limits the right to strike. It requires that all labor disputes must be re-
 ferred to compulsory arbitration if labor and management cannot reach a solution
 (see Section 6.b.). The law does not have any provision ensuring strikers' freedom
 from any legal or administrative action taken against them by the State. In May
 a group of 180 Indian nursing assistants left their housing camp and moved into
 the Indian embassy, protesting the fact that they had not received the wages they
 were promised by their recruiting agents in India and Kuwait. By the end of Sep-
 tember, most of the nursing assistants had agreed to return to their jobs at the
 original salary; the remaining nursing assistants returned to India.
 In June pilots and air and ground engineers from the national carrier, Kuwait
 Airways, staged a strike to protest a cut in free ticket entitlements and inaction on
 increases to some of their allowances.
 Ninety-two employees of the Kuwaiti National Petroleum Company walked off the
 job for 4 days in late September to protest the imposition of certain promotion and
 hiring precepts. After the Government intervened, the workers agreed to suspend
 the strike and enter into talks with management.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. The KTUF belongs to the Inter-
 national Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 Iganize and bargain collectively, subject to certain restrictions (see Section 6.a.).
 ese rights have been incorporated in the Labor Law and have, according to all
 reports, been respected in practice.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers
 or their representatives" in the private sector. Most agreements are resolved in such
 negotiations; if not, either party may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Labor for mediation. If mediation fails, the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration
 board composed of officials from the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employer. Technically, wages and conditions of employ-
 ment for civil service workers are established by the Government, but in practice,
 the Government sets the benefit scales after conducting informal meetings with offli-
 
 
 1512
 
 cials from the civil service unions. Union officials resolve most issues at the working
 level and have regular access to other senior officials.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against employees, based on their affiliation with a union.
 Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor 'except in cases specified by law  or national emergency and with just remu-
 neration.' The Government does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by
 children, but such practices are not known to occur.
 Foreign workers may not change their employment without permission from their
 original sponsors unless they have been in the country for over 2 years. Domestic
 servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses from this practice because they are
 not protected by the Labor Law. In many cases employers exercise control over their
 servants by holding their passports, although the Government prohibits this prac-
 tice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in disputes.
 Some foreign workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled south Asian workers,
 live much like indentured servants. They frequently face poor working conditions
 and some physical abuse (see Section 6.e.).
 Domestic servants who run away from their employers may be treated as crimi-
 nals under the law. However, the authorities usually do not enforce this provision.
 In some reported cases, employers illegally withheld wages from domestic servants
 to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. The Government has done
 little, if anything, to protect domestics in such cases.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age is 18 years for all forms of work, both full- and part-time. Employers
 must obtain permits from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor to employ juve-
 niles between the ages of 14 and 18 in certain trades. Education is compulsory for
 children between the ages of 6 and 15. The Government does not prohibit forced and
 bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur (see Section
 6.c.). Some small businessmen employ their children on a part-time basis, and there
 have been confirmed reports that some south Asian and southeast Asian domestic
 servants are under 18, but falsified their ages in order to enter the country.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours a day on the condition that they work
 no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a 1-hour rest period.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. An informal two-tiered labor market ensures
 high wages for Kuwaiti employees, while foreign workers, particularly unskilled la-
 borers, receive substantially lower wages. There is no legal minimum wage in the
 rivate sector. In the public sector, the effective minimum wage is approximately
 774 (226 dinars) per month for citizens and approximately $301 (90 dinars) per
 month for non-citizens. The public sector minimum wage provides a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. Wages of unskilled workers in the private sector
 do not always permit a decent standard of living. To be eligible to sponsor family
 members for residency in Kuwait, government workers must receive a minimum
 wage of $1,530 (450 dinars) per month, and private sector workers must make at
 least $2,210 (650 dinars) per month.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. The Labor Law limits the
 standard workweek to 48 hours with 1 fu lday of rest per week, provides for a mini-
 mum of 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule
 for industrial accidents. Domestic servants, who are specifically excluded from the
 Private Sector Labor Law, frequently work long hours, greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged the Government to provide the weekly 24-consecutive-hour
 rest period to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and
 workers in enterprises employing fewer than 5 persons. The law pertaining to the
 oil industry provides for a 40-hour workweek, 30 days of annual leave, and sick
 leave. Laws establishing work conditions are not always applied uniformly to foreign
 workers. Labor law also provides for employer-provided medical care and compensa-
 tion to workers disabled by injury or disease due to job-related causes. The law also
 requires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers exposed
 to environmental hazards on the job, e.g., chemicals, asbestos, etc. The Government
 has issued occupational health and safety standards; however, compliance and en-
 forcement appear poor, especially with respect to unskilled foreign laborers. Employ-
 ers often exploit workers' willingness to accept substandard conditions. Some foreign
 
 
 1513
 workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled south Asian workers, live much like in-
 dentured servants, are unaware of their legal rights and generally lack the means
 to pursue a legal remedy. They frequently face contractual disputes, poor working
 conditions, and some physical abuse. Most are in debt to their employers before they
 arrive in the country and have little choice but to accept the employer's conditions,
 even if they contradict the contractual terms; it is not uncommon for wages to be
 withheld for a period of months. Most, if not all, of the foreign workers are forced
 to live in "housing camps,. which are generally overcrowded and lack adequate cook-
 ing and bathroom facilities; they are only allowed off the camp compound on com-
 pan transport or by permission of the employer.
 orkers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protection exists for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. According to the most recent fig-
 ures available, the Government had registered about 800 cases involving occupa-
 tional injuries during the year. To cut accident rates, the Government periodically
 inspects installations to raise awareness among workers and employers and ensure
 that they abide by the safety rules, control the pollution resulting from certain dan-
 gerous industries, train workers who use new machines in specialized institutes,
 and report violations.
