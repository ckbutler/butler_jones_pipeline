 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh underwent a transition from a Martial Law
 Administration (MLA) to civilian rule in 1986. The Chief
 Martial Law Administrator and President, H.M. Ershad, had
 taken power in a bloodless coup in March 1982 and had ruled
 under martial law from that time. Under Ershad's guidance, a
 series of steps was taken leading up to the return of civilian
 rule; these included Bangladesh's first parliamentary elections
 in 7 years in May 1986, the surrender by military courts of
 their civil jurisdiction, the return of regional martial law
 administrators to the barracks, the lifting of most
 restrictions on political activity, and, in October, the
 election of Ershad to a 5-year term as civilian President.
 Earlier, Ershad had given up his post as Chief of Army Staff
 and retired from the army. On November 10 Ershad officially
 lifted martial law.
 During the last year of martial law, the Martial Law
 Administration (MLA) continued to be restrained in its
 application of theoretically unchecked powers. The regime
 became less heavy-handed as the leadership became less
 preoccupied with its initial objective of eradicating
 corruption and more concerned with the normal chores of
 governing, such as encouraging economic development,
 implementing administrative decentralization and reform, and
 attracting civilian political support.
 The trend toward political liberalization, interrupted in
 March 1985 with the banning of political and trade union
 activity, was resumed in October 1985 with the relaxation of
 the ban and its elimination on January 1, 1986. In May 1986,
 several opposition parties campaigned actively in the
 parliamentary elections. The campaign was marred by the deaths
 of at least 20 people nationwide. However, although opposition
 parties and independents won 122 of the 300 directly elected
 seats, the major opposition parties charged gross
 irregularities in the conduct of the elections and of
 subsequent by-elections in August, in which the government
 party swept all 8 seats. In October the major opposition
 parties chose not to participate in the presidential poll,
 which was won by incumbent President Ershad, who overwhelmed a
 field of 11 independents.
 Bangladesh remains one of the poorest and most densely
 populated countries in the world. An estimated 70 percent of
 Bangladeshis subsist below an absolute poverty level, and the
 population is increasing by 2.6 percent a year. Agriculture
 accounts for half of the gross domestic product and about
 74 percent of employment. The Government's avowed priority
 has been economic development. Its key programs have been
 aimed at increased agricultural yields, reduced population
 growth, decentralization of administration, and development of
 the private sector. Although an important Government goal in
 implementing its policies has been the eradication of
 corruption and inefficiency, reports persist of widespread
 corruption at all levels of the Government.
 In 1986 there continued to be instances of press restrictions
 as well as cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. Reports of
 violence against ethnic communities in the more remote areas of
 the country increased during the year.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A small, simmering insurgent movement bred of social disruption
 and economic decline continued in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,
 where some 600,000 tribal people live. Sporadic clashes
 reportedly took place between government forces and small
 groups of armed tribal insurgents, the Shanti Bahini (Peace
 Force). Although some observers allege that the frequency of
 confrontations and the number of deaths are increasing, no
 reliable statistics are available. The Shanti Bahini launched
 an offensive in May, killing armed forces personnel and
 civilian settlers in a series of apparently coordinated
 attacks. In retaliation, the military, accompanied by
 settlers, attacked tribal villages. An Amnesty International
 report of September 1986 provided first-hand accounts of the
 violence and death which occurred during May and accused the
 Government of sanctioning unlawful killings. Despite an
 amnesty for all insurgents proclaimed in October 1983 and
 again in May 1986 for a brief period, the area was off-limits
 to foreigners, and contact between tribal people and foreigners
 was actively discouraged by the Government. The tribal leaders
 continued to demand the preservation of their autonomous
 culture and an end to Bengali settlement in the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts.
 In the country at large, killing for directly political motives
 remains uncommon, although violence between factions, gangs,
 and economic adversaries sometimes assumes political
 coloration.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were reports of torture of some political prisoners, as
 well as criminal suspects. A June 1986 Amnesty International
 (AI) report on torture in Bangladesh cited allegations that
 the Directorate General for (Armed) Forces Intelligence
 tortured some political prisoners held for short periods of
 interrogation. Many of the prisoners who were reportedly
 tortured were student activists. AI asked the Government to
 undertake impartial and independent investigations into
 allegations of torture and to file criminal proceedings against
 law enforcement personnel when justified. According to AI, no
 such investigations were made. Articles of the 1972 Bangladesh
 Constitution specifically prohibiting torture were in suspense
 from 1982 when martial law was declared until the recent
 lifting of martial law.
 Although police treatment of accused criminals is often rough
 and can include abusive interrogations and beatings, reports
 of fatalities from such mistreatment are rare. According to
 one report, however, a 17-year old student died in a hospital,
 where he had been transferred from police custody, from a
 brain hemorrhage caused by a blow to the back of his head.
 There were also reports that landless workers and activists
 
 
 1116
 BANGLADESH
 promoting landless workers' rights have been ill-treated or
 tortured while in police custody. Punishment of police and
 jail officials involved in mistreating prisoners sometimes
 takes place in cases where the victim or his friends and
 family can attract publicity, but mistreatment of ordinary
 citizens often goes unpunished.
 The year saw an increase in reports of torture of tribal
 villagers by security personnel. Allegations ranged from
 harassment and extortion to rape and murder. These reports
 came from human rights groups which believe that the Government
 should protect the rights of tribal people, particularly
 property rights, against settlers from other parts of the
 country.
 Conditions in Bangladesh's overcrowded jails reflect the
 country's extremely poor living conditions. Amnesty
 International reported that cells for prisoners in the Dhaka
 cantonment had neither light nor furniture. The grill door to
 many cells was covered by a wooden board, increasing the sense
 of the prisoner's isolation. In the larger prisons, prominent
 persons and political prisoners are held in conditions which
 are markedly better than those afforded to ordinary criminals,
 as is customary in South Asia. Prospects for the
 implementation of prison reforms remain slight.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under long-time provisions of the law, reaffirmed by the
 Special Powers Act of 1974, persons can be detained without
 charge for 24 hours, held with the consent of a magistrate for
 30 days, and held with government approval for an indefinite
 time. Although these powers provide broad flexibility, the
 Act was reportedly disregarded entirely for some persons held
 in the custody of military personnel during the martial law
 period. For others in custody, the Act was breached by the
 failure to comply with time limits or to produce a prisoner
 before a magistrate. Prior to the May parliamentary elections,
 the Special Powers Act was invoked against several prominent
 opposition leaders who threatened to disrupt the elections
 with demonstrations. In general, whenever participation in
 demonstrations or other political activity prompted the MLA
 summarily to detain individuals, the authorities sought to
 notify families expeditiously of the detained and arrested
 persons' whereabouts. Such demonstrators and activists were
 seldom held for long periods. Observers estimated that fewer
 than 100 people were detained for other than common law
 offenses.
 In what could have been a significant development, the
 Government began honoring writs of habeas corpus, even before
 martial law was lifted. However, some prisoners released as a
 result reportedly were arrested again within 24 hours.
 Bangladeshi legal and human rights organizations reported cases
 of suspects arrested on minor charges who remained in jail for
 long periods without trial.
 There was no report of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The MLA suspended martial law courts prior to the May
 parliamentary elections. Since then, civil and criminal cases
 have been heard by civilian courts in public trials in which
 the right to counsel is respected. Civil courts are
 
 
 1117
 BANGLADESH
 overburdened and available only to those who can afford
 representation but are generally considered fair. Processing
 cases can be both time-consuming and expensive, working a
 hardship on the vast majority of litigants and discouraging
 many from seeking redress through the courts. There are few
 legal aid programs to assist indigents.
 To accomplish the goal of speedy justice and relieve court
 dockets of a reported backlog of some 60,000 cases, the MLA
 had required that cases be concluded within 6 months. The
 result was that new cases came to trial and were decided in a
 timely fashion, while older cases were postponed.
 The MLA dispersed magistrate courts to the newly established
 Upazilla (subdistrict) level of government and decentralized
 the administration of high court appellate benches. Many
 considered court decentralization an important step in
 bringing judicial relief to the majority of the population
 living outside the capital city.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh authorities do not normally engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home, although MLA officials are known to have
 entered the homes of opposition leaders, detained individuals,
 and searched their premises without warrants. The law requires
 a judicial warrant before authorities enter a home, and courts
 require evidence supporting a reasonable basis of suspicion
 before issuing a warrant. Wiretaps are believed to be used
 selectively, as is the monitoring of private correspondence.
 The Government maintains civilian and military intelligence
 services which concern themselves, in part, with domestic
 events. Although not pervasive, the influence and capability
 of these services is thought to be growing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities. In 1986 Bangladesh television and radio focused
 heavily on the activities of government leaders and virtually
 neglected the opposition. In the print media, the Government
 controls one of Dhaka's four English-language daily newspapers,
 a Bengali-language daily in Dhaka, and a Bengali-language
 weekly through a national press trust. The Government owns
 the major Bangladesh News Agency (BSS) as well as a daily
 newspaper in Rajshahi. Three of the Dhaka English dailies and
 most of the many Bengali-language periodicals and newspapers,
 however, are privately owned; some are supported by political
 parties and reflect various political views. Major newspapers
 report on both the Government and opposition, although coverage
 of opposition political activities is usually somewhat less
 extensive than that of official activities. The Bangladesh
 news media, including the BSS, did not repeat any open or
 implied criticism of either the President or the armed forces.
 Explicit criticism of any foreign country (unless made by the
 Government) or criticism of any authoritarian order was also
 avoided. The Government denied the application of a biweekly
 to publish more frequently, reportedly because the publisher
 refused to print progovernment stories.
 In 1986 the MLA exercised its authority to ban foreign and
 domestic publications. Three Bengali-language magazines,
 
 
 1118
 BANGLADESH
 Ekota, Amader Kotha, and Sangbadik were closed. They joined
 the popular weekly Jai Jai Din (closed in 1985, reopened and
 closed again in 1986), Ittehad (closed in 1984), and Jooi Jatra
 (also closed in 1984). None of the three closed in 1986 was
 allowed to reopen. Reprints of an article from the London
 Observer critical of President Ershad were confiscated by the
 Government. Distribution of selected editions of other papers
 was also banned.
 Five journalists, including the president of the Weekly
 Newspaper Journalists Union, were released by the MLA in June
 1986. The MLA also detained journalists for writing articles
 critical of martial law (an offense under martial law
 regulations), but eventually released all of them. No
 journalists were known to have been imprisoned in 1986.
 A ban on political activity at all universities was lifted in
 1985, and many students were vocal in their criticism of the
 MLA. Taking advantage of the relative freedom enjoyed on the
 Dhaka University campus, opposition parties attacked the
 Government through their student fronts. Students were free
 to express a wide range of political opinion through campus
 organizations and their publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 By the beginning of 1986 all martial law restrictions on
 political activities were removed, paving the way for a new
 round of elections later in the year. Subsequently, the
 Government allowed the major opposition parties to campaign
 openly or protest peacefully. A ban on antielection
 activities was imposed prior to the May 1986 parliamentary
 elections and the October presidential election. Restrictions
 were placed at times on public assemblies. These restrictions
 have since been lifted.
 A ban on trade union activity instituted in March 1985 was
 lifted on January 1, 1986. The Bangladesh labor movement held
 an open election for federation officers of the Bangladesh Free
 Trade Unions Congress (BFTUC) in March. Delegates freely
 elected the winners by secret ballot. Throughout the campaign
 for the May parliamentary elections, the Government allowed
 union activity, which included numerous local labor actions.
 A call for a general strike by a coalition of 14 trade union
 federations in support of the program of the main alliance of
 opposition political parties was called off because of a lack
 of rank-and-file support. Labor activity increased throughout
 the year, but the general strike was employed less frequently
 than in 1985.
 Workers in Bangladesh generally enjoy the right to associate
 freely, to organize, and to bargain collectively. Because of
 a low level of industrialization, labor unions represent no
 more than 5 percent of the work force. Although only a small
 portion of the work force is unionized, unions are powerful
 and important in certain key sectors such as jute, tea, and
 transportation. Unions are heavily involved in politics; of
 17 trade union federations, only 1 claims no political
 affiliation. Most unions are urban-based and serve as fronts
 for political parties. Bangladesh's progressive labor law is
 often ignored by both management and labor.
 Unions are free to draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 elect officers, and formulate programs. There are no
 restrictions on joining confederations and affiliating with
 
 
 1119
 BANGLADESH
 international organizations. Individuals need government
 clearance to travel to international labor conferences and
 attend programs sponsored by foreign labor institutions; such
 clearances are routinely granted. Under a provision of
 Bangladesh's labor law, the Government can suspend or dissolve
 individual unions. In theory, Bangladeshi workers enjoy
 participatory rights in all union business; in practice, these
 rights are often violated by both employers and union leaders.
 In theory, unions and their members are fully protected against
 antiunion discrimination; in practice, employers regularly fire
 workers for union activities and harass union activists and
 leaders.
 Antiunion discrimination is especially prevalent in the garment
 industry, where most of the workers are young women.
 Following labor agitation and violence against firms and
 personnel in the Export Processing Zone in Chittagong, the
 Government banned union activity in an effort to enhance its
 attractiveness to foreign investors. Employers, through
 connections in the Government and the military, often succeed
 in having legal actions that unions file against them forgotten
 or quashed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Predominantly Muslim, Bangladesh continues to permit conversion
 from one religion to another. Prosyletizing by Bangladeshi
 citizens is allowed under Article 41 of the Constitution,
 subject to law, public order, and morality. Proselytization
 is largely directed toward minority groups such as Hindus and
 tribal peoples. There is strong social resistance to efforts
 to convert persons from Islam. Certain Islamic organizations
 continue to voice concern over Christian missionary activities
 and the conversion of Muslims to Christianity. Some Christian
 missionaries face delays in renewing their visas and are
 concerned that the Government might make it difficult for them
 to stay in the country.
 The Government has continued to pledge equality of treatment
 and freedom of worship to Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian
 minorities, who constitute approximately 13 percent of the
 population. Although this policy is substantially respected,
 the numerical predominance of Muslims and South Asia's history
 of communal violence and discrimination contribute to minority
 concern.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladesh citizens are free to move within the country, except
 within designated "red areas" in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
 There are also areas near the borders from which all
 nonresidents are banned. Bangladeshis are generally free to
 visit and emigrate abroad, subject to foreign exchange
 controls. In some instances, persons deemed to be security
 risks are not allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants must
 obtain "no-objection certificates" from the ministry in which
 they are employed before traveling abroad, and citizens going
 overseas to work must register with the ministry responsible
 for manpower export. The right of repatriation is observed.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslim Biharis, or "stranded
 Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending resettlement in
 Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these non-Bengalis opted
 
 
 1120
 BANGLADESH
 for Pakistani citizenship. Pakistan agreed to take them back
 provided financing for resettlement costs was made available
 from outside sources. A Saudi-based Islamic social
 organization continues its efforts to raise money for these
 resettlement costs. Camp dwellers may seek employment and
 conduct other activities but face disadvantages as noncitizens.
 Some Biharis have lost property as a result of laws
 confiscating Pakistani holdings, but those Biharis who chose
 to become Bangladeshi citizens in 1971 are entitled to full
 rights of citizenship. Biharis may still apply for Bangladeshi
 citizenship at any time.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 reported that seven Iranians and one Afghan were arrested in
 Bangladesh with false entry papers. Considered security risks
 by the Government, the refugees were imprisoned for 6 months
 until released on bail by the UNHCR. The Iranians, several of
 whom were accepted for resettlement, faced legal charges. The
 Afghan remained in prison and was not allowed to receive
 visitors.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Bangladesh held its first parliamentary elections in 7 years on
 May 7, 1986. An alliance of opposition parties contested the
 elections against candidates associated with the party formed
 by the President. A second alliance of opposition parties
 chose to boycott the polls, claiming they could not be free
 and fair unless martial law were lifted and other conditions
 met. The progovernment party won 178 out of the 300 directly
 elected seats, and opposition parties and independents won 122.
 Despite this record showing by the opposition, opposition
 party leaders cited incidents of fraud and intimidation.
 Opposition winners were sworn in as members of Parliament in
 July but declined to take their seats in protest against the
 continuation of martial law and the conduct of the May
 elections. By-elections were held in August for eight
 parliamentary seats; candidates from the same major opposition
 alliance which participated in the May elections again took
 part. The progovernment party swept all eight seats, in most
 cases winning by lopsided margins. No major opposition party
 participated in the October presidential poll. With the
 lifting of martial law, the opposition parties have announced
 their intention to take the seats to which they were elected.
 President Ershad played a major part in the moves to restore
 constitutional government under his own civilian leadership.
 In August he gave up his post as Chief of Army Staff and
 retired from the army. He then joined the progovernment party
 and became its chairman in preparation for his candidacy in
 the October 15 presidential election. Contesting as a
 civilian, Ershad received approximately 85 percent of the
 vote. Opposition political figures and members of the foreign
 press corps contended that the 55 percent turnout claimed by
 the Government was greatly inflated and that the Government
 had used fraudulent means on a wide scale. On November 10,
 President Ershad signed a proclamation withdrawing martial
 law. Earlier that day, Parliament passed a constitutional
 amendment ratifying as law acts promulgated by the MLA and
 giving immunity from prosecution to the martial law
 authorities.
 Since independence in 1972, members of Bangladesh's elite have
 periodically endeavored to establish a democratic form of
 
 
 1121
 BANGLADESH
 government by framing a constitution and experimenting with
 parliamentary and presidential systems. Nonetheless,
 Bangladesh has spent 9 of its 15 years since it gained its
 independence from Pakistan under martial law, which has
 contributed to the fragility of its institutions. This in
 turn has fostered a belief among the military that it is the
 only national institution able to bear responsibility for
 national affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several international nongovernmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, the
 International League for Human Rights, the Law Association for
 Asia and the Western Pacific (LAWAASPA), and the International
 Commission of Jurists continue to be represented in Bangladesh.
 The Government has not obstructed independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in
 rural areas, early marriage, high child-bearing rates, and
 long hours of household labor leave little opportunity for
 nonfamily interests or outside employment. Even in urban
 areas and among the affluent, the traditional social system
 makes women economically dependent on their husbands or other
 male relatives.
 By custom and by Islamic tradition, women occupy a subordinate
 place and receive unequal treatment before the law on a
 widespread basis. The ability of a family to seclude its
 women is a symbol of middle or high social status. Women are
 virtually absent from the cash work force, except in the
 export-oriented garment industry. Their wages lag behind
 those of men, even for the same work.
 The daily press testifies to a pattern of domestic violence
 (murder, rape, torture), breach of matrimonial contract,
 denial of inheritance rights, and desertion which victimizes
 women and which is particularly acute among the poor. The
 rate of suicide among women is reportedly almost three times
 higher than among men. The Government promulgated a stringent
 ordinance in 1983 to deter such cruelties to women as murder,
 kidnaping, abduction, and trafficking in women. The number of
 reported cases of acid-throwing against women, a crime which
 leaves its victims dead or badly scarred, declined during the
 past year. The penalty for acid-throwing is death. The death
 penalty is also imposed against those directly responsible for
 "dowry killing" or for killing a woman in the course of a
 rape. "Dowry killings" usually share a common theme: the
 bride's family has not made full payment of a supposedly
 promised dowry, so the husband or his family attacks and
 sometimes murders the bride. There is generally little
 recourse for abused women, especially for crimes within the
 family or home.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, although not in law, in their access to government
 
 
 1122
 BANGLADESH
 positions and political office. Members of some minorities,
 principally Hindus, have lost or have had serious difficulty
 retaining their properties as a result of prejudicial
 administration of vested property laws which provide that
 property belonging to persons who left Bangladesh between 1965
 and 1971 should be managed by the Government. The Government
 is authorized to use and sell this property, which it has
 sometimes done to the disadvantage of the former owner.
 Reports also persist that the property rights of tribal
 peoples are being violated. Tribal land, for which there is
 frequently no deed, is said to have been parceled out by
 Bangladesh authorities to Bengali Muslim settlers. Over the
 past decade, successive governments settled close to 300,000
 ethnic Bengalis in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Tribal people
 also face the loss of land through failure to meet mortgage
 payments, false deeds, and physical attacks. In areas where
 the tribal insurgency is active, the army can take land
 without compensation. Dhaka-based legal aid organizations
 have been offering representation to a limited number of
 tribal people illegally removed from their lands.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Bangladesh's labor law stipulates minimum ages for various
 types of employment; in industries where unions are strong
 these minimums are enforced, but the poverty of the country is
 such that children are regularly engaged in any line of work
 they can get, especially fieldwork. In general, regulations
 regarding minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety
 and health are not strictly enforced.
 Child labor increased in 1986. As estimated by the Bangladesh
 Bureau of Statistics, the number of child laborers was 3
 million, compared to 2.5 million in 1981. Of the manual
 laborers in the markets of Dhaka, 70 percent of those surveyed
 were between the ages of 7 and 15. Children pedaled cycle-
 rickshaws, worked as helpers in transport services, carried
 loads at railway stations and river terminals, and worked at
 construction sites.
