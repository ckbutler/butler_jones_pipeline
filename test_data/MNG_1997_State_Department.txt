 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia made further progress in its transition from a highly centralized Com-
 munist-led state to a full-fledged multi party, parliamentary democracy although
 these gains still must be solidied, and the process continues to evolve. he Prime
 Minister is nominated by the President and a pproved by the State Great Hural, the
 national legislature. Mongolia's progress in the development of democratic institu-
 tions was demonstrated by the unexpected June 1996 election defeat of the Mongo-
 lian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which had been in power since 1921. The
 MPRP accepted its defeat and has entered into its role in opposition. There are 12
 political parties, 4 or which hold seats in the Hural.
 Security forces are under civilian control; the Minister of Defense is the first civil-
 ian to hold this post. The national police have primary responsibility for internal
 security. The military forces are responsible for external security, including border
 security. Reduced government spending continued to force downsizing of the mili-
 tary forces. The State Security Agency (SSA), formerly the Mongolian Central Intel-
 ligence Agency (MCIA) is responsible for internal security; its head has ministerial
 status and reports directly to the Prime Minister, a Hural committee oversees the
 military forces, the police, and the SSA. Some members of the security forces com-
 mitted occasional human rights abuses.
 Despite reforms in the 1990's, most large economic entities remain under state
 control; the Government plans to privatize 60 percent of these entities by 2000. The
 economy continued to expand and strengthen, despite inflation of 23 percent. Mon-
 golia remains a very poor country, with per capita income at approximately $340
 per year. It relies heavily on foreign economic assistance. The mainstays of the econ-
 omy continue to be copper production and other mining, livestock raising, which is
 done by a majority of the rural population, and related food-, wool-, and hide-proc-
 essing industries, which meet both local needs and produce goods for export. A
 growing trade and small entrepreneurial sector in the cities provides basic consumer
 goods. Minerals, especially copper, comprise the bulk of export earnings. An unreli-
 able energy system, a lack of transportation and other infrastructure, and a small
 domestic market discourage foreign investment.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Problems
 remain, however, including occasional beatings of detainees and prisoners by mem-
 bers of the security forces, poor prison conditions, restrictions on due process for de-
 tainees, occasional government manipulation of the media, and violence against
 women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Several dozen prisoners died in custody during the year, at least partially due to
 inadequate management and oversight by the authorities (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids such practices, there were credible reports that
 police and prison officials sometimes beat or otherwise physically abused prisoners
 and detainees. Prison facilities are poor-including insufficient food and heat-and
 threaten the health of detainees. With the continuing rise in crime and subsequent
 increase in the prison and pretrial detainee population, severe crowding in both
 prisons and detention facilities is common, aggravating management and resource
 problems.
 The deaths of several dozen prisoners from undetermined health-related causes
 appears at least partially attributable to negligence and inadequate oversight. How-
 ever, there is no evidence of a pattern of deliberate abuse or of a policy of withhold-
 ing food or other necessities as punishment.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 shall be searched, arrested, detained, or deprived of liberty except by law, but these
 protections have not been fully codified. Under the Criminal Procedures Code, police
 may arrest those caught committing a crime and hold them for up to 72 hours be-
 fore the decision is taken to prosecute or release. A warrant must be issued by a
 prosecutor for incarceration of longer duration or when the actual crime was not
 witnessed. A detainee has the right to a defense attorney during this period and
 during any subsequent stage of the legal process. If a defendant cannot afford a pri-
 vate attorney, the State will appoint an attorney.
 
 
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The courts are independent, and there is no evidence that they discriminate
 against any group, or that decisions are made for political reasons.
 The court system consists of local courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court. The 9-member Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system, hearing
 appeals from lower courts and cases involving alleged misconduct by high-level offi-
 cials. Local courts hear mostly routine criminal and civil cases; provincial courts
 hear more serious cases such as rape, murder, and grand larceny and also serve as
 the appeals court for lower court decisions. A Constitutional Court, separate from
 the criminal court system, has sole jurisdiction over constitutional questions. The
 General Council of Courts, an independent administrative body, nominates can-
 didates for vacancies on both the supreme and lower courts; the President has the
 power to ratify or refuse to approve such nominations. The Council also is charged
 with ensuring the rights of judges and providing for the independence of the judici-
 ary.
 All accused persons are provided due process, legal defense, and a public trial, al-
 though closed proceedings are permittedin cases involving state secrets, rape cases
 involving minors, and other cases provided by law. Defendants may question wit-
 nesses and appeal decisions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the private beliefs and
 actions of citizens, and the Government generally respects this in practice. The head
 of the SSA may, with the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct the
 monitoring and recording of telephone conversations. The extent of such monitoring
 is unknown. The MPRP accused the then-Mongolian Central Intelligence Agency of
 spying on some of its members in November 1996. An investigation by the Hural
 found the accusations to be true, and the head of the MCIA was fired. The MCIA
 was reorganized and renamed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the rights of free-
 dom of speech, press, and expression. The Government generally respects these
 rights in practice. An increasing variety of newspapers and other publications rep-
 resent major political party viewpoints as well as independent views. However, both
 state-controlled and independent media have been occasionally manipulated by the
 State in order to put forward government policy. State-controlled media remain the
 largest organizations by far. Independent media sometimes complain of unequal ac-
 cess to government information and officials. One example of official manipulation
 was a dispute between a private Western-Mongolian joint venture and the govern-
 ment body responsible for oversight of such joint ventures. Editors of independent
 media reported being threatened with charges of violating state secrets for having
 reported on government electronic surveillance prior to the 1996 local elections. One
 independent newspaper reported that its office telephones were monitored by gov-
 ernment security forces.
 Although in the past the Government controlled access to newsprint, all news-
 papers now buy newsprint directly from private suppliers, and neither party-affili-
 ated nor independent news media report difficulty securing an adequate supply. Due
 to transportation difficulties, uneven postal service, and fluctuations in the amount
 of newsprint available, access to a full range- of publications is restricted in outlying
 re    lelaws are very generous to plaintiffs as well as a hurdle for small media. One
 negative judgment can lead to bankruptcy, while the larger, state-owned media can
 more readily sustain such adverse financial judgments.
 There is a government-financed television station with countrywide reception ca-
 pability, a limited-operation international joint venture private television channel,
 a new private television station, and several radio stations in Ulaanbaatar. State-
 owned radio is particularly important as the major source of news in the country-
 side. Both official and private media present opposition and government news. Resi-
 dents of Ulaanbaatar also have access to television. Citizens receive broadcasts from
 China, Russia, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the United States,
 and other countries by commercial satellite and cable television systems. An esti-
 mated 20 percent of households have television.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 
 
 858
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right both to worship
 and not to worship and explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state. The
 Government generally respects these provisions in practice. Although Mongolia has
 no official state religion, the Government has contributed to the restoration of sev-
 eral Buddhist sites. There are important religious, historical, and cultural centers.
 It does not subsidize the Buddhist religion in other ways.
 Although under the provisions of a 1993 law on relations between church and
 state, the Government may supervise and limit the numbers of both places of wor-
 ship and clergy for organized religions; there are no reports that it has done so. Reli-
 gious gups, however, must regster with the Ministry of Justice. Proselytizing is
 allowed, although a Ministry of Education directive bans the mixing of foreign lan-
 gage or other training with religious teaching or instruction. Contacts with coreli-
 gionists outside the country are allowed.
 The Government closed some Buddhist, Christian, and Bahai places of worship for
 failing to register properly, and it prevented one foreign religious organization from
 importing Mongoha    langage Christian videotapes and boks for children. It re-
 portedy did so because the organization tried to claim s aus as a nongovernmental
 organization (NGO), rather than as a religious organization.
 d.Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 as well as the right to travel and return without restriction, and the Government
 generally respects these rights in practice. By regulation some categories of foreign-
 ers who wish to travel for more than 1 week must notify police authorities of their
 projected destination.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees in the small number of cases
 reported in which such status has been claimed. There were no reports of forced ex-
 pulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections by secret ballot and universal suffrage. Presidential,
 parliamentary, and local elections are held separately. In the May presidential elec-
 tions, MPRP candidate Natsagiin Bagabandi defeated the incumbent President
 Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat and a third candidate in elections that were free and fair
 marking the third consecutive election-including 1996 parliamentary and local
 elections-in which the governing party was defeated.
 There are 12 registered political parties; 4 are represented in the Hural.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women or minorities in
 government and politics. Women are not represented in the highest levels of the
 Government and in the highest echelons of the judiciary. Only 7 of 76 Hural mem-
 bers are women. Although there are significant numbers of women in various mid-
 level ministry positions, there are no women in the Cabinet or the Supreme or Con-
 stitutional Courts. The low number of women at the highest levels of government
 has several causes, including tradition and some degree of discrimination by the vir-
 tually all-male leadership structure.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that ... no person shall be discriminated against on the
 basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status," and that
 "... men and women shall be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields,
 and family." The Government generally enforces these provisions in practice.
 Women.-There is increasing public and media discussion of domestic violence, in-
 cluding spousal and child abuse, after many years of government and societal de-
 nial. Although there are no reliable or exact statistics regarding the extent of such
 abuse, human rights groups, women's groups, resident diplomats, and other observ-
 ers believe that it is a common phenomenon. The large economic and societal
 changes underway have created new stresses on families, including loss of jobs, in-
 flation, and lowered spending on social and educational programs. These factors,
 coupled with the serious problems caused by extremely high rates of alcohol abuse
 have led to increased instances of family abuse and a andonment, and have added
 
 
 to the number of single-parent families, most of which are headed by women. Al-
 though women's groups advocate new statutes to cope with domestic violence, there
 is no known police or government intervention in cases involving violence against
 women beyond prosecution under existing assault laws after formal charges have
 been filed. Rape is illegal, and offenders can be prosecuted and convicted, but there
 is no law specifically prohibiting spousal rape.
 The Constitution provides men and women with equal rights in all areas and,
 both by law and practice, women receive equal pay for eua work and have equal
 access to education. Women represent about haf the workforce, and a significant
 number are the primary earners for their families. Although many women occupy
 midlevel positions in government and the professions, and many are involved in the
 creation and management of new trading and manufacturing businesses, women are
 almost completely absent from the highest leadership levels of both the public and
 private sectors. There is no government agency that oversees women's rights, nor
 are there any notable efforts by the Government to encourage greater representa-
 tion by women in government policymaking.
 A small number of women's rights groups concern themselves with such issues as
 maternal and children's health and domestic violence. The law prohibits women
 from working in certain occupations that require heavy labor or exposure to chemi-
 cals that could affect infant and maternal health. The Government enforces these
 provisions.
 Children.-Increased stress on the family structure and throughout society has
 had adverse effects on many children, and the Government has been unable to keep
 pace with all of the educational, health, and social needs of the most rapidly grow-
 ing segment of its population. The Government provides children of both sexes with
 free public education through the age of 16, although family economic needs and
 state budgetary difficulties make it difficult for some children to attend school. Edu-
 cation is compulsory until the age of 16. In addition there continues to be a severe
 shortage of teaching materials at all educational levels.
 There are growing numbers of infants and small children orphaned by maternal
 deaths and desertion, and in Ulaanbaatar and major urban centers there are grow-
 ing populations of street children. There are an estimated 3,000 street children. The
 Government is committed in principle to children's rights and welfare but it pro-
 vides only minimal support for the few shelters and orphanages that do exist, and
 those facilities must turn to private sources to sustain their activities.
 Mongolia has a long tradition of support for, and often communal raising of chil-
 dren, and this tradition enjoys public support. The Government has been reluctant
 to admit the extent of the problem of orphaned children and slow to take steps to
 improve the welfare of children who have become the victims of larger societal and
 familial changes.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment and education, and the Government provides benefits to the disabled
 according to the nature and severity of disability. Those who have been injured in
 industrial accidents have the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work.
 The Government also provides tax benefits to enterprises which hire the disabled,
 and some firms hire the disabled exclusively. There is no legislation mandating ac-
 cess for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution entitles all workers to form or join
 union and professional organizations of their choosing. Union officials estimate that
 union membership totals over 400,000 persons, somewhat less than half the
 workforce. Union membership is decreasing as the economy shifts from large state
 enterprises and as increasing numbers of workers either become self-employed or
 work at small, nonunionized firms. No arbitrary restrictions exist on who may be
 a union official; officers are elected by secret ballot.
 Union members have the right to strike. Those employed in essential services,
 which the Government defines as occupations critical for national defense and safe-
 ty, including police, utility, and transportation workers, do not have the right to
 strike.
 Most union members are affiliated with the Mongolian Trade Unions Confed-
 eration, but some are affiliated with the newer Association of Free Trades Unions.
 Both organizations have ties with international labor organizations and confed-
 erations in other countries.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In theory, wage levels and
 other employment issues are decided in tripartite contract negotiations between em-
 ployer, union, and government representatives. The Government's role is limited to
 ensuring that the contract meets legal requirements as to hours and conditions of
 
 
 work. In practice wages and other conditions of employment are set mainly by the
 employer, whether that employer is a private firm or the Government.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law specifically prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor, including forced labor by children. The Government en-
 forces this law. However, most members of the military forces are required to help
 with the fall harvest.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law prohibits children under the age of 16 from
 working, although those 14 and 15 years of age may do so with parental consent.
 Those under 18 years of age may not work at night, engage in arduous work, or
 work in danerous occupations such as mining and construction. Enforcement of
 these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regulations, is the responsibility of
 state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These ins pectors have
 the authority to compel immediate compliance with labor legislation, but enforce
 ment is limited due to the small number of labor inspectors and the growing num-
 ber of independent enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly legal minimum wage is approxi-
 mately $12 (9600 tugriks) per month. This level applies to both public and private
 sector workers and is enforced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. This is the
 lowest wage for manual labor, such as janitorial work; virtually all civil servants
 earn more than this amount, and many in private businesses earn considerably
 more. The minimum wage alone is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family.
 The law sets the standard legal workweek at 46 hours and establishes a minimum
 rest period of 42 hours between workweeks. For those under 18 years of age, the
 workweek is 36 hours, and overtime work is not allowed. Overtime work is com-
 pensated at either double the standard hourly rate or by giving time off equal to
 the number of hours of overtime worked. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are
 prohibited by law from working overtime.
 Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health and safety
 standards, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare provides enforcement. According
 to labor law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work sit-
 uations and still retain their jobs. Mongolia's near-total reliance on outmoded ma-
 chinery and problems with maintenance and management lead to frequent indus-
 trial accidents, particularly in the mining, power, and construction sectors. Effective
 enforcement of existing occupational hea1th and safety standards is difficult because
 the Government has less than 40 full-time inspectors to cover all firms, including
 a growing number of small enterprises. Some of the major industrial sectors, how-
 ever, have part-time inspectors.
