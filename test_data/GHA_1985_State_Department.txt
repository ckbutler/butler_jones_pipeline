 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 (PNDC) under the Chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry
 Rawlings, who seized power from the previous elected
 Government on December 31, 1981. Under the Establishment
 Proclamation issued January 11, 1982, the Council exercises
 ,all powers of government." In practice, government policy is
 developed by Chairman Rawlings assisted by a number of close
 advisers, both inside and outside government. The Council was
 recently expanded to 10 members and now includes, aside from
 the chairman (the lone survivor of the 7 original members), 2
 recently added military officers and 7 civilians (including 2
 women and 1 ex-military). A Cabinet composed of the
 secretaries (ministers) of various departments conducts the
 day-to-day activity of the Government. A network of
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR) is designed
 as a channel to transmit government policies to the citizen
 and citizen concerns to the Government.
 Despite a period of violence and confrontation in 1982, the
 Government has been generally successful in its efforts to
 defend itself against violent overthrow without adopting
 draconian controls over the population. Nevertheless,
 outspoken criticism of the Government has occasionally
 resulted in detention of the critic, creating an atmosphere
 conducive to self-censorship. Most coup attempts have come
 primarily from members and former members of the armed
 forces. At least two dissident incidents were reported in
 1984.
 In 1983, the Government adopted an exceptionally austere
 economic recovery program in an effort to redress a quarter
 century of economic mismanagement and political instability,
 which caused Ghana to decline from one of Africa's most
 promising states to a condition of economic collapse and
 poverty. Remedial measures have included a more than 1,000
 percent devaluation, severe structural readjustments, and an
 emphasis on spending for rural rather than urban projects.
 Conducted in concert with the International Monetary Fund, the
 3-year recovery program has begun to have a positive effect
 and has attracted support from foreign donors, including the
 United States and international financial institutions. The
 economic growth rate is expected to make a third consecutive
 positive showing in 1985. Pre-1983 triple digit inflation has
 been reduced to under 20 percent.
 On the whole, some positive trends in human rights, which were
 first identified in the second half of 1983, continued during
 1985. However, there are no elections to national governing
 bodies and no legal means by which citizens can freely and
 peacefully change their laws, officials, or form of
 government. The most noticeable improvement in human rights
 has been the restoration of civil order after an initial 18
 months of revolutionary excess in 1982 and 1983. Discipline
 has been restored in the uniformed services and the police, as
 well as among military political cadres. The courts have been
 allowed to continue to operate relatively free of executive
 interference. The principal impediment to the free exercise
 of human rights remains the absence of constitutionally
 sanctioned protection of those rights. The potential for
 arbitrary deprivation of liberty is demonstrated by continuing
 instances of incarceration without formal charges. A system
 of public tribunals, which parallels the regular courts,
 
 
 129
 GHANA
 failed to enforce procedural safeguards adequate enough to
 constitute acceptable du4 process. Although the Government is
 studying means of restoring a democratic system, there is
 still no guarantee of elections nor are there any current
 plans to provide for a relaxation of government control of the
 main national newspapers and broadcast news.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killing was reported in which there was evidence of
 political motivation or governmental instigation.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearance traceable to government action or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces was reported in 1985, for
 the second successive year.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Twice during 1985, the Government acknowledged that some
 members of the armed forces beat persons detained by them. In
 one of the cases the victim later died, apparently of injuries
 sustained while in custody. In neither case was anyone
 reported to have been disciplined. In another case, however,
 a soldier was convicted and later executed for crimes
 committed against civilians. No other allegations of torture
 or cruel treatment were reported in 1985. During the year,
 six people were executed upon conviction by tribunals of
 offenses that were essentially of an economic, "white collar",
 anticorruption nature. The Government has continued to
 improve prison conditions and alleviate crowding. Service
 organizations and family members are permitted to provide for
 prisoners, and there are regular church services.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons into
 custody, sometimes late at night, secretly, with or without a
 warrant, and hold them incommunicado for months. Some of
 those so detained are said by government officials to have
 committed crimes, although the only "offense" of which they
 are known to be "guilty" is the expression of views critical
 of or different from those of the Government. When the Ghana
 Bar Association has attempted to free some of these persons
 through writs of habeas corpus, the PNDC has either stood
 aside and permitted their release or has interposed ex post
 facto preventive custody orders barring their release and
 citing national security considerations as justification.
 Except for these persons, detentions are normally performed
 according to due process of law and subject to a functioning
 bail system. The criminal code requires that an arrested
 person be brought before a court within 48 hours. Some writs
 of habeas corpus continued to be granted in 1985, but habeas
 corpus is limited by a 1984 law which prevents any court from
 inquiring into the grounds for the detention of any Ghanaian
 detained under PNDC Law 2 (the law setting up a national
 
 
 130
 GHANA
 investigation committee, and giving that committee power to
 investigate virtually any allegation referred to it by the
 PNDC).
 Although the Government does not announce detentions or
 releases, it appears that the number of prisoners in detention
 without due process fluctuated in 1985. A March amnesty of
 202 prisoners included 2 former ministers; and on January 9,
 1986, the last former minister being detained was released on
 bail. In the latter half of 1985, at least 5, and perhaps as
 many as 20, persons were arbitrarily detained, though 7 of
 these detainees were released in late November. Among the
 detainees were at least two who had been released in 1984,
 after a previous period of detention. Including some of those
 just incarcerated, a list of uncharged detainees published in
 a weekly newspaper in August contained 17 names. However, a
 government official claimed, also in August, that there were
 no political prisoners since those in detention were guilty of
 crimes (although they had not yet been tried). Amnesty
 International has adopted as a "prisoner of conscience" a
 Ghanaian who was sentenced by a public tribunal to 16 years in
 prison for complicity in a November 1982 coup attempt.
 Ghana prohibits forced labor, except in terms of military
 draft and labor following court conviction.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional legal safeguards remain available in the
 established court system, which includes High Courts, Appeals
 Courts, and a Supreme Court headed by a Chief Justice. In
 1982, the Government also established a new set of judicial
 bodies which parallels the older court system. These organs
 include the Office of Revenue Commissioners, the National
 Investigations Committee, the Special Military Tribunal, and
 the Public Tribunals Board, as well as Public Tribunals, which
 exist at the national and regional levels and are planned for
 districts and communities. In 1985, a National Appeals
 Tribunal came into existence to hear appeals from the Public
 Tribunals. The Government's announced purpose in establishing
 the tribunals was to provide justice more quickly to more
 people with less corruption. Critics contend that the
 tribunal system still depends largely on judges with little or
 no legal experience, that it shortcuts legal safeguards in an
 effort to speed proceedings, and that it creates opportunities
 for corruption because of ambiguities concerning the
 jurisdictions of the tribunals and that of the courts. In
 1985, the Government also approved the creation of a legal aid
 program, but it is still in the preimplementation stage.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A person in Ghana is, for the most part, free of
 interference by the State in his or her private conduct. For
 example, membership in organizations such as the Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution is voluntary. The
 monitoring of telephones and mail occurs rarely, if at all.
 Forced entry into homes has been reported in connection with
 security investigations. Informers exist but informer
 systems, so far as is known, do not. There is no forced
 resettlement of populations, no interference with the right to
 marry or to have children, and no effort to prevent parents
 
 
 131
 GHANA
 from teaching their children religious practices, either at
 home or by public means.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and the press guaranteed by the 1979
 Constitution stand abrogated, but the PNDC chairman has
 publicly encouraged people to speak out on community
 concerns. The Government owns the radio and television
 stations, as well as the two principal daily newspapers.
 Several privately owned newspapers have been relatively bold
 in their news coverage and editorial comment. Nevertheless,
 in early 1985 one private weekly suspended publication for
 several issues under government orders; the editor and the
 publisher of-another weekly were beaten for publishing an
 erroneous story (although the Government subsequently
 apologized); the publisher of another weekly was imprisoned in
 July without charges and released in November; and the
 Government has occasionally limited supplies of newsprint
 available to the independent press. In December, the
 Government banned publication of the Catholic Standard, a
 church newspaper known for its independent stand on human
 rights and other issues. The press generally avoids criticism
 of the revolution or of Chairman Rawlings and focuses instead
 on uncovering instances of waste, fraud, and mismanagement,
 even when they involve relatively high-level officials.
 Academic freedom tends to be respected, Private organizations
 voice occasional dissent from official policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals are generally free to join together formally or
 informally to promote nonviolent causes, but restrictions
 remain on association for the purpose of protesting government
 policies. Political meetings are banned. Permits are
 required for public meetings but are routinely given except
 when the meeting has an overtly political purpose.
 In 1985, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) continued to be led
 by officials freely elected in December 1983. The TUC is
 associated with the International Labor Organization and the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity which has its
 headquarters in Accra. The right to strike is recognized in
 law and in practice in Ghana. Ghanaian trade unions freely
 engage in collective bargaining with both private sector and
 state-owned enterprises, though in the latter category there
 is indication that the Government has recently used brief
 detention and threats against union leaders to force agreement
 on an issue involving a state-owned enterprise.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state favored religion and no restriction on the
 exercise of religion or on contacts with others of the same
 faith. Most Ghanaians, including senior government officials,
 are practicing members of a religious group. Foreign
 missionary groups operate freely throughout the country. In
 1985, the PNDC chairman publicly criticized the leaders of one
 of the major religious denominations for disciplining two
 priests. His criticism has been echoed in sometimes virulent
 attacks on the church in government-owned newspapers,
 especially for alleged political misuse of the pulpit.
 
 
 132
 GHANA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are free to move from one part of the country to
 another without special permission. Since 1983, diplomats
 have been required to give 48 hours notice before traveling
 outside the greater Accra region. Roadblocks continue to
 exist for the prevention of smuggling but are less obtrusive
 than in 1984.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States,
 Ghanaians are free to travel for up to 90 days in West
 Africa. Ghanaians are generally free to exercise this right,
 and nationals of other member states are free to travel to
 Ghana. The major restraint on travel by Ghanaians is the lack
 of foreign exchange. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate or
 to be repatriated from other countries. If they are
 considered a security threat, then special permission must be
 obtained. In 1985, approximately 100,000 Ghanaians returned
 home, having been expelled by Nigeria. Passports are prized,
 and their issuance is frequently long delayed.
 In August 1985, the Government deported four expatriates,
 three of whom had either lived in Ghana many years or had
 Ghanaian spouses and children. None of the four was given a
 hearing.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The PNDC under Chairman Rawlings exercises total executive,
 legislative, judicial, and administrative power in Ghana (PNDC
 Law 42). There are no elections to governing organs and no
 current procedure by which citizens can freely and peacefully
 change their laws, officials, or form of government. However,
 Chairman Rawlings' appointments to the PNDC continue to
 reflect a variety of views. A panel to design new democratic
 structures to replace Ghana's existing provisional system is
 currently at work, but has yet to publish any of its
 deliberations or a timetable. It has, however, published some
 papers presented to it by various experts. Efforts to give
 substance to the revolutionary slogan, "power to the people,"
 include elections for leadership positions at the local level
 to the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR).
 These efforts are supposed to culminate in July 1986 with a
 national CDR conference. Thus far, indications suggest that
 these CDR elections have been relatively free and open. No
 claim is made by the Ghana Government, however, that these
 Committees are meant to take the place of either elected local
 or national governing bodies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government continued to permit international organizations
 to send representatives to Ghana to inquire into the human
 rights situation. A representative of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross continued regular prison visits and
 the Ghana chapter of Amnesty International held another
 conference on humanit&rian law. Though Ghanaian officials
 received members of foreign diplomatic missions for intensive
 discussions of human rights, the Government is sensitive to
 any implication that its decisions on human rights can be
 
 
 133
 GHANA
 affected by external or internal pressures. Internal bodies
 concerned with human rights tend to be objective but not
 especially vocal or effective in their reporting.
 Nevertheless, various independent groups and organizations
 have worked for and sometimes succeeded in gaining the release
 of some persons from custody. Official human rights matters
 are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, although
 inquiries may be answered at various levels, including cabinet
 secretaries. Amnesty International in its 1985 Report was
 concerned about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience
 and the detention without trial of people held on political
 grounds. It noted that a number of people, apparently
 suspected of trying to overthrow the Government in 1984, were
 reportedly executed by the security forces without trial.
 Freedom House rated Ghana "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ghana is a developing country with a population of 12.8
 million. The population growth rate is 3.1 percent (1985).
 The per capita gross national product was estimated at $310 in
 1983. Ghana has a mixed economy. The Government owns
 enterprises in the agricultural, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors; most productive agricultural enterprises, including
 those in the key cocoa sector, are owned by small farmers.
 The Government maintains a monopoly over the purchase and
 export of cocoa, coffee, shea nuts, and cotton. The private
 trading sector is also substantial, but the Government has
 favored the state-owned companies in national procurement and
 distribution.
 Ghana's austere economic recovery program has met its targets
 and is supported by the International Monetary Fund, the World
 Bank, and primary Western donors, including the U.S.. The
 recovery program features a devaluation of Ghana's currency by
 over 1,000 percent; establishment of producer and export
 incentives, including increased prices to cocoa and coffee
 farmers; the gradual elimination of subsidies on utilities and
 petroleum products; budgetary stringency; and an emphasis upon
 improving the standard of living in rural areas. The recovery
 program is showing signs of success. Real gross domestic
 product, measured in local currency, grew at an estimated 0.7
 percent rate in 1983, 7.6 percent in 1984, and an estimated 5
 percent in 1985. Triple digit inflation fell to approximately
 40 percent in 1984 and to an estimated 20 percent in 1985.
 The Government's work with the international community in
 1983-84 to overcome a major drought and food crisis succeeded
 so well that in 1985 Ghana was able to export surplus maize to
 Burkina Faso and Mali.
 Life expectancy at birth is 58.9 years, and the infant
 mortality rate in 1985 was estimated at 97 per 1,000 live
 births. In 1980, 47 percent of the population had access to
 safe drinking water (72 percent of the urban population). A
 renewed emphasis is now being placed on creating and improving
 wells in rural areas, particulary in the northern regions. In
 1970, the adult literacy rate was estimated to be 30.2
 percent, with the male rate at 43.1 and the female at 18.4
 percent. The difference can be partly attributed to a
 traditional perference for educating male over female
 children. Current literacy rates are not available, but 1982
 primary school enrollment ratios indicated improvement in
 access to education, with a primary school enrollment ratio of
 76 percent, (85 percent for boys and 66 percent for girls).
 
 
 184
 GHANA
 Working conditions in Ghana are governed by labor legislation
 which specifically prohibits forced labor, sets a minimum age
 for the employment of minors (15), and prohibits night work
 and certain types of hazardous employment for those under 18
 years of age. Government directives also establish a minimum
 wage and, through both directives and union contracts, the
 normal hours of work are defined in terms of a 40 hour week.
 Labor legislation also provides for labor inspectors and gives
 them the power to order the alteration or closing of any work
 site "to avert any threat to the health or safety of the
 workers."
 Women's rights in business, the civil service, and the home
 have long been well established and respected. Two women are
 among the 10 members of the ruling PNDC. There is one female
 cabinet member and at least six women are in subcabinet
 positions. Although women in urban centers and those who have
 entered modern society encounter little bias in most
 endeavors, role pressures do exist. Women in the rural
 agricultural sector remain subject to the constraints
 associated with traditional male-dominant mores, in spite of
 efforts by the Government and more enlightened elements in the
 society to curtail such practices. In the past year, the
 Government has promulgated four laws which will overturn many
 of the customary traditional and colonial laws which
 discriminate against women. The four laws cover head of
 family accountability, intestate succession, customary divorce
 registrations, and the administration of estates.
