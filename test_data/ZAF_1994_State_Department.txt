 SOUTH AFRICA
 In a dramatic and historic departure from 46 years of white-minority rule, South
 Africans in 1994 participated in the country's first multiracial election. During a 2-
 week period from April 26 to May 10, South Africans officially replaced the apart-
 heid regime with a -democratically elected Government of National Unity. The first
 nonracial election took place April 26-29, administered, monitored, and deemed sub-
 stantially free and fair by an Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), and ob-
 served by thousands of domestic and international monitors. The new Interim Con-
 stitution and Bill of Fundamental Rights came into effect on April 27, replacing the
 previous regional government structure of 4 provinces and 10homeland territories
 with 9 provinces. Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as President on May 10, with
 the previous president, F.W. de Klerk, serving as one of two Deputy Presidents. A
 multiparty Transitional Executive Council (TEC) served as a bridge between the
 dissolution of the old regime and the installation of the new Government of National
 Unity.
 The African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP), and the Inkatha
 Freedom Party (IFP), with a total of 377 of 400 seats in the National Assembly,
 formed the new Government and shared proportionally the original 27 cabinet posi-
 tions: 18 for the ANC, 6 for the NP, and 3 for the IFP. The National Assembly and
 the 90-member Senate, when in joint session, comprise the Constitutional Assembly
 which is tasked with formulating South Africa's new constitution.
 Although the security forces, including the newly named South African National
 Defense Force (SANDF) and the South African Police Service (SAPS), are under-
 going monumental changes, they remain a powerful, influential, and highly autono-
 mous force within the Government. During the election, the security forces, espe-
 cially the then South African Defense Force, had a pivotal role, maintaining public
 order and providing the LEC with logistical support. Starting in April, the SANDF
 initiated the process of integrating into its 65,000-strn ranks 20,000 former mem-
 bers of Umkhont We Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANO; 6,000 former mem-
 bers of the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), the armed wing of the Pan
 Africanist Congress (PAC); and 9,000 members of the former homeland armies.
 While the integration will bring the total SANDF force to approximately 100 000
 the military leadership has pledged to reduce this number to between 65,000 and
 75,000 through voluntary and involuntary resignations. The SAPS totals 120,000
 and is expected to assimate 30,000 police from the former homelands.
 In 1994 the SANDF acquitted itself well in internal security operations, particu-
 larly during the state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal, but there continued to be
 credible reports of torture and unexplained deaths of persons while in police cus-
 tody. Also, the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), which was deployed to some
 townships during the preelection period, performed poorly and inadvertently killed
 at least one person. The Government disbanded the NPKF following the elections,
 incorporating some of its members into the ranks of the SANDF.
 South Africa has a diversified and productive economy with strong agricultural
 and industrial sectors. The manufacturing sector contributes 25 percent to a gross
 domestic product of $111.8 billion. Unequal opportunities and disproportionate gov-
 ernment spending over the years have resulted in illiteracy, high unemployment,
 and other social ills among the black majority. The unemployment rate in the for-
 mal sector is approximately 46 percent, while over 60 percent of the black popu-
 lation is either totally without work or employed in the informal sector.
 The year represented a turning point in South Africa's human rights history. The
 new Interim Constitution and the Bill of Fundamental Rights provides for freedoms
 of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, free movement of travel and domi-
 cile, and protection of minority rights. Section 29 of the Internal Security Act (ISA),
 which had permitted the old government to detain thousands of persons without
 charge or trial for indefimite periods, was repealed.
 Following the installation of the new Government, there was a dramatic reduction
 in political and other extrajudicial killing. Once the IFP leadership decided to par-
 ticipate in the election campaign and the elections were held, violent conflict be-
 
 
 233
 tween the ANC and IFP supporters subsided, and white rightwing extremists
 seemed to resign themselves to the inevitable. Nevertheless, politically motivated vi-
 olence persisted throughout the year especially in KwaZulu/Natal, the IFFs provin-
 cial stronghold, in spite of a state of emergency there from March 31 to August 31.
 Both the ANC and LFP were responsible for this violence. The number of unex-
 plained deaths in police custody also continued at a high level. The Goldstone Com-
 mission unearthed prima facie evidence which implicated senior South African Po-
 lice officers in the supply of weapons to the IFP. A team of Dutch human rights
 monitors and police experts, as well as investigators from an Independent Board of
 Inquiry (a nongovernmental organization whose primary mission is to investigate
 political violence and police misconduct) uncovered a pattern of police torture of de-
 tainees in the Vaal Triangle area of suburban Johannesburg. Many knowledgeable
 observers believe that, in spite of the constitutional changes and the introduction
 of human rights training for the SAPS. improvement in respect for human rights
 will only occur once the former SAP leaders have been removed from office.
 The Justice Ministry-drafted bill that recommended amnesty to those who com-
 mitted politically motivated crimes between 1960 and 1993 loomed at year's end as
 a major test for the new Government in achieving its accountability and reconcili-
 ation goals. The Government also announced reforms aimed at strengthening wom-
 en's rights and its intention to revamp South Africa's labor relations system by giv-
 ig a statutory basis to collective bargaining and improving dispute resolution pro-
 cedures. Violence against women continued to be a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The level of political and
 extrajudicial killings decreased in 1994, especially after the Apnil election, but still
 remained high. The December total of 94 politically motivated deaths, as reported
 by the Human Rights Committee of South Africa (HRC), was the lowest monthly
 figure since February 1991. The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR),
 which always emphasizes the prvisional nature of its year-end statistics, reported
 89 deaths for the month of December. HIRC reports there were 2,687 politically moti-
 vated deaths throughout 1994 (the corresponding SAIRR figure is 2,367), compared
 with 4,364 in 1993, and 2,987 politically motivated injuries, compared with 4,339
 in the p receding year. In 1994, 31 persons died in police custody, compared with
 39 in 1993. In Kw~ul/aal there were 1,588 ploliticaly motivated deaths in
 1994, compared with 2,009 in 1993. There were 1,63 1 politically motivated deaths
 during the 4 months preceding the election, compared with a much lower figure of
 1,056 deaths during the remaining 8 months of the year. On the other hand the
 number of deaths in police custody for the 4 months preceding the election and the
 8 months following it (11 and 20, respectively) showed almost no downward swing
 at all.
 There were a number of killings by official forces, elements of which, it had be-
 come increasingly clear through the rldstne Comsion investigations, had been
 involved in the past in covert "third force" activity to foment ANCIIFP conflict. The
 largest number of political and extrajudicial killings were committed by the rival
 ANC and ]FP, often involving their local self-defense units (ANC SDU's) and self-
 protection units (IFP SPU's). The vast majority of the violence was concentrated in
 KwaZulu/Natal and the East Rand sections of metropolitan Johannesburg. There
 were also killings by homeland security forces, rightwing extremists, and in the
 "taxi war" killings by rival groups, that allegedlyinvolve political undertones.
 Killings related to the taxi wars occurred not only in the Western Cape but in all
 regions of the country except the Free State and Northern Cap. Taxi-related deaths
 increased sharply during the final quarter of 1994. Out of a nationwide total figure
 of 184 for the whole year, there were 36 deaths recorded in October and 39 in No-
 vember.
 In the irst incident of targeted political killing since the 1993 murder of Chris
 Hani, an unknown assailant(s) killed former Dutch Reformed Church moderator
 Johan Heyns in his Pretoria home on November 5. Although at year's end. the po-
 lice had no suspect or confirmed motive there was widespread speculation that
 rightwing extremists had assassinated Heyns for political reasons. The apparent
 professionalism with which the killing was carried out stunned the population and
 created anxiety among parliamentarians and the press about a new round of politi-
 cal violence.
 In February the TEC formed the NPKF, composed of 35,000 Evolunteers3-largely
 MK soldiers, in the hop that it would be more effective than the SAPS in keeping
 the peace between the hostel dwellers (generally IFP supporters) and squatter-camp
 
 
 234
 residents (generally ANC supporters) in Johannesburg's townships. However, on its
 first assignment in the East-Rand, it performed poorly. During an April 18 firefight
 between township residents, the NPKF was caught in the crossfire and returned fire
 wildly, reportedly killing one reporter and wounding two others.
 According to HRC data, 31 persons died in police custody in 1994. Incident reports
 on these deaths did not reveal a clear pattern. In some cases, those arrested died
 as a result of injuries received either during attempted crime or during the arrest
 process. In other cases, those arrested committed suicide in their police cells. In a
 few cases, pathologist reports confirmed allegations of police abuse and torture at
 time of inter gation Such incidents, however, are generally considered to be the
 excption rather than the rule.
 On March 18, the Goldstone Commission released a report in which it presented
 prima facie evidence implicating senior South African Police (SAP) officers in third
 force activity in.clandestine support of the IFP. The report specifically implicated
 Colonel Eugene de Kock, a olice training unit commander, in the supply of weap-
 onsto the IFP. As aresult of the report, a number of very high-ranking SAP officers
 retired from the service, while de Kock himself was arrested and, having been re-
 fused bail, awaited trial at year's end. Meanwhile, the Tranvaal Attorney General
 ontinued to investigate  e     third force allegations of the Goldstone Commission.
 Similarly, in the widely followed Goniwe inquest, which concluded Ma 28, the
 judge found that, although he was unable to identify' the murderers, there was
 prima facie evidence implicating the security forces in the June 27, 1985, killing of
 the so-called wCradock Four," which inciuded Matthew Gniwe and three Uted
 Democratic Front colleagues. In this case, evidence included a security force docu-
 ment calling for Gnwe and his colleagues to "be permanently removed from society
 as a matter of urgency."
 In the preelection violence, in mid-March the Bophuthatswana Security Forces
 (BSF) used lethal force in attempting to put down p rotests calling for homeland
 president Mangope to step down and terminate Bophnuthatswana's nominal inde-
 pendence. BSF members killed at least 42 people and injured 150 others during the
 protest activity.
 The new Government began a formal investigation into KwaZulu Police (KZP) hit
 squads in September and also began a preliminary investigation into ANC hit squad
 activity in the KwaZuluNatal Midlands region.
 There were many incidents involving killings by ANC/WFP supporters. The great-
 eat death toll resulting from any one single incident occurred in Johannesburg on
 March 28, when ANC and IFP supporters fought during a Zulu-sponsored march in
 support of King Goodwill Zwelithini's call for a sovereign Zlu state and in opposi-
 tion to the upcoming election. By the end of the day, over 50 people had died in
 the fighting, including 8 persons shot dead in front of ANC headquarters. After the
 election, an ANC minister in the new Government acknowledged that persons com-
 ing from ANc  headquarters had also attacked the marchers during the incident and
 promised a full investigation. At year's end the investigation was ongoing, but, ac-
 cording to most reports, the deaths in this case weree  de largely to the ANC/IFP
 figting r   fther than to police intervention in the melee.
 InKwauu/Natal, the ANC/IFP preelection conflict resulted in several ugly epi-
 sodes, including one on April 12, when I supporters tortured and massacred eight
 employees of a private company who were handing out TEC leaflets explaining vot-
 ing procedures.
 In postelection violence some SDU's, SPU's, and somewhat politicized criminal
 gangs continued to kill suspected political opponents. The ANC and the IFP did not
 always have control over these local vigilante groups. Observers pointed out that in
 areas like Tokoza and Katlehong near Johannesburg, law enforcement actually re-
 mained in the hands of these heavily armed local groups rather than the SAPS. In
 the Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging(PWV) reg o n (soon to be officially renamed
 Gauteng), two initial groups of former SDU and SPU members have already under-
 gone the necessary training to be integrated into the regular police units. However,
 this program is still regarded as experimental.
 In the March political violence in Bophuthatswana (see above), some 1,500 right-
 wing extremists arrived in the homeland, allegedly at the request of the homeland
 president, to help stabilize the territory. In the process, a Bophuthatdwana police
 officer executed two of the white extremists in full view of television cameras. The
 violence ended when the TEC sent in the SADF to restore order and placed the
 homeland under TEC central authority.
 Not only in Bophuthatswana did white rightwing groups, such as the Afrikaner
 Weerstandbeweging (AWB), engage in extensive v   due prior to the election. In
 the week immediately preceing the election, there were 13 separate bombings
 throughout the PWV region, manly attributed to rightwing extremists. These mci-
 
 
 235
 dents caused 23 deaths and 179 injuries. Since April no significant incidents or or-
 ganized, politically motivated violence have occurred which might be directly attrib-
 utable to rightwing extremists, although many observers believed that rightwing
 elements assassinated prominent church leader Johan Heyns on November 5 (see
 above).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of disappearances caused by offi-
 cial forces. However, neither the TEC nor the new Government initiated any new
 investigations into past disappearances, in the hopes that the still to be established
 Truth and Reconciliation Commission will investigate cases such as that of the 1988
 disappearance of community activist Stanza Bopape.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Deding Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Interim Constitution stipulates that "no person shall be subject to tor-
 ture of any kind, whether physical, mental or emotional, nor shall any person be
 subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," there were credi-
 ble reports that, both before and after the Interim Constitution came into effect, po-
 lice tortured and severely mistreated detainees in their custody.
 In one of the most egregious examples, credible reports indicate a pattern of sys-
 tematic torture of police detainees by the members of the Vanderbijlpark Murder
 and Robbery Unit m the Vaal Triangle area of suburban Johannesburg. At year's
 end, a team comprising a Witwatersrand/Vaal Triangle police officer a representa-
 tive from the Independent Board of Inquiry, three SAPS colonels, and police experts
 from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, had conducted a detailed investiga-
 tion of 121 cases of torture, the vast majority of them involving the Vanderbijlpark
 Murder and Robbery Unit. Of these 121 cases, at least 29 had been completed and
 forwarded to the Attorney General for action. By the end of 1994, the Attorney Gen-
 eral had decided to prosecute in 7 cases involving 12 police officers. The Attorney
 General declined to prosecute in 5 cases, and the remaining cases were still pend-
 ing. In the meantime, the authorities transferred four plice officers out of the
 Vanderbilpark Unit, pending further investigation. The initial findings indicated
 that, among the alleged torture methods, officers of the Vanderbijlpark Murder and
 Robbery Unit frequently employed electric shock.
 There were other reprted incidents of police torture elsewhere in South Africa,
 often involving "tubing", a method of smothering the nose and mouth of torture vic-
 tims with a rubber tube, thereby making it virtually impossible for them to breathe.
 For example, in August, internal stability unit members from Mtubatuba, Northern
 Natal, allegedly assaulted an ANC-supporting shop steward with a rubber tube at
 the police station in Ngwelezane.
 From the outset the new Government gave a high priority to addressing the issue
 of police brutality and the need for institutional reform, especially in the light of
 the Goldstone Commission findings. More recently, the existence of heavily armed
 local groups has complicated law enforcement responsibilities (see Section L.a.). On
 May 25, the Minister for Safety and Security announced plans for a comprehensive
 reorganization of the SAPS, including decentralization of the command structure,
 the promotion of more women and blacks into senior officer ranks, and introduction
 of a new institutional culture in support of democratic constitutional rights. During
 the year, there were new programs aimed at furthering police-community relations,
 and the Lawyers for Human Rights (LUR), one of the foremost human rights advo-
 cacy groups in South Africa, regularly conducted human rights education and train-
 ing workshops for police officers and instructors at police colleges throughout the
 country. Nevertheless, at year's end the effectiveness of these measures in reducing
 SAPS abuses had yet to be demonstrated.
 In general, prison conditions are poor but not life threatening. The Department
 of Correctional Services has traditionally refused to provide information on prison
 operations, but there were reports that inmates and prison guards killed some pris-
 oners. After several prison riots instigated by the South African Prisoners Organiza-
 tion for Human Rights (SAPOHR), the President created the Commission of Inquiry
 into the Unrest in Prisons. During Commission hearings, SAPOHR cited widespread
 human rights abuses in prisons, including deaths, assault, harassment, and other
 physical and psychological abuse. At years end, the Commission's report had not
 yet been made public.
 Female prisoners normally enjoy better conditions than do their male counter-
 parts; women's facilities are generally cleaner and less austere. In an effort to re-
 duce prison overcrowding, the Government granted an amnesty in 1994 to all female
 prisoners with children under 12, if they had been convicted of nonviolent crimes.
 South African prisons offer no special services nor protection for juvenile inmates,
 thereby leaving them vulnerable to abuse. Although by law persons between the
 ages of 18 and 21 are considered juveniles" and must be incarcerated away from
 adult prisoners, this is often not the case. As a result there is widespread rape and
 
 
 236
 sexual exploitation of juveniles by adult prisoners who are sometimes aided and
 abetted by warders. Juvenile prostitution is common in the prisons. The conserv-
 ative leadership of the Department of Correctional Services haB resisted pressure to
 address this problem or to implement policies on AIDS awareness and prevention.
 According to the Department of Correctional Services, as of December 1, 1994,
 there were 613 children under age 18 serving prison sentences and 665 children
 awaiting trial. On May 24, President Mandela ordered all relevant government de-
 partments to take immediate steps to empty South Africa's prisons of children and
 place them in suitable alternative care. In addition, the Correctional Services
 Amendment Bill, which was tabled before Parliament on August 24, is designed to
 humanize the treatment of children upon their arrest. In a September 20 amend-
 ment to the draft bill, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Correctional Serv-
 ices provided that, following arrest, children under 14 could not be detained for
 longer than 24 hours without being afforded an opportunity to appear in court. In
 addition, following a court appearance, they would ave to be located in a place of
 safety or in a foster home rather than be incarcerated. Children between the ages
 of 14 and 18 could be incarcerated following a court appearance but only for a maxi-
 mum of 48 hours. However, in November, the Advisory National Working Group on
 Children in detention/alternative centers indicated that the September 20 amend-
 ment could not be implemented because all existing alternative care facilities were
 already occupied by other children. At year's end, this problem awaited consider-
 ation in the January 1995 session of Parliament.
 By agreement with the Government, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) has access to all inmates in South African prisons and to all police
 station detainees. The ICRC provides the authorities with reports of any sub-
 standard prison conditions it encounters, but does not publish its findings. However,
 the South African Prisoners Organization for Human Rights (SAPOHR) does pub-
 lish its findings.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Interim Constitution prohibits de-
 tention without trial. In April the National Assembly repealed portions of the Public
 Safety Act (PSA) and the Internal Security Act (ISA), which permitted indefinite de-
 tention of persons without charge or trial.
 Under the Interim Constitution, every "detained person" has a number of rights,
 including the right to be informed promptly of the reasons for detention; to be
 charged within 48 hours of arrest; to be detained in conditions of human dignity;
 to consult with legal counsel at every stage in the legal process; to communicate
 with relatives, medical practitioners, and religious counselors; and to be released
 with or without bail, unless the interests of justice require otherwise. At year's end,
 most courts and police appeared to be acting in good faith to respect these rights,
 although there was a lack of uniformity in application at some levels.
 According to the HRC, the authorities detained 270 persons without charge from
 January 1 through May 15 under the old laws, but had detained no person since
 then unless properly charged. Throughout the year, the Advisory Commission on In-
 demnity and Amnesty, chaired by LHR national director Brian Currin, continued to
 process amnesty and indemnity applications by those claiming to be political detain-
 ees or prisoners (see Section i.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Interim Constitution's section on fundamental
 rights provides for due process, including the right to a fair, public trial, with coun-
 sel and within a reasonable time of being charged; and with the right of appeal to
 a higher court. That Constitution also provides for an independent and impartial ju-
 diciary subject only to the Constitution and the law. The Constitution established
 the Constitutional Court as the supreme arbiter of constitutional questions and
 overturned the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, which, under the old system,
 restricted courts' authority to alter or strike down laws. This change removed a key
 obstacle to maintaining judicial independence.
 The new Court was expected to begin hearing cases in early 1995. Its 11 mem-
 bers, who -will serve 7-year terms, were selected by a process which attenuates di-
 rect political influence: While 5 of the 11 Constitutional Court judges were directly
 chosen by the State President, the remaining 6 judges were selected by the Presi-
 dent from a list of 10 nominees submitted by the Judicial Service Commission (see
 Section 3).
 The relationship between the Constitutional Court and the Appellate Division of
 the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein (which was formerly the country's supreme udi-
 cial body) remains unclear, as does the extent to which appellants will be permitted
 to seek Constitutional Court review as a right, rather than at the Court's discretion.
 Judges try criminal cases; the jury system was abolished in 1969. The Supreme
 Court or in one of its provincial divisions try serious offenses, including capital
 
 
 237
 crimes. Magistrates, who are career civil servants, hear lesser offenses. The presid-
 ing judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence.
 While initial indications point to good-faith efforts by South African authorities
 to ensure fair public trial, delays in implementation of due process rights are wide-
 spread. In particular, pretrial delays still plague the criminal justice system, which
 sometimes result in the obstruction of justice. The delays are due to a combination
 of poor court management and the growing exercise of the right to counsel, coupled
 with the inability of legal aid structures to cope with demand in a timely fashion.
 Critics continued to charge that the judiciary remained a bastion of de facto
 apartheid. White males have always dominated the bench, as well as the senior
 members of the bar from whose ranks judges have been chosen. As a result, extreme
 racial and gender imbalances continue. President Mandela noted in September that
 the country's 94 judges include only 1 black and 2 women (both white). In addition,
 only 37 of 1,088 magistrates, 37 of 172 senior counsel and 1,180 of 8,300 attorneys
 are black. In late December, Durban attorney Navanthem (Ravi) Pillay became the
 first black woman in South African history t be appointed a judge; she will serve
 on the Natal Supreme Court bench.
 President Mandela vowed to act promptly to redress these imbalances. The Gov-
 ernment adopted policy changes to permit the appointment of attorneys and law
 professors as Supreme Court judges. This greatly broadened the pool from which
 judges can be selected and should help to create a more diverse and representative
 bench.
 During the year, the Mandela Government also began to address the controversial
 issues of both amnesty and punishment for past human rights abuses. The Cabinet
 debated a draft bill which would create a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission."
 This Commission would investigate political crimes and human rights abuses com-
 mitted, inter alia, by members of the apartheid-era government security apparatus,
 rightwing extremist groups and antiapartheid liberation movements. In addition,
 the Commission would authorize reparations and other compensatory measures for
 victims and relatives of victims of certain abuses.
 In the draft bill, which has been circulated for comment, the cabinet agreed that
 the Commission would cover crimes and abuses committed between March 1, 1960,
 and December 6, 1993, and that the approximately 10 members of the Commission
 would be independent and would be appointed by the President upon the rec-
 ommendation of Parliament. It was expected that the commissioners would complete
 their work within a period of 12 to 18 months. The Commission would have three
 committees to handle amnesty and indemnity, human rights violations, and repara-
 tions to and rehabilitation of victims. The draft bill instituting the Commission is
 expected to be debated in the January 1995 session of Parliament.
 The number of political prisoners still held at year's end was unknown, but was
 believed to be in the low hundreds. The Advisory Committee on Indemnity and Am-
 nesty had by year's end processed more than 1,200 applications from persons claim-
 ing they were political prisoners or facing political charges. The Committee rec-
 ommended about 250 cases for amnesty. According to the HRC, the authorities had
 granted indemnity to 69 political prisoners in late November, pursuant to Commit-
 tee recommendations, and earlierhad released over 90 at the Committee's behest.
 In addition to those mentioned in Section L.a., there were several other important
 cases in which the courts sentenced offenders for past human rights abuses. For ex-
 ample on March 30, the Pretoria Supreme Court convicted 17 hostel-dwellers, pre-
 sumed to be IFP supporters, for the massacre on June 17,1992, of 45 people at the
 Boipatong Township squatter camp, an area of ANC support. Also, on May 11, the
 Rand Supreme Court sentenced to death six white rightwing extremists for the mur-
 der of four blacks, including an 11-year-old child, at a roadblock near Randfontein
 on December 12, 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 and security forces retained the legal authority to engage in domestic surveillance
 activities, including the use of informers. However, informed observers believe that
 under the country's dramatically changed political environment the use of this au-
 thority has been limited to the pursuit of legitimate law enforcement and national
 security objectives.
 Before the Interim Constitution came into force, police had sweeping powers of
 search and seizure in magisterial districts that had been declared "unrest areas,"
 under the provisions of the Public Safety Act. The provisions of the Act that allowed
 for the declaration of "unrest areas" are no longer operative, and police searches in
 all of South Africa must now be conducted in accordance with the Criminal Proce-
 dure Act of 1977. This Act requires that a warrant be issued by a magistrate before
 a search can be conducted, unless there are reasonable grounds to suspect that evi-
 dence would be destroyed in the time that it would take to obtain one. Despite the
 
 
 widespread anticipation that some provisions of the Criminal Procedures Act will be
 challenged as being unreasonable infringements of the right to privacy, all South
 Africans now generally enjoy protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.
 The legacy of apateid has left vast numbers of South Africans landless; more
 than 8 million people now live in squatter camps which often surround settled com-
 munities. The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act gives landowners and local gov-
 ernments the authority to remove informal settlements without reference to the
 courts. Despite widespread preparedness on the part of the central Government and
 many local authorities to seek accommodation with squatters, some municipalities,
 landowners, and, in one case, rightwing vigilantes, have demolished shacks as a
 means of forcing squatters to move.
 Although the problem of forced relocation of residents of informal settlements was
 most pronounced prior to the April election, forced relocations continued throughout
 the year. The most notable of these incidents occurred in early June when the Jo-
 hannesburg City Council, without securing a court order or legal judgment, demol-
 ished two squatter settlements on city land. Unauthorized land invasions by squat-
 ters also continued sporadically throughout the year, a practice severely decried by
 the Government as inimical to the housing strategy it devised as part of its Recon-
 struction and Development Program.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedoms of
 speech and press, and these rights are respected in practice. Both the mainstream
 and the so-called alternative press kept the public well informed and criticized both
 the Government and the opposition.
 The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), once seen as the Govern-
 ment's mouthpiece, continued to undergo profound changes under the direction of
 a new board of directors and a new group manager. Parliament established the
 Independent Broadcasting Authority (BA) in 1993 to oversee restructuring the
 broadcasting industry and to issue licenses. At year's end, the IBA began to issue
 temporary community radio licenses, but the process was a slow one. By early De-
 cember, the IBA had issued only one license, for Radio Maritzburg, although more
 were expected in January 1995. Radio and television news reporting from both the
 SABC and the privately owned Radio Station 702 appeared balanced.
 Although rarely invoked, considerable legislation remained on the books that per-
 mit the Government to restrict the publication of information about the SAPS,
 SANDF, petroleum issues, prisons, an  men    ins itutions. In August the Minister
 of Defense sought a court order interdicting an alternative weekly newspap~er from
 publishing articies about the SANDF Directorate of Covert Collections. However,
 the Minister refrained from proceeding with the action in the face of intense opposi-
 tion from the press and the AnC.
 While there were no instances of government-or police- sanctioned harassment of
 the press, there were cases of harassment of journalists by supportrs of white
 rightwing organizations prior to the election. AW  supporters m  anaded an Afri-
 can-American journalist and two black colleagues at a rightwing rally; and right-
 wing supporters harasse    d nbeat two other American reporters during unrest in
 Bophuthatswana. Earlier in the year, rightwingers harassed an African-American
 journalist at a Vlksfront party rally. There were no such incidents since the elec-
 tion in April.
 The Internal Security Act still allows the Government to ban organizations and
 their publications. Prohibitions against the publication of material deemed to be por-
 nographic are also still in effect, but enforcement of such bannings became less fre-
 quent after the election.
 During the year, Parliament repealed the News        Regtration Act of 1971,
 which required newspapers to register with the Ministry of Home Affairs and pay
 a certain fee. Many observers considered this Act an impediment to freedom of the
 press, since it permitted the Government to withhold registration if it opposed a
 particular publication.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political parties and organiza-
 tions exercise broad constitutional freedoms of assembly and association. Although
 the legal framework governing public meetings and demonstrations comprises nine
 different aparheid-er laws, police policy is now to act in accordance with the Regu-
 lation of Gatherings Act which, at year's end, awaited the signature of the Presi-
 dent. This At promulgates recommendations on public gatherings that were made
 by the Goldtone Commission; it requires local governments, demonstration organiz-
 ers, and the police to cooperate in order to facilitate the exercise of the right to
 
 
 239
 
 peaceful assembly. The authorities may prevent demonstrations only under extreme
 circumstances, and, even then, the Act provides for judicial a ppeals.
 Despite declared police adherence to the Regulation of Gatherings Act, there were
 several controversial incidents in July and August in which the police acted forcibly
 to prevent an "illegal gathering," pursuant to a court order issued under existing
 laws. Police used excessive force to disperse these gatherings and the HRC said the
 police "appeared to be reverting to their old habits by breaking up peaceful dem-
 onstrations with dogs, robber bullets, and tear gas." Although lega observers said
 the use of force in these instances was inappropriate.
 Prior to the April election, there were incidents impeding political assembly and
 association. The police used the emergency and unrest provisions of the Public Safe-
 ty Act on numerous occasions to prohibit political meetings and demonstrations,
 usually to reduce violence. In the former homeland of Bophuthatswana, local offi-
 cials banned most political organizations and prohibited political meetings and in
 the KwaZulu homeland officials used their authority to hamper severely political ac-
 tivity by groups other than the IFP. The climate of violence that existed in many
 parts of Kwaulu and in some East Rand townships resulted in so-called no-go
 areas where, in some cases, leaders of the ANC and, in others, leaders of the IFP
 could not organize meetings without risk to their lives. The National Party and the
 Democratic Party also experienced difficulty in organizing rallies in some areas.
 ANC and IFP sympathizers shared culpability for this situation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. There
 were no known cases of restrictions being placed on the expression and practice of
 religious belief, nor on proselytizing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re.
 patriation.-The Interim Constitution stipulates freedom of movement, including
 travel abroad, choice of residence, and safeguards on citizenship. Neither the
 preelection government nor the new nonracial, democratically elected Government
 restricted the movement of South Africans domestically or their freedom to travel
 overseas, emigrate, or repatriate.
 Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) contin-
 ued to assist with the repatriation of South African exiles under its September 1991
 mandate, the flow of these returnees had almost come to an end. By year's end, ap-
 proximately 14,000 exiles had returned, including 7,303 who returned with UNH
 assistance and an estimated 6,000 who voluntarily repatriated under other auspices.
 An additional 3,500 exiles remained registered with the UNHCR and cleared for re-
 patriation, but they had chosen not to return.
 Illegal immigration became a growing political issue during the year, and the
 SANUF increased border control measures. In December Minister of Defense Joe
 Modise told a press conference that the controversial electrified fence along South
 Africa's border with Mozambique had been switched off. Both the Department of
 Home Affairs (DHA) and private monitoring groups conservatively estimated that
 2 million refugees and illegal immigrants currently reside in South Africa, of whom
 70 percent are from Mozambique and the remaining 30 percent are from other Afri-
 can countries, Eastern Europe, and the Far East, particularly China and Pakistan.
 Prior to the October 4, 1992, Peace Accord in Mozambique, civil unrest drove
 Mozambicans across the border. In recent years, they seem increasingly attracted
 by better economic opportunities in the Transvaal and KwaZulu/Natal.
 There has been close cooperation between the UNHCR and the Government to en-
 sure UNHCR protective services to Mozambicans and others wishing to apply for
 refugee status. In agreement with the Mozambican Government, the UNHCR initi-
 ated on January 10, 1994, the organized voluntary repatriation of Mozambican im-
 migrants. Under the Aliens Control Act, the DHA may involuntarily repatriate per-
 sons who do not qualify for refugee status to their countries of origin. According to
 the DHA, between January 1 and December 31, South Africa involuntarily repatri-
 ated a total of 90,692 illegal immigrants. Of these, 71,279 were Mozambicans. The
 only other countries to which the DHA repatriated significant numbers of illegal im-
 migrants were Zimbabwe with 12,931 and Lesotho with 4,073.
 Although there is widespread recognition of the distinction between bona fide ref-
 ugees/asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, this distinction is not well rooted
 among front-line immigration officials. Any so-called foreigner who is arrested and
 found not to possess the proper documents is often automatically considered to be
 an illegal immigrant and is summarily deported. Asylum seekers, who often have
 to wait 2 years for their scheduled case-determination interview, are typically issued
 a "Section 41" document permitting them to remain in the country and even seek
 employment, pending results of their interview. However, some police officers fail
 to recognize this document and have harassed asylum seekers.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 On April 26-29, South Africa for the first time held a nonracial election in which
 all citizens were allowed to participate. The election was peaceful and was pro-
 nounced "substantially free and fair. As a result, the TEC, which had been created
 in 1993, as well as the old National Party government, gave way to a Government
 of National Unity. At the national level, 19 parties stood for election, with 7 gaining
 enough votes to be represented in the National Assembly. These, ranked by number
 of seats obtained, were: the ANC, the NP, the IFP, the Freedom Front (FF), the
 Democratic Party (DP), the PAC, and the African Christian Democratic Party
 (ACDP).
 South Africa will be governed until 1999 by an Interim Constitution which allows
 for executive power sharing among political parties, based on the proportion of the
 vote they received in the April election. It provides for a bicameral parliament, an
 executive state president, and an independent judiciary which, for the first time, in-
 cludes a Constitutional Court.
 The Parliament comprises the National Assembly and the Senate, and, when in
 joint session, serves as the Constitutional Assembly. According to the Interim Con-
 stitution, the Constitutional Assembly is required by April 1996 to draft and ap-
 prove a new and permanent constitution which is consistent with 34 constitutional
 principles. If it fails to do so, it will be dissolved, and a new election will be held.
 If it succeeds, it will remain in office until 1999, when a fresh election under the
 new permanent constitution will be held. This permanent constitution will have to
 be reviewed and approved by the Constitutional Court (see below).
 The National Assembly is made up of 400 members elected by a system of "list
 proportional representation." Each of the 19 parties which appeared on the ballot
 submitted a rank-ordered list of candidates. The voters then cast their ballots for
 one party. Seats in the Assembly were allocated based on the percentage of votes
 each party received. Even thoug the ANC gained a majority of 252 seats in the
 400-seat Parliament, it is required to share power at the cabinet level with the NP
 which gained 82 seats and with the IFP which gained 43 seats.
 The Senate consists of 90 members, 10 from each of the nine provinces created
 under the Constitution. With a few exceptions, the Senate has coequal legislative
 powers with the National Assembly.
 In addition to President Mandela, who is the Executive Head of State, South Afri-
 ca has two Executive Deputy Presidents, Thabo Mbeki, representing the ANC, and
 F.W. de Klerk, the former president, representing the NP. A constitutional amend-
 ment in September created an additional 28th cabinet seat beyond the original max-
 imum of 27 seats provided for in the Interim Constitution. Any party holding at
 least 20 seats in the Assembly is entitled to a proportionate share of cabinet seats.
 According to the Constitution, the Cabinet must in the first instance seek consen-
 sus.
 The Interim Constitution provides for a Constitutional Court whose responsibility
 is to interpret, defend, and enforce the Constitution. The Court will have the power
 to overturn any law or executive act that it deems unconstitutional. Chapter three
 of the Constitution delineates over 25 fundamental rights of a South African citizen
 which it is the Court's duty to protect. The Constitutional Court must rule on
 whether the constitutions adopted by the Constitutional Assembly or any of the
 provinces are consistent with the Interim Constitution's constitutional principles.
 The 11judges of the Court were named in October, and they were expected to begin
 hearing evidence on their first case, concerning the legality of the death penalty, in
 January 1995.
 The first major test for the government coalition centered on the Justice Min-
 istry's draft legislation designed to foster national reconciliation (see Section I.e.).
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. In fact, a record 106 women sit in the new 400-member National Assembly and
 16 women in the 90-member Senate. A woman, Dr. Frene Ginwala, was elected
 speaker of the National Assembly, and women parliamentarians have formed a cau-
 cus in order to press for legislative and other solutions to problems of sex discrimi-
 nation. However, women are less well represented in the Cabinet where only 3 out
 of 28 ministers and 3 out of 13 deputy ministers are women. There are no women
 among the 9 provincial premiers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The new nonracial, democratically elected Government has continued to pursue
 the preelection government's practice of permitting an increasingly broad range of
 
 
 domestic and international organizations to monitor, investigate, and report on
 human rights issues.
 On August 22, the Senate passed legislation creating the Human Rights Commis-
 sion and the Office of Public Protector, two bodies for the protection of human rights
 which the Interim Constitution mandated. The Parliament's Standing Committee on
 Justice has insisted that the Office of Public Protector, whose task is to investigate
 abuse and maladministration by government, should maintain its independence of
 the executive branch. Accordingly, Parliament will appoint the Public Protector and
 determine compensation and conditions of service.
 Throughout the first 4 months of 1994, when the most intensive election cam-
 paigning took place, the United Nations, the European Union, the Commonwealth
 of Nations, and the Organization of African Unity stationed observers in South Afri-
 ca to monitor campaign activities and any violence related to them. These observers
 attended marches, demonstrations, and other mass events, monitoring compliance
 by all participating organizations with both the principles of the National Peace Ac-
 cord and the guidelines of the Goldstone Commission governing marches and politi-
 cal gatherings. The observer groups enjoyed complete freedom of access to all geo-
 graphic areas, institutions, and personalities, except in the then homeland of
 Bophuthatawana.
 The central and most provincial governments also welcomed visits and sugges-
 tions by, and cooperated with a number of international nongovernmental human
 rights organizations (NGO's). however, while authorities in the Gauteng (ex-PWV)
 region granted complete access to NGO's to detention cells, those in Northern Natal,
 under the state of emergency, restricted NGO access. This disparity in responsive-
 ness between the Gauteng and KwaZulu/Natal provincial governments has persisted
 since the election.
 As noted in Section 1.c., the Government granted the ICRC access to all prisoners
 and detainees. Prior to the April election, the former Bophuthatswana government
 resisted ICRC relief activities but did give the ICRC access to prisons. However,
 after the election, ICRC has had complete access to prisoners and detainees
 throughout the country, including during the state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal.
 The Government's receptivity to ICRC prison visits is especially noteworthy in view
 of widely publicized charges by the South African Prisoners Organization for Human
 Rights concerning poor prison conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, gender,
 ethnic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience,
 belief, culture, or language.
 Women.-Discrimination against women, particularly against black women, re-
 mains a serious problem despite legal and constitutional advances in 1994.
 There is still a high rate of domestic violence against women. According to the
 Department of Justice, between December 1993 and July 1994, magistrates issued
 some 5,207 restraining orders in response to complaints of domestic violence. A
 Human Sciences Research Council study indicated that 43 percent of women qaes-
 tioned said that they had been victims of marital rape and assault, and more than
 half also knew of other women who had been battered. When contacted for assist-
 ance, police and community services were, in most cases, reluctant to intervene on
 a woman's behalf. Over 50 percent of murdered women died at the hands of their
 male partners.
 The recent overall increase in violent crime in South Africa has also been reflected
 in the level of crimes against women. According to the latest available statistics
 from the South African Police Service, there were 25,298 incidents of rape reported
 nationwide during the period January 1 through October 31, 1994, involving women
 18 years of age and older. This represents a 17 percent increase over the 21,543
 incidents of rape reported for the corresponding period in 1993. In 1992 there were
 23,675 rapes reported but only 6,131 rapists convicted. In cases of rape accompanied
 by extreme violence, offenders can receive stiff sentences, including life imprison-
 ment. In September there were several well publicized cases of forced prostitution
 involving South African and foreign (Asian and other African) women in Johannes-
 burg. During raids, police arrested women and establishment operators but not
 male patrons.
 In Iate 1993, Parliament passed the Promotion of Equality Between Men and
 Women Act and the Prevention of Family Violence Act. In August the Department
 of Justice released a family violence brochure and a poster explaining the protec-
 tions afforded women and children under the new legislation. Women who know
 
 
 242
 
 their rights can apply to a judge or a magistrate for an injunction prohibiting a
 partner from acting violently against them.
 Discrimination against women in traditional law remains. In September Home Af-
 fairs Minister Manuos.thu Buthelezi promised that the KwaZulu/Natal legislature
 would abolish discriminatory customary laws under which women are considered
 and treated as minors. Such laws exist among other ethnic groups, too, where they
 remain unchallenged.
 Women's rights groups continue to press the Government to enact legislation to
 protect women in customary marriages, to provide equal fringe benefits for women
 in the workplace, and to legislate equal taxation for women. In response, the new
 Government has repeatedly proclaimed its commitment to women's rights and to a
 "nonsexist" South Africa. Even prior to the April election, the TEC had created a
 Subcouncil on the Status of Women.
 Children.-The Interim Constitution stipulates that children have the right 'to
 security, basic nutrition, and basic health and social services." Although the Govern-
 ment is committed to providing these services and to correcting past race-based im-
 balances, it is still developing the mechanisms for delivering the necessary services.
 Best estimates indicate that between 25 and 33 percent of South Africa s children
 suffer from chronic malnutrition or stunted growth.
 Special programs known as "Presidential Initiatives" (owing to President
 Mandela's interest in them) are part of the Reconstruction and Development Pro-
 gram and offer free health care to pregnant mothers and children under 6 and pro-
 vide a nutritional feeding for primary school children. These programs are aimed
 at correcting imbalances such as those reflected in the infant mortality rate, which
 is 6 per thousand among whites compared with 66 per thousand among blacks.
 Violence against children is widespread, including in prisons (see Section 1.c.).
 From January through November 30, the South African Police Service's child protec-
 tion unit investigated 20,624 crimes against children, including 6,670 cases of rape,
 3,598 cases of indecent assault, and 2,949 cases of common assault. Many NGO's,
 such as the National Children's Rights Committee, are working to enhance the qual-
 ity of life of South Africa's children. At year's end, the public awaited a report from
 the Goldstone Commission on its investigation into the effects of violence on chil-
 dren.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-With the adoption of the Interim Constitu-
 tion and Bill of Fundamental Rights, and the near-total repeal of the race-based
 statutes of the apartheid era, South Africa has theoretically eliminated all forms of
 racial discrimination. Many private sector companies and institutions have initiated
 their own affirmative action programs in an effort to correct workforce imbalances
 and avoid government-instituted programs. However, de facto discrimination is still
 widespread, and the white minority still controls much of the power and wealth.
 The Government has begun reorganizing and redesigning the educational, hous-
 ing, and health-care systems to benefit all racial and ethnic groups in society more
 equally, but until the work is completed, de facto discrimination continues in all
 these areas.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1994 South African society continued to promote an
 increasingly modern concept of people with disabilities as a self-empowered minority
 whose civil rights must be protected. This approach is reflected most notably in the
 Interim Constitution and Bill of Fundamental Rights which includes disability as
 a basis for nondiscrimination.
 During the April 26-29 election, the IEC made extensive efforts to enable disabled
 citizens to vote, including the use of mobile polling stations.
 In 1986 the NP government incorporated architectural specifications into the Na-
 tional Building Code to ensure equal access to public buildings for the physically
 disabled. However, these have rarely been enforced and, until recently, public
 awareness of them was virtually nonexistent. The National Environmental Acces-
 sibility Program, an NGO whose affiliated members comprise disabled consumer as
 well as service-provider groups, has now established a presence in all nine provinces
 in order to lobby for compliance with the regulations and to sue offending property
 owners, as necessary.
 According to the LHR, the public service staff code health requirements are un-
 necessarily invasive and attempt to identify the limitations ofjob applicants rather
 than their capabilities. These requirements equate disability with ill health and
 thus reinforce the notion that disabled people are unhealthy and unfit for work.
 Government personnel managers have used the wide discretion allowed them to pre-
 vent disabled people from gaining permanent employment status. At year's end, the
 government department responsible for the Reconstruction and Development Pro-
 gram (RDP) and Disabled People South Africa, the principal South African civil
 rights organization of people with disabilities, were negotiating the appointment of
 
 
 243
 an official to ensure that all RDP projects take account of the needs of disabled
 South Africans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Relations Act entitles all workers in the
 private sector to join labor unions of their choosing. There are 201 registered trade
 unions and 47 unregistered unions with a total approximate membership of over
 3 million workers or 45 percent o? the employed, economically active population.
 Probably more than half of all union members are black.
 At year's end, the Government was drafting a new labor relations act designed
 to consolidate and simplify South African labor law. Currently, South African labor
 relations are characterized by a patchwork of labor law and practice largely de-
 signed to inhibit or restrict trade union organization and activity. The result is an
 uneven and sometimes volatile labor relations climate in which trade unions must
 rely as much on their own organization and strength as on their legal rights to
 achieve their objectives.
 The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is formally allied with
 the ANC and the South African Communist Party. Over 60 COSATU members
 serve in national and provincial legislatures and administrations. The second larg-
 est trade union federation, the National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), while
 officially independent of any political grouping, has close ties with the PAC and the
 Azanian People's Organization.
 In 1979 South Africa extended the right to strike, long enjoyed by white workers,
 to most private sector workers, regardless of race. Since then, work stoppages trig-
 gered by collective bargaining disputes, and occasionally by political issues, have
 been commonplace. Current South African labor law does not prohibit an employer
 from firing a striking employee. However, the Industrial Court has reinstated such
 fired employees when it considered the firing to be an unfair labor practice. In this
 regard, the Court has held that striking employees cannot be fired if the strike is
 a valid part of the collective bargaining process.
 Historically, public sector employees have been legally rohibited from striking.
 The 1993 passage of a Public Sector Labor Relations Act, while clarifying the collec-
 tive bargaining process for public sector employees, still sharply restricts strike ac-
 tivity. COSA    as     ed that the Government's definition of "essential services"
 is too broad, and that it is specifically designed to block public sector strike activity.
 The Government does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international
 labor organizations.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) readmitted South Africa in 1994.
 On'rgially an ILO member since its 1919 inception, South Africa withdrew from the
 ILCY in 1964. Following the reinstatement, the International Labor Conference re-
 sinded its declaration concerning action against apartheid.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law defines and protects
 the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Government does not interfere
 directly with union organizing in the private sector and generally has not inter-
 vened in the collective bargaining process. In spite of recent le gslative changes, col-
 lective bargaining still does not apply to farm workers and domestic workers. Ex-
 cluded from the statutory system of industrial councils until 1979, black unions de-
 veloped a collective bargaining tradition of their own. Unassisted by statute the
 unions established collective bargaining relations at the enterprise level on the tasis
 of majority representation.
 Since 1979 black unions have made increasing use of South Africa's industrial
 council or centralized collective bargaining system.
 The 1993 emergence of tripartite negotiating forums, such as the National Man-
 power Commission (NMC) and the National Economic Forum (NEF), strengthened
 trade union influence over labor and economic plicy. The planned merger of the
 NMC and NEF into the National Economic Develo ment and Labor Council
 (NEDLC) will solidify the role of trade unions as sociapartners with government
 and business in the formation of economic and labor policy.
 South African law prohibits discrimination by private sector employers against
 union members and organizers, and disputes over recognition are relatively few. Pri-
 vate mediation services are available and have been voluntarily resorted to by man-
 agement and black trade unions to resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Relations
 Act established the Industrial Court to rule in labor/management disputes. The
 most common complaints filed with the Court concern dismissals, followed by unfair
 labor practices. A Labor Court of Appeals oversees the Industrial Court and can
 overturn its decisions. The Public Sector Labor Relations Act (PSLRA), which was
 passed in 1993, clarifies dispute resolution within the public sector by recognizing
 the right of unions to orgamze and bargain collectively in the public sector, by es-
 
 
 244
 tablishing dispute resolution procedures, and by recognizing the right of public sec-
 tor workers not performing essential services to strike in some circumstances.
 South Africa has no export processimg zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal under the
 Interim Constitution and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Basic Conditions of Employ-
 ment Act prohibits the employment of minors under age 15 in most industries,
 shops, and offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors under 16 from work-
 ing underground. There is no restriction, however, on the age at which a person
 may work in agriculture. Use of child labor on farms, often inlharsh and dangerous
 conditions, is common. Use of child labor in the informal economy is also common-
 place. The Ministries of Labor and Justice are weak and reactive in enforcing exist-
 ing child labor laws, depending largely on complaints made against specific employ-
 ers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated minimum wage
 in South Africa. Instead, the Labor Relations Act provides a mechanism for negotia-
 tions between labor and management to set minimum wage standards, industry by
 industry. At present, over 100 industries covering most nonagricultural workers
 come under the provisions of the Act.
 Most industries have a standard workweek of 46 hours, as well as vacation and
 sick leave. Overtime is voluntary and limited to 10 hours a week. The law does not
 mandate a 24-hour rest break.
 Attention to health and safety issues has increased in recent years but is still in-
 adequate. The state-funded National Occupational and Safety Association claims the
 number of workers suffering disabling injuries annually has dropped significantly
 over the last decade. Nevertheless, injury and death at the workplace, especially in
 heavy manufacturing and mining, is still common. In 1993 after a campaign of sev-
 eral years' duration by the National Union of Mineworkers, the Government agreed
 to establish a Mines Commission of Inquiry to investigate South Africa's mining
 health and safety laws. The Commission began work in 1994 but had not reported
 its finmdings and recommendations by year's end.
 South African occupational health and safety laws, while requiring an employer
 not to p lace employees at unreasonable risk, do not give employees the right to re-
 move themselves from a hazardous job. An employee's decision to leave a hazardous
 worksite could possibly lead to dismissal but more probably would result in discipli-
 nary action. South African occupational health and safety laws do provide protection
 for workers who report or file complaints against unsafe working conditions. Such
 workers cannot be dismissed or reduced in rank or salary.
