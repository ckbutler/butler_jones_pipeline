 SPAIN
 The government of Spain has moved to bring democracy to
 Spain and to guarantee a broad spectrum of democratic
 freedoms. New laws and decrees providing freedom of
 assembly and other political activity have been approved;
 judicial safeguards have been strengthened; press censor-
 ship has been greatly restricted and all political prison-
 ers have been released. The government, at some risk,
 has also taken vigorous measures to halt previous police
 excesses and to ensure that law enforcement is impartial.
 Terrorists of both right and left have been arrested
 and prosecuted.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including

 cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 While Spain's welfare system is not as extensive as
 that of some other European countries, most Spaniards
 receive sufficient food, shelter and health care.
 Spanish economic development has brought about an
 enormous improvement in the general standard of living
 over the past 15 years. A far-reaching tax reform
 program, backed by the government, is already underway.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 There is no restriction on religion or the exercise of
 these freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, foreign
 travel or emigration. A small number of accused and
 convicted terrorists were released from prison last
 spring on condition they leave Spain. At least some
 subsequently returned to Spain, without being re-arrested.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The first free democratic elections in 40 years took
 place June 15, 1977, and the Parliament elected then
 is now working on a new democratic constitution.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The government has shown no antipathy to independent
 outside investigations of Spain's human. rights
 situation.
