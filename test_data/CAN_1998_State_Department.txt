 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment and an independent judiciary. Citizens periodically choose their xepresenta-
 tives in free and fair multiparty elections.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and municipal police
 forces. The armed forces !rove no role in. domestic law enforcement except in na-
 tional emergencies. Laws requiring the security forces to respect human rights are
 strictiy observed, and violators are punished by the courts.
 Canada has a highly developed, market-based economic system. Laws extensively
 protect the well-being of workers and provide for workers' freedom of association.
 The Government generally respected the humanrights of its citizens. However,
 there were occasional complaints in some areas, primarily regarding discrimination
 against aboriginals, the disabled, and women. The Constitution and laws provide
 
 
 1195
 
 avenues for legal redress of such complaints. The Government continues to take se-
 rious steps to address private acts of violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The controversy over the 1995 shooting death of an aboriginal activist at
 Ipperwash, Ontario closed with the criminal conviction of a provincial police officer.
 In April the officer was found guilty of criminal negligence causing death in the
 shooting and was sentenced to 2 years' community service under the supervision of
 a parole officer (see Section 5). Activists no longer occupy the provincial park, and
 in June the Federal Government agreed to return the neighboring military base to
 tribal control. As part of the agreement, the Federal Government is to return lands
 appropriated in 1942 under the War Measures Act and provide funds for community
 development and environmental cleanup.
 A controversy arose in March after a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) offi-
 cer shot and killed a woman and her child on the Tsuu T'ina reservation. The officer
 was called to assist a tribal police officer and a social worker, who had responded
 to a domestic dispute, and fired in response to high-powered rifle fire -from the
 woman. The province of Alberta, where the incident took place, commissioned an
 independent investigation of the incident by the British Columbia Attorney Gen-
 eral's office that was reviewed further by a respected former Alberta judge. The re-
 views determined that criminal charges against the officer were not warranted. A
 separate judicial inquiry is underway with the participation of the reservation rep-
 resentatives to determine the causes of the incident and how future incidents could
 be prevented.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the Government observes the prohibition in
 practice.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. Reported inadequacies at Toronto's Don
 jail are being addressed; however, inmates continue to complain of overcrowding, in-
 adequate facilities, and inhuman conditions.
 In May the Chief of the Armed Forces announced an investigation into credible
 allegations made by a number of women serving in the armed forces that, in pre-
 vious years, they had been subjected to rape, sexual harassment, and sexual abuse
 by their military colleagues. Armed forces officials established a special hot line to
 receive additional information and reports addressing such conduct and information
 concerning those involved in any possible concealment of such offenses.
 Toronto police initiated a review of procedures following public complaints about
 the use of strip searches and body cavity searches in several routine arrests. The
 review determined that there were isolated incidents of unnecessary searches. To-
 ronto police determined that the policy was still appropriate, but that officers re-
 quired additional training in determining when such searches are appropriate.
 Public controversy also arose concerning the use by police of pepper spray to
 break up demonstrations that blocked the access road to the November 1997 Asia
 Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Vancouver, (see Sections l.d.
 and 2.a.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.
 At the November 1997 leaders meeting of APEC in Vancouver, police arrested
 small numbers of demonstrators, including free speech advocates, but subsequently
 released them without charge (see Sections 1.c. and 2.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process and vigorously enforces the right to
 a fair trial.
 The court system is divided into federal and provincial courts, which handle both
 civil and criminal matters. The highest federal court is the Supreme Court, which
 exercises general appellate jurisdiction and advises on constitutional matters. The
 judicial system is based on English common law at the federal level as well as in
 most provinces; in the province of Quebec, it is derived from the Napoleonic Code.
 Throughout Canada judges are appointed. In criminal trials, the law provides for
 a presumption of innocence, and the right to a public trial, to counsel (free for
 
 
 1196
 
 indigents), and to appeal. The prosecution also can appeal in certain limited cir-
 cumstances.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 generally prohibits such practices, government authorities scrupulously respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 Journalists are occasionally banned from reporting some specific details of court
 cases until a trial is concluded, and these restrictions, adopted to ensure the defend-
 ant's right to a fair trial, enjoy wide popular support. Some restrictions on the
 media are imposed by provincial-level film censorship, broadcasters' voluntary codes
 curbing graphic violence, and laws against hate literature and pornography. The
 Human Rights Act prohibits repeated communications by telephone that expose a
 person or group to hatred or contempt. Human rights groups are exploring the pos-
 sibility of extending this prohibition to the Internet.
 The RCMP Public Complaints Commission opened an investigation on police be-
 havior while providing security to the APEC leaders meeting in Vancouver in No-
 vember 1997. RCMP officers used pepper spray to break up small crowds of protest-
 ers who had blocked the only access road to a meeting site and had torn down a
 security barricade. The protesters allege that their right to free speech was in-
 fringed by the RCMP's actions. The protesters also allege that the arrest of one of
 their leaders prior to the meeting on charges (which were subsequently dropped) of
 temporarily deafening an RCMP officer with a loudspeaker were a further violation
 of the arrested individual's rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The
 investigation was suspended in December after allegations that the process had be-
 come tainted by political interference from the Solicitor General. The protesters al-
 lege that the-RCMP acted under orders from the Prime Minister's office (see Sec-
 tions 1.c. and 1.d.).
 In November police in Vancouver clubbed and arrested several demonstrators pro-
 testing a visit by the Prime Minister. Those arrested were released without charge.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides-for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and extends first
 asylum. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 refugee status. Canada, is a resettlement country, and as of September the Govern-
 ment projected granting 24,100 to 32,300 claims for refugee status in 1998.
 In 1997 almost 1,000 Czech Roma claimed refugee status. The Government con-
 tinues to process these claims for refugee status and has not forcibly deported any
 of the asylum claimants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 A significant body of opinion in the province of Quebec, represented by the party
 that governed the province throughout 1998, continues to maintain that Quebec has
 the right to withdraw from the confederation if that decision proves to be the demo-
 cratically expressed will of the people of Quebec, and that it is only Quebeckers who
 have the right to make this decision. In response to a reference on the question from
 the Federai Government, the Supreme Court ruled in August that a unilateral dec-
 laration of independence by Quebec would be illegal under Canadian and inter-
 nationa law.' HoWever, the Court added that the Federal Government and other
 provinces would be obliged to negotiate Quebec's separation in good faith if a clear
 majority of Quebeckers voted to separate on the basis of a cleariy phrased question.
 Women play a significant role in government and politics, although they are
 underrepresented in proportion to their percentag e  fe population. In the Par-
 
 
 1197
 
 liament, 61 of 301 members in the House of Commons are women. Eight women
 were appointed to the 30-person Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, sex-
 ual orientation, or mental or physical disability. These rights are generally re-
 spected in practice, but there are occasional charges of discrimination in this multi-
 cultural society.
 Afflrmative action (employment equity) legislation continues to be a topic of na-
 tional and provincial debate. In June the Human Rights Tribunal ruled that the
 Federal Government must pay back wages to predominantly women workers in un-
 derpaid positions. The Government appealed this decision, focusing on the methodol-
 ogy used to calculate wages owed, but not arguing against the principle of pay eq-
 uity. Since 1995 the Federal Government has had employment equity laws in place,
 and regulations have been promulgated covering federal employees in all but the se-
 curity and defense services.
 Women.-The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse. The
 health and economic costs of violence against women have been estimated to be $2.7
 billion (Can $4.2 billion) annually. Nevertheless, according to Statistics Canada, 3
 in 10 women currently or previously married or living in a common-law relationship
 have experienced at least I incident of physical or sexual violence.
 The Criminal Code prohibits criminal harassment (stalking) and makes it punish-
 able by imprisonment for up to 5 years. Changes to the law in 1997 strengthened
 tools to combat child prostitution and prohibited female genital mutilation, which
 is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical
 and psychological health.  "
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions. The law prohibits sexual harassment, and the Government enforces this pro-
 vision.
 Women have marriage and property rights equal to those of men. Women head
 over 85 percent of single parent households. Child support reforms in 1996 and 1997
 include: Amendments to the income tax act to eliminate child support from the cus-
 todial parent's taxable income and the tax deduction available to payers of child
 support; amendments to the divorce act to establish fairer and more consistent child
 support payments; new measures to strengthen enforcement; and an enhanced in-
 come supplement for lower-income families.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Federal and provincial regulations protect children from abuse, overwork, and
 discrimination and duly penalize perpetrators of such offenses. There is no societal
 pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. Nevertheless, the
 Government continues to receive numerous complaints regarding discrimination
 against disabled persons and has instituted programs to discourage such discrimina-
 tion. Disabled persons are underrepresented in the work force; they make up 2.7
 percent of the federally regulated private sector work force, but those capable of
 working total 6.5 percent of the population. The law mandates access to buildings
 for persons with disabilities, and for the most part the Government enforces these
 provisions.
 Changes to the Human Rights Act and Criminal Code came into force on June
 30. The Human Rights Act now requires employers and service providers to accom-
 modate special needs of people with disabilities, provided that it does not constitute
 an undue hardship. The Criminal Code now makes the sexual exploitation of per-
 sons with disabilities in situations of dependency a criminal offense.
 In June the province of Alberta announced that it would compensate the nearly
 surviving 500 persons who were sterilized without their consent under a policy
 aimed at residents of mental institutions. More than 2,000 Albertans were sterilized
 between 1928 and 1972 under the Alberta Sterilization Act, which was repealed in
 June 1972.
 
 
 1198
 
 Indigenous People.-The treatment of Canada's aboriginal people continued to be
 one of the most important human rights issues facing the country. Disputes over
 land claims, self-government, treaty rights, taxation, duty-free imports, fishing and
 hunting rights, and alleged harassment by police continued to be sources of tension
 on reserves. Aboriginal people remain underrepresented in the work force, over-
 represented on welfare rolls and in prison populations, and more susceptible to sui-
 cide and poverty than other population groups.
 In January the Federal Government issued its response to the 1996 report of the
 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples intended to restore aboriginal communities
 and restructure their relationship with the Federal Government. The Minister of In-
 dian Affairs read an official "Statement of Reconciliation" that apologized for past
 wrongs committed by the Federal Government. The Aboriginal Action Plan also in-
 cludes a commitment of approximately $400 million (Can $600 million) for aborigi-
 nal programs. The program was developed in consultation with aboriginal political
 leadership but was criticized by some groups for not going far enough to ameliorate
 past rights violations.
 Treaty rights for aboriginals are recognized in the Constitution, and the Govern-
 ment is currently engaged in discussions with aboriginal groups on various treaty
 issues. The Federal Government is involved in self-government negotiations with
 over 350 First Nations. Aboriginal rights in British Columbia (B.C.) are poorly de-
 fined. Since becoming a province of Canada in 1871, B.C. has not concluded treaties
 with any of the aboriginal groups that occupied the area prior to the arrival of set-
 tiers. While many of the province's more than 100 aboriginal groups have outstand-
 ing claims for land, self-government, and other rights, none of these have been set-
 tled in the form of treaties. In December 1997, the Supreme Court strengthened the
 legal position of aboriginal groups in B.C. In what is known as the Delgamuukw
 decision, the Court found that the provincial and federal governments must consult
 with aboriginal groups on all land use and resource decisions affecting areas
 claimed as tribal homelands. This ruling gave aboriginal groups a significant say
 in the use of vast tracts of the province even though title to the land never has been
 established formally in treaties.
 In August the Federal and British Columbia provincial Governments concluded a
 treaty with the Nisga'a people who live in northwestern B.C. Although the treaty
 is not considered to be a precedent for the more than 50 other sets of negotiations
 under way in B.C., the treaty represents a significant development. If ratified and
 implemented, the treaty would result in the Nisga'a receiving control over 2,020
 square kilometers (765 square miles) of tribal lands, a cash settlement, fishing and
 timber cutting rights, and certain rights to limited self-government. At the same
 time, the treaty eventually would end a range of special tax breaks and other bene-
 fits available under the status quo. To take effect, the treaty must be ratified by
 three parties: the Nisga'a people; the Federal Government; and the provincial legis-
 lature. While the Nisga'a people have ratified the agreement and ratification by the
 federal Parliament appears certain, there is political debate within British Columbia
 over the treaty. The degree of self-government to be afforded the Nisga'a and the
 rights of nonaboriginal people residing on tribal lands are among the major points
 of contention, and various parties have raised legal challenges. While some opposi-
 tion political parties oppose the treaty, provincial parliamentary ratification is ex-
 pected early in 1999.
 The Stoney reserve west of Calgary gave up control of its finances to federal In-
 dian Affairs officials in 1997, following widespread allegations of political corruption,
 financial mismanagement, sexual assaults, and abuses connected with social service
 agencies. Seven deaths in the second half of 1997 allegedly linked to poor conditions
 on the reservation helped spur what aboriginal groups considered to be delayed fed-
 eral intervention, despite early calls for help from the community. Independent au-
 diting of the reserve's finances, accompanied by cost-cutting measures, has restored
 the reserve to fiscal health. Full financial control is scheduled to be returned to the
 Stoney tribal council in April 1999, contingent on additional reforms and the intro-
 duction of a code of ethics and accountability. The Stoney are 1 of 12 aboriginal re-
 serves where federal officials have assumed control as interim managers.
 Quebec's Indian peoples remain overwhelmingly opposed to separation from Can-
 ada and deeply distrust the separatist government of the province. Despite the Que-
 bec Prime Minister's recent overtures to the leaders of the Cree and Inuit nations,
 surveys indicate that most of Quebec's 60,000 Indians would favor partition of the
 province in the event of Quebec's separation from Canada. Indian leaders maintain
 that a sovereign Quebec would treat Indians as another ethnic minority instead of
 as sovereign nations within the territory of the province. To address these senti-
 ments and respond to a summer highway blockade and a pending lawsuit, in Octo-
 ber the Quebec government agreed with the Cree and Mohawk tribes to initiate ne-
 
 
 1199
 gotiations regarding longstanding grievances over timber resources, public rights of
 way on tribal lands, and management of development in the James Bay region.
 The province of New Brunswick signed interim forestry agreements with several
 First Nations throughout the province giving native groups the right to harvest
 wood from Crown land pending a longer-term arrangement. The agreement became
 necessary following a court decision in 1997 granting exclusive harvesting rights to
 aboriginals, which was subsequently overturned on appeal. The federal Supreme
 Court refused to hear the case and it is now awaiting reconsideration in New Bruns-
 wick courts.
 Religious Minorities.-The League for Human Rights of B'nai Brith in Canada
 (headquartered in Toronto) reported that there were 212 incidents of anti-Semitic
 harassment in 1997-a decrease of 13 percent from 1996. The League attributed the
 decline to law enforcement actions taken against hate movements and antihate
 movement education program. The League noted concern about the continued
 growth of anti-Semitic activity on the Internet.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The narrow defeat of the 1995 Quebec sov-
 ereignty referendum left unresolved the concerns of French-speaking Quebeckers
 about their minority status in Canada, while sharpening the concerns of English-
 speaking Quebeckers about their minority status. The separatist Parti Quebecois
 provincial government of Quebec has stated that it would hold another sovereignty
 referendum only under "winning conditions." The Supreme Court ruled in August
 that a unilateral declaration of independence would be illegal, but that the Federal
 Government and other provinces would be obligated to negotiate Quebec's separa-
 tion if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted to change their relationship with Can-
 ada on the basis of a clearly phrased referendum question (see Section 3).
 Some English-speaking and native groups in Quebec assert the right to keep parts
 of Quebec in Canada in the event that Quebec declares independence. Despite per-
 sonal meetings and other overtures by Quebec's Prime Minister to Indians and the
 English-speaking community, both groups remain distrustful of the separatist gov-
 ernment of Quebec. Many members of these communities fear that their rights
 would be infringed by a sovereign Quebec.
 The Constitution protects the linguistic and cultural rights of minorities. Despite
 Canada's federal policy of bilingualism, English speakers in Quebec and French
 speakers in other parts of Canada generally must live and work in the language
 of the majority.
 In Quebec language laws restrict access to English-language, publicly funded
 schools through grade 11 to children whose parents were educated in English in
 Canada and to short-term residents. Local law stipulates that French is the working
 language of most businesses and must be predominant in bilingual commercial sign-
 age.
 The English-speaking minority of Quebec, representing 9 percent of the popu-
 lation of the province and 16 percent of the population of the city of Montreal, con-
 tinues to protest restrictions placed on English-language use. In 1997 the Quebec
 provincial government reestablished a French language inspection office that had
 been abolished in 1993. English speakers also expressed concerns over the closing
 of several English-language health services and limitations on public schooling in
 their language, as well as over indications that the Prime Minister of Quebec was
 continuing to discourage a return to the use of bilingual signs in major chain.
 Provinces other than Quebec often lack adequate French-language schooling,
 which is of concern to local Francophones, although French-language schools and
 French immersion programs are reported to be thriving in all three prairie prov-
 inces.
 In October 1997, the-Province of Nova Scotia and the Halifax school board an-
 nounced that they would cooperate in implementing the 75 recommendations men-
 tioned in an August 1997 report on the causes of racial violence at 2 high schools
 in the Cole Harbor area of Halifax. Racial tensions subsequently have eased follow-
 ing the school board's implementation of a "zero tolerance" policy toward disruptive
 behavior.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Labor
 Code protects these rights for all employees under federal jurisdiction, while provin-
 cial legislation protects all other organized workers.
 Trade unions are independent of the government. Of the civilian labor force, 29.5
 percent is unionized.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1200
 
 All workers have the right to strike, except for those in the public sector who pro-
 vide essential services. The law prohibits employer retribution against strikers and
 union leaders, and the Government enforces this provision.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 (except for some police) and the private sectors have the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively. While the law protects collective bargaining, there are limitations,
 which vary from province to province, for some public sector workers providing es-
 sential services.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and requires employers to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. There are effective mechanisms for resolving com-
 plaints and obtaining redress.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor, including that per-
 formed by children, is illegal, and there were no known violations.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.--Child
 labor legislation varies from province to province. The Federal Government does not
 employ youths under 17 years of age while school is in session. Most provinces pro-
 hibit children under age 15 or 16 from working without parental consent, at night,
 or in any hazardous employment. These prohibitions are effectively enforced
 through inspections conducted by the federal and provincial labor ministries. Edu-
 cation is compulsory through age 15 nationwide.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohi-
 bition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Standard work hours vary from province to
 province, but in all the limit is 40 or 48 a week, with at least 24 hours of rest.
 Minimum wage rates are set in each province and territory, and range from $3.25
 to $4.65 (Can $5.00 to Can $7.15) per hour. Ontario and Alberta have a minimum
 wage rate for youths lower than their respective minimums for adult 'workers. A
 family whose only employed member earns the minimum wage would be considered
 below the poverty line.
 Federal law provides safety and health standards for employees under federal ju-
 risdiction, while provincial and territorial legislation provides for all other employ-
 ees. Federal and provincial labor departments monitor and enforce these standards.
 Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reason-
 able cause" to refuse dangerous work.
