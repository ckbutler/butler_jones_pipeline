 JORDAN
 Jordan is a constitutional monarchy in which the King maintains
 a monopoly of power. He appoints and dismisses the Government
 .and is the primary focus of foreign policy. The Prime Minister
 and the cabinet exercise considerable responsibility in the
 formulation of domestic and economic policy. The parliament
 was dissolved in 1976, but an appointed Senate and National
 Consultative Council have limited powers to debate laws placed
 before them and make recommendations to the cabinet.
 A participant in the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967, Jordan
 gave shelter to large numbers of Palestinian refugees in each
 of those years. Tensions between the refugees and native
 Trans-Jordanians boiled over in the disturbances of 1970.
 Since these violent incidents, Jordan has remained under
 martial law, which it justifies by pointing out the political
 instability of its neighboring countries and the generally
 tense situation in the region. The Government resorts to
 authoritarian measures sparingly, however.
 Disfavored by geography, a small population, unfavorable
 climate, and lack of arable land and natural resources, Jordan
 is a poor country. During the past 20 years, however, Jordan
 has made substantial economic progress-while preserving
 domestic stability in a politically volatile region.
 While adversely affected by the 1973 and subsequent oil price
 increases, Jordan has benefited from the general increase in
 wealth in the region. When security conditions in Beirut
 deteriorated in 1975, Amman, with its agreeable climate,
 relatively good communications, transportation connections,
 stable government, and free market economic policies, began to
 play an increasingly important role as one of several Middle
 East regional economic and commercial centers. Spurred by the
 influx of repatriated earnings of Jordanians working abroad and
 payments from Arab states following the November 1978 Baghdad
 summit, the Amman area in particular experienced an economic
 boom. The foundations of this prosperity, however, are
 fragile, and economic growth slowed somewhat during 1982.
 Nevertheless, barring the unforeseen, economic conditions for
 1983 should remain reasonably good. Jordan's economy continued
 to experience real growth during 1982.
 The Government of Jordan is committed to free enterprise,
 although it holds important shares in a number of basic
 industries and exercises controls on some goods in the market
 place, especially foodstuffs. Economic stability and
 development have been enhanced by the fact that Palestinian
 refugees have been given Jordanian citizenship and participate
 fully in Jordan's economic and social life and the limited
 political life which is permi..ted in Jordan. Despite
 occasional tensions between Palestinian-Jordanians and the East
 Bank Trans-Jordanians, relations between the two communities
 are generally good. Jordanians, who are primarily Sunni
 Muslims, respect Islamic civil, legal, and social
 institutions. The small but important Christian minority is
 not discriminated against except at the very top of the armed
 forces, and on the whole enjoys equal status and economic
 well-being. The King plays an important role in assuring
 religious harmony in Jordan.
 While qualified by the martial law currently in force in
 Jordan, the Constitution affirms the integrity of the person in
 
 
 1179
 Jordan. There are no reports of killings for political
 motives, disappearances, torture, or cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Invasion of the home is
 prohibited except by court-issued warrant. Under martial law,
 persons may be detained without trial or charge for indefinite
 periods; however, limited use is made of this power. The civil
 and military courts provide for public trial and appeal.
 Martial law courts provide the same guarantees as do the civil
 courts, but in practice do not grant bail. subject to
 limitations by the monarchy, citizens have civil and political
 rights under the Constitution. Political parties, however,
 have been banned since 1957 and the parliament was dissolved in
 1976. Elections are freely held for most municipal and local
 councils and mayors. Freedom of the press and speech are
 guaranteed by the Constitution, subject to some self-censorship
 and government influence. Freedom of religion, movement, and
 assembly are also constitutionally guaranteed.
 There have been no significant changes in human rights in
 Jordan in the past year. The most significant long term trend
 is that signified by the absence of democratic participation in
 the political process at the national level since the
 dissolution of the elected parliament in 1976.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 No politically-motivated killings have been recorded in 1982.
 There have been a very few attempted or actual killings in the
 past few years for political purposes. The perpetrators in the
 few identified cases may have been acting under the orders or
 influence of a foreign government. The Jordanian Government
 actively tries to prevent such acts.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances reported in Jordan in 1982. The
 Jordanian security forces do not secretly abduct people;
 however, they are empowered to detain people without trial. In
 such cases, family members can obtain information on the
 whereabouts of their relatives. There is no evidence to
 indicate that persons so detained have died as a result of
 torture, cruelty, negligence, or summary execution.
 c. Torture
 No constitutional provision or law specifically forbids
 torture. Law 23 of 1953, which regulates the treatment of
 prisoners, guarantees that they receive medical treatment and
 provides for inspection of prisons in order to ensure that
 healthful conditions prevail in them. No accusations of
 torture are known to have been made in 1982. There is no
 evidence that Jordanian Governmental authorities condone or
 practice torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners.
 Within the constraints of a limited budget, prisons are Spartan
 but adequate in the context of Jordanian society. Prison
 conditions are not designed to be intentionally degrading. A
 new, highly modern complex is currently being built to replace
 the old, inadequate, and cramped Mahatta prison in Amman.
 There appears to be no discrimination according to religion or
 social class in the treatment of prisoners.
 Jordan has recently taken steps to improve the treatment of
 juvenile offenders, establishing a new juvenile detention
 center. Juveniles have been moved to the new center from the
 Mahatta rehabilitation and correction center, where they had
 
 
 1180
 been housed with adults, because of lack of space in
 then-existing juvenile detention centers. Subject to fiscal
 constraints, Jordan is planning to institute a system of
 special juvenile courts.
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan. Jordanian law
 provides for trial in absentia of Arabs who sell West Bank
 property to the "enemy' (defined as an Israeli citizen,
 resident of Israel, or Israeli corporation). The maximum
 penalty for this crime is death. Although such trials have
 occurred, and the death penalty has been pronounced, it has
 never been carried out.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Legally, Jordan has been in a state of war since 1948. Martial
 law, most recently reaffirmed in 1973, has been in force for
 much of that period. Under martial law, the executive
 authority has the power to detain persons indefinitely without
 trial. Jordanian security forces use the detention provisions
 of martial law to detain individuals suspected of cross-border
 infiltration or security threats. A detained person may take
 his dase to the High Court of Justice (an administrative
 tribunal) to argue that his detention on security grounds is
 not justified. Jordanian martial law does not provide for
 habeas corpus.
 In recent years the Government has made limited use of its
 detention powers. While exact statistics are unavailable, it
 appears that several dozen people were detained in 1982 for
 periods ranging from a few days to several months.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both civilian and military courts operate under normal
 Jordanian law. In addition, martial law courts are established
 under the provisions of martial law. The jurisdiction of the
 systems is clearly defined in law, with the martial law court
 responsible for crimes such as espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black
 marketeering, and security offenses. The civil courts retain
 jurisdiction for most other crimes. Military courts prosecute
 military personnel for all categories of offenses.
 Although the martial law court is not bound to observe normal
 rules of evidence or procedure, such generally accepted legal
 practices have been observed during the last five years.
 Accordingly, defendents before this court are represented by
 legal counsel and may cross-examine witnesses. The three
 judges currently sitting on the martial law court all have
 legal education, as does the military prosecutor. Sentences of
 the martial law court may not be appealed, but they must be
 ratified by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Martial Law
 Governor. The Prime Minister has the authority to increase,
 reduce, or annul any martial law sentence.  in practice, cases
 are reviewed for fairness by his legal advisor and/or the
 Minister of Justice before the Prime Minister makes a
 decision. In practice, individuals charged in martial law
 courts are not granted bail. Martial law trials in general are
 handled more expeditiously than civilian trials.
 Under the civilian court system, cases must be reviewed by the
 Public Prosecutor's office within 24 hours of an arrest. The
 prosecutor must determine that sufficient evidence exists to
 warrant prosecuting the accused. The prosecutor then turns the
 case over to the Attorney General's office, which prepares a
 formal bill of indictment if satisfied that enough evidence
 exists to warrant prosecution.
 At all stages in this process, the accused is entitled to be
 represented by legal counsel. Many defendents are unaware of
 this right and fail to exercise it. The Jordanian legal system
 
 
 1181
 provides that if the accused cannot obtain legal counsel for
 himself, the state, through the bar association, will assign a
 lawyer to defend him. An established appeals process exists
 for felony cases.
 Jordan upholds the principle that judges should be independent
 and insulated from political pressures. Judges are selected by
 a board composed of members of the High Court of Justice, a
 representative of the Attorney General's office, and the Under
 Secretary of Justice (the senior civil servant in the Ministry)
 and must prove competance in the law through a written
 examination. Judges may only be removed from office on grounds
 of specific transgression of the law and after a hearing before
 a disciplinary board (made up of a membership similar to that
 of the selection panel).
 In addition to martial and civil law, Muslim traditional
 religious law (Sharia) plays an important role in Jordanian
 life and society. Rights of inheritance and child custody,
 conduct between neighbors, and women's personal status are
 largely adjudicated according to the Sharia law. In accordance
 with Muslim tradition, polygamy is permitted, though not widely
 practiced. A man may divorce by unilateral repudiation. A
 specified inheritance system exists under the Sharia and is
 applied in Jordan.
 A separate Sharia court system exists to resolve disputes
 between Muslim parties in cases dealing with subjects such as
 divorce, alimony, and inheritances.  Christian religious courts
 handle similar cases between Christians. Cases between
 individuals of differing religions are handled by the civilian
 court system.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authorities is
 against the law and no reported cases have occurred. Search
 and arrest require warrants except in cases of hot pursuit.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1952 Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press
 within certain limits defined by law. In fact, Jordanians
 express their opinions freely in private and, to a much more
 limited extent, in print. The radio and television systems in
 Jordan are state-controlled. Private newspapers and
 periodicals (which are all subject to Government influence)
 practice a form of self-censorship on important national
 issues. Low-key media criticism of the Government's domestic
 policies occurs occasionally. The press generally reflects the
 Government's position on major foreign policy and security
 issues. Newspapers have been closed down for varying periods
 in the past for printing articles of which the Government
 strongly disapproved and journalists have been warned about
 comments which may be considered critical of some groups or
 interests. One new economic magazine was closed in 1982 for
 reporting political topics in violation of its license.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available, although
 subject to infrequent censorship. Salacious and pornographic
 materials are banned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Jordanians are free to associate as they choose, except in
 political organizations. Persons who demonstrate without first
 obtaining a permit are liable to be dispersed by the police;
 such permits are only rarely granted. Formally organized
 associations are subject to the laws of their establishment.
 Political parties are not permitted; charters of other
 organizations may not include political objectives.
 
 
 1182
 Jordanians may freely join labor unions and professional
 organizations. Such associations require government license,
 but these are granted routinely for groups which are not
 overtly political. These unions and associations are permitted
 to defend the interests of their members, and their officers
 are freely elected by the membership. Strikes are legal in
 Jordan; however, the Ministry of Labor must be notified in
 advance (14 days for small firms, 28 days for large firms).
 During this period, the Ministry attempts to arbitrate. If
 these efforts fail, employees may strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is followed by the great majority of
 .Jordanians. The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship, and
 persecution or harassment of the Christian minority (about five
 percent of the population) is against Jordanian law as well as
 government policy and practice. The only actual restraint on
 the Christian religion is a prohibition against proselytizing
 among Muslims. There appears to be little difference between
 adherents of the religions in social or economic status.
 Nevertheless, some tensions do exist between the Islamic and
 Christian communities. Christians are represented in the
 Government and military roughly in proportion to their share of
 the population, although traditionally the most senior
 positions are reserved for Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country (with the exception of certain
 defined and limited military zones) is unobstructed. With a
 few exceptions, the Government does not restrict travel abroad
 by its nationals.
 Women and minor children are required to have written consent
 of their husband, father, or oldest male relative in order to
 obtain a passport. Such persons travelling alone generally are
 presumed by the authorities to have written permission to
 travel.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem, especially since
 the 1948 and 1967 influxes of Palestinians made homeless as a
 result of the Arab-Israeli wars. Jordan has committed
 substantial resources to help resettle these refugees and
 ameliorate their plight. According to the most recent United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency statistics, refugees and their
 descendants on the East Bank of the Jordan River now total
 approximately 930,000. This total does not include a large but
 undetermined number of other persons from the West Bank, the
 Gaza Strip, or the State of Israel, who have settled in Jordan
 since 1948. All of these people have been granted Jordanian
 citizenship and have the unrestricted right to live, work, and
 own property in Jordan.
 There are no restrictions on these or any other citizens who
 might wish to return to Jordan after a period spent residing
 abroad. Jordanians who have travelled or studied abroad,
 especially in Eastern European or communist countries, often
 have their passports taken by the General Intelligence
 Directorate upon their return to Jordan. They may regain their
 passports after answering questions about their activities and
 contacts abroad.
 Jordan allows the movement of peoples between the East Bank and
 Israeli-occupied territories. In doing so, the Government has
 reminded its critics that such travel is humanitarian, helps
 maintain West Bank Arab ties, and is economically advantageous
 to the inhabitants of the occupied territories.
 Jordan recognizes the right of asylum even in cases which have
 resulted in strained relations with neighboring states.
 
 
 1183
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Jordan is a monarchy in which the King enjoys a monopoly of
 ultimate political power. Governments are formed and dissolved
 at his command and he remains the ultimate arbiter of policy.
 Organized political parties are not permitted in Jordan. The
 Communist Party is prohibited by law. According to the 1952
 Constitution, there should be an appointed Senate and a Chamber
 of Deputies elected by universal suffrage by secret ballot.
 The Chamber of Deputies was dissolved in 1976. Parliamentary
 elections have been postponed indefinitely, for the Government
 believes that both East and West Bank must be represented in
 any future parliament and it is presently impossible to conduct
 Jordanian elections in the occupied West Bank.
 In 1978, King Hussein established a National Consultative
 Council with appointed members selected to represent the
 various geographic regions and social, ethnic, religious, and
 tribal groups in the country. Legislation is submitted by the
 Executive to the Council for review; it does not have veto
 power, but often discusses policies actively and sometimes
 heatedly. Thus, it has provided a forum for dialogue between
 the Government and the public. The Government generally has
 not promulgated legislation with which the Council
 disagreement; for example, the Council has had substantive
 input into the recently approved five-year plan and the new
 income tax law.
 The councils of most cities and towns in Jordan are elected by
 popular vote. King Hussein has taken steps to increase the
 participation of women in the political process, appointing the
 first female Cabinet Minister in Jordan's history in 1979.
 Four of the 75 members of the National Consultative Council are
 women.
 A certificate of good conduct is required for government
 employment and for work or study abroad. It may be requested
 by an employer. The certificate is provided or refused by the
 General Intelligence Directorate based on review of their files
 and, at times, following an interview with the individual
 concerned.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from private and
 international human rights organizations. Amnesty
 International has made inquiries about specific cases from time
 to time, focusing on detention without trial and on the death
 penalty. The Jordanian Lawyers' Professional Association has
 formed a Human Rights Committee, but it is not active. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross maintains an office in
 Amman. The representative visits all prisons and detention
 facilities on a regular basis. lie is allowed confidential
 access to all prisoners and detainees. The Government is
 responsive to his recommendations.
 The Government has played an active role in the UN Human Rights
 Commission at Geneva. Jordan is a party to the Covenant on
 Political and Civil Rights and the Covenant on Economic and
 Social Rights.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 From 1976 through 1980, Jordan's economy grew at an average
 annual real rate of close to nine percent. During 1981,
 economic growth slowed slightly, averaging about seven percent,
 a still healthy and noteworthy rate given the world-wide
 economic slowdown in that year. Per capita GNP in 1981 rose to
 approximately $1,875. Some 17 percent of the population is
 considered to receive income below the absolute poverty level.
 
 
 1184
 Services, including government, continue to contribute nearly
 2/3 of national output, followed by the industrial and
 construction sectors (30 percent) and agriculture (six
 percent). Jordan remains heavily dependent upon external aid
 with 51 percent of its 1982 budgetary resources coming from
 external resources. Inflation in 1981 was around 12 percent,
 only slightly higher than the 1980 level.
 Jordan's domestic work force of nearly 450,000 is close to full
 employment. Significant numbers of foreign workers, estimated
 at some 120,000, have entered the country in recent years.
 Such unemployment as exists is structural, with the highest
 incidence in the skilled, management, and professional
 categories. While more than 300,000 Jordanians continue to
 work abroad, principally in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, these
 states have reduced the number of Jordanian passport holders
 admitted to work in the past several years, and current outflow
 is estimated at 5,000 - 6,000 workers annually. Women are 14
 percent of the labor force and are expected soon to be 20
 percent. Increasing female employment and possible reduction
 of Jordanians working abroad could raise unemployment in the
 coming years.
 Remittances from Jordanian workers abroad exceeded one billion
 dollars in 1981. Since 1979, Jordan has received large annual
 transfer payments from the oil-rich Arab states. In 1981,
 these,-payments totalled $1.2 billion. Foreign aid coupled with
 the high level of worker remittances'enabled Jordan to cover
 its $2.4 billion balance of trade deficit in 1981 and still
 post an overall balance of payments surplus of $50 million.
 Under its 1981-1985 five-year economic and social development
 plan, the Government of Jordan plans to commit $10 billion to
 economic and social development projects. The plan emphasizes
 development of industry and mining, particularly the
 development of Jordan's phosphate and fertilizer industries,
 the extraction of potash for export from the Dead Sea waters,
 and the doubling of cement output by 1985.
 Jordan's current population, based on the preliminary result of
 the 1979 national census and a growth rate of 3.8 percent per
 year, is now approximately 2,362,700. Of this, about 60
 percent live in corporate city limits, but some 20 percent more
 live in suburban and semi-urban areas, thus making Jordan a
 highly urbanized society. The national rate of population
 increase is at least 3.6 percent, with an additional .2 percent
 increase from net immigration. The population below the age of
 15 is 51.8 percent, resulting in a high dependency ratio. Life
 expectancy at birth is currently 59.8 years for males and 63.6
 years for females. Infant mortality is estimated to be 70 per
 1,000 live births.
 Health facilities in Jordan are widely distributed, but with a
 wide disparity in the quality of services, which range from the
 most modern facilities in the cities to rural village clinics
 which infrequently have a doctor in attendance. At present,
 there is one doctor for each 961 Jordanians. By 1986 there is
 expected to be one doctor for each 568 residents. In 1981,
 there were 16.7 hospital beds for each 10,000 inhabitants, but
 a planned increase will raise this to 25.8 per 10,000 by 1986.
 Although education is compulsory through the ninth grade,
 primary school (1-6) enrollment rates drop from 97 percent to
 about 82 percent in preparatory (7-9) and only 58 percent in
 secondary (10-12) schools. Adult literacy has increased
 dramatically over the past 20 years. At present, some 65.4
 percent of all those above the age of 15 are literate, with
 males at 71.1 percent and females at over 55 percent. For ages
 15-19, however, illiteracy is only 7.6 percent, with 2.4
 percent of males and 13.3 percent of females.
 Some 66 percent of all Jordanians have piped-in water supplies;
 this percentage will increase dramatically in the next five
 
 
 1185
 years as water projects now under way are completed. Only 35.7
 percent of rural families have piped-in water, however, and
 provisions of piped water to most of the remaining rural
 families, representing 10-15 percent of all Jordanians, is
 prohibitively expensive. While chlorination and treatment of
 some water is carried out in Jordan, water is not always safe
 and incidents of contamination are common.
 Jordanian citizens are accorded equal treatment in social
 services like health, education, and some subsidized
 foodstuffs. Despite limited natural resources and a rapidly
 growing population, the standard of living in Jordan has risen
 during the past decade. While most citizens have benefitted in
 some ways from this growth, gains have been unevenly
 distributed. The Government recognizes this problem and is
 attempting to deal with it by such measures as improving income
 tax collection and imposing heavy taxes on luxury imports.
 Jordan's essentially free enterprise economy has created many
 opportunities for its people, regardless of religious, ethnic,
 or tribal background. There is no evidence of
 government-encouraged discrimination. Women in Jordan, as in
 other Arab states, are traditionally disfavored economically
 and, to a lesser extent, educationally. The status of women is
 a result of traditional Islamic social values which fix women
 in the role of housewife and mother. This pattern is
 changing. The Government encourages more female participation
 in the labor force. It is noteworthy that the present Minister
 of Social Affairs is a woman.
