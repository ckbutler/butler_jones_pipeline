 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) has been ruled since 1981
 by General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba, who came to power in a
 bloodless coup and, with backing from the military, has since
 exercised virtually full political control. In 1986 General
 Kolingba was elected unopposed to a 6-year term as President,
 and a Constitution was adopted establishing a National
 Assembly. The following year the Central African Democratic
 Assembly Party (RDC) was formed as the sole legal party. Faced
 with growing public discontent, General Kolingba announced in
 April 1991 that other parties legally registered by the
 Ministry of the Interior could compete with the RDC for
 legislative elections in March 1992 and for presidential
 elections in November 1992. At year's end there were 15
 registered parties, and the Government continued to move slowly
 toward political liberalization.
 The Ministry of Defense controls military and national
 gendarmerie forces totaling 4,000 troops. These forces share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian police
 force under the'Ministry of Public Security, which is
 responsible for normal police functions. President Kolingba
 controls a 1,400-man presidential security force led by 150
 French advisers.
 The C.A.R. is a landlocked and sparsely populated country, most
 of whose inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture. The
 principal agricultural exports are coffee, cotton, timber, and
 tobacco. Since 1982 the Government has tried to implement
 economic structural reforms in cooperation with international
 donors. However, with continuing unfavorable world economic
 trends and corruption and mismanagement in government, progress
 has remaixied elusive. Also, workers became increasingly
 discontented in 1991, and labor unrest throughout the year
 paralyzed the economy and public administration.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1991. Maor abuses were
 the use of arbitrary arrest and detention against political
 opponents and workers; repeated interference in the judicial
 process; and continued abridgements of freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and worker rights. More than 30 union members
 were arrested in July for essentially peaceful political
 activity. After holding dissident General Francois Rozize in
 detention for 2 years without charge or trial, the Government
 brought him and four of his associates--all of whom were
 forcibly repatriated from Benin in 1989--to trial in
 September. The High Court of Justice acquitted Bozize and two
 others, but the Ministry of Justice refused to release them;
 the President subsequently pardoned them on December 1, along
 with all other political detainees. The Government's tactics
 against the growing opposition, including slow progress toward
 convening a national conference, undercut the progress made in
 political party format-ion and the Government's promise of free
 elections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity, of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings, but
 there were a few reports of extrajudicial killing. In January
 a government official announced that Pierre Wanga and three
 
 
 62
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 others had been beaten while in police custody in 1990 and that
 Wanga had died as a result. Although the Government announced
 that there would be a complete investigation and that suspects
 had been arrested, there was no subsequent announcement
 concerning judicial action.
 In August government soldiers killed an unknown number of
 youths under questionable circumstances at a coffee storage
 warehouse outside of Bangui. Officials of the Central African
 League of Human Rights claimed the youths were students
 protesting government policy towards the opposition on property
 owned by a presidential ally; the Government charged that the
 youths were part of a bandit gang. During a demonstration on
 May 6 in Bangui against governmental education policy, a
 secondary school student was fatally injured by a tear gas
 canister fired by security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and defines sanctions for
 those found guilty of physical abuse. Nonetheless, reports of
 police beatings of criminal suspects continue as in the case of
 Pierre Wanga.
 The physical conditions of Central African prisons are hard.
 One pro-opposition group reported that some of its members were
 jailed for up to 6 months from September 1990 to March 1991 in
 cramped cells without toilet facilities and only such food and
 other necessities as families could provide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1991 the Government used detention to suppress political
 activity, holding labor activists and opposition supporters for
 protracted periods on charges of being a threat to state
 security.
 Persons detained in nonpolitical cases must be brought before a
 magistrate within 96 hours. In practice, inefficient judicial
 procedures often caused this deadline to be exceeded. Further,
 according to credible reports, three persons have been held in
 Ngaragba prison without charge or trial since March 1990,
 reportedly because they failed to pay a bribe to a local
 official. No system of bail exists, but sometimes persons are
 released on their own recognizance.
 Political detainees may be held without charge for up to 2
 months. The Government consistently ignored this limit or held
 persons without trial for long periods while preparing the
 State's case against them. The Government does not reveal the
 number of political detainees it holds. The number of those
 arrested and detained tended to rise during strikes and
 opposition activities. In January more than 50 prisoners were
 known to be in detention. In April the Government announced
 the release of 48 political prisoners, including Ruth Rolland
 and Phillipe Bolibo, both incarcerated for political opposition
 to the regime since 1989. Following a general amnesty on
 September 1, the total number of detainees dwindled to 11. At
 
 
 63
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 year's end, there were no known political detainees or
 prisoners being held.
 Other political detainees released during the year included 21
 members of the Coordinating Committee for the Convocation of a
 National Conference (CCCCN). They were released in March after
 6-months' incarceration on the grounds of insufficient evidence
 to warrant trial. The CCCCN group, which had called for a
 national conference independent of the ruling RDC congress, had
 been arrested in September and October 1990 for attending an
 opposition meeting.
 Among those detained in 1991 were Ro4er Poguy Magineaud, a
 businessman, detained and questioned for 7 days in May about
 his alleged political activities. During the first week of
 July, at least 25 people, including three prominent labor
 leaders, were arrested during strikes in Bangui (see Section
 6.a.). Most were detained following confrontations between
 police and workers at the labor union headquarters in Bangui
 and released on July 11, but the three union leaders were
 charged with inciting violence and given suspended sentences of
 1 to 3 years on July 31.
 Concerned relatives and opposition leaders claimed that several
 youths were arrested fodlowing the demonstrations on May 4-6
 and flown to Birao in the furthest northeast corner of the
 country. Criminals and "undesirables" have been exiled there
 in the past. The authorities -acknowledged that government
 policy directs the police-to arrest youths not possessing valid
 identification and work papers, but they did not provide
 specific information on this case.
 Exile is not permitted in law and is not practiced by the
 Government, but a number of political opponents have left the
 country to avoid government sanctions. Among well-known
 self-exiles are Rodolph Iddi-Lala, currently in Togo, and Ange
 Patasse, currently in Paris.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary consists of regular and military courts, with the
 Supreme Court at the apex- In common criminal cases, the
 accused have a right to legal counsel at all stages, trials are
 public, and defendants have a right to be present. These
 safeguards generally apply in practice. Insufficient
 resources, however, including inadequate training of officials,
 sometimes hampers administration of the law, and persistent
 traditional beliefs regarding witchcraft and sorcery sometimes
 overcome strict adherence to formal rules of evidence.
 In political cases, the Government frequently interferes, and
 the procedural safeguards specified above do not apply.
 Created in 1988 to try. "political" prisoners, the High Court of
 Justice heard its first cases in September 1991, those of
 General Francois Bozize and four codefendants. Political
 prisoners ire generally defined in the Central African
 Constitution as persons who threaten state security. In a
 public trial, the Court unconditionally acquitted Bozize and
 two others of political charges but remanded the two
 codefendants to criminal court for further action. Although
 the High Court of Justice is constitutionally defined as the
 court of last appeal for political cases, the Minister of
 Justice refused to accept the verdict and immediately
 instituted new legal steps against Bozize and the two others.
 A three-judge panel subsequently decided that the three must
 
 
 64
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 stand trial again before the Supreme Court on charges stemming
 from an alleged 1982 coup attempt. On December 1, the
 President pardoned Bozize and his codefendants. Some local
 human rights activists criticized the State's arbitrary
 handling of the Bozize case, including the sudden Presidential
 pardon and complained about official media coverage of the
 affair.
 The Ministry of Justice took several other steps to check
 growing judicial independence, creating the post of Inspector
 General charged with oversight of justice, removing the
 President of the Supreme Court, and replacing the president of
 a tribunal which had ruled to annul a government decision to
 suspend six union federations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of
 the home without a warrant in civil and criminal cases, but in
 political and security cases, police are legally permitted to
 search private property without written authorization and do so
 in practice. The Government maintains a close watch on
 citizens who are suspected of opposing it. To combat local
 crime, including robbery and assault, the RDC political party
 created citizens' action groups called vigilance committees in
 1988, consisting of 20 volunteers per neighborhood. These
 committees have sometimes intruded on police responsibilities
 but in general were less active in 1991.
 Civil servants were not required to join the ruling RDC, but
 there were strong social pressures to join, particularly in the
 case of those holding high-level positions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of private citizens to speak publicly about political
 developments or to criticize the Government is circumscribed,
 although most people feel free to comment privately on
 political affairs. The National Assembly provides a
 constitutional forum for public discussion of government
 policies, but since the Assembly is traditionally obedient to
 the executive, few citizens follow Assembly debates or approach
 their representatives with concerns.
 Newspapers, radio, and television are all government owned and
 controlled. Unswerving in their support for President Kolingba
 and the RDC, the media do not provide objective coverage of
 important national political developments, including the Bozize
 trial (see Section l.e.). Despite a September pledge, the
 Government did not give opposition parties equal access to the
 national media. Domestic news favored upbeat stories and
 noncontroversial events, although the newspapers' awareness
 campaign about the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
 through articles and advertisements addressed a major domestic
 health problem. Opposition parties and groups published and
 distributed manifestos, policy statements, and analyses of
 events, most often in typewritten and photocopied form.
 Reporting on international news was selective and avoided
 events that might have embarrassed friendly foreign
 governments, but radio broadcasts, over the course of the year,
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 did cover reform of other single-party systems in Africa and
 Eastern Europe.
 Academic freedom is limited: striking teachers in 1990 and
 1991 were important actors in maintaining pressures for
 political reform.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly is constitutionally guaranteed but is
 restricted in practice. Several labor and student
 demonstrations were broken up by police, and the Ministry of
 the Interior banned a political rally in September.
 The Government addressed demands from a cross-section of
 Central African society for a national conference to discuss
 current political problems and the future po-litical structure
 of the C.A.R. by promising in September to schedule for
 February 1992 a "national debate." No date had been set by
 year's end. The RDC declared in October 1990 its intention to
 pursue democratization within a single-party system. However,
 in April 1991"President Kolingba suddenly announced to the RDC
 leadership that he would permit multipartyism. In June the
 National Assembly drafted a law governing the formation,
 activities, and dissolution of political parties, and on July 4
 the law governing multiparty politics and setting standards for
 party registration took effect. This-statute required
 submission of a dossier for each application containing
 information about the party leadership; police records of the
 party leaders; the statutes, program, and by-laws of the party;
 and the location of the party headquarters. If the Minister of
 Territorial Administration does not reject the application
 within 45 days, the party automatically becomes a legal
 entity. At the end of 1991, there were 15 registered parties,
 including the RDC.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A variety of religious communities are active in. the country,
 including traditional Afsican faiths, Christian denominations,
 and Muslims. -Most religious organizations.and missionary
 groups are free to, proselytize and worship. However, religious
 groups must register with the Government, and any group whose
 behavior is. considered political in nature remains subject to
 sanctions.
 The Government's 1986 ban on the activities of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses community remained in effect on the grounds that this
 group's refusal to serve in the army or salute the flag
 constituted defiance of government authority. The 1989 ban on
 the activities of the Union of Evangelical Pentecostal Churches
 for "irresponsible conduct" remained in effect at the end of
 1991.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Ttavel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 While people were generally free to move within the country,
 police and other government officials at checkpoints along
 major roads sometimes harassed travelers unwilling or unable to
 pay bribes. The Government took steps in September to reduce
 this practice. The Government recognizes the right of
 voluntary travel and repatriation, and financial and
 educational constraints, rather than government controls, act
 
 
 66
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 to restrict most foreign travel and emigration. There were no
 known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 By the end of 1991, more than 10,000 Sudanese had fled civil
 strife in Sudan to seek safe haven in the remote southeastern
 corner of the C.A.R. In collaboration with U.N. agencies and
 private relief groups, the C.A.R. National Commission for
 Refugees is providing assistance to this group. The C.A.R.
 also continued to host 1,600 Chadian refugees, and at year's
 end the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was still
 interviewing those who may choose to repatriate voluntarily.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional guarantees, citizens were not able to
 change their government by democratic means in 1991, and until
 April only those candidates selected by the ruling RDC were
 legally permitted to contest National Assembly elections, next
 due in March 1992. The power and prerogatives of the
 President, who ran uncontested in the 1986 presidential
 elections, and the RDC were not subject to change from below.
 President Kolingba allowed his Cabinet some latitude in
 day-to-day government administration, but frequent cabinet
 changes minimized the effect of broadening this small base of
 executive decisionmaking. The President carefully controls
 political change, and it remained to be seen at year's end if
 the advent of multipartyism will bring true democratic reform.
 The Constitution grants the National Apsembly the authority to
 debate and vote on bills proposed by the executive and to
 initiate legislation of its own. Assembly sessions sometimes
 involved criticism of the Government, and Deputies, who have
 immunity, did occasionally modify the language of proposed
 legislation. However, the Assembly rejected no legislation
 proposed by the executive in 1991. Its initial rejection of
 the Government's 1991 budget drew stern rebukes from the
 executive branch and was promptly overturned. It is rare that
 deputies cast negative votes or abstain.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of citizens
 in the political process. In practice, women have generally
 not been appointed to high level ministerial positions in the
 Government. Of 88 ministers in Kolingba Governments over 10
 years, only 2 have been women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In September the National Assembly agreed to the creation of a
 National Human Rights Commission empowered to operate under the
 direct authority of the President. This appointive CQmmission
 draws members from a wide array of professions, and its goals
 and effectiveness remained unclear at year's end. In June
 human rights lawyer Nicholas Tiangaye also created the Central
 African Human Rights League (LCDH), a nongovernmental
 organization with the declared goals of publicizing human
 rights violations in Central Africa, implementing the
 international human rights accords to which C.A.R. is a party,
 lobbying the Government for improved human rights practices,
 and pleading individual cases of human rights abuses before the
 courts. The LCDH had some effect in calling attention to
 official abuses (see Section l.a.)..
 
 
 67
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 In the past,-the Government has permitted representatives of
 Amnesty International to visit Bangui on request, and the
 regional representative of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) visited Bangui in July.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before the.
 law without regard to wealth, race, or religion. In practice,
 however, some minorities receive unequal treatment. The
 forest-dwelling Bayaka, commonly known as Pygmies, are subject
 to discrimination and exploitation which the Government has
 done little to correct. Pygmies are often hired by villagers
 to work for wages much lower than those received by other
 groups.. Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peuhl) herders, are
 sometimes resented by other Central Africans for their
 affluence and thus are singled out for harassment, such as
 police shakedowns. There are few Muslims in senior government
 posts.
 There are about 80 ethnic groups in the C.A.R., and President
 Kolingba has stressed the desirability of an ethnic balance .in
 his Cabinet. In practice, however, preference for high
 government and military positions has been given to members of
 his Yakoma ethnic group, which forms less than 5 percent of the.-
 population. During a special May session of the RDC, the
 Government came under public criticism for its ethnic
 imbalance. President Kolingba responded by replacing some
 Yakoma In his Cabinet but not really addressingthe imbalance.
 Although the Constitution affirms- the equality of. all citizens,
 women are not in fact treated as equal to men economically,
 socially, or politically. Although progress has been made in
 narrowing gender differences, gaps exist not only between men
 and women, but between urban and rural women as well. Between
 60 and 70 percent of urban women go to primary school while
 only 10 to 20 percent of their rural counterparts do so. At
 the primary level, females and males have equal access to
 education, but a majority of females drops out at ages 14 and
 15 due to social pressure to marry and bear children. At the
 university of Bangui, the s6le university in the C.A.R., only
 20 percent of the students are female.
 Traditional patterns persist to a considerable degree. In most
 rural areas, where subsistence farming is the chief livelihood,
 women continue traditional child-raising and heavy farming
 tasks while men frequently seek paid phyiical day labor or
 await hard-to-find salaried work. Some women work in commerce
 as market vendors.
 There is no precise data on the percentage of women in the wage
 labor force, but in cities many educated women find work
 outside the traditional patterns. Some hold clerical
 positions; and a small but growing number are establishing
 private businesses or moving into the upper ranks of the
 Government. In 1990 women were accepted for training in the
 gendarmerie for the first time; the first of these graduated in
 1991.
 Polygamy is legal, although fewer women accept the practice
 than in the past. A prospective husband must indicate at the
 time of the marriage contract whether he intends to take
 further wives.
 
 
 68
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it
 is difficult to gauge the extent of the problem, which is
 seldom officially reported. Some women believe that spousal
 abuse of women has diminished from past levels. The Ministry
 of Justice hears few cases of spouse abuse, although the issue
 does come up during divorce trials or in civil suits for
 damages. Cases of domestic violence occasionally appear in the
 press. Some women reportedly tolerate abuse in order to retain
 a measure of financial security for themselves and their
 children. Neither the Government nor the women's division of
 the RDC publicly addressed this issue in 1991.
 The Penal Code forbids blows or injuries to children under the
 age of 15. Current interpretation of the Code includes
 prohibition of female genital mutilation. Nonetheless, the
 force of tradition tolerates this practice in rural areas and,
 to a lesser degree, in Bangui, although many urban dwellers
 consider it an outdated custom. However, it was praised in a
 press article on the national mothers' day as a national
 tradition.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 During 1991 the Government continued to harass or inhibit labor
 activity by banning some organizations and by arresting labor
 leaders.
 A 1988 law, which entered into force on May 1, 1989, grants all
 workers the right of association. Since then teachers, civil
 servants, postal workers, and employees in the few large
 factories and businesses in Bangui have organized.
 Approximately 60 locals exist in Bangui alone. The Ministry of
 the Interior has also recognized 10 sectoral unions in Bangui
 and 24 provincial unions, all of which belong to the main labor
 federation, the Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC).
 Recognition requirements are pro forma. For most of 1991,
 there was only one main labor federation, the USTC, plus six
 public sector federations.
 The 1988 law provides for the right to strike but only after
 rigorous requirements are met, that is, after a government
 mediator and an arbitration council both fail to achieve
 agreement between labor and management. There were a number of
 strikes in 1991 which did not follow these requirements,
 including a general strike protesting salary arrears,
 mistreatment of unionists, and lack of political reform. The
 general strike, which began in May, led to a July 3
 confrontation between strikers and security forces at union
 headquarters. The military occupied the headquarters and
 arrested more than 30 unionists. The following day, security
 agents arrested three union leaders leaving the July 4
 reception at the U.S. Ambassador's residence.
 Starting in June, the Government made efforts to dissolve the
 six public sector labor federations for striking illegally for
 political reasons. When the courts refused to dissolve the
 federations, President Kolingba removed the magistrates
 involved. On July 6, Prime Minister Edouard Franck announced
 the suspension of the six public sector union federations until
 October 31 and ordered the private sector to return to work.
 Although these actions ended the general strike and the public
 sector unions were forced to hold meetings clandestinely, most
 teachers and public health workers remained on strike through
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 the end of the year. The-Government lifted the public sector
 union suspension on November 1.
 Most detained unionists were eventually released, but several
 received prison terms. USTC Secretary General Theophile
 Sonny-Cole was sentenced to a year in prison without actually
 being arrested or appearing in court. While he remained at
 liberty at the-end of the year, the Government appeared to
 retain the option of imposing the sentence at any time. The
 other unionists who were sentenced received either suspended
 terms or were freed under the amnesty which President Kolingba
 declared on September 1 to mark his 10th year in power.
 Toward the end of the year, the Government announced that it
 supported the principle of "multiunionism" as a logical
 corollary to multipartyism. By year's end, three smaller
 federations had been. formed, but none initially demonstrated
 any provincial or sectoral union support. Credible evidence
 suggested that one, the Confederation of Central African Trade
 Unions (CSTCj, was mostly government funded; another, the
 National Confederation of Central African Workers (CNTC) is the
 resurrected version. of a previously government-controlled
 federation, headed by a retired union rival of Sonny-Cole's.
 The 1988 law allows unions to affiliate with international
 labor organizations. Both the USTC and the CNTC maintain
 international labor contacts.
 In April 1989, the U.S. Government announced the suspension of
 tariff preferences accorded the C.A.R. because of the
 Government's failure to respect worker rights. The C.A.R.
 formally requested reinstatement in September 19r89,. and its
 request was granted in February 1991, before the most recent
 round of arrests and the suspension of labor federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The C.A.R. has little industry or large-scale agriculture. The
 1988 union law, which-applies throughout the country, accords
 trade unions full legal status, including the right to own
 property and to sue in court. However, it does not
 specifically state that trade unions may engage in collective
 bargaining. Mechanisms for collective bargaining contained in
 the 1961 Labor Code have in the past been used occasionally in
 the private sector during the periods in which union activity
 was not banned. Collective bargaining, though failing to bring
 a lasting settlement, took place in 1991 in both the private
 and public sectors. Employers are expressly forbidden from
 discriminating against workers on the basis of union membership
 or union activity, and infractions can result in the assessment
 of legal damage. Several of the USTC unions claim, however,
 that the Government has itself discriminated against their
 members, notably through the arbitrary reassignment of teachers
 and civil servants to provincial posts. There are no export
 processing zones in the C.A.R.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is specifically prohibited by the 1961 Labor Code,
 and no reports were made of forced labor in 1991.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law, but this provision is only loosely enforced by the
 
 
 70
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice, the role of
 children in the labor force is generally limited to helping the
 family in traditional subsistence farming or retailing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government, and a social
 security system exists for private industry. The lowest
 minimum wage assures a family the basic necessities but is
 barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of living. In
 July the Government announced that it would raise the minimum
 monthly industrial wage by 40 percent, and the minimum
 agricultural wage by less than 25 percent a day. These
 increases had not yet taken effect by year's end. Much labor
 is performed outside the wage and social security system,
 especially by self-employed farmers in the large subsistence
 agricultural sector. The law sets maximum working hours for
 government employees and most people in the private sector at
 40 hours per week. Domestic employees may work up to 55 hours
 per week. There are elso general laws on health and safety
 standards in the workplace, but they are neither precisely
 defined nor actively enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Civil Service.
