 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a multiparty parliamentary democracy in which constitutional pow-
 ers are shared between the elected Head of State, President Antonio Mascarenhas
 Monteiro, an independent, the Head of Government, Prime Minister Carlos Walmon
 Veiga, and his party, the Movement for Democracy (MPD). The MPD has an abso-
 lute majority in the National Assembly. The principal opposition party, the African
 Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV), held power in a one-party state
 from independence in 1975 until 1991. The judiciary is independent, but there were
 accusations that courts manipulate trial schedules for political reasons.
 The Government controls the police, which has primary responsibility for mainte-
 nance of law and order. Some members of the police committed human rights
 abuses.
 Cape Verde has a market-based economy but little industry and few exploitable
 natural resources. Based on 1996 data, the per capita income is $1,087. The country
 has a long history of economically driven emigration, primarily to Western Europe
 and the United States, and receipts from Cape Verdeans abroad remain an impor-
 tant source of income. Even in years of optimum rainfall, the country can produce
 food for only 25 percent of the population, resulting in heavy reliance on inter-
 national food ald.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 while in principle the law and the judiciary provide means to deal with isolated in-
 stances of abuse, in practice the Government has not held accountable police officers
 who were credibly accused of human rights abuses. There were several credible
 cases of police abuse, including beatings, of citizens detained on suspicion of crimi-
 nal activity. The judicial system is overburdened, and lengthy delays in  s are
 common. There were instances of media self-censorship, and the authorities some-
 times prosecuted for criminal libel journalists and editors who published material
 critical of government officials. The Government denied licenses to two new inde-
 pendent radio stations. Violence and discrimination against women and mistreat-
 ment of children continued to be serious problems. Although the Government sup-
 ported legislation to ameliorate these problems, it failed to adopt, implement, and
 enforce policies designed to address the most critical challenges.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 58
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, but there were a number of credible re-
 ports that police mistreat citizens in custody, including beating citizens detained on
 suspicion of criminal activity. While mechanisms for investigating citizen complaints
 of police brutality exist in theory, in practice these mechanisms are not effective.
 Severe overcrowding of prisons is a problem, and they do not meet minimum
 inenainal standards.
 The Government permits both formal visits by human rights monitors to prisons
 and routine visits to individual prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that a suspect must
 be charged before a judge within 48 hours of arrest. Police may not make arrests
 without a court order unless a person is caught in the act of committing a felony.
 In exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, authorities may
 detain a person without charge for up to 5 days. These laws generally are observed
 in practice.
 IFebruary police briefly detained two union leaders had organized a demonstra-
 tion to protest the reorganization of the state news services. The unionists later
 were absolved following a court decision that upheld their constitutional right of free
 assembly.
 The Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare for trial in state security cases
 and may detain persons until trial or or a period not to exceed 1 year. There is
 a functioning system of bail.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a judiciary inde-
 pendent of the executive branch, and the Government respects this provision in
 practice. However, in July a group of jurists, in an open letter to the Minister of
 Justice, accused the courts of "selectively" delaying or accelerating trial dates for
 "non-judicial," that is, political reasons. Four citizens associated with the opposition
 PAlO V, who were arrested for church desecration in 1996 and later ordered released
 for lack of evidence pending trial, still have not had a trial scheduled despite their
 repeated pleas that their case either be heard or that charges against them be
 dropped.
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and the regional courts.
 Of the five Supreme Court judges, one is appointed by the President, one by the
 National Assembly, and three by the High Council of Magistrates. Judges are inde-
 pendent and may not belong to a political party.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial. Defendants are presumed
 to be innocent; they have the right to public, nonjury trial; to counsel; to present
 wituesses; and to appeal verdicts. Free counsel is provided for the indigent. Regional
 courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural areas. The Ministry of
 Justice and Labor appoints local judges, who are usually prominent local citizens.
 Defendants may appeal regional court decisions to the Supreme Court.
 The judiciary generally provides due process rights. However, there are serious
 delays owing to understaffing, and the right to an expeditious trial is constrained
 by a seriously overburdened judicial system. A backlog of cases routinely leads to
 trial delays of 6 months.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-oThe Constittion provides for the freedom to ex-
 press ideas by words, images, or any other means, and for freedom of the press
 without censorship. The Government generally respectod these freedoms in practice,
 and there is a substantial independent press. Nevertheless, there was continued
 criticism by independent political figures of the performance of the state-controlled
 television, radio, and print media for their failure to exercise vigorously their mon-
 itoring role in a multiparty system.
 Journalists are independent of government control and are not requlred to reveal
 their sources. However, self-censorship within the governmentcntrolled media, in-
 cluding the national television and radio networks as well as th e l t-owned news-
 paper Novo Jornal, influences media criticism of the Government. Under broadly in-
 terpreted criminal libel laws, the authorities frequently prosecuted and often con-
 victed and fined opposition newspaper editors and journalists who published articles
 critical of government officials.
 Government authorization is not needed to establish newspapers or other printed
 publications. Despite the broadly interpretsd criminal libel laws, there are no re-
 
 
 ports of independent media outlets having experienced direct pressure in their daily
 operations or business activities. The national radio station provides live broadcasts
 of National Assembly sessions.
 Government authorization is required to establish broadcast media. The Govern-
 ment denied ministerial authorization to two new independent radio stations, Radio
 Morabeza, owned by the opposition-controlled municipality of Sao Vicente, and
 Radio Commercial, owned by private investors, some of whom are associated with
 the opposition PAICV, and ordered them to cease broadcasting. (Another independ-
 ent station, the Roman Catholic Church-owned Radio Nova, continues to broadcast
 with ministerial authorization.) The National Assembly passed legislation that es-
 tablished a formal licensing mechanism for communications.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom, and this right is respected in
 practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by the authorities. Throughout the year, labor organizations, opposition
 political parties, civic action groups, and numerous others exercised this right with-
 out government interference or objection.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 separation of church and state. It also prohibits the state from imposing religious
 beliefs and practices. The Government respected these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides citizens with the right to travel and establish resi-
 dence without government restrictions.
 The Constitution provides for repatriation, and the Government respected this in
 practice.
 The Constitution provides for the right of asylum by refugees, and no violations
 were reported. According to the Human Rights Commission, credible media reports,
 and government officials, Nigerian citizens have been subject to discrimination by
 immigration authorities.
 The Government has not formulated specific policies regarding refugees or first
 asylum, and the issue of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Power was transferred peace-
 fully by the PAICV to the MPD following free and fair elections in 1991; a second
 general election in 1995 and municipal and presidential elections in 1996 also were
 jud ged free and fair by international observers.
 The Constitution provides for the separation of powers. Cabinet ministers are not
 required to be members of the National Assembly, but they are individually subject
 to confirmation by the President. Collectively, they must retain the support of a par-
 liamentary majority. The President may dismiss the Government with the approval
 of the Council of the Republic, which is composed of the President of the National
 Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Supreme Court, the Attorney
 General, the President of the Regional Affairs Council, and four private members.
 Referendums may be held under specified circumstances, but they may not chal-
 lenge individual political rights and liberties or the right of opposition parties to
 exist and function freely.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or
 members of minorities to vote or to participate in the political process. Women con-
 stitute 11 percent of the deputies elected to the National Assembly. There are two
 female cabinet ministers and three secretaries of state (junior ministers).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two private human rights groups, the National Commission of the
 Rights of Man and the Associacao ze Moniz. No major human rights organizations
 conducted investigations during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. However, the Government does not effectively enforce all
 its provisions, resulting in discrimination, particularly against women and children.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains com-
 mon. Victims rarely report crimes such as rape and spousal abuse to the police.
 Women's organizations are seeking legislation to establish a special family court to
 address crimes of domestic violence and abuse.
 
 
 60
 Despite constitutional prohibitions against sex discrimination and provisions for
 full equality, including equal pay for equal work, discrimination against women con-
 tinues. Women experience difficulties in obtaining certain types of employment. Al-
 though they are often paid less than men, they are making modest inroads in the
 professions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in inheritance, family,
 and custody matters. However, largely because of illiteracy, most women are un-
 aware of their rights. Women often are reluctant to seek redress of domestic dis-
 putes in the courts. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women alleges disparate
 treatment in inheritance matters, despite laws calling for equal rights.
 Children.-The Government prepared studies of social policy priorities and legal
 rights for children and adolescents, and the Cape Verdean Institute for Children
 was restructured in accordance with norms established in the Convention on the
 Rights of the Child to implement its obligations under the Convention. In education
 the Government's priorities include extending mandatory education to 6 years for
 all children, and there has been substantial progress toward this objective. In health
 the Government seeks to reduce infant mortality and disease, combat drug and alco-
 hol abuse, and discourage teenage pregnancy.
 Child abuse and mistreatment, sexual violence against children, and juvenile
 prostitution are continuing problems, exacerbated by chronic poverty, large un-
 planned families, and traditional high levels of emigration of adult men. In July the
 newspaper A Semana reported several cases of sexual abuse against children and
 adolescents. The newspaper observed that violations often occur in the victims' fami-
 lies and often are known by neighbors and relatives who prefer to keep silent. The
 inefficiencies of the judicial system make it difficult for the mass media and govern-
 ment institutions to address the problem.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution mandates "special protec-
 tion" for the aged and disabled, the Government does not mandate access to public
 buildings or services for the disabled. There are no official schools or trained teach-
 ers for the disabled, although several nongovernmental groups, including an associa-
 tion for the blind, are active.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that workers are legally
 free to form and to join unions without government authorization or restriction.
 There are two umbrella union associations: The Council of Free Labor Unions, com-
 osed of 11 unions with about 14,000 members, and the National Union of Cape
 er e orkers, formed by the former ruling party but operating independently
 composed of 14 unions with about 16,000 members. The Government does not inter-
 fere with the activities of these organizations, but both suffer from a shortage of
 funds.
 The Constitution provides union members with the right to strike, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this right. By law, an employer must reinstate a worker fired un-
 justy. However, there are no known instances of the law being tested.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and have ties with African and inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-he Constitution provides for
 the right to organize, to operate without hindrance, and to sign collective work con-
 tracts. Workers and management in the small private sector, as well as in the pub-
 lic sector, reach agreement through collective bargaining. However, as the country's
 largest employer, the Government continues to play the dominant role in setting
 wages aI does not fix wages for the private sector, but salary levels for civil servants
 provide the basis for wage negotiations in the private sector.
 A 1991 legislative decree bans antiunion discrimination by employers with fines
 for offenders. There were no reported cases of such discrimination.
 There are no expoert processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Lcbor.-orrced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and such practices
 are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 14 years. The law prohibits children under the age
 of 16 from working at night, more than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where
 toxic products are produced; but the Government rarely enforces the law. In practice
 the Ministry of Justice and Labor-enforces minimum age laws with limited success,
 and then only in the urban, formal sectors of the economy.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and such practices are
 not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wages to
 those paid to civil servants. For an entry level worker, this wage is approximately
 $110 (10,418 escudos) per month. The majority of jobs pay wages insufficient to pro-
 vide a worker and family a decent standard of living; therefore, most workers also
 rely on second jobs, extended family help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many domestic servants and agricultural laborers
 work longer hours.
 The Director General of Labor conducts periodic inspections to enforce proper
 labor practices and imposes fines on private enterprises that are not in conformity
 with the law. However, the Government does not systematically enforce labor laws,
 and much of the labor force does not enjoy their protection. Few industries employ
 heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents are rare.
 There is no legal provision for workers to remove themselves from unsafe working
 conditions without jeopardy to continued employment.
