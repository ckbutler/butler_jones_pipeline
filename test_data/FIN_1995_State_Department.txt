 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Puishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to fair public trial,
 and an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right. The President appoints
 Supreme Court justices, who in turn appoint the lower court judges.
 Local courts may conduct a trial behind closed doors in Juvenile, matrimonial, and
 guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or endanger the secu-
 rity of the state. In national security cases, the judge may withhold from the public
 any or all information pertaining to charges, verdicts, and sentences. The law pro-
 vides for sanctions against violators of such restrictions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their Gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women are fairly well represented in government. There are 67 in the 200-mem-
 ber Parliament, and 7 in the 18-member Cabinet. The current Government has
 made increasing the number of women in senior positions a priority, placing women
 at the top of key ministries, including Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Finance.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, Ian-
 guae, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Woren.-The law provides for stringent penalties for violence against women;
 this provision is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shel-
 ter Homes as well as the municipalities maintain such homes for female, male, and
 -child victims of violence in homes all over the country. The total number of shelter
 units is around 55. The annual number of calls to the police relating to domestic
 violence is no longer centrally compiled but is estimated at some 10,000 to 12,000.
 Shelter officials state that the figure is less than half of the number of actual inci-
 dents. There were 90 rape cases handled by the courts in 1991, the last year for
 which central statistics are available. Government experts note no evidence of a sig-
 
 
 857
 nificant change in the incidence of rape in recent years but say that as many as
 half of all rapes may go unreported.
 Two thorough epidemiological studies indicate that 5 to 8 percent of the retired
 population fall victim to violence. Studies show that the opening of a shelter home
 in an area brings cases of family violence out into the open. The concept of family
 violence in Finland includes negigence in care, psychological violence, and economic
 abuse.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and sponsors legisla-
 tion to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, or retirees.
 In 1985 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights law which mandates
 equal treatment for women in the workplace, including equal a for "comparable"
 jobs. In practie, comparable worth has not been implemented ecause of the dif-
 ficulty of establishing criteria, but the Government, employers, unions, and others
 continue to work on implementation plans. Women's average earnings are 80 per-
 cent of those of men, and women still tend to be segregated in lower-paying occupa-
 tions. While women have individually attained leadership positions in the private
 and public sectors, there are disproportionately fewer women in top management
 jobs. ndustry and finane, the labor movement, and some government ministries re-
 main male 0mated. Women are permitted to serve in the military. The Govern-
 ment's Equality Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations against sexual
 discrimination. Of the 85 complaints submitted to the Ombudsman between Janu-
 ary 1 and June 30, 61 had been processed, and a violation of the law was estab-
 lished in 24 cases.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, and the national consensus
 supporting children's rights is enshrined in law.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law has required since the 1970's that
 new public buildings be accessible to people with physical disabilities, many older
 buildings remain inaccessible to them. There is no such law for public transpor-
 tation, but each state subsidizes measures to improve accessibility to vehicles. Local
 governments maintain a free transport service that guarantees 18 free trips per
 month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided interpretation
 services ranging from 120 to 240 hours annually. The Government provides sub-
 sidized public housing to the severely disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Sami (Lapps), who constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent
 of the population, benefit from legal provisions protecting minority rights and cus-
 toms. Sami language and culture are supported financially by the Government. The
 Sami receive subsidies to enable them to continue their traditional lifestyle, which
 revolves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and civil rights and are
 able to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cultural interests. Swed-
 ish is established as a second official language; about 6 percent of the Sani popu-
 lation speaks Swedish as a native language.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the rights of trade
 unions to organize, assemble peacefully, and strike, and the Government respects
 these provisions. About 87 percent of the work force is organized. All unions are
 independent of the Government and political parties. The law grants public-sector
 employees the right to strike, with some exceptions for provision of essential serv-
 ices. In the first quarter of 1995 there were 33 strikes, of which all but 2 were wild-
 cat strikes.
 Trade unions freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are usually
 based on incomes policy agreements between employee and employer central orgam-
 zations and the Government. The law protects workers against antiunion discrimi-
 nation. Complaint resolution is governed by collective bargaining agreements as
 well as labor law, both of which are adequately enforced.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and this prohibition is honored in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Youths under 16 years of age can-
 not work more than 6 hours a day or at night, and education is compulsory for chil-
 dren from 7 to 16 years of age. The Labor Ministry enforces child labor regulations.
 There are virtually no complaints of exploitation of children in the work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage, but the
 law requires all employers-including nonunionized ones-to meet the minimum
 
 
 wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in the respective industrial sec-
 tor. These minimum wages generally afford a decent standard of living for workers
 and their families.
 The legal workweek consists of 5 days not exceeding 40 hours. Employees working
 in shifts or during the weekend are entitled to a 24-hour rest period during the
 week. The law is effectively enforced as a minimum, and many workers enjoy even
 stronger benefits through effectively enforced collective bargaining agreements.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Labor
 Ministry effectively enforces them. Workers can refuse dangerous work situations,
 without risk of penalty.
