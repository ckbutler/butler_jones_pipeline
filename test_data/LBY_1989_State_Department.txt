 LIB A*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a
 dictatorship ruled by Colonel Mulammar Al-Qadhafi. He is
 aided by extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees which
 operate at his behest. The governing principles of the
 society are expressed in Col. Qadhafi's "Green BookP rather
 than in a constitution. He has created a political system
 borrowing from pan-Islamic and pan-Arab sources and purporting
 to establish a "third way" superior to both capitalism and
 communism. In the past, he has used assassination as one way
 to control his enemies abroad; he controls enemies at home in
 a variety of summary and judicial proceedings which are
 employed wherever popular resistance exists. Ethnic
 minorities, such as Berbers, are tightly controlled.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of
 several elite military units, including Col. Qadhafi's
 personal bodyguards. The Revolutionary Committees and
 People's Committees also have security functions, designed to
 protect as well as monitor the populace. The result is
 multilayered, pervasive surveillance and control of individual
 activities. Although Col. Qadhafi announced his intention in
 1988 to strip the Revolutionary Committees of some of their
 prerogatives over internal security, there is little evidence
 that he has done so.
 Despite recent government efforts at privatization, the Libyan
 economy remains essentially state controlled and is based
 primarily on the country's rich oil resources, which-are its
 principal source of foreign exchange earnings. Libya has used
 its oil income to finance internal development (new schools,
 hospitals, roads), but much has been'wasted, and the decline
 in oil revenues has forced retrenchment.  The foreign
 exchange controls Libya relaxed in 1988 were again tightened
 in 1989. Libya's economic difficulties have been exacerbated
 to some extent by the regime's expenditures for weapons and on
 foreign military adventures.
 Major human rights restrictions and abuses continued in Libya
 in 1989. Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking. As
 a practical matter, there are no effective rights, to peaceful
 association or assembly, to freedom of speech, to expression
 of opposing views to the Government in any form, to formation
 of trade unions, or to strike. The same is true of rights
 such as the right to be considered innocent until proven
 guilty, to a public or speedy trial, to be secure in one's
 home or person, or even to hold property. While some of these
 rights are guaranteed in principle by the Libyan Government,
 there is no evidence that they exist in fact. Although Col.
 Qadhafi announced his support in 1988 for policies and reforms
 aimed at remedying past widespread abuses of human rights in
 Libya, there was little evidence of any significant change and
 many of the reforms do not appear to have been implemented.
 Amnesty International (AI) estimates that over 90 political
 prisoners remained imprisoned at the end of,1988.
 *Since the U.S. has no official observers present in Libya and
 since Libya's media are totally controlled, this report draws
 heavily on unofficial sources.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Ther4 4ere several reports of politically related and
 extrajudicial killings in 1989. Security forces Were reported
 to have killed two or three persons and wounded others when
 they opened fire on a demonstration--in which anti-Qadhafi
 slogans were being shouted--in Tripoli in January 1989 (see
 Section 2.b.). A would-be assassin of Qadhafi was reported to
 have died of "shock" ih police custody in May. There were
 unconfiYmed reports that Islamist extremists opposed to the
 GovernmenE killed about a dozen nonbelievers in mosques in
 Tripoli in August. The mayor of Sirte is belibved to have
 been killed for reasons of tribal politics-in September. An
 Italian citizen was killed and his body burned by ufiknown
 assailants in October 1989 during a period of anti-Italian
 demonstrations fomented by the Libyan Government.
 AI has expressed concern about the large number of offenses,
 including political offenses, which are punishable by death
 under Libyan law. For example, Law No. 71 of 1972 provides
 for the death penalty for anyone involved with any group
 activity based on any ideology opposed to the principles of
 the revolution (see also Section l.e.). In 1988 Col. Qadhafi
 publicly stated his support for the abolition of the death
 penalty and promised to commute all existing death sentences.
 However, the Great Green Document on Human Rights adopted by
 the General People's Congress in 1988'merely identified the
 total abolition of the death penalty as an "aim of the
 society," and declared that the death penalty should be
 applied in those cases in which the accused poses a danger of
 corruption to the society.
 In 1980 the Government instituted a policy of assassinations
 of Li'Egah exiles and announced the formation of "guicide
 squadh" t' hunt down ahd kill Libyan dissidents abroad.
 Betwebn Mfch 1980 and June 1987, Al recorded at least 37
 attacks on Libyan opponents or presumed opponents living
 abroad, resulting in 25 deaths. In 1988 the regime invited
 exiles to return, jromising they would not be in danger. Most
 refused to do so. There were no reliable reports of
 assassinption attemps against Libyan exiles during 1989.
 According to At's repoit for 1988, "col* Qadhafi indicated that
 the policy of "phy~lbal liquidation" of political opponents
 had ended. '
 b. Disappearance
 There wer ' n6 reports of disappearance in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Tieatment or Punishment
 No current information is available on this subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimit~dperiods. Many political 15risoners are held in
 unofficial detention centers controlled by members of the
 Revolutionary Committees, where prolonged periods of
 
 
 1481
 incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to other
 would-be opponents of the regime. AI stated in a report in
 August 1989 that 40 people are reportedly in incommunicado
 detention following antigovernment disturbances between
 January and May, mainly at the universities in Tripoli and
 Benghazi. While undergoing interrogation, sometimes for
 periods of several months, prisoners are given no access to
 legal representation. Although Qadhafi has claimed to be
 opposed to secret arrests, there is still no evidence he has
 followed up with explicit orders to that end or that the
 situation has improved in practice. Foreigners have also been
 subject to arbitrary arrest in the past, and there are
 credible reports that some foreign workers in Libya have been
 forced into military training and military service on behalf
 of Libya or coerced into subversive activities against their
 own countries.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Col. Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or
 studying abroad to return to Libya. Libya does, however,
 expel noncitizens arbitrarily.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civilians may be tried in regular courts, in less formal
 "people's courts," or by military or revolutionary courts,
 depending on the arbitrary decision of the security forces.
 Security forces have the power to judge persons guilty without
 trial, particularly "traitors to the people." Trials are also
 held in private or in the absence of the accused. The
 traditional courts have been bypassed to a significant extent
 by people's courts and revolutionary courts which sometimes
 conducted "show trials" on television, followed by public
 executions, which have at times been televised. These various
 trial systems provide few safeguards.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Secretariat of Justice. The Union
 of Arab Lawyers, located in France, has expressed concern
 about the ability and freedom of attorneys to provide legal
 defense for political prisoners while serving as government
 employees. Libya claims that it "guarantees prisoners all
 necessary means of defense and safeguards of justice adequate
 to the principles contained in the [Universal] Declaration of
 'Human Rights" and provides for legal assistance "as soon as
 possible with respect to the exigencies of interrogation."
 Nevertheless, there continue to be numerous reports that these
 rights are frequently denied.
 Alleged political offenses in the past often have been tried
 before ad hoc revolutionary courts rather than by civilian
 courts, with the opportunities to engage defense counsel
 severely restricted. A number of these trials have been held
 in secret. The regime's announcement in 1988 of the abolition
 of all "extraordinary" courts, including those operated by the
 Revolutionary Committees, does not appear to have been
 implemented.
 Some of the political prisoners known to be held in Libya were
 released in March 1988, and Col. Qadhafi declared that there
 were "less than 100" political detainees. In its 1989 Report,
 covering 1988, AI estimated the number at 90.
 
 
 1482
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not respect the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home reportedly often is
 disregarded. Local and international telephone calls are
 routinely monitored. The informer network is extensive,
 encouraged by both security agencies and Revolutionary
 Committees. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to
 suspected regime opponents can result in harassment or even
 persecution and detention by the authorities. Property can be
 seized and burned if it belongs to "enemies of the people" or
 those who "cooperate" with foreign powers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's
 Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, in
 general freedom of speech is severely limited. This is
 especially true with regard to any criticism of Col. Qadhafi
 or his regime. Fear of being informed upon by elements of the
 Revolutionary Committees and an underlying climate of mistrust
 at all levels of society further inhibit freedom of speech.
 Freedom of speech and other basic civil and political rights
 are further restricted during internal security crises.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is
 a state-run daily newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000.
 Several smaller newspapers are run by the Revolutionary
 Committees and the Islamic Call Society. JANA, the official
 news agency, is the designated conduit for politically
 acceptable opinions. Publishing opinions contrary to
 government policy is not permitted. Foreign publications,
 once censored, now reportedly circulate sporadically in
 Tripoli.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is repressed unless it is government
 controlled and supportive of regime positions. The right of
 association is limited and granted only to institutions
 affiliated with the regime. Organizations such as independent
 trade unions and professional associations are viewed as
 unnecessary, since Col. Qadhafi has vowed not to "accept
 intermediaries between the revolution and its working forces."
 Following the last-minute cancellation of an international
 soccer match in Tripoli in January 1989, disappointed crowds
 reportedly demonstrated spontaneously in the streets, chanting
 'down with Qadhafi" and other slogans. Security forces fired
 on the crowds, reportedly killing two or three and wounding
 others. In a speech shortly thereafter, Col. Qadhafi
 indirectly acknowleged growing public opposition by calling
 for an end to "the demonstrations, the sit-ins, and the
 protests." He also called for an end to organized sports.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 LIBYA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Some minority religions (e.g.
 Christianity) still are allowed to conduct services, but
 Islamic groups at variance with the state-sanctioned version
 are banned. In an apparent effort to eliminate any
 alternative power bases, the regime has banned the
 once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious sect.
 Services in Christian churches are attended by the foreign
 community. There is a resident Catholic bishop and a small
 number of priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to wear
 religious habits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, movement is not usually
 restricted for Libyan citizens. Traditionally, exit permits
 have been required for travel abroad, and currency controls
 have also served to restrict travel. Restrictions on travel
 abroad were eased significantly in 1988, but the restrictions
 on currency imposed in late 1989 had the practical effect of
 again curbing travel. Members of the Revolutionary Committees
 maintain surveillance of some Libyans while abroad. The right
 of return of Libyan nationals is theoretically fully protected
 even for opponents of Col. Qadhafi, so long as they are
 prepared to "repent." However, this "right" often appears to
 be more nearly an obligation; the regime often calls for
 students, many of whom are under government subsidy, and
 others working abroad to return on little or no notice and
 without regard to the impact on their studies or work.
 Libyans who study abroad are interrogated on their return
 home. Not surprisingly, a number of those called on to return
 resist.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government.
 Major government decisions are controlled by Col. Qadhafi
 himself, a few key figures around him, or by committees acting
 in his name. He appoints military officers and official
 functionaries down to junior levels. Power flows through a
 small circle'of trusted associates. Corruption in the
 administration is a major problem, adversely affecting the
 efficiency of government.
 Participation in elections is mandatory, and all candidates
 are bleared by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates,
 .election brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969)
 government, or people who have been attacked by the power of
 the revolution." Political parties and tribal or local
 groupings are prohibited.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no independent human rights organizations in Libya
 to monitor the Government's performance. The Libyan Arab
 Human Rights Committee, a government organization, was created
 in May 1989, reportedly to implement the reforms announced in
 
 
 1484
 LIBYA
 1988. Al was allowed to visit Libya in 1988 and meet with
 p6litical, judicial, and security officials.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent -allegations of discrimination based on
 tribal status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Col.
 Qadhafi has often complained about the continued power of
 tribal and other groups, but he also utilizes them for
 political action when he sponsors proregime demonstrations.
 In past years, he sought unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers
 married only non-Berbers, presumably in an effort to erode
 their tTibal identity.
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society
 serve to restrict the rights of certain groups, most notably
 women. Within the confines of Islam, Col. Qadhafi has led
 efforts'to change the status of women and expand their access
 to educational and employment opportunities. Women currently
 receive basic military training and are subject to the
 military draft, with some exceptions. The husband's
 permission is necessary for women or children to travel
 abroad. Female circumcision is still reportedly practiced
 among tribal groups in remote areas of the south. No
 information is available on the extent to which violence
 against women is a problem in Libya.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to form or join unions of their
 own choosing. The official trade union organization, the
 General Federation of Producers' Trade Unions, which was
 created in 1972, is under government control and administered
 through the People's Committee system. Independent trade
 unions and professional associations are viewed as
 unnecessary, since-Col. Qadhafi has vowed not to accept
 intermediaries between the revolution and its working forces.
 Although unions are assured the right to "safeguard their
 interests," there is no right to strike, and no strikes by
 Libyan workers have been reported for-years.
 With government financing, the official trade union
 organization-plays a leading role in the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and exploits international trade
 union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts on behalf of
 the Government. Libya is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). It ratified ILO Convention 98 on the
 Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively in 1962"(under the
 previous regime)i but it has not ratified Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the Libyan Labor Code provides for collective
 agreements, there is no collective bargaining in Libya. The
 ILO's Committee of Experts (COE), for a number of years
 including 1989, has noted that the conditions which are laid
 down in the Labor Code for the validity of collective
 agreements are contrary to provisions of ILO Convention 98
 
 
 1485
 requiring free and voluntary negotiation of collective
 agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Libya has ratified the two ILO Conventions dealing with forced
 labor. The ILO's COE, in its 1989 Report, noted that "persons
 expressing certain political views or views ideologically
 opposed to the established political, social or economic
 system may be punished with penalties of imprisonment...
 involving...an obligation to perform labor." It also noted
 that public employees in Libya can be imprisoned and sentenced
 to compulsory labor "...as a punishment for breaches of labour
 discipline or for participation in strikes even in services
 whose interruption would not endanger the life, personal
 safety, or health of the whole or part of the population."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No information is available regarding employment of children
 in Libya. In general, there is no evidence that child labor
 is a widespread practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Libya maintains a work force of around 1 million workers in a
 population of 3.7 million. There is no minimum wage rate set
 by law. The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. Libyan labor
 law defines the rights and duties of workers, and such aspects
 as compensation, pension rights, minimum rest periods, and
 length of the workday. Information on health and safety
 standards is not available.
 Libyan labor law does not apply to the 300,000 foreign workers
 in Libya, who do much of the blue-collar and technical work.
 Their permission to stay in the country extends only for the
 duration of the contracts under which they are employed.
 Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as
 changes in work rules and contracts, with little option but to
 accept or to depart the country, often without full
 compensation for work already performed. The conditions of
 their employment are subject to negotiation between the worker
 and the employer. Foreign workers who are not under contract
 enjoy no protection and in past years have been expelled for
 such infractions as supporting or organizing strikes.
