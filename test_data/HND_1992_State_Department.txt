 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and a unicameral Con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms, and an indepndent judiciary headed by a Supreme
 Court of Justice. Civilian rule was reatored in 1982, and in January 1990 the Na-
 tional Party candidate, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, was inaugurated as President,
 ending 8 years of Liberal Party administration. While the Honduran armed forces
 (HOAF) now play a less intrusive role in the country's civilian government, they still
 operate with considerable institutional and legal autonomy in internal security and
 military affairs. In 1992 the Callejas administration proved unable to ensure that
 many human rights violations were fully investigated, or that most of the perpetra-
 tors of those violations, either military or civilian, were brought to justice. Moreover,
 where arrests occurred, Honduras' criminal justice system was in most cases incapa-
 ble of rendering a verdict and passing a sentence in a timely manner. As of year's
 end, no progress had been made in solvin; or rendering judgment in any of the
 major outstanding human rights cases occuring in 1992, or any dating from previous
 years.
 The HOAF comprise not only the air force, army and navy but also the police,
 known as the Public Security Fore (FUSEP), as a fourth branch. Total military ex-
 penditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $150 million. In 1992 military
 spending is estimated at two-thirds that leveL The FUSEP consists of the Order and
 Security Police, divided into 11 regional commands, and four special commands: the
 Transit Police, the Treasury Police, the S  ial Services Police, and the most impor-
 tant from a human rights standpoint the National Department of Investigation
 (DNID. Members of the HOAF continued to commit human rights abuses, primarily
 for personal motives. HOAF personnel, especially officers, can still act with impu-
 nity in committing crimes. This is due to the failure of the Supreme Court to render
 decisions about the jurisdiction of civilian courts over HOAF personnel accused of
 offenses involving civilians; the tendency of HOAF personnel to protect officers ac-
 cused of abuses; the inability of civilians to levy formal accusations before military
 courts; an ill-trained and poorly equipped judiciary and police force; and an endemi-
 cally corrupt and inefficient criminal justice system.
 In 1992 the economy moved out of the steep recession caused in part by the pain-
 ful economic austerity and adjustment program launched by the Callejas Govern-
 ment in March 1990. The Government projected 1992 real GDP growth at 3.5 per-
 cent, and hoped to hold inflation below 10 percent. Per capita GDP grew only 0.8
 percent, however, as the population increased 2.7 percent. In 1991 per capita income
 was estimated to be $637 combined unemployment and underemployment ran as
 high as 45 percent and illiteracy was approximately 27 percent. Seventy-four per-
 cent of Hondurans lve in poverty.
 In 1992 the principal human rights violations continued to be extrajudicial
 killings, arbitrary and incommunicado detentions, torture and abuse of detainees,
 impunity of armed forces personnel responsible for abuses, and the inability of the
 woefully underfunded judicial system to provide prisoners awaiting trial with swift
 and impartial justice. The same immunity from prosecution and punishment en-
 joyed by military personnel is extended to other elite groups. Virtually no elected
 official, member of the business elite, bureaucrat, politician, or anyone with per-
 ceived influence or connection to the elite was subjected to legal sanctions for seri-
 ous abuses.
 During the year the Callejas administration made some limited efforts to improve
 the country's human rights situation. In May the President issued an executive de-
 cree establishing a new human rights office at the presidential level which opened
 
 
 428
 in December. Also, FUSEP's Office of Professional Responsibility, established in late
 1991, continued investigating allegations of police misconduct.
 RESPEOT FOR HUMAN RIGHnS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KiUing.-The number of homicides increased
 in general in 1992, which contributed to the difficulty in differentiating between
 killings, committed for political reasons and those carried out for other motives. As
 in previous years, some members of the police and security forces were involved in
 extrajudicial killm, and often failed to cooperate in investigations and proceedings
 that implicated their colleagues. Investigating many of these killings and appre-
 hending the perpetrators proved to be beyond the capability of Honuras' already
 weak, underfinded, and inefficient crimina justie system. At year's end most of
 the high profile murders remained unsolved Virtually no arrests or convictions were
 made in the cases of possible political killings from previous years.
 Poitical and extrajudicia kilings in 1992 included the following: On May 13, un-
 known persons shot and killed Armando Montes Zapata the National Party mayor
 of Juticalpa and his driver possibly in a vendetta-read killing. Two suspects were
 arrested or Montes' murder, but were later released for lack of evidence and the
 crime remains unsolved.
 The body of Juan Humberto Sanchez was discovered near his home in
 Colomoncagua, bound hand and foot and shot in the head. His parents accused
 members of the HOAF's 10th Battalion of involvement in his death, noting that
 HOAF soldiers detained Sanchez on July 9, held him for 2 days and, upon returning
 him to his home, threatened him with death. They said that a military patrol took
 him away again on July 11. The HOAF admitted picking up Sanchez on July 9, but
 denied committing the murder. On July 30, HOACommander-in-Chief Major Gen-
 eral Luis Alons Discua attributed Sanchez' death to the general lawlessness in the
 country, referring to him as a criminal with ties to the Farabund Marti National
 Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador. FMLN leadership said that Sanchez had
 been an FMLN member providing security for Radio Venceremos and accused the
 HOAF of having killed Sanchez only because of FMLN membership. The Committee
 of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH) announced
 that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has accepted the Sanchez
 case for review.
 Rigoberto Boijas, the head of the San Pedro Sula union in the state-owned na-
 tional electricity company, was shot to death on July 15 in San Pedro Sula. Borjas
 had earlier survived a December 1991 grenade attack. No arrests were made in ei-
 ther case. Boijas headed the union faction that cooperated with the Government,
 and was elected to replace the previous leadership after an illegal 1991 strike,
 launched by the union s radical |eftwing national leadership, collapsed. While no
 group claimed responsibility, there was speculation in the press that leftwing ele-
 ments murdered Borjas. Another murder with political overtones was that of Ramon
 Castellon Baide the general manager of a local office of the national electrical com-
 pany in Santa harbara. The Morazanist Patriotic Front (FPM) took responsibility
 for his murder, claiming Castellon was once a member of the 3-16 Battalion and
 had participated in the disappearances of several leftist leaders. The police and the
 army discounted the claim of FPM responsibility, but were unable to identify the
 perpetrators and no arrests were made.
 CayoEng Lee, a professor of industrial engineering at the National University's
 Regional University of the North (CURN) and a long time member of the United
 Umversity Democratic Front (FUUD-a right wing university oranization with ties
 to the National Party) was shot to death in an ambush on July 28. Eng Lee was
 the fourth FUUD activist murdered within 3 years. HOAF Commander-in-Chief
 Discua publicly blamed the crime on "leftist elements settling accounts with en-
 emies.' No claims of responsibility or arrests were made.
 Raul Antonio Ramos Florms, apprehended by three DNI agents near the town of
 Danli on August 18, was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds 5 days later
 near the village of Los Trozos. The three DNI agents and two civilians, a well-to-
 do cattle rancher and his driver, were subsequently arrested on September 1 in
 what was called a 'killing for hire" scheme; Ramos allegedly was involved in a land
 sale dispute with the rancher, Conrado Alberto Alvarez. All five men were brought
 before a civilian criminal court and at year's end were in detention awaiting trial.
 Little progress was made toward resolving cases pending from prior years. Judi-
 cial proceedins in the July 13, 1991, rape and murder of 18-year-old student Riccy
 Martinez continued slowy in 1992. On June 5 the judge handling the case added
 the crime of rape to the murder warrants against ex-Colonel Angel Castillo
 
 
 Maradiaga and Santos Eusebio Blovares Funez. On June 24 the court raised the case
 from the investigative to the review phase. As of the end of 1992, the judge had
 completed review of the case and the next stage, presentation of the evidence, was
 under way.
 In the case of the killing of five members of the National Association of Honduran
 Peasants in rural Agua Caliente in May 1991, the jurisdictional dispute between the
 civilian court and the military court remains unresolved. When both courts initiated
 proceedings, the civilian judge requested that the military judge desist from hearing
 the case. When the military judge refused, the files of beth cases were sent to the
 Supreme Court for resolution. In August the Supreme Court returned the files of
 the civilian court to the civilian judge saying that certain irregularities in them had
 to be resolved before the court could issue a ruling.
 A former DNI collaborator told CODEH in February 1992 that the December 8,
 1991, murder of Manuel de Jesus Guerra, a prominent leader of the leftwing Na-
 tional Central of Farm Workers (CNTC) was the work of four DNI agents acting
 under instructions of a DNI subdirector. When CODEH escorted the collaborator to
 a civilian court in San Pedro Sula a few days before his claims were publicized, the
 judge refused to take his statement, citing technical reasons. Therefore, CODEH
 said, it had no choice but to reveal the collabrators claims. The police claimed that
 the persons named never had any connection with DNI or FUSEP. On July 21,
 CODEH filed a complaint before a civilian criminal court in San Pedro Sula accus-
 ing the sub-director of the DNI in San Pedro Sula, Army Major Victor Manuel
 Bueso, and a FUSEP lieutenant of illegal detention and making thrats against the
 life of Angel Gutierrez, regional secretary of the CNTC in Santa Barbara.
 Gutierrez said that he was detained without a warrant and was subjected to psy-
 chological torture and death threats by the DNI, who tried to get him to confess
 to Guerra's murder. The police asserted that they wanted to question Gutierrez
 about the killing since he was one of the last people to see Guerra alive. On August
 10, the judge of the civilian criminal court announced that CODEH's complaint was
 outside her court's jurisdiction and she transferred it to the local military court.
 The Government failed for another year to make headway in its investigation into
 the 1990 killings of labor leader Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina and student leader
 Ramon Antonio Briceno. While a suspect in Briceno's murder was arrested in July,
 he was soon released for lack of evidence.
 One bright spot was the modest efforts of FUSEP Commander Brigadier General
 Guillermo Paredes to improve the poor image of the police. FUSEPs Office of Pro-
 fessional Responsibility (OPR), which began operation in September 1991 continued
 investigating allegations of police misconduct. The office showed itself to be effective
 in handling allegations against enlisted and low-ranking police officers. Its effective-
 ness against high-ranking FUSEP officers, however, remains to be proven. FUSEP's
 investigations into two separate murders of civilians resulted in three DNI agents
 and one Interpol agent being fired from the force, and all four being turned over
 to the civilian courts for trial.
 b. Disaparance-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1992. Loal human rigts grup and Amnesty International continued to press,
 unsuccessfully, for an oficial accounting of the approximately 145 claimed dis-
 appearances which mainly occurred dunng the early 1980's under the tenure of
 former Armed Forces Commander General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, and police and military authorities reit-
 erated throughout 1992 their assurances that the practice had stopped, credible
 charges of torture and other abuse of detainees continued. Methods of torture in-
 cluded beatings on various parts of the body, being tied up and suspended in air
 (the so-called helicopter torture), the use of the 'capucha* (a hood dusted on the in-
 side with lime), and psychological torture such as death threats.
 A U.S. citizen under arrest for drug trafficking complained to a US. consular offi-
 cer of being beaten repeatedly (with pieces of tires) by the DNI in San Pedro Sula
 over the course of 14 days. A medical examination confirmed the nature of his inju-
 ries. The FUSEP had not yet responded at year's end to an official request to inves-
 tigate the matter. Unofficialy, the police claimed the prisoner received his iures
 when he tried to escape by jumping out of a moving police car. A reliable wtness
 had observed the prisoner in custody following his arrest, however, and reported he
 had been unharmed at that time.
 While FUSEP authorities have announced in past years that individual cases of
 alleged torture would be investigated, the results of such investigations, if any, have
 never been released. There are no known instances of members of the arm forces
 ever being convicted of torture.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Honduran law states that a person may
 be arrested only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commis-
 sion of a crime, and that the person must be clearly informed of the grounds for
 the arrest. A detainee must be brought within 24 hours before a judge, who then
 must issue an initial temporary holding order within 24 hours and release an initial
 decision within 6 days. The judge must conduct a preliminary investigation to de-
 cide whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a trial within 30 days or, if nec-
 essary, to extend the 30.day period up to 3 months. While bail is legally available,
 poor defendants, seldom represented by an attorney, are often unable to take advan-
 tage of it. Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedure, criminal procedings may
 be initiated by a judge, the police, public officials, or any citizen. Praps as many
 as 80 percent of the cases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal
 justice system, but instead are settled administratively by police or municipal courts
 which are separate from the regular judicial court system.
 The FUSEP, in particular its .DNI division, and other security force elements con-
 tinued to practice arbitrary arrest and detention in a substantial number of cases.
 Credible reports of incommunicado detention and failure to comply with writs of ha-
 beas corpus also continued.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under Honduran law, an accused person has the
 right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an initial hearing b a judge, to
 bail, to an attorney provided bf the State if necessary, and to appeal. Defendants
 in military tribunals have the same due process rights as those being tried in the
 civilian system, with the exception of bail. The military court system does not have
 its own courts of appeal; appeals and ratifications of military court verdicts are re-
 ferred to the civilian judicial system.
 Despite legal protections, the Honduran judicial system applies justice inequi-
 tably. The poor are punished in accordance with the law, but the rich or politically
 influential are almost never brought to trial, much less convicted oriailed. Those
 few who are incarcerated usually manage to buy their way out or escape." The
 most notable example of the latter in 1992 was the murder case against Rosa Castro
 Bobadilla, arrested and charged with the murder of Fernando Marichal Callejas
 (cousin of President Rafael Leonardo Callejas) in January 1992, who later "escaped"
 from the country before she could be brought to trial. As a prime example of the
 kind of conflict of interest present in the Honduran system of government, the foren-
 sic evidence in this case was originally reviewed by the then Chief of Legal Medi-
 cine, who was also the suspect's brother. He remained in charge of the evidence
 until being fired 3 months afer Castro Bobadilla's escape.
 In 1992 both the Supreme Court and the Callejas Administration appeared unable
 to summon the political will to resolve the long-standing jurisdictional disputes be-
 tween the civilian and military court systems. These primarily involved cases in
 which a member of the military was alleged to have committed a crime against a
 civilian in circumstances unrelated to official duties. In many of these cases, high-
 level HOAF authorities previously insisted that the Constitution gave jurisdiction
 to the military courts, while several prominent civilian jurists and nongovernmental
 organizations, such as CODEH, publicly argued that civilian courts should have ju-
 risdiction. The Supreme Court failed to resolve the constitutional question despite
 several cases pending before it. A congressional committee also began to study clari-
 fication of the pertinent constitutional articles governing the issue in August 1992.
 Honduras' civilian judiciary is weak, underfunded, politicized, inefficient, and cor-
 rupt. The nine magistrates of the Supreme Court are elected to 4-year terms by ma-
 jority vote of the Honduran Congress and confirmed by the President. The period
 of their terms coincides with those of the Congress and the President. The Supreme
 Court appoints all of the judges in the lower civilian courts. Whenever past elections
 resulted ina change of ruling party, there was always a large turnover of court per-
 sonnel. While the implementation of a "judicial career" law in 1991 held out the
 promise that in the future judges, prosecutors pblic defenders, and other court
 personnel would be hired only on merit and coudbe legally removed only for cause,
 results have been few. The judiciary remains vulnerable to outside influence and
 suffers from woefully inadequate funding.
 Detention without sentencing, averaging 14 months and sometimes much longer,
 constitutes one of the most serious human rights problems in Honduras. A signifi-
 cant number of defendants in Honduras serve the maximum possible sentence for
 the crime of which they are accused before their trials are ever concluded (or some-
 times even begun). Approximately 85 percent of the prison population in 1992 had
 been neither sentenced nor exonerated. These judicial weaknesses, along with the
 FUSEP's own problems of underfunding and poorly paid, ill-trained personnel,
 greatly undermine the right of Honduran citizens to a fair public trial.
 
 
 Cf. Arbitrary Interference with Prvacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that entry by persons
 authorized by the State may be made only with the owner's consent or with author-
 ization by a competent authority, and then only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., or at
 any time in the event of an emergency, or to prevent the commission of a crime.
 There were credible charges in 1992 that police and armed forces personnel failed
 at times to obtain the needed authorization before entering a private home. Govern.
 ment monitoring of mail or telephones may be authorized by judicial order for.ape-
 cific purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. There is credible
 evidence that the HOAF takes advantage of its operation of the national telephone
 company to monitor selected telephone lines illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and these freedoms are largely respected in practice. The media, how-
 ever, are subject to corruption and politicization. As in past years, there were allega-
 tions of intimidation by authorities, instances of self-censorship, and payoffs to jour-
 nalists. In August Minister of Information Olman Serrano publicly accused ournal-
 ists of receiving regular payoffs. A week later, following a general outcry from the
 media Serrano withdrew the charge, claiming that his remarks had referred only
 to media owners.
 In February Francisco Rodriguez, a reporter for the daily Tiempo, was subpoenaed
 to testify in the criminal court handling the case of the murder of Fernando
 Marichal Callejas (see Section Ie.). The court asked Rodriguez to reveal the sources
 of material he had reported in connection with the case. Rodriguez declined to re-
 veal the sources, citing Article 72 of the Honduran Constitution and the Law of
 Freedom of Expression. Subsequently, Tiempo director Manuel Gamero was simi-
 larly called to testify on March 4, and also refused to divulge sources. The paper
 continued to protect its sources, and no judicial action was taken against it.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution gives
 Hondurans the right to peaceful assembly for political, religious, or other purposes.
 The Government does not generafly require pnor authorization or permits but may
 ask for a permit to 'guarantee public order. Demonstrations to protest such mat-
 ters as the Government's economic programs routinely took place throughout the
 year without obstruction. Police kept a low profile and did not interfere in the dem-
 onstrations marking the first anniversary of the murder of Riccy Mabel Martinez.
 However, the Ministry of Education did declare the day a school holiday, which the
 protest organizers claimed was an effort to decrease student participation. The Gov-
 ernment denied this. There are no restrictions on the rights of association.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects all forms of religious expres-
 sion, and there is no state religion. Most Hondurans are Roman Catholic. Foreign
 missionaries of various Protestant sects work and proselytize throughout the coun-
 try. There were no publicly reported incidents of harassment or intimidation of the
 clergy by the military in 1992.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enter and exit Honduras without arbitrary impediment, and
 travel within the country's borders is freely permitted. There have been no known
 instances in which citizenship has been revoked for political reasons. The U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees officially closed the Salvadoran refugee camp at Mesa
 Grande on March 30, 1992. Approximately 1,400 Salvadorans returned to El Sal-
 vador from the camp in March; approximately 121 Salvadorans living at the camp
 did not return.
 Of the 250 Haitian asylum seekers who arrived in Honduras in November 1991,
 only 44 remain; the rest voluntarily returned to Haiti.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hondurans continue to exercise the right to change their government through
 democratic and peaceful means. National and municipal governments are chosen by
 free, secret, direct, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, and
 any citizen born in Honduras or abroad of Honduran parentage may hold office ex-
 cept for members of the clergy and armed forces. A new political party may gain
 legal status by obtaining 20,000 signatures and establishing party organizations in
 50_percent of the country's departments.
 The voters choice of candidates is severely limited, however, by the unitary ballot
 system under which the voter must cast a single ballot for a single slate of can-
 
 
 432
 didates for both president and congressional candidates. The inability to practice
 split-ticket voting has an adverse effect on Honduras' small parties, and limits the
 institutional effectiveness and independence of the Congress whose members have
 no mandate of their own. A separate mayoral ballot, however, was introduced in late
 1992.
 In addition, the internal candidate selection process in both major parties tends
 to limit direct, popular participation in the process, particularly at the reional or
 local levels. Both major parties have an extensive "precandidate campaign period,
 following which the presidential candidates are selected through internal elections,
 held approximately 1 year before the national elections. Unsuccessful precandidates
 have criticized the process as unfair and undemocratic. Once selected through the
 internal elections, the parties' presidential candidates have the right to choose con-
 gressional and mayoral candidates. While both leading precandidates claim that
 they will consult with local leadership before making such choices, some have ar-
 gued for a more explicitly democratic system for selecting candidates for these of-
 ices.
 Although there are no overt impediments to participation in the political system
 by indignous people and women, traditionally they are very poorly represented in
 leadership positions and political parties (see Section 5). Only Gracras de Dios prov-
 ince, with its overwhelming Misquito Indian population, currently has a Misquito
 Deputy serving in Congress.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Government officials continued to meet and cooperate with representatives of local
 and international human rights organizations in 1992. The governmental Inter-In-
 stitutional Commission on Human Rights, established in 1987 to respond to domes-
 tic and international inquiries and to mivestiate human rights violations, is com-
 of members drawn from the Supreme Court, armed forces, Foreign Ministry,
 Mintry of Government and Justice, and National Congress. It is charged with
 gathering evidence in human rights cases, presenting that evidence to the courts,
 and asking the Supreme Court to ensure that a trial take place based on that evi-
 dence when the lower courts fail to act. The Commission is ineffective, however it
 did not ask the Supreme Court to pursue any human rights case in 1992, and it
 did not receive full cooperation from military and civilian judicial authorities. It did
 launch an investigation into conditions and corruption in the Honduran prison sys-
 tem, but has yet to report its findings. In May 1992, President Callejas approved
 a decree establishing a new governmental Human Rights Commission at the presi-
 dential level. In November Dr. Leo Valladares, formerly the head of the Center for
 the Investigation and Promotion of Human Rights (CIPRODEH), was appointed to
 head the Commission. The office was'inaugurated on December 17 and is now open
 to receive complains.
 The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH) and the
 Committee of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras
 (COFADEH) are the best known and most active local nongovernmental human
 rights organizations. Since the Government has failed to establish an effective
 human rights monitor, CODE, with its network of offices throughout Honduras,
 is often the only recourse available to victims of abuses, particularly those living in
 rural areas. Also, the nongovernmental CIPRODEH, which was established in April
 1991, offers basic human rights courses, holds monthly seminars, carries out re-
 search on Honduran issues, and serves as a source of information on human rights.
 There was one reported incident of harassment against a member of a human
 rights organization in 1992. In March, a CODEH representative in Olancho, Antonio
 Zelaya Reyes, was on his way to a radio station to make a radio broadcast. Accord-
 ing to press reports and CODEH, an alleged "DNJ collaborator" put a gun to
 Zelays's face outside the radio station and threatened to kill him for comments he
 was making against the police. Zelays was saved from injury by the intervention
 of a passerby. CODEH filed  a complaint with the Reconciliation Commission in
 Olancho. Although the Commission agreed to act on the complaint, CODEH has yet
 to receive a response.
 Section 5. Discrimination based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution bans any discrimination on grounds of race, sex, and class. In
 fact, however, as noted in Section i.e., both the military and wealthy political and
 social elite enjoy impunity from the legal system. The Constitution provides for 2
 years of compulsory military service for male citizens between the ages of 18 and
 30, but only Hondurans from the middle and lower classes are forcibly recruited into
 the armed forces.
 
 
 433
 The indigenous peoples of Honduras have little or no participation in decisions af.
 fecting their lands, cultures, traditions, or the allocation of natural resources. All
 indigenous land rights are communal, and property sale either by individuals or the
 tribe is prohibited. Tribal lands are often poorly defined in documents dating from
 the mid-19th century, and legal title based on modern cadastral measurements is
 lacking in most cases. Decisions regarding exploitation of timber resources on indig-
 enous ands are made by the Honduran Forestry Development Corporation, often
 over strenuous tribal objection. Usurpation of indigenous lands by nonindigenous
 farmers and cattle growers is common.
 Legal recourse is commonly denied to indigenous groups because of the courts'
 bias m favor of the nonindigenus party, often people of means and influence. Fail-
 ure to obtain legal redresshas frequently provoked indigenous groups to attempt
 to regain lands through land invasions and other tactics. The legal system, while
 slow to proceed against nonindigenous usurpers of indigenous lands, moves rapidly
 and forcefully against indigenous groups who seek redress through direct actions.
 Women are represented in at least small numbers in most of the professions, but
 cultural attitudes limit their career opportunities. Women have equal access to edu-
 cational opportunities and are paid equal wages for equal work, although their jobs
 are often classified as less demanding as a justification for paying them lower sala-
 ries.
 Informed local observers report that the problem of physical abuse of women is
 widespread in Honduras, but reliable statistics are unavailable. Efforts to combat
 violence against women are severely impeded by serious weaknesses in Honduras'
 Penal Code. For example, in the case of rape, the age of sexual consent is 12 years.
 Both statutory rape and rape of a victim between the ages of 12 and 21 are consid-
 ered public crimes which the State will prosecute. However the rape of someone 21
 years of age or older is considered to be a private crime which the State will pros-
 ecute only at the request of the victim. The penalties for rape are relatively ight,
 ranging from 3-9 years.
 There are no shelters specifically maintained for battered women. Although the
 law offers legal redress few women take advantage of the legal process. This reluc-
 tance stems from a lach of education and the perception, often correct, that judges
 would be unwilling to apply the law vigorously. Many organizations have begun to
 offer assistance to women, principally targeting those living in the rural sectors and
 marginal, neighborhoods of cries. The Honduran Federation of Women's Associa-
 tions, for example, provides home construction and improvement loans, offers free
 legal assistance to women, and lobbies the Government on women's causes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions. Although only about 20 percent of the work force is organized, trade unions
 exert considerable economic and political influence. They frequently participate
 without interference in public rallies against government policies and also make ex-
 tensive use of the media to advance their views. There are three large peasant asso-
 ciations directly affiliated with the trade unions.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic labor rights is provided
 for by the Constitution and honored in practice. The Civil Service Code stipulates
 that public workers, however, do not have the right to strike.
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity* associations, which provide
 an array of services through an association and a joint employer/worker capital
 fund. Organized labor, including the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
 Industrial Organizations and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICYTU), strongly opposes these associations on the grounds that they do not permit
 strikes and have inadequate grievance procedures. This issue is the subject of an
 ICFTU complaint against Honduras in the International Labor Organization, which
 continued under examination in 1992, as did a separate complaint involving the
 1991 murder of trade union leaders, Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramon Antonio
 Briceno, and death threats. The membership of solidarity associations in Honduras
 remained static during 1992.
 The Government afforded official recognition to parallel unions in the Union of
 Public Employees of Roads, Airport and Terminal Maintenance in July. It has peri-
 odically dismissed workers supporting the elected union and then replaced them
 with supporters of the government backed parallel union. Similarly, the Govern-
 ment installed a parallel union in the telecommunication workers union
 (SITRATELH). When members of the established union held a congress on July 11
 to elect their leadership, uniformed soldiers entered the meeting and dispersed it,
 informing members that they "had nothing to do there." Former SITRATELH leader
 Carlos Kellner, who continued to challenge and appeal the imposition of a parallel

 union, was arrested on August 28 by the DNI and held incommunicado for 5 days.
 When the case was finally brought before him, a criminal judge summarily dis-
 missed DNI charges that Kellnerhad stolen union funds, and ordered Kellner's re-
 lease. He continued to suffer harassment and threatening telephone calls, however.
 On September 28, Kellner's private automobile was set on fire in front of his resi-
 dence, and he believed DNI officers were responsible.
 Honduras' trade union movement maintains close ties with various international
 trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and to
 bargain collectively is protected by law but not always observed in practice. Retribu-
 tion by employers for trade union activity is not uncommon, in spite of its prohibi-
 tion in the Labor Code. There are instances in which companies threatened to close
 down if unionized. Some workers were harassed and, in some cases, fired because
 of their efforts to form a trade union. Relatively few workers were actually dis-
 missed for union activity;, these cases, however, served to discourage other workers
 from attempting to organize. Workers who are fired may apply to the Ministry of
 Labor or the courts for redress. Complaints to the Ministry about victimization for
 union activity are few, allegedly due in part to fear of retribution by current or fu-
 ture employers and, in part, to an understaffed Labor Inspectorate Corps limited in
 its ability. to pursue extensive investigations of formal complaints.
 Collective bargaining agreements are the norm for companies in which the work-
 ers are organized. Workers in both unionized and nonunionized companies are
 under the protection of the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress
 from the Ministry of Labor. Wages in nonorganized companies are determined by
 labor supply and demand, within the constraints of the minimum wage law, last ad-
 justed in June.
 When unions are formed, a list of initial members must be submitted to the Min-
 istry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. There have
 been credible reports of individual Labor Ministry officials providing names of em-
 ployees seeking trade union recognition prior to such recognition having been grant-
 ed. In some instances, this permitted employers to dismiss petitioning employees in
 advance of the recognition process taking place. The Ministry is considering admin-
 istrative measures which would guard against such instances and provide protection
 to employees petitioning for union recognition. In the meantime, however, dismissed
 workers are usually given their severance payments and once the severance pay-
 ment is accepted, the worker loses the right to judicial appeal of the dismissal.
 The free trade zones are governed by the same labor regulations as the rest of
 private industry. Working conditions and wages in these exprt processing zones
 (EPZ's) are generally considered superior to those prevailing in the rest of the coun-
 try. A special decree governing EPZ's provides that in the event of a labor dispute
 which could interrupt or delay production or exprt deliveries, workers will be treat-
 ed under the same Labor Code provisions as public sector workers, i.e., they may
 not strike. Nevertheless strikes which occurred in the government-controlled EPZs
 were not declared illegal by the Ministry of Labor. Unions are active in the govern-
 ment-controlled Puerto Cortes free trade zone, but factory owners have resisted ef-
 forts to organize the privately owned new industrial parks. No strikes have occurred
 in the privately owned industrial parks.
 According to a recent survey, only one company operating within the privately
 owned industrial parks is presently unionized. Blacklisting is clearly prohibited by
 the Honduran labor code. Nevertheless, there is credible evidence that informal
 blacklisting does occur in the privately owned industrial parks. There is no evi-
 dence, however, that the Government or military maintain union blacklists.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in Honduras; such practices are prohibited by law and the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit the employment of children under the age of 16 years. Violations of
 the Labor Code occur frequently in rural areas or in small companies. High unem-
 ployment and underemployment have resulted in many children supplementing the
 family income by working on small family farms, as street vendors, or in small
 workshops. The Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for enforcing child employ-
 ment laws, but it lacks the resources necessary to carry out the task.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the Labor Code require
 that all labor be fairly paid. Minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and occupa-
 tional safety are all regulated, but the Ministry of Labor lacks the staff and other
 resources for effective enforcement. In May 1992, organized labor and the private
 sector umbrella organization agreed on a 13.7 percent increase in the minimum
 wage, to become effective June 1. Even after this third consecutive annual increase,
 the minimum wage, which varies by occupation and location, is considered insuffi-
 
 
 435
 cient to provide a decent standard of living, ,particularly in view of inflation. In addi-
 tion, Labor Minister Carlos Torres declared in September 1992 that approximately
 30 percent of the 10,000 enterprises under his ministry's supervision pay less than
 the minimum wage. Some employers, he noted, generally the smaller enterprises
 pay as little as 50 percent of the already low minimum wage. Many households need
 to pool family members' salaries to survive.
 The law prescribes an 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek in 6 days. The Labor
 Code provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after
 4 years, but regulations are frequently ignored in practice as a result of the high
 level of unemployment and underemployment.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws.
 Due to a lack of resources, the laws are not well enforced. Reliable reports indicate
 that as many as 50 deaths per year result from serious health and safety hazards
 facing Miskito Indian scuba divers employed in lobster and conch harvesting off the
 Caribean coast of Honduras. Some complaints have also arisen about the failure
 of foreign factory managers to comply with the Labor Code in factories located in
 free trade zones and industrial parks.
