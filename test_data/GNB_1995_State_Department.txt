 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau held its first multiparty elections in 1994, electing
 Joao Bernardo Vieira President. Vieira had ruled the country since taking power in
 a 1980 coup. He is also president of the African Party for the Independence of Guin-
 
 
 120
 ea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), the only legal political party from independence
 in 1974 until the 1991 adoption of a multiparty constitution. The PAIGC holds 62
 of the 100 seats in the National Assembly where 4 other parties are represented.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary.
 The police, under the direction of the Ministry of Internal Administration, have
 primary responsibility for the nation's internal security. The armed forces are re-
 sponsible for external security and may be called upon to assist the police in inter-
 nal emergencies. The police were responsible for human rights abuses.
 The population of 1 million relies largely upon subsistence agriculture. Annual per
 capita gross domestic product is estimated at $200. The economic situation deterio-
 rated this year, with the inflation rate rising to over 50 percent. The country is bur-
 dened by a heavy external debt and has inadequate tax revenues.
 Political pluralism brought about greater transparency. However, the overall
 human rights situation did not improve appreciably during the year. Police contin-
 ued to engage in arbitrary detention, physical mistreatment, and other forms of har-
 assment. The Government did not punish any members of the security forces for
 these abuses. Prison conditions remained poor, and prolonged detention and a lack
 of due process continue. Journalists continue to practice self-censorship Discrimina-
 tion against women, and violence and discrimination against women and children
 are problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The 1992 death of Ussumane Quade, an army officer beaten to death while in po-
 lice custody, remains unresolved. Human rights monitors continued to press for a
 thorough and impartial investigation of his death, ostensibly a suicide, but police
 have refused to cooperate.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or other coercion is invalid. However, the Government often ignores
 these provisions. Security and police authorities have historically employed torture
 and abusive interrogation methods, usually in the form of severe beatings or depri-
 vation. The Government rarely enforces provisions for punishment of abuses com-
 mitted by security forces.
 Two policemen were accused of rape in July. The case was discussed in the Na-
 tional Assembly and widely publicized in the press. However, the accused police offi-
 cers had not been formally charged or tried by year's end. Human rights monitors
 report other incidents in which police accused of rape or mistreatment of prisoners
 have not been prosecuted.
 Prison conditions are poor, but generally not life threatening. The Human Rights
 League has offered to pay for prison improvements, but the Government has denied
 them access.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal system provides for procedural
 rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to release if no timely indictment is
 brought, and the right to a speedy trial. In practice, the judicial system generally
 fails to provide these rights.
 Police detain suspects without judicial authority or warrants, occasionally through
 the device of house arrest. The Government holds detainees without charge or trial
 for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado.
 Human rights monitors estimate that pretrial detainees arrested without war-
 rants and imprisoned without charge make up more than 90 percent of the prison
 population. The authorities do not routinely observe bail procedures.
 There were no known cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but judges, who are poorly trained and poorry paid, are sometimes subject to
 political pressures and corruption.
 Trials involving state security are conducted by civilian courts. Military courts try
 only cases of a military nature. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for
 both civilian and military cases. The President has the authority to grant pardons
 and reduce sentences.
 Despite its problems, the judicial system is sometimes capable of providing a fair
 trial, even in controversial cases. Several policemen were convicted of being accom-
 plices to armed robbery in September and were awaiting sentencing at year's end.
 Citizens who cannot afford an attorney have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.
 
 
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and urban dwellers often bring
 judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid the costs and bureaucratic im-
 pediments of the official system. Police often resolve disputes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence,
 but the Government does not always respect these rights. The authorities examine
 international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom use judicial warrants,
 and the police sometime force entry into private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, but journalists continue to practice self-censorship.
 One independent newspaper suspended publication for economic reasons, leaving
 only one regularly published independent newspaper, which nevertheless expressed
 strong criticism of the Government. Joao de Barros, former publisher of a defunct
 opposition weekly, was arrested and mistreated while attempting to depart the
 country in March.
 Two private radio stations began broadcasting in Bissau, bringing the total to
 four.
 Academic freedom is observed in schools and research institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Government approval is required for all as-
 semblies and demonstrations. All such requests have been granted. Various opposi-
 tion parties held legal political rallies during the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While religious groups must be licensed
 by the Government, none have been refused. Various faiths, including Jehovah's
 Witnesses, commenced missionary operations during the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement within the country and
 generally does not restrict foreign travel and emigration. Passports are issued by
 the Minister of Internal Administration. Citizens are guaranteed the right to return
 and are not subject to political revocation of their citizenship. There are no provi-
 sions for asylum.
 The number of refugees grew to 25,000 due to heightened conflict in Senegal's
 Casamance region. The Government has asked the U. High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees to move the Casamance refugees further from the border area, but refugees
 generally resist this proposal.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1994 voters were able to freely choose their government for the first time in
 the nation's history. The PAIGC retained power in elections judged to be free and
 fair by international observers, although they acknowledged irregularities. Local
 elections have not yet been scheduled. The independent National Commission of
 Elections has been absorbed by the Ministry of Internal Administration.
 Women are underrepresented in the political process. Eight of the 100 National
 Assembly Deputies are women, and there is a women's caucus that cuts across party
 lines. Only 2 of 25 Cabinet members are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not interfere with the Guinea-Bissau Human Rights League
 and international human rights groups which continued to investigate human rights
 abuses objectively. The League's planned conference on police and prison reform was
 cancelled for the second consecutive year due to the Government's refusal to allow
 police to attend. The Government denied the Human Rights League access to pris-
 oners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and
 religion. In practice, however, these provisions are not effectively enforced.
 Women.-WPhysical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of set-
 tling domestic disputes. While police will intervene in domestic disputes if re-
 quested, the Government has not undertaken specific measures to counter social
 pressure against reporting domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment
 of women.
 
 
 Discrimination against women persists although officially prohibited by law.
 Women are responsible for most work on subsistence farms and have limited access
 to education, especially in rural areas. Women do not have equal access to employ-
 ment. Among certain ethnic groups, women cannot own or manage land nor inherit
 Chilr�  en.-The Government allocates only limited resources for children's welfare
 and education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is widely
 practiced within certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and Mandinkas. Despite
 official prohibition of this practice, the Government has not taken effective action
 to halt FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation mandating accessibility. The law
 does not specifically prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and the
 Government does not ensure equal access to employment and education. The State
 has made some efforts to assist disabled veterans through pension programs, but
 these programs do not adequately address veterans' health, housing, and food needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides all civilian workers with
 the freedom to form and join independent trade unions. However, the vast majority
 of the population works in subsistence agriculture. Most union members are govern-
 ment or parastatal employees; only a small percentage of workers are in the wage
 sector and are organized.
 The Government registers all labor unions. There are 11 labor unions registered
 and operating. All unions are officially independent of the Government, but seven
 unions are affiliated with the National Trade Union Confederation (UNTG), which
 retains close informal ties with the PAIGC. The law does not favor UNTG-affiliated
 unions over others. The Constitution provides for the right to strike and protection
 from retribution against strike activities.
 The only legal restriction on strike activity is the requirement for prior notice.
 Legal strikes were conducted by several unions, with no retribution against the
 strikers. Several other labor disputes were resolved via nonbinding arbitration con-
 ducted by unions or the Ministry of Public Works, Civil Service, and Administrative
 Reform.
 All unions are free to affiliate freely with national confederations and inter-
 national labor organizations of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Constitution does not
 provide for or protect the right to bargain collectively, and there were no instances
 of genuine collective bargaining. Most wages are established in bilateral negotia-
 tions between workers and employers, taking into consideration the minimum sala-
 ries set annually by the Government's Council of Ministers.
 The Government's provision for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination has very little effect due to low union membership. The Government
 adopted no laws to establish penal sanctions against employers practicing such dis-
 crimination. This practice is not widespread.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 permitted by law, and i not known to exist. Judicial action is pending against an
 individual accused of coercing labor during the year.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The General Labor Act of 1986 es-
 tablished a minimum age of 14 years for general factory labor and 18 for heavy or
 dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age requirements are
 generally followed in the small-wage sector, but the Ministry of Civil Service and
 Labor does not enforce these requirements in other sectors. Children in cities often
 work in street trading, and those in rural communities do domestic and field work
 without pay. The Government does not attempt to discourage these traditional prac-
 tices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government's Council of Ministers annu-
 ally establishes minimum wage rates for all categories of work but does not enforce
 them. The lowest monthly wage is less than $25 (450,000 pesos). This wage is inad-
 equate to maintain a minimum standard of living, and workers must supplement
 their income through other work, reliance on the extended family, and subsistence
 agriculture. The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek with-
 out further compensation is 45, but the Government does not enforce this provision.
 The Ministry of Civil Service and Labor establishes legal health and safety stand-
 ards for workers, with the cooperation of the unions, which are then adopted into
 
 
 law by the National Assembly. However, these standards are not enforced, and
 many persons work in conditions which endanger their health and safety.
