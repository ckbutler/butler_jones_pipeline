 NIGERIA
 At the end of 1993, Nigeria's military continued to rule the country. Until August
 27, General Ibrahim Bahangida who had come to power in a 1985 coup, was the
 head of the military regime. n er Babangida, Nigeria's main decisionmaking organ
 in 1993 was the military-dominated National Defense and Security Council (NDSC),
 which ruled by decree. Amid controversy arising from his annulment of the June
 12 Presidential election, Babangida resigned as r ent and Commander-in-Chief
 on August 26, installing the Interim National Government (ING) headed by busi-
 nessman Ernest Shonekan. The ING included many members of the earlier Transi-
 tional Council, which had been responsible for managing day-to-day governmental
 affairs under the oversight of the NDSC. The ING was to organize a new presi-
 dential election and hand over authority to an elected civilian president by March
 31, 1994. On November 17, the military forced Shonekan to resign, and General
 Sani Abacha assumed the titles of Head of State and Commander-in-Chief.
 Abacha established a military-dominated "Provisional Ruling Council" (PRC),
 which ruled by decree, and named prominent persons from around the country to
 head gover.-ment ministries, grouping them into a 32-member "Federal Executive
 Council" (FEC). Although the FEC included some holdovers from the ING, it also
 included some well-known prodemocracy and human rights activists. The PRC
 quickly dissolved the national and state legislatures and the local councils and re-
 placed elected civilian governors with military administrators. The military regime
 announced it would hold a constitutional conference to plot Nigeria's future, includ-
 ing a timetable for return to democratic government. In the interim, the decree sus-
 pending the 1979 Constitution remained in force.
 Nigeria's tightly controlled transition to civilian, democratic rule was supposed to
 end on August 27 with the inauguration of a democratically elected, civilian presi-
 dent. From February to April, Nigeria's two permitted political parties, the Social
 Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC), staged
 presidential nominating conventions at the ward, local government, state, and na-
 tional level. On June 12, the SDI's Moshood K.O. Abiola and the NRC's Bashir Tofa
 squar.-d off in what national and international observers characterized as the freest
 
 
 213
 and fairest election in Nigeria's history. But this assessment did not address itself
 to the process leading to the election, whose integrity suffered from the military re-
 gime's extensive manipulation, including the exclusion of many prospective can-
 didates. From early official and unofficial returns it appeared Ahiola had won a
 landslide victory. However, before formal results were announced, Babangida again
 usurped the democratic process, annulling the June 12 results. Babangida rational-
 ized his action by claiming that he and the NDSC had uncovered evidence of mas-
 sive electoral fraud, but he never presented evidence to the Nigerian people and
 never released the June 12 results. Nigerians in the Southwest responded to
 Babangida's announcement with public protests and civil disobedience campaigns.
 In July the protests turned violent, and more than 100 people were killed.
 The bicameral National Assembly was installed in December 1992, but the NDSC
 prohibited it from legislating on most areas of national life. The ING used other bu-
 reaucratic and political maneuvers to circumscribe sharply the Assembly's authority.
 In November the PRC dissolved it. The basis of Nigerian constitutional law during
 1993 was unclear. Legal experts could not always agree about what document
 formed the basis of law at any particular point during a year when three different
 governments held power. Questions of which constitution, if any, was in effect are
 largely irrelevant. All three governments derived their authority, directly or indi-
 rectly, from military power-not from a constitution or a popular mandate. More-
 over, all Nigerian constitutions contain essentially the same provisions regarding
 human rights, and these form the basis of most judicial decisions, unless, as was
 often the case, a decree specifically nullified a provision or ousted judicial authority.
 The Government enforces its authority through the Federal Security System (the
 Armed Forces, the State Security Service, and the national police) and through the
 courts. In 1992 Babangida announced the creation of the National Guard, which
 was supposed to relieve the military of its internal security role in situations in
 which the police were unable to maintain public order. However, during July's
 prodemocracy demonstrations, the National Guard remained in its barracks, and
 Babangida deployed the army to help quell the disturbances. In late October, the
 ING failed to fund the Guard and announced plans to disperse its personnel to var-
 ious army units for additional training, effectively disbanding the organization. The
 security forces committed many human rights violations in 1993.
 Most of Nigeria's 90-million population is rural, engaging in small-scale agri-
 culture. Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign exchange
 earnings and 80 percent of its budget revenues. In order to cope with reduced oil
 revenues, Nigeria adopted an indigenous Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in
 1986. While the SAP was a success in some respects, economic conditions for the
 average Nigerian remain very difficult. The elites continue to prosper, but there is
 Widespread unemployment, underemployment, and inflation. Large budget deficits
 financed by money creation pushed inflation into the 80- to 90-percent range during
 1993. The majority of the Nigerian population lives in poverty.
 Nigeria's human rights record worsened in 1993. Babangida's erratic political
 course fueled increased economic distress, heightened episodic civil unrest in urban
 areas and interethnic violence in some rural areas, resulting in many civilian
 deaths. The Babangida regime regularly relied on arbitrary arrest and detention as
 a means of silencing its critics. It closed media houses critical of Babangida's nul-
 lification of the June 12 election and announced a series of draconian decrecs re-
 stricting press freedom. Like other military decrees, they contained clauses prohibit-
 ing judicial review. Security services routinely harassed human rights and
 prodemocracy groups, journalists, and student activists. Other human rights prob-
 lems included extrjudicial killings, police brutality, dangerous and unsanitary pris-
 on conditions, violence and discrimination against women, and infringements on
 freedom of speech, press, travel, and political and labor affiliation.
 Shortly after its inauguration, the ING released detained human rights activists
 and pledged to respect press freedoms. Activists arrested during antigovernment
 demonstrations in September were formally charged and released on bail. However,
 other human rights abuses continued, and the ING failed to honor its pledge to re-
 peal the draconian press decrees. The PRC permitted the closed media houses to
 reopen and withdrew spurious charges against prominent human rights and jour-
 nalists, but, like the ING, it did not repeal the press decrees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, extrajudicial
 killings and excessive use of force by police and security services were common. The
 most deadly incident occurred in July after the regime deployed police and military
 
 
 214
 
 units to quell prodemocracy protests in Lagos. There were credible reports that se-
 curity forces may have killed as many as 150 people. The regime asserted that the
 death toll was much lower and that security forces intervened only when confronted
 by violent criminals. While the victims included hoodlums and looters, who used the
 protests as cover to engage in violent criminal activities, eyewitness accounts indi-
 cated that security forces often fired randomly into crowds, killing innocent bystand-
 ers and peaceful demonstrators.
 Security forces in eastern Nigeria demonstrated a similar willingness to use dead-
 ly force when confronted by peaceful demonstrators. In May the Movement to Save
 the Ogoni People (MOSOP), which alleges that the Government is systematically
 violating the Ogonis' human rights (see Section 5), staged a peaceful demonstration
 to protest an earlier violent confrontation between MOSOP sympathizers and secu-
 rity forces. According to eyewitness accounts, security forces fired into the protest-
 ers, killing one of them.
 Although there are no definitive statistics, Nigerian human rights groups main-
 tain that scores of people die annually while in police custody. The claims, though
 difficult to substantiate, are widely accepted by the Nigerian public and consistent
 with other credible reports of police abuse, including the use of torture to extract
 criminal confessions (see Section l.c.). In March the Civil Liberties Organization
 (CLO) publicized the case of Johnny Eshiet, who died while in police custody in Sep-
 tember 1992. The Ikeja police arrested Eshiet, a transport driver, after his vehicle
 was reported missing. The CLO reports that police officers bound Eshiet's hands
 and legs, hung him from the roof of an interrogation room, and flogged him with
 metal wires in an attempt to extract a confession from him that he arranged to have
 his vehicle stolen. An eyewitness reported observing Eshiet lying in a pool of blood
 after the interrogation. Plainclothes policemen took Eshiet to the hospital where he
 later died.
 Police and security services are seldom held accountable for the use of excessive,
 deadly force or the death of individuals while in custody. The Government made no
 effort to investigate the conduct of security forces during July's prodemocracy pro-
 tests and, despite pressure from CLO, there was no effort to investigate Eshiet's
 death. After the death in 1992 of an army colonel, Domven Rindam, at a police
 checkpoint, however, the authorities swiftly arrested and charged three policemen
 with murder. The celebrated case was pending before a Lagos high court at year's
 end. Rindam's death led police to dismantle most checkpoints, but violent crime in
 some parts of the country prompted police to maintain others. In June the press re-
 portedthat police killed a 21-year-old truck driver at a checkpint along the Port
 Harcourt-Aba expressway. No one was charged with the crime. The attempt to pun-
 ish Rindam's killers contrasted sharply with the Port Harcourt case and raised
 questions about the willingness to investigate extrajudicial killings when the victims
 are nonmilitary.
 b. Disappearance.-No politically motivated disappearances were reported. How-
 ever, government detention practices have the effect of causing many detainees to
 be "missing" for extended periods (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Constitutions in effect under the NDSC, the ING andthe PRC prohibit torture and
 mistreatment of prisoners and provided criminal sanctions for such excesses, and
 the Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction of evidence obtained through
 torture. Nevertheless, detainees frequently die while in custody (see Section L.a.),
 and there were credible reports that police seeking to extract confessions regularly
 beat and tortured suspects. For example, the CLO reported that after police from
 the Adeniji Adele station arrested Uzoma Okorie and Godson Erugo they stripped
 them naked, suspended them by their wrists from the roof of a police interrogation
 room, and flogged them. While beating Ms. Okorie, police placed the neck of a beer
 bottle in her vagina. The CLO reports that police rearrested and beat Okorie and
 Erugo after they tried to file a complaint with the divisional police commander. In
 another case, the CLO reports that police in Port Harcourt chained the hands and
 feet of detainee Madufuro lgwe, suspended him upside down from a ceiling fan, and
 flogged him with motorbike brake wire.
 In an interview with the CLO, Bertram Igwe, a public relations officer of the Riv-
 ers State Police Force sought to rationalize the use of torture: "There are helpless
 situations when you know that a suspect is deliberately telling lies and there is no
 other means you can use in cracking the case other than softening him." The Con-
 stitutional Rights Project conducted a nationwide police powers study that indicates
 Igwe's sentiments are shared by a large number of police officers: 67 percent of the
 0 cers interviewed conceded that, absent an efficient means of investigating a
 crime, torture becomes the easiest means of extracting information from suspects.
 
 
 Conditions in Nigeria's prisons continue to threaten life. Lack of potable water
 and sewage facilities and medical supplies contribute to deplorable sanitary condi-
 tions. Disease runs rampant in the cramped, poorly ventilated facilities. A 1993
 study of the Ikoyi prisons by the Lagos-based National Institute of Medical Research
 revealed that 28 percent of inmates had tuberculosis. The Institute warned that an
 epidemic could break out beyond prison walls unless steps were taken to treat in-
 mates. At most prisons, inmates are seldom allowed outside their cells for recre-
 ation, and many must provide their own food. In those cases, only those with money
 or whose relatives bring food have something to eat. Poor inmates rely on handouts
 from others to survive.
 There are credible reports that inmates are denied food and medical treatment
 as a form of punishment. It was widely reported, for example, that Beko Ransome-
 Kuti and Ken Sare-Wiwa were denied access to medical care after they were de-
 tained in July (see also Section .d.). Saro-Wiwa suffers from a heart condition, and
 his health deteriorated during his confinement. In some cases, prison officials and
 police deny inmates food and access to medical treatment to extort money from
 them.
 Overcrowding in Nigerian prisons also remains a serious problem. The CLO re-
 ported that cells designed to hold four inmates at the State Intelligence and Inves-
 tigation Bureau in Port Harcourt often contain more than 30. In October 1992, the
 Government created a task force on prison decorgestion to address this problem.
 The task force's mandate was to review prison conditions, prisoners' jail terms, their
 conduct, and, when ap ropriate, authorize prisoners' release. According to former
 Secretary for Internal fairs, Alhaji Abdulrahman, the task force had freed more
 than 4,000 prisoners since beginning its work. Many of those released had been de-
 tained without charge or had spent years in prison waiting for trial (see Section
 1.d.).
 While prison authorities are supposed to hand over to foster homes children born
 to women in prison, many children remain in detention with their mothers. Because
 soners are often expected to provide for themselves, it is often less costly for the
 vernment to keep children in prison with their mothers than it would be to place
 them in foster care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Nigerian criminal justice procedures call
 for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most categories of criminals. Inefficient
 administrative procedures, potty extortion, bureaucratic inertia, poor communication
 between police and prison officials, and inadequate transportation still result in con-
 siderable delays, often stretching several years, in bringing suspects to trial.
 Police are empowered to make arrests without warrants if there is reasonable sus-
 picion of an offense. These provisions give the police powers that are often abused.
 Nigerian law requires the arresting officer to inform the accused of charges at the
 time of arrest and take him or her to the station for processing within a reasonable
 time. The suspect is supposed to be given the opportunity to engage counsel and
 to post bail. Credible reports indicate that the police generally do not adhere to
 these safeguards. Suspects are often held incommunicado under harsh conditions for
 extended periods without charge. Arbitrary detention occurs frequently. Relatives
 and friends of wanted suspects are also commonly placed in detention without
 charge in an effort to induce the accused to present themselves to the police.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) provides
 that the Government may detain without charge persons suspected of acts preju-
 dicial to state security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When
 invoked by the Vice President, the Decree suspends the detainee's civil liberties and
 forbids judicial review of actions taken within its provisions. Many Nigerians still
 consider Decree Two the main threat to their basic freedoms because the judicial
 ouster clause encourages arbitrary detention by allowing officers to make arrests
 with impunity. Also, the definition of what constitutes acts prejudicial to state secu-
 rity or the nation's economic well-being can be very broadly interpreted.
 After July's prodemocracy demonstrations, the regime used Decree Two to arrest
 and silence Beko Ransome-Kuti, Femi Falana, and Gani Fawehinmi, leading mem-
 bers of the Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella human rights organization
 which was openly critical of the regime's decision to nullify the June 12 election re-
 sults. The CD had called for the July demonstrations. The Government charged the
 three men with conspiracy and sedition and held them in an Abuja prison for almost
 8 weeks. The regime ignored two court orders to produce the activists in court and,
 citing its powers under Decree Two, did not comply with a court order granting the
 detainees bail. The ING released them on August 30 but did not honor a promise
 to submit legislation to the National Assembly which would have repealed Decree
 Two. The PRC subsequently withdrew the charges, but Decree Two remains in
 force.
 
 
 216
 The regime detained Ken Saro-Wiwa, a leading human rights monitor and govern-
 ment critic, on three occasions: for brief periods on April 12 and 24, and for several
 weeks after June 21. Saro-Wiwa and MOSOP members maintain that the regime
 invoked Decree Two to detain him in June. While press reports that the regime
 planned to charge Saro-Wiwa with conspiracy and sedition make the MOSOP's con-
 tention plausible, the regime never publicly invoked Decree Two.
 The above cases were not isolated. The Government routinely detained human
 rights monitors, journalists (see Section 2.a.), and political opponents for making or
 publishing statements critical of the Government. In 1992 five human rights activ-
 ists, including Beko Ransome-Kuti, Gani Fawahinmi and Femi Falana, were de-
 tained under 1)ree Two and charged with treason. The case, which now appears
 to have become moot, was adjourned to February 1994.
 Most often the authorities did not charge the detainees with a crime, held them
 for only brief periods and questioned them about their activities and statements.
 The regime detained Ransome-Kuti without charge on three occasions before arrest-
 ing him in July and charging him with conspiracy and sedition. Gani Fawehinmi
 claimed that the Government had detained him 23 times since 1969. Fawehinmi is
 suing Babangida, who allegedly detained him 14 of the 23 times, for damages. In
 February the regime detained Panaf Olakanrni, a CD member, for 3 days, allegedly
 for possessing seditious materials. The same month, security agents raided the
 C LO's Lagos headquarters (see Section 4) and detained its President, Olisa
 Agbakoba and two others. After questioning them about their human rights and
 prodemocracy work, security agents warned the three men to refrain from engaging
 in subversive acts. In March security agents detained Funsho Omogbehin, a CLO
 member.
 After the regime nullified the June 12 elections, its arrests of human rights and
 7odemocracy advocates increased. The regime detained leading supporters of
 biola, the apparent winner of the June 12 election, includingOyo State politician
 Lanidi Adedibu and former governor of Kano State Abubakar Rimi.
 According to credible press reports, the Goverment asked Adedibu to sign a state-
 ment renouncing his support for Abiola and the June 12 elections. In August secu-
 rity agents detained 200 prodemocracy activists who staged a sit-in to protest mili-
 tary rule and the nullification of the June 12 election results. As the National As-
 sembly prepared to consider a motion endorsing an extension of Babangida's rule,
 security agents intervened, frequently detaining members for "questioning." Some
 members were held for as long as 24 hours. The authorities also arrested leading
 human rights monitors and labor leaders in Kaduna and Jos. They released the
 Kaduna monitors, who were not charged with a crime, after several days in deten-
 tion. However, they charged the Jos activists, who were distributing prodemocracy
 leaflets, with distributing seditious materials and then released them on bail.
 Nigeria's total prison population is estimated at 65,000. Human rights groups es-
 timate that as much as 46 percent of this population is awaiting trial. A precise fig-
 ure for the number of individuals detainedi without charge is unavailable. There are
 no credible estimates of the number of political detainees.
 There were no known instances of forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-Decree One of 1984, the Basic Constitution (Modi-
 fication and Suspension) Decree, the first decree promulgated by the military offi-
 cers who overthrew the civilian regime of President Shagari in 1983, left the institu-
 tional framework of the udiciary relatively intact but established a arallel system
 of military tribunals wit sole jurisdiction over certain offenses, suc  as coup-plot-
 ting, corruption, armed robbery, and illega ale of petroleum. A 1991 Decree
 amended Decree One by providing that only sitting or retired civilian judges may
 preside over tribunals hearing nonmilitary cases.
 In most cases before the tribunals, the accused have the right to legal counsel,
 bail, and appeal, though some tribunals substitute a presumption of guilt for the
 presumption of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals reportedly exceed
 conviction rates in the regular courts. Sentences are generally severe.
 Convictions for armed robbery by the Special Robbery and Firearms Tribunals, as
 well as convictions under the Treason and Treasonable Offenses Tribunal, carry the
 death penalty with no right of appeal. In the ase of armed robbery, death sentences
 are confirmed by the state governor. Until Auust 26, when General Babangida in-
 stalled the ING, the NDSC was responsible or onfirming treason sentences. At
 year's end, it was unclear what organ of the Government had assumed this respon-
 sibility. Convictions before the Miscellaneous Offenses Tribunal and the Recovery of
 Public Property Tribunal may not be appealed in the regular courts, though there
 is provision for appeal before the Special Appeals Tribunal.
 The Government's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the constitutional
 court system, seriously undermines the judiciarys indepnendce and often results
 
 
 in legal proceedings that deny defendants due process. For example, after 1992's
 ethnoreligious disturbances in Zangon Kataf, the regime created two special tribu-
 nals to try those allegedly involved in the riots. Defendants charged before the tri-
 bunals were denied the right to appeal the decisions. In early 1993, the tribunals
 sentenced 15 people to death. One of the tribunal chairmen, retired Justice Benedict
 Okadigbo, demonstrated little regard for due process throughout the hearings. There
 were credible reports that during the trial of six individuals, including retired Major
 General Zamani Lekwot, Okadigbo expressed his unhappiness with the defense at-
 torneys' line of questioning and threatened to jail them if they continued. Human
 rights groups charged that proceedings before the Okadigbo tribunal were subject
 to political influence and that Okadigbo was more interested in securing convictions
 than in securing justice. The resignation of a tribunal member, who alleged that the
 other justices regularly met and gave judgments on cases without consulting him,
 lent credence to these allegations. To prevent human rights groups from challenging
 the tribunals' decisions, the regime promulgated a decree which removed the au-
 thority of the regular courts to hear any case regarding any abuse of constitutional
 rights by the tribunals. In August General Babangida commuted the sentences of
 those convicted by the Zangon Kataf tribunals from execution to 5 years in prison.
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state trial courts, state
 appeals courts, the Federal Court of Appeal, and the Federal Supreme Court. Under
 the 1979 Constitution, courts of first instance include magistrate or district courts,
 customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and for some specified cases, the
 state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court has juris-
 diction. In rinciple, customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if both
 plaintiff an defendant agree to it, though in practice fear of legal costs, delay, and
 distance to alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these courts.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally protected individual rights. Lawyers in court frequently referred to rights
 protected by the (then suspended) 1979 and (unimplemented) 1989 constitutions,
 and in cases where the Government had no direct interest, these rights were gen-
 erally respected. They include a presumption of innocence, the right to be present,
 to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented by legal counsel.
 Free legal counsel is available through the Legal Aid Council for persons charged
 with capital crimes, but the Council is inadequately funded to provide assistance to
 all persons charged with lesser crimes. There is a legal provision for bail, but many
 human rights groups charge that it is underutilized. Bail is denied to those charged
 with murder, armed robbery, and drug offenses. There are no legal prvisions bar-
 ring women or other groups from testifying in civil court or iving their testimony
 less weight. The testimony of women is, however, accorded les weight in Shari'a
 courts. There is a widespread perception that judges in both the regular and Shari'a
 courts are easily bribed, or settled," and that the courts cannot be relied upon to
 render an impartial judgment.
 Despite Nigeria's established legal tradition, the judiciarys independence and in-
 tegrity are a so undercut by the Government's frequent refusal to respect court rul-
 ings. For example, the regime ignored a court order requiringthat it produce de-
 tained human rights monitors Ransome-Kuti, Fawehinmi, and Falana, in court (see
 Section 1.d.). While some judges, like the justice who ordered the regime to show
 cause for its detention of the editors of Tell magazine (see Section 2.a.), are prepared
 to challenge the Government, many are not. This was best illustrated in 1993 by
 a Supreme Court decision in a case challenging the regime's authority to nullify the
 June 12 elections. The Supreme Court ruled that the decrees represented the su-
 preme law of the land.
 In addition, there is a perception that in cases which touch upon important gov-
 ernment interests, the Government manipulates the courts. Early in the year,
 prodemocracy groups threatened to file a suit challenging the regime's decision to
 cancel the 1992 primaries and extend its rule by 8 months. The regime responded
 by reminding Nigerians that the decrees on which its actions were based contained
 judicial ouster clauses, prohibiting judicial review of its actions. The regime, its
 spokesmen said, was not subject to any court orders touching upon the transition
 program. In June, however, the regime chose to respect an Abuja high court re-
 straining order prohibiting the National Electoral Commission (NEC) from releasing
 the June 12 results. This decision followed an earlier government decision to ignore
 a court order forbidding the NEC from conducting the elections. The regime's selec-
 tivity did not escape the notice of Nigerians, many of whom charged that the re-
 gime's newfound respect for the rule of law was rooted in its unhappiness with the
 election results. Shortly afterward, General Babangida nullified the election.
 The two civilians and nine army officers, convicted in connection with an April
 1990 coup attempt after an unfair secret trial before a Special Military Tribunal,
 
 
 continued to be held incommunicado at year's end. Otherwise, there were no reports
 of political prisoners in Nigeria.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide for the rights to privacy in the home, in cor-
 respondence, and in oral electronic communications, but those Constitutions, as
 noted, were suspended throughout the year. In fact, human rights leaders allege
 that they are regularly followed and that their organizations' telephones are cut or
 tapped by security agents. Given statements made by police officials in late 1992
 and early 1993 that security agencies (were) monitoring the activities of a human
 rights activist', these claims seem credible.
 Also, in January Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka complained that immigration and
 customs officials harassed him at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and in
 June Soyinka charged that security agents monitored his movements. Soyinka also
 alleged that a police helicopter frequently hovered around his home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1979 Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and the press, and the three governments that controlled Nigeria during
 1993 repeatedly reaffirmed their commitment to both principles. In practice, how-
 ever, the Babangida regime regularly violated these guarantees and conducted a
 vigorous campaign to silence its critics in the press. While the ING did not routinely
 arrest and detain journalists, neither did it honor its pledge to repeal decrees limit-
 ing freedom of the press, nor did it permit media organizations closed by the
 Babangida regime to reopen. The PRC permitted media houses to reopen but did
 not repeal the objectionable decrees.
 Security agents often prevented human rights monitors from discussing the Gov-
 ernment's human rights record and criticizing the transition program. During April
 security agnts detained Abdul Oroh, the CLO's Executive Secretary, and Nimmo
 Bassey and prevented them from speaking at the opening of a new CLO chapter
 in Benin City. Also in April, Delta tate police prevented Ken Saro-Wiwa from de-
 livering a lecture and forcibly escorted him from the state. After General Babangida
 installed the Interim National Government, Attorney General Clement Akpamgbo
 announced that reference to the nullified June 12 election constituted a criminal act.
 The Babangida regime regularly detained journalists, often charging them with
 conspiracy or sedition, for publishing material critical of the Government or which
 the Government deemed inflammatory. In March after The Reporter, a northern
 daily, published a front-page commentary titled, "Nigeria's prevailing mess:
 (Babangida) to blame," the regime proscribed the newspaper and jailed its editor,
 Mallam Hayatu. Also in March, security agents arrested the editors of The News
 and charged them with contempt of court, allegedly for publishing sealed court docu-
 ments. There are credible reports, however, that the regime arrested the editors to
 punish them for their magazine's consistent criticism of government policies. In
 April the Government arrested Innocent Okoye, editor of The Satellite, and Chris
 Okolie, publisher of Newbreed magazine after they printed articles critical of the re-
 me. The regime arrested the editors of Tell magazine in May and again in August.
 n the second instance, the regime ignored a court order to produce the editors in
 court and provide a justification for their detention. It subsequently released the
 editors but char ged them with possessing seditious documents. The PRC dropped
 the charges on November 30.
 The Babangida government waged an aggressive campaign (often relying on in-
 formers) to silence Tell and The News, magazines which consistently published arti-
 cles critical of the regime and its transition program. In April and May, security
 agents seized thousands of issues of both magazines-at one point seizing three suc-
 cessive issues of Tell. In May security agents seized 42,000 co pies of an edition of
 The News which contained an article characterizing General Babangida as 'careless,
 incompetent, and unprincipled." The authorities frequently detainedvendors caught
 selling either magazine without bringing charges. The regime justified its seizures
 of Tell and The News by alleging that two unpublished decrees proscribed the maga-
 zines' circulation.
 On May 2, the regime promulgated the Treason and Treasonable Offenses Decree,
 which permits it to prosecute anyone who conspires either with himself or any
 other person in Nigeria or outside Nigeria by words or publication to disrupt the
 general fabric of the country or any part of it." The Government may impose the
 death penalty on individuals convicted under the Decree, which is so broadly worded
 that almost any criticism of the Government could violate its provisions. On May
 22, the regime, perhaps in response to intense domestic and international criticism,
 reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of the press and announced that it was "set-
 ting aside" the Decree. The regime did not repeal the Decree, however, and on the
 
 
 same day it made the announcement, State Security Service agents seized 80,000
 copies of The News.
 In June the regime promulgated the Offensive Publications (Proscription) Decree,
 Decree 35, which empowered it to proscribe or order the seizure of any publication
 containing any article or material likely to disrupt the transition to democracy. Like
 the treason Decree, Decree 35 is so broadly worded that almost any criticism of the
 transition program could provide sufficient grounds for the seizure or proscription
 of the publication in which it appeared.
 Regime attacks on the press intensified after nullification of the June 12 election
 results. In July it closed six media houses, including the Concord group, owned by
 M.K.O. Abiola, the apparent winner on June 12. All six media houses were strongly
 critical of the regime's nullification of the election and repeatedly urged the govern-
 ment to release and respect the results. Secretary for Information and Culture,
 Uche Chukwumerije, claimed the media houses were closed because they had "mort-
 gaged their professional ethics for money" and engaged in "irresponsible journal-
 ism." Official anger over the media houses' criticism is a much more plausible expla-
 nation for their closure. The regime permitted two of the media houses to reope,
 though one was open only "commercially" and restricted from publishing. We
 Babangida regime promulgated a decree banning 10 publications of the other 4
 media houses, including The National Concord, The Punch, The Sketch, and The
 Observer. The PRC allowed them to reopen in November.
 Also in August, the Babangida regime promulgated Decree 43, which prescribed
 new registration guidelines for all newspapers and was designed to control the press
 and silence its criticism of the regime. The guidelines require the payment of reg-
 istration fees of approximately $10,000 and approval of a registration application by
 a newspaper registration beard whose members are appointed by the Secretary for
 Information and Culture. The Decree lays out tough penalties, including prison
 terms and fines, for the circulation of unregistered newspapers and publication of
 false statements. It requires also that every issue display the names and addresses
 of its owners, publishers and printers. Registration must be renewed annually. In
 September the Interim National Government intimated that it would delay enforce-
 ment of Decree 43 until December. It also announced that it was the responsibility
 of the National Assembly, not the ING, to repeal the Decree. The Assembly was not
 able to do so before General Abacha's military regime dissolved it.
 Nigeria's universities were closed on May 3 because of a strike by the Academic
 Staff of Universities Union (ASUU, see Section 6). In early October, the strike ended
 and the universities reopened. The Government lifted its bans on the ASUU and
 the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) in 1993. Academic freedom
 is generally respected, although some groups allege that government security agents
 maintain an active undercover presence on the campuses and that university au-
 thorities act at the behest of the Government to suspend or expel student activists.
 Student political activists continued to face harassment from university and security
 officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although all Nigerian constitu-
 tions have provided all citizens the right to assemble freely and to associate with
 other persons in political parties, trade unions, or other special interest associations,
 only two political parties were permitted in 1993, and the PRC dissolved them on
 November 18. In addition, Abacha's first speech as Head of State declared that "all
 processions, political meetings and associations of any type in any part of the coun-
 try are hereby banned."
 The PRC's predecessors did not normally require permits for public meetings in-
 doors, and permit requirements for outdoor public functions were often ignored.
 However, on the authority of Decree Five the Babangida regime banned gatherings
 whose political, ethnic, or religious overtones it feared might lead to unrest. In Jan-
 uary Osun State authorities, fearing protests by prodemocracy activists, banned
 public demonstrations and processions. In June Bauchi State authorities announced
 a similar ban aimed at preventing prodemocracy demonstrations in the wake of the
 regime's nullification of the June 12 election. Open-air religious services away from
 places of worship remain prohibited in most states due to religious tensions in var-
 ious parts of the country.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special interest organizations,
 including religious groups, trade groups, women's organizations, and professional as-
 sociations. Such organizations need not register with the Government and are gen-
 erally permitted free association with other national and foreign bodies. Members
 of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) accused the regime of interfering with their
 right to freedom of association, however. In February 1993, the regime promulgated
 Decree 21, the Legal Practitioners (amended) Decree, which empowered Nigeria s at-
 torneys to manage the NBA's affairs and conduct elections for its national executive
 
 
 220
 committee. After a disputed presidential election in 1992 the NBA was thrown into
 crisis. The regime allegedly tried to take control of the NBA by backing a candidate
 (ING Secretary for Transport and Aviation and PRC Minister for Power and Steel
 Alhaji Dalhatu) friendly to it but, having failed, used the NBA's internal disarray
 as an excuse to try again by means of Decree 21. The NBA was challenging Decree
 21 in court at year's end.
 In May the regime banned several political organizations which it contended were
 founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial lines for the pur-
 pose of sponsoring various political candidates. The organizations remained banned
 under the ING and the PRC.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Decree One (suspending most of the 1979 Constitution)
 and the unimplemented 1989 Constitution prohibit federal and state governments
 from adopting an official state religion. In addition the PRC has made it clear that,
 whatever emerges from the planned constitutionai conference, Nigeria will remain
 a secular state. The 1979 and 1989 constitutional provisions for freedom of belief,
 practice, and education in regard to religion aregenerally respected. The Govern-
 ment instituted a ban in 1987 (which is still in effect) on religious organizations on
 schoolgrounds at the primary level. Individual students retain the right to practice
 their religion in recognized places of worship.
 Distribution of religious publications is generally unrestricted. There is a lightly
 enforced ban on published religious advertisements and religious programming on
 television and radio remains closely controlled by dle Government. Both Christian
 and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immi-
 gration Department were restricting the entry into the country of certain religious
 practitioners, particularly persons suspected of proselytizing. Religious practitioners
 operating schools, institutions, or medical facilities generally were not affected, nor
 were those seeking renewal of existing residence permits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Nigeri a's 1979 and 1989 Constitutions entitle its citizens to move freely
 throughout the country and to reside where they wish. They also prohibit expulsion
 or the denial of exit or entry to any Nigerian citizen. In practice, Nigerians travel
 abroad in large numbers, and thousands are engaged overseas in work and study.
 Exit visas are not required.
 However, the Babangida regime for political reasons occasionally prevented travel.
 In June the regime seized Ken Saro-Wiwa's passport and refused to release Olisa
 Agbakoba's passport, which it had seized the previous year, preventing them from
 traveling to Vienna to attend the World Conference on Human Rights. The regime
 returned Saro-Wiwa's passport in September after his release from detention (see
 Section 1.d.) and Agbakoba's shortly afterwards. In September authorities briefly
 seized and held Wole Soyinka's passport. Citizens leaving Nigeria have the right to
 reenter, and citizenship may not be revoked for an reason.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum in Nigeria for po-
 litical refugees from other countries. Nigeria supports and cooperates with the Lagos
 office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A Liberian
 refugee camp, with an estimated population of 3 000, continued to oprate in Ogun
 state. There is also an undeterminednumber of Chadian refugees residing primarily
 in the northern border area. There were no reports that refugee.l were expelled from
 Nigeria in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens did not have this right in 1993. Throughout most of 1993 the NDSC,
 headed by General Babangida, remained the highest authority in the land. On Au-
 gust 26, Babangida announced that he was leaving office and installed an Interim
 National Government (ING) headed by Ernest Shonekan, a civilian. The ING, which
 was supposed to organize new elections and hand over power in March 1994, in-
 cluded a number of officials, civilian and military, from the Babangida regime and
 continued to rule by decree. The PRC, which took power November 17 banned all
 political institutions and parties. It announced plans for a constitutional conference,
 but national elections before 1995 are unlikely.
 After canceling presidential primaries in late 1992, General Babangida promul-
 gated Decree 52, which extended military rule by 8 months until August 27, 1993,
 and laid out a new election process and schedule. Presidential candidates were re-
 quired to win nominating conventions at the ward, local, state and, finally, the na-
 tional level before squaring off in June 12 elections. The 23 individuals who com-
 peted in the canceled 1992 presidential primaries were banned from contesting the
 new election.
 
 
 221
 In 1989 the Government created the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Na-
 tional Republican Convention (NRC), wrote their manifestos, constitutions, and plat-
 forms, and gave them the exclusive right to contest elections. From February to
 April 1993, the SDP and the NRC conducted nominating conventions under the
 close supervision of the Government. M.K.O. Abiola emerged as the SDP presi-
 dential candidate, while Bashir Tofa secured the NRC nomination.
 On June 12, Nigerians voted in what national and international observers judged
 the freest and fairest election in the country's history. However, this assessment did
 not take account of the process leading to election day which was marred by exten-
 sive manipulation by the military regime, including the exclusion of many prospec-
 tive candidates. Early official results and unofficial returns appeared to indicate
 that Abiola had won a landslide victory. However, before the National Electoral
 Commission could announce formal results, an Abuja high court issued a restraining
 order blocking their release. The court issued the order after an organization seek-
 ing to extend military rule filed a suit challenging the election's validity. On June
 23, General Babangida nullified the election results, claiming that he and the NDSC
 had uncovered evidence of widespread electoral fraud, but he never presented any
 evidence to substantiate his allegation. Many Nigerians believe that he canceled the
 election because he opposed the results.
 General Babangida's action in nullifying the June 12 election results produced
 massive public protests and civil disobedience campaigns. It lead to a standoff be-
 tween Babangida and the unofficial winner, Abiola, with strong elements of a strug-
 gle between military and civilians. His action also ignited longstanding ethnic ani-
 mosities and briefly raised the spectre of civil war. Subsequently, Olusegun
 Obasanjo, a former head of state, and others played important mediating roles in
 advocating an all-civilian interim government.
 The ING, however, proved incapable of dealing with Nigeria's problems. At the
 urging (some say demand) of General Abacha and others, ING Chairman Shonekan
 resigned on November 17. Abacha installed himself as Head of State and estab-
 lished the military-dominated PRC. He also named a largely civilian cabinet which
 included some prominent prodemocracy and human rights activists. Reneging on an
 earlier promise, Abacha named military officers rather than civilians to replace the
 elected civilian governors whom he had dismissed. Local Government councils were
 left in the hands of civilians, but Nigerians will not have an opportunity peacefully
 to change their government at any level until the proposed constitutional conference
 completes its work and a timetable for the return to democracy is implemented.
 At the party conventions and in the June 12 election, voters cast their ballots by
 a "modified open-secret system." Under this system voters balloted privately but re-
 mained at the conventions and polling stations while election officials publicly tab-
 ulated the results.
 Men continue to dominate Nigerian politics. However, there are no legal impedi-
 ments to political participation or voting by women or any other minority group.
 One woman served in the 91-member Senate, and 6 women served in the 589-mem-
 ber House of Representatives. Several women ran for President and at the SDP con-
 vention one woman, Sarah Jibril, finished fourth in the balloting. One woman held
 a cabinet position in the Interim National Government, and there were two female
 deputy governors. There is 1 woman in the 32-member FEC, but no woman is a
 member of the PRC.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups across a broad spectrum are engaged in the vocal and public
 campaign for the promotion of human rights in Nigeria. Among the most active are:
 the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO); the Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights (CDHR); the Constitutional Rights Project; the National Association of Demo-
 cratic Lawyers; Human Rights Africa; the Legal Research and Resource Develop-
 ment Center; the National Association of University Women; the International Fed-
 eration of Women Lawyers; and the Human Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar
 Association. A number of prominent authors, including Nobel laureate Wole
 Soyinka, artists, educators, and jurists, in addition to professional and iabor organi-
 zations, have spoken out frequently on human rights issues.
 The Government often interfered with the activities of human rights organiza-
 tions detaining their members (see Section 1.d.) and preventing them from criticiz-
 ing the Government's human rights record (see Section 2.a.). Detentions increased
 after the Government nullified the June 12 election. In addition to incidents out-
 lined in other sections of the report, in February police and security agents raided
 the CLO's Lagos office and confiscated membership lists, financial statements, and
 the manuscript of a report titled, "Prisoner in the Shadows-a report on women and
 
 
 222
 children in selected Nigerian prisons." On the same day, security agents searched
 the home of CLO President Olisa Agbakoba and the home of CDHR member Chima
 Ubani. Security agents also detained Agbakoba (see Section 1.d.). On occasion, the
 Government harassed family members of human rights leaders.
 High-level government officials regularly denounced the activities of Nigeria's
 human rights community, often accusing its members of participating in foreign-in-
 spired plots to destabilize the country. There are credible reports that the State Se-
 curity Service engaged in a campaign to discredit human rights leaders by distribut-
 ing leaflets and hanging posters alleging that they were interested only in political
 self-promotion or stirring up ethnic divisions (see also Section 1.f.).
 In June the regime sent a diplomatic note to all diplomatic missions rnd inter-
 national organizations present in Nigeria deploring diplomatic contact with human
 rights groups, which it labeled "subversive. The note threatened that the regime
 would take approriate measures to protect its national security" if diplomats con-
 tinued meeting with human rights groups. U.S. and other diplomats continued *to
 meet with such groups. Foreign human rights groups ar, permitted to visit Nigeria.
 The Government occasionally responds to domestic human rights charges, though
 often not constructively. For example, the Government often claims that its attacks
 on the press (see Section 2.a.) are a response to irresponsible journalism.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment,
 but women often experience discrimination because the Goverment tolerates cus-
 tomary and religious practices which adversely affect them. Women do not receive
 equal pay for equal work and often find it extremely difficult to acquire commercial
 credit or obtain tax deductions or rebates as the heads of households.
 While some women have made considerable individual progress, both in the aca-
 demic and business world, most women are underprivileged. According to a 1990
 U.N. Children Fund's (UNICEF) report. fewer than 10 percent of Nigeria's women
 are employed in nonfarming occupations. Though women are not legally barred from
 owning land, under customary land tenure systems only men own land, and women
 ain access to land through marriage. In addition, under law a woman may not in-
 erit her husband's property unless she can prove that she contributed to the acqui-
 sition of the property. Many customary practices do not even recognize a wom'n's
 right to inherit her husband's property, and many widows are rendered destitute
 when their in-laws take virtually all of the deceased "husband's property," often
 leaving the woman with barely the clothes she is wearing. Polygamy is widely prac-
 ticed among all Nigerian ethnic groups in both Christian and Islamic communities.
 Reports of wife abuse are common, especially in polygamous families. Police do
 not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and they are seldom discussed publicly.
 In more traditional areas, it is questionable whether the courts and police actively
 intervene to protect women who formally accuse their husbands if the level of al-
 leged abuse does not exceed customary norms in the area. Purdah, the Islamic prac-
 tice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men outside the family, is preva-
 lent in parts of Nigeria's far north. A number of factors affect the strictness with
 which seclusion is enforced, including the husband's wishes and his socioeconomic
 status.
 An estimated 100,000 Nigerian women suffer from vesico-vaginal fistula. Approxi-
 mately 83 percent of the cases result from prolonged labor among underage women.
 Another 13 percent reportedly result from the primitive Hausa/Fulani practice
 known as "gishiri cut," whereby a pregnant woman is cut open through the genital
 organs, damaging the bladder or rectum, in a frantic bid to release the fetus.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's welfare has been more
 sporadic than deliberate, and it devotes only limited resources to children's welfare,
 though the amount of money spent on children's health projects has increased in
 recent years. Nigerian laws designed to protect the rights of children, such as child
 labor laws and the 1964 Children and Young Persons Act, are often obsolete, inad-
 equate, and seldom enforced. Although the law stipulates that "no child shall be or-
 dered to be imprisoned" in Nigeria, juvenile offenders are routinely denied bail and
 incarcerated along with hardened criminals. Juvenile courts often ignore proper pro-
 cedures, and there is little effort to explain the nature of the offense to defendants.
 The Government only occasionally condemns child abuse and neglect and makes lit-
 tle effort to stop customary practices, such as the sale of children into marriage.
 "Remand homes," as Nigerian reform schools are known, are very protective of their
 inmates, but necessary elements such as varied and sufficient food, medical care,
 health precautions and recreation arc lacking.
 
 
 223
 Nigerian law provides that "no child should be engaged or be employed in street
 trading." However, the Government condones street trading, and young boys and
 girls are prevalent in Nigeria's market stalls and hawking a variety of wares in the
 ubiquitous traffic jams. Inordinate numbers of street children are prevalent
 throughout Nigeria and many, known as "area boys," often resort to crime and har-
 assment of traders, pedestrians, and drivers. The Government periodically rounds
 up and detains these children with no regard for due process.
 Despite government efforts, labor, political, and other problems plague Nigeria's
 education system, and many children go without any formal education. Parents are
 often forced to remove children from school for economic reasons. There are credible
 reports that poor families often sell their daughters into marriage as a means of
 supplementing their incomes. There are also reports that many young girls are
 forced into marriage as soon as they reach puberty, regardless of age, to prevent
 "indecency" associated with premarital sex.
 The Government publicly opposes female genital multilation (circumcision). Nige-
 ria was one of five countries which sponsored a resolution at the 46th World Health
 Assembly calling for the elimination of harmful health practices, including female
 genital mutilation. However, most Nigerian ethnic groups circumcise young females.
 Nigerian experts estimate that as many as 50 percent of Nigerian girls/women-vir-
 tually 100 percent in the primarily Christian south, and fewer in the Muslim
 north-have undergone female genital mutilation which varies from simple removal
 of the labia minors to removal of the clitoris to the most dangerous form,
 infibulation. The age at which females are circumcised varies from the first week
 of life to after a woman delivers her first child. Some groups circumcise prior to
 marriage; others during pregnancy, believing that if the head of the child touches
 the clitoris during delivery, the child will die. The Federal Ministry of Health and
 nongovernmental organizations sponsor public awareness and education projects to
 inform communities of the health hazards associated with female genital mutilation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no official policy of discrimination
 against any of Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not favor one group over
 another. However, Nigeria has a long history of tension among its diverse ethnic
 groups. Clashes between rival ethnic groups in Delta, Rivers, and Taraba States
 often resulted in bloodshed. Tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on
 individual government officials to favor their own ethnic group, and ethnic favor-
 itism persists.
 The Ogoni, an ethnic group indigenous to Rivers State in eastern Nigeria (Nige-
 ria's oil producing region), charge that the Government engages in a systematic
 campaign to deprive them of their land and its wealth. The Ogonis claim that the
 Government seizes Ogoni property without fair compensation, ignores the environ-
 mental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and fails to provide adequate social
 services, such as water and electricity. The Movement to Save the Ogoni People,
 which is campaigning for greater Ogoni autonomy, often describes government pol-
 icy towards the Ogoni as genocide. While the confrontation between the Government
 and the Ogoni has occasionaly turned violent (see Section L.a.) and Ogoni concerns
 about environmental degradation and the quality of social services in the oil produc-
 ing region have some merit, accusations that the Government is engaged in a geno-
 cidal campaign against the Ogoni are unfounded.
 Religious Minorities. -Nigerian law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonethe-
 less, it is commonly reported that government officials often discriminate against
 persons practicing a religion different from their own. Religious tensions often lead
 to violence, as in 1992 when clashes between Muslims and Christians in Kaduna
 State resulted in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of deaths. Many Christian leaders
 allege that the civil disturbance tribunals established to try those accused of inciting
 the Zangon Kataf riots were biased against Christian defendants. The composition
 of the six-member Okadigbo tribunal, which included four Muslims, reinforced this
 impression. While it is unclear if a defendant's religion influenced the tribunal's
 judgments accusations that the tribunal did not adequately safeguard defendants'
 right to a free and fair trial are credible (see Section i.e.).
 People with Disabilities. -The Government called for private businesses to insti-
 tute policies ensuring fair treatment for the 2 percent of the work force that it
 claims is disabled. It as not, however, enacted any laws nor formulated any policy
 which specifically ensures the right of the disabled to work, nor has it mandated
 what action should be taken if employers discriminate against the disabled.
 While there is nothing which would indicate systematic discrimination against the
 disabled, disabled workers must compete in an economy in which many nondisabled
 are unemployed and underemployed. In addition Nigeria's poor infrastructure
 makes it difficult for the disabled to get to work, making them less attractive to em-
 ployers. Few office buildings have access ramps for wheelchairs, and many have cle-
 
 
 224
 vatorm that work sporadically, if at all. Public transportation, when and where avail-
 able, is not equipped to handle wheelchairs.
 While the Government appears desirous of providing education for all handi-
 capped children and adults, Nigeria's economic crisis and lack of adequate infra-
 structure make it difficult to allocate sufficient resources to meet the disabled popu-
 lation's needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 The Babangida regime and the interim government that succeeded it made few
 changes in labor law. The interim government restructured the Nigeria Labour Con-
 gress in August, merging unions to reduce the number of affiliates from 41 to 29.
 a. The Right of Association.-Nigerian workers, except members of the armed
 forces and employees designated essential by the Government, may join trade
 unions. Essential employees include firefighters, police, employees of the Central
 Bank, the security printers (printers of currency, passports, and government forms),
 and customs and excise staff. Primary, secondary, and university teachers were
 added to the list of essential personnel in May. They fall into a special category,
 however, as they are allowed to organize but not to strike. The National Labour
 Congress (NLC), Nigeria's umbrella labor federation, repeatedly called on the re-
 ime to reinstate unions in all sectors of the economy except for the armed forces,
 efighters, and police. Neither the ING nor the PRC rescinded the relevant decree.
 The vast majority (approximately 72 percent) of the Nigerian work force is em-
 ployed in agriculture.   a agicutural workers are unionized. Domestic workers,
 most of the informal sector, and practically all small industries and businesses re-
 main nonunionized. Approximately 11.5 percent of the total work force belong to
 unions. Government decrees and policy continue to restrict labor freedoms. In con-
 travention of the International La bor Organiation (ILO) Convention on Freedom of
 Association, the Government has decreed a single central labor body, the NLC, and
 deregistered all other union federations.
 The Government continued to resist attempts by senior government staff to form
 and register as an independent labor association the Senior Staff Consultative Asso-
 ciation of Nigeria (SESCAN). It refused to register SESCAN affiliates as authorized
 labor organizations and did not allow employers to deduct SESCAN dues from em-
 ployees' paychecks.
 The NC claims 3.5 million members out of a total work force of over 30 million,
 but this figure is difficult to verify. Although the population has grown and the work
 force has increased, endemic economic problems have probably contributed to a de-
 cline in union membership.
 Under Nigerian labor law, any nonagricultural enterprise which employs more
 than 50 employees is obliged to recognize trade unions and must pay or deduct a
 dues checkoff for employees who are members. The NLC has complained that some
 employers deliberately organize their industries into multiple units employing less
 than 50 workers to avoid unionization. When the NLC called a general strike in Au-
 gust, the regime threatened to withdraw the dues checkoff provision and make the
 payment of union dues completely voluntar. Organized labor condemned this pro-
 posal, and the ING dropped it when the strike ended.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case of essential services
 as defined by the Government. There are no laws prohibiting retribution against
 strikers and strike leaders. However, strikers who feel they are facing unfair ret-
 ribution may submit their cases to the Industrial Arbitration Court. Its decisions
 are binding on all parties.
 During 1992 and 1993, a rapidly declining economy and the regime's annulment
 of the June 12 election resulted in a growing wave of protracted labor disputes, cul-
 minating in the NLC's August 28-September 6 general strike and a series of general
 strikes sponsored by the Campaign for Democracy (CD) and other government oppo-
 nents. Although the security forces detained and harassed some of the more out-
 spoken labor leaders, they did not make a systematic attempt to stop the strikes.
 There were no mass arrests of striking workers or violent confrontations between
 strikers and the security forces.
 In May the regime promulgated the Teaching Essential Services Decree, which
 declared education an essential service. Although education-sector unions were not
 proscribed, the Decree called for the dismissal of teachers who participate in a strike
 that is longer than 1 week in duration. In July the regime banned the Academic
 Staff Union of Universities, which had been on strike since May, and issued dismis-
 sal notices to striking university teachers. The strikers ignored the dismissals, and
 the regime later rescinded the ban and reinstated the strikers without penalty.
 The ILO continues to criticize the Nigerian Labor Code, which it asserts allows
 a number of practices that run counter to ILO conventions. These include Nigeria's
 
 
 225
 single trade union system, the ban on organizing for certain categories of workers
 the broad powers of the Government to supervise union accounts at any time, and
 restrictions on the right to strike.
 In August 1991, the regime's Decree 32 amended a policy held since 1975 which
 permitted international labor affiliation only with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU) and affiliated pan-African labor federations. Decree 32 par-
 tially repealed the ban by allowing affiliation with non-African international labor
 organizations, but only for training and education assistance.
 The transition to civil rule program promulgated during the Babanida regime
 made it illegal for the NLC to engage in partisan politics. Despite this, the NLC
 publicly endorsed the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and NLC President Paschal
 Bafyau lobbied vigorously to be named the SDP's vice presidential candidate in the
 June 12 election. Neither the NLC nor Bafyau was sanctioned for their political ac-
 tivities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor laws permit both
 the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively between management and
 trade unions. Collective bargaining is in fact common in many sectors of the econ-
 omy. However, the Government retains broad authority over labor matters and can
 intervene forcefully in labor disputes which it feels contravene its essential political
 or economic programs.
 There are provisions against antiunion discrimination in the Trade Dispute Act
 of 1976. Nigerian law further protects workers against retaliation by employers for
 labor activity through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian Industrial
 Court, which handles complaints of antiunion discrimination. The NLC has com-
 plained, however that the Nigerian judicial system is often slow to handle labor
 cases and that this constitutes a denial of redress to those with legitimate com-
 plaints. Courts have compelled several employers to reinstate fired union activists.
 The Ministry of Labor has tried to restrict its role to the enforcement of minimum
 wage and freedom of association laws. In January 1991 the Government abolished
 the uniform wage structure for all government entities. Now each tier of govern-
 ment--federal, state, lcal, and state-owned firms--is free to negotiate its own level
 of wages, benefits, and conditions of employment. As a result, negotiations pre-
 viously conducted on a nationwide basis under the direct supervision of the Labor
 Ministry, are now conducted on a local, often plant-wide, basis with less government
 involvement.
 General Babangida laid the cornerstone for an export processing zone in Calabar
 on November 8, 1991. As of the end of 1993, the regime had not addressed the
 shape of labor relations within the zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1979 Constitution (and the
 1989 Constitution, which formed the basis for most jurisprudence during 1993) pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor, and this prohibition has long been generally ob-
 served in practice. The ILO, noting that the 1989 Constitution had been suspended,
 asked the Government to indicate how the ILO Convention against forced labor
 would be enforced in the absence of constitutional guarantees. The ILO has also
 pointed out that Nigerian legislation regarding punishment for illegal strikes,
 breaches of labor discipline by merchant seamen, and compulsory arbitration may
 be in violation of the ILO Convention of the Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory
 Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1974 Labor Decree prohibits
 employment of children under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and re-
 stricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work. The labor law
 prohibits the employment of children in agricultural or domestic work for more than
 8 hours per day. The 1974 Decree allows the apprenticeship of youths aged 13 to
 15 under specific conditions. Apprenticeship exists in a wide range of crafts, trades,
 and state-owned enterprises.
 Primary education is compulsory in Nigeria, though the law is rarely enforced and
 recent studies show declining enrollment. The Government and UNICEF estimate
 that in 1987 primary school enrollment probably peaked at around 61 percent, de-
 clined steadily thereafter, and may have droppedbelow 50 percent during 1993. The
 principal cause for the decline has been continuing deterioration of public schools.
 his lack of sufficient primary school infrastructure has denied some families access
 to education, contributing to the number of children on the employment market.
 The ILO and UNICEF, in consultation with the NLC, have concluded that child
 labor, while not yet endemic, is on the increase in the unregulated and
 nonunionized informal sector and could become a serious problem. Nigeria's export
 industries do not employ children. The United Nations has proposed a study to de-
 termine more precisely the extent of child labor in Nigeria. It also prposes to work
 together with the NLC, nongovernmental organizations, and the Nigerian Govern-
 
 
 ment to devise strategies to combat child labor abuses. Under the provisions of ILO
 Convention 123, the ILO requested the Government to supply it with a list of Nige-
 rian children who may be employed in mining. The regime had not yet responded
 to the request by years end.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1974 Labor Decree establishes a 40-hour
 workweek, prescribes 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and sets a minimum wage of
 $14 (450 Naira) per month. The Government's Structural Adjustment Program
 (SAP), coupled with a high inflation rate, has reduced the buying power of many
 Nigerian workers and led many within the NLC to criticize the SAP as an unfair
 imposition on the workers. The minimum wage as currently stipulated does not
 allow a worker's wages to keep pace with inflation nor provide a decent standard
 of living. Rising inflation is a frequent cause of strikes. Nigerian labor law stipulates
 that workers are to be paid extra for hours worked over the legal limit. Labor law
 also states that workers who work on Sundays and statutory public holidays must
 be paid a full day's pay in addition to their normal wages. There is no law prohibit-
 ing-excessive compulsory overtime.
 The 1974 Decree contains general health and safety provisions, some aimed spe-
 cifically at youth and female workers, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor. Employ-
 ers must compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of those killed in in-
 dustrial accidents. The Labor Ministry, which is charged with enforcement of these
 laws, has been largely ineffective, and violations are common and go largely
 unpunished. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work sit-
 uations without jeopardy to continued employment. However, such requests are
 rare, as dire poverty often compels workers to remain in dangerous jobs although
 they may be fully aware of the possible consequences.
 In 1991 Nigeria invited an ILO tripartite team from the Committee of Experts
 (COE) to evaluate the country's labor inspection system. The COE determined that
 Nigeria was not yet fully in compliance with the relevant ILO conventions, as it did
 not maintain adequate statistics on its inspection program. Despite extensive ILO-
 sponsored training prgrams for factory inspectors, at the end of 1993 the ILO had
 not yet ruled that Nigeria was in compliance.
