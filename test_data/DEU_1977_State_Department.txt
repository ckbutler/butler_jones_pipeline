 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 
 Human rights are an important element of the basic
 law which established the Federal Republic of Germany
 in 1949. These principles embodied in the basic law
 have been scrupulously observed. Despite the serious-
 ness of recent terrorist activity, the Federal Republic
 is dealing with the problem within the constitutional
 framework.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed. The Parliament has
 recently passed a law dealing with the problem of
 terrorism. Lawyers of imprisoned terrorists no longer
 have the right of unrestricted and uncontrolled access to
 their clients. This law was enacted to prevent the
 smuggling into prisons of small arms and communication
 devices by certain lawyers, as had apparently been
 happening. The law does not deny legal counsel to
 terrorist prisoners.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Federal Republic provides extensive social security
 benefits, unemployment compensation, full health services,
 and free education to'all through university levels.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Civil and political liberties and participation in
 democratic processes are respected. Radical political
 parties are permitted to participate in local, state and
 federal elections. However, membership in some legal but
 radical parties has barred applicants from civil service
 employment. This disqualification has been the subject
 of public political debate, as the criteria for
 disqualification are not uniformly administered in all
 states of the Federal Republic.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 A number of groups from outside the Federal Republic
 have surveyed the human rights situation in the Federal
 Republic since the war. The government does not appear
 to resent such monitoring efforts.
