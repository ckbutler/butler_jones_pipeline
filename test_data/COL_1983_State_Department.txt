 COLOMBIA
 Colombia has a strong, functioning multiparty democracy. The
 country has been ruled by elected governments for all but four
 years (1953-57) of the present century. The political arena
 has been dominated by the Liberal and the Conservative parties
 since the mid-19th century, but smaller parties are represented
 in Congress and have fielded Presidential candidates. The 1982
 congressional and Presidential elections produced the largest
 voter turnout in recent history. Belisario Betancur, the
 Conservative candidate, won the Presidency, while the Liberals
 took control of Congress. Members of Congress and the
 President are elected in separate elections every four years.
 Governors and mayors are appointed by the President, as are
 members of the Cabinet, under a constitutional provision which
 calls for "adequate and equitable" representation in government
 of members of the major party which does not hold the
 Presidency.
 Civil and political liberties are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, but an overburdened and cumbersome judicial
 system often results in lengthy periods of detention before
 cases are tried. For much of the past 30 years, however, the
 country has been under a constitutionally authorized state of
 siege to deal with the guerrilla movement, which permits the
 curtailment of some civil and political freedoms. The state of
 siege was last lifted in June 1982. There is a bill before
 Congress which would prohibit one of the most controversial
 aspects of the previous state of siege (the so-called security
 statute). Under this proposed legislation, trial in military
 courts of civilians charged with guerrilla-related crimes will
 not be permitted if a state of siege is reimposed. The
 Minister of Defense favors passage of this bill.
 Political violence has troubled Colombia for over 30 years,
 stemming from historical fights for political power between the
 Conservative and Liberal parties. The Colombian Government
 promulgated a generous all-but-unconditional amnesty law in
 November 1982 which covered all guerrillas. According to the
 Peace Commission, some 1,500 guerrillas took advantage of the
 amnesty.  (The Minister of Defense, during a congressional
 debate in September 1983, however, said that 329 guerrillas
 laid down their arms and 331 were released from jail. The
 Minister of Justice in the same debate noted that it was
 impossible to determine how many of those accepting the amnesty
 had returned to armed violence.) At.least three prominent
 former guerrillas were killed after accepting the amnesty, but
 it was unclear whether they were killed by vigilante groups
 composed of members of the security forces seekings revenge or
 by guerrilla organization members punishing defectors. The
 Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, the most
 prominent human rights organization in Colombia, has reported
 39 amnestied guerrillas were killed by security forces.
 'hose who did accept the amnesty and laid down their arms were
 generally low-ranking members of the various guerrilla groups.
 The leaders of the guerrilla organizations rejected the
 amnesty, demanding that it be accompanied by a national
 dialogue to ameliorate the country's social, economic, and
 political problems and by a military truce in areas which they
 alleged they controlled. The Government did not agree to a
 truce, noting that the armed forces had the right and the duty
 of the state to maintain order in all parts of the country.

 In rejecting the amnesty, the guerrilla leaders accused the
 Colombian armed forces of sabotaging the Government's peace
 efforts and asserted that there were no guarantees of personal
 security for those who accepted the truce. The former
 president of the Peace Commission noted the apparent lack of
 good faith on both sides when he resigned in May 1983, citing
 the impossibility of dealing with "enemies of peace both within
 and outside the Government." The current president of the
 Peace commission has commented that talks with the guerrillas
 will continue.
 In October 1983 the President of Colombia met in Madrid with
 leaders of the second-largest guerrilla band, the 19th of April
 Movement (M-19). A press communique issued by the President's
 staff indicated that subsequent meetings between the Government
 and the guerrillas would be held.
 When citing the lack of guarantees in the amnesty law for the
 personal safety of amnestied subversives, the guerrilla
 organizations noted the apparent impunity of vigilante-type
 groups, specifically the HAS (Muerte A Secuestradores--Death to
 Kidnappers). The HAS first appeared in November 1981 and was
 allegedly formed by a group of drug traffickers to rescue the
 kidnapped daughter of a wealthy rancher and alleged narcotics
 trafficker., Since then, labor leaders, lawyers, professors,
 and journalists with alleged Marxist bdliefs or connections
 with guerrillas and known subversives have been victims of
 MAS. President Betancur ordered the Attorney General, who is
 appointed by Congress and functions as an ombudsman, to
 investigate MAS.
 The Attorney General issued a report in February 1983 stating
 that MAS was not an organization with a hierarchy or
 well-defined program but rather reflected a "state of mind"
 which had developed over the many years of violence which
 Colombia had experienced. He named 163 persons, including 33
 active duty security forces personnel, as suspects in MASrlike
 activity. He stressed that the armed forces as an institution
 were not involved. In January 1983, three men arrested for
 murder claimed that they hadbeen acting under the direction of
 one of the military men named in the Attorney General's list
 and that they had been trained and supplied weapons by the army
 to counter guerrillas and guerrilla sympathizers.
 Despite the Attorney General's emphasis on the role of
 individuals in the MAS, the army hierarchy rallied to the
 defense of the armed forces as an institution, and a day's
 salary was pledged for the legal defense of all accused
 military personnel. T-wo military members suspected of MAS-like
 actions were charged in civilian courts for attempted murder,
 but the armed forces petitioned the disciplinary tribunal to
 have them tried by court martial. The tribunal ruled, over the
 objection of the Attorney General, that the military courts had
 jurisdiction over the active duty personnel. None of the.
 accused military has been brought to trial, a fact that has
 been sharply criticized by human rights groups and by the
 press. In September 1983, during a congressional debate,
 Minister of Defense Landazabal noted that most members of the
 military had acted with honor but there were some who should be
 investigated. According to an official in the judge advocate
 general's office (which is staffed by 10 civilian lawyers), all
 allegations of abuse of military power are investigated, but,
 in 1982 only one percent merited being brought to trial.

 Colombia has a high violent-death rate; not all violent acts
 are attributable to the guerrillas, the armed forces, or
 vigilante groups. Criminal elements, especially those
 connected to drug trafficking activity, are responsible for
 some of the deaths. Uniforms, symbols, and methods of
 operation are borrowed by one group or the other, either to
 discredit opponents or to hide culpability, making it difficult
 to determine who is responsible for which crime.
 During 1983 the human rights situation in Colombia improved.
 The Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission
 of Human Rights reports of November 1982 and August 1983
 praised Colombia for lifting stage of siege provisions and
 promulgating an amnesty. Even though the amnesty program,
 through the Peace Commission, has not been as successful as
 intended, efforts are still being made by the government to
 keep direct channels of communication open between itself and
 the guerrillas.
 RESPEC' FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 According to the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights, during the period August 1982-August 1983, the first
 year of President Betancur's four-year term, 674 people were
 assassinated, by the "armed forces," police, or secret agents,
 paramilitary groups, or unknown persons. The Committee also
 listed 340 death threats, and 144 woundings and attempted
 assassinations by security forces and paramilitary
 organizations. "he great majority of these offenses took place
 in rural areas, where the military is fighting guerrilla groups
 and where confirmation of reports is often difficult. The
 Committee's statistics are based on press reports, personal
 testimonies, and, especially, complaints filed by relatives and
 friends of the victims. The Committee does little
 investigation of the merits of each alleged violation
 reported.
 In October 1983, the Attorney General began an investigation
 into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of 22
 individuals in Antioquia in August 1983, and the subsequent
 discovery of their bodies in common graves. Individuals
 familiar with the circumstances of the disappearances have
 accused members of the military of the crimes.
 During the same period, according to armed forces statistics,
 56 members of the national police and 41 members of the armed
 forces were killed by guerrillas while 262 guerrillas died.
 During the same period, 261 civilians were alleged to have been
 assassinated by guerrillas, primarily the Revolutionary Armed
 Forces of Colombia for failure to support the guerrillas or for
 presumed assistance to the security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 The Permanent Committee reported that 97 people had disappeared
 or had been kidnapped in 1983. Fifty-four of these offenses
 
 
 511
 were attributed to security forces, 14 to paramilitary
 organizations, and the remaining 29 to persons unknown.
 President Betancur ordered an investigation into the
 disappearances, and in October 1983 the Attorney General stated
 that 200 people had disappeared, although it was not clear to
 which period he was referring. He expressed the fear that many
 of these individuals were subsequently killed but said he
 planned to investigate each case to determine the fate of the
 200. According to armed forces statistics, 157 individuals
 were kidnapped and held for ransom. Among the victims were
 three Americans, two of whom have been released. Since the
 Permanent Committee does not investigate cases, it is hard to
 determine how valid are these general figures, although it is
 safe to assume that some of these charges have merit.
 While kidnapping in the rural areas is widely believed to be
 the work of guerrillas, who have traditionally used kidnapping
 and extortion to raise funds, there is almost certainly some
 criminal activity as well.
 There was a rash of kidnappings in the urban areas in 1983,
 primarily of individuals from wealthy families. Large ransoms
 were demanded and paid in most cases. In many cases, the
 ransomed victims believed they were held by guerrilla groups,
 and the organizational skill, weapons, and ideological rhetoric
 used during the negotiations to release them indicated
 guerrilla involvement. In one case, however, the victim was
 convinced that the police were involved in the kidnapping. In
 other cases criminals motivated by purely financial gain are
 believed to have been responsible. For example, in August
 1983, police arrested a group of common criminals for the
 kidnapping of an American employee of a major multinational
 company. 1"hey had used the name Revolutionary Organization of
 the People, a radical offshoot of a former workers
 organization, and defended their actions in ideological terms.
 There is strong evidence that they were also responsible for
 the kidnapping and death of social worker Gloria Lara de
 Echeverri in 1982, and had used the Revolutionary Organization
 name to deflect attention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law. However, the Permanent Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights listed 619 cases of torture
 between August 1982 and August 1983; 487 were attributed to the
 security forces, 109 to paramilitary organizations, and the
 remainder to persons unknown. Again, the majority of the cases
 are reported from rural areas; press reports indicate many
 murder victims of vigilante groups showed signs of torture. It
 is impossible to determine how extensive these acts are and how
 many are perpetrated by government forces.
 In December 1982, a group of individuals accused of the
 kidnapping and murder of Gloria Lara de Echeverri were arrested
 by a military brigade, Brigada De Los Institutos Militares
 (BIM), now called the XIII Brigade, in Bogota. The accused had
 ties to the Revolutionary Organization of the People, a radical
 offshoot of a former workers organization. The accused's
 video-taped confessions were played for the press at a
 conference called by the XIII Brigade commander. When turned
 
 
 512
 over to the police, however, the suspects recanted, claiming
 their confessions were secured by torture. The Institute of
 Legal Medicine, a government agency, investigated but found no
 evidence of torture. They were later released following the
 arrest of another group for a crime with striking similarity to
 the kidnapping of Gloria Lara de Echeverri, lending credence to
 their charges that their confessions were obtained through
 torture. As a result, the Congress, the press, and the
 Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights called for
 the Government to reinvestigate whether the group which had
 originally been arrested for Lara's murder had indeed been
 tortured. By the end of November, the Government had not
 investigated these complaints again.
 Many prisons are overcrowded, and one--on the Pacific Island of
 Gorgona--will soon be closed because of its deteriorating
 condition. Conditions in many prisons are deplorable. In most
 prisons, inmates are fed a typical Colombian diet but can
 supplement it with purchases from prison stores. Prisoners
 with financial resources live better than those without.
 Family members and friends are normally allowed to visit
 regularly and to bring food and clothes. Most prisoners
 accused of guerrilla crimes have been incarcerated in regular
 prisons, although segregated from common criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Colombia's Constitution provides for habeas corpus procedures,
 and the law requires that individuals be brought to court
 within 72 hours of arrest in most cases. These requirements
 are respected in practice. Persons detained for disturbance of
 public order can be held up to 10 days before charges need to
 be filed. There are no legal provisions for exiling.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The rights of public trial and of due process are guaranteed to
 all by the constitution and generally honored. A prisoner may
 be represented by an attorney of his choice, or if he has none,
 the court will appoint one. Owing to an overburdened judicial
 system, many persons indicted for common crimes never come to
 trial, but are simply released after serving the minimum
 sentence applicable to the crime in question. According to the
 Minister of Justice, in January 1983 there were approximately
 28,000 prisoners, 19,000 of whom were in pretrial detention. A
 bill currently before Congress would allow special judges to
 hear cases of extortion, kidnapping, and terrorism, as well as
 reduce the number of trials by expanding the jurisdiction of
 police inspectors to try less serious crimes. At the same
 time, the ministry is considering plans to streamline the court
 system and revise the penal code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution requires a court order before authorities can
 enter a private home, except.in the case of "hot pursuit" of a
 person seen committing a crime. While some human rights
 organizations allege widespread violations in some remote areas
 of the country, where the military is predominant, the concept
 of the sanctity of the home and privacy is widely respected in
 
 
 513
 most parts of the country. Persons from rural areas have
 claimed that they were forced to leave their farms because of
 guerrilla activity in their areas.
 Section 2 Respect for civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally guaranteed rights have been generally
 respected, and the press often vigorously criticizes the
 Government and its leaders. The privately owned print media
 are under no government restraints. Daily and weekly
 newspapers and magazines print a wide variety of political
 views.
 Radio and television broadcasters have been requested
 occasionally not to broadcast news of certain events such as
 airline hijackings or terrorist actions, while they are still
 going on. Television channels are controlled by the state,
 which leases time to private companies. The Government does
 not permit private news programs to broadcast interviews which
 last longer than 10 minutes; during political campaigns, news
 programs cannot broadcast the voice of a candidate whose
 campaign rally is being filmed. There is no such restriction
 on "talk shows." A section of a bill on electoral reform
 before Congress calls for insured access to the electronic
 media for all political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings, marches, and demonstrations are normally and
 frequently held without interference. Generally, prior
 permission is required for large demonstrations, but it is
 invariably granted, except when there is a clear and present
 danger to public order. In 1983, there was no known denial of
 permission to demonstrate.
 Colombian workers freely exercise the right to form unions and,
 in the private sector, to bargain collectively and strike.
 There are four labor confederations (including one associated
 with the-Communist Party) and an estimated 7,000 unions.
 Approximately 15 percent of the total labor force is
 unionized. Among the four confederations, the Confederation of
 Colombian Workers and the Union of Colombian Workers are
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The remaining two, the Trade Union Confederation of
 Colombia and the General Confederation of Labor, are affiliated
 with the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World
 Confederation of Labor, respectively. The labor code is
 administered impartially, regardless of the ideology of the
 union. Trade union leaders participate fully in the electoral
 process and are often members of the National Congress and
 municipal assemblies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Colombian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.
 Although an overwhelming majority of Colombians are Roman
 Catholics, no constitutional or practical discrimination exists
 against any religious group.
 
 
 514
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Colombians are free to leave the country without unusual
 restrictions. In areas under military control, where operations
 against rural guerrilla groups are underway, the movement of
 civilians has been restricted by the need for "safe conduct"
 passes. The guerrillas reportedly use a similar means to restrict
 travel in areas under their control.
 Colombians who have sought and been granted "diplomatic asylum" in
 foreign embassies have always been allowed to depart. Expatriates
 are allowed by law to repatriate, and the right is respected in-
 practice. Colombia in the past has accepted refugees--the most
 recent case involving Nicaraguans who landed at San Andres
 Island. Because that island is claimed by Nicaragua, the
 Colombian Government resettled the refugees on mainland Colombia.
 However, because of high unemployment and underemployment, the
 Government is now reluctant to accept displaced persons.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Colombia has a strong democratic system of government, and
 elections are generally considered honest. Persons over 18 years
 of age have the constitutional right to vote. Those convicted of
 certain crimes may be disenfranchised. Public employees are
 forbidden by law to participate in political campaigns but, with
 the exception of military personnel, can vote.
 Colombian politics are dominated by the country's two major
 parties, the Liberal and the Conservative. The current chief
 executive is a member of the Conservative Party. Each major party
 includes elements with widely divergent political views. All
 parties are free to raise funds, field candidates, hold public
 meetings, have access to the media, and publish their own
 newspapers. The almost seven million turnout for the May 30,
 1982, Presidential election was approximately 60 percent of
 eligible voters, the heaviest voter turnout in recent history.
 Many went to the polls despite guerrilla threats to punish those
 who did. -he Liberal Party captured the most seats in the
 Congress.
 Since President Betancur's election, the Peace Commission, which
 was reconstituted and enlarged in September 1982, has recommended
 ways of reintegrating into society those engaged in rebellion and
 on ways to ameliorate the social, economic, and political
 conditions in the country. Members of the Peace Commission and
 the President have met with guerrilla leaders to discuss ways of
 achieving peace.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Colombian Government has actively participated in
 international and regional human rights bodies. Freedom House
 classifies Colombia "free." Colombia has invited both Amnesty
 International and the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 
 
 515
 to visit on human rights matters. The U.S.-based organization
 Americas Watch made a visit to Colombia in September 1982 and
 again in April 1983.
 The Permanent Committee f6r the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active national organization monitoring the local human
 rights situation. Statistics prepared by this Committee have been
 used extensively by international organizations such as Amnesty
 International, Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on Latin
 America. Colombian human rights organizations follow trials of
 those accused of rebellion, investigate reports of human rights
 violations, provide defense lawyers, and publish newsletters.
 Periodic human rights forums are held in Colombia.
 A number of Colombian human rights organizations in the past have
 severely criticized Colombian military and paramilitary
 organizations for participating in "official repression."
 Americas watch's 1983 report noted, however, that the Colombian
 Government had taken serious steps toward curbing what Americas
 Watch terms "militarization."
 Colombian officials have shared the concerns of the local human
 rights groups regarding such alleged violations, and they have
 been responsive to requests by international groups to investigate
 reported violations of human rights. President Betancur, the
 Colombian Attorney General, and high military officials have
 publicly stressed their intention to end paramilitary violence.
 In August 1983, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the
 organization of American States rejected accusations of 96 human
 rights violations against Colombia. The Commission noted that the
 Colombian Government had given satisfactory explanations in the
 cases; the accusers had not sent the documentation requested by
 the Commission; and the alleged victims had been covered by the
 amnesty.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economic slowdown which began in 1980 continued, and the real
 Gross Domestic Product growth rate for 1983 was expected to rise
 to be only about two percent. Colombia's population growth rate
 was 2.1 percent in 1980. Inflation is declining because of
 reduced consumer demand and monetary and credit policies.
 Official government data shows unemployment rose to 11.5 percent
 in September 1983. Underemployment is between 14 percent and 16
 percent.  omitted from any official labor statistics are an
 estimated 2.5 million children under age 15 who work for low pay
 under poor conditions and with little protection from the
 Colombian labor code. Although increases in minimum wages have
 kept pace with increases in the cost of living in recent years, a
 large percentage of workers do not earn the minimum wage.
 Per capita Gross National Product in 1981 was $1,334, but there is
 inequality in the distribution of the nation's income and wealth.
 According to a 1983 World Bank report, the wealthiest 10 percent
 of Colombia's 27 million population received 40 percent of the
 national income, while the poorest 20 percent got only five
 percent. Colombia has a highly progressive income tax, but tax
 evasion is widespread and direct taxation is declining as a
 proportion of government revenue.
 
 
 516
 In December 1982, the Betancur administration decreed a 50-day
 tax amnesty period in which previously unreported assets could
 be declared with no questions asked; the program had only
 moderate success. Land tenure is also a problem: the top 10
 percent of landowners hold 80 percent of the land, while the
 bottom 10 percent own 0.2 percent. Significant regional
 inequalities also exist, with the best economic opportunities,
 health care facilities, and education available in the largest
 cities. This has contributed to the problem of heavy, though
 decreasing, migration from the countryside to urban areas. A
 notable exception to income maldistribution is in Colombia's
 important coffee-growing regions, where farms have
 traditionally been small- to medium-sized. More recently, some
 small farms in the higher altitude areas of Bogota and Medellin
 have been able to take advantage of the increasing export
 demand for fresh cut flowers.
 There is a severe teacher shortage, particularly in the
 countryside. Primary school enrollment has increased, and the
 adjusted enrollment ratio of 128 percent in 1979 is partially
 explained by frequent repetition and the presence of
 adolescents and adults in the primary grades. The adult
 literacy rate was estimated at 81 percent in 1973. Colombia's
 infant mortality rate was 56 per 1,000 live births in 1980.
 Life expectancy at birth was 63 years in 1980. While the ratio
 of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements in 1977 was 98.0 percent, per capita
 consumption of important commodities such as meat, eggs, and
 milk declined between 1948 and 1978, and malnutrition is a
 leading cause of death among children under five years.
 According to 1983 World Bank statistics, 64 percent of the
 population has access to safe water.
 The Betancur government has promised to provide 400,000
 low-cost housing units between 1983 and 1986 and to concentrate
 on rural adult literacy and vocational training. The
 Government will also offer extension courses at the university
 level to expand education. The 1983 budget for the social
 sector ministries (labor, government, health, and education)
 accounted for approximately 29.1 percent of the total
 government budget.
 The economic situation of women, though improving, is
 inferior. Although women have equal civil and property rights
 and they comprise just over 25 percent of the economically
 active population, they are concentrated in low-productivity
 and low-income sectors. Historically, the unemployment rate
 for women has been higher than for men, but this difference has
 decreased in recent years. Although Colombian women are
 legally entitled to pay equal to that of their male
 counterparts and are normally paid equal salaries when employed
 by the Government, this is not generally the case in private
 industry.
 As more Colombian women graduate from universities and
 participate in the work force, they are increasingly active at
 all levels of society. An increasing number of women are
 receiving higher education, and they currently comprise 40
 percent of the university population. They serve as
 legislators, judges, departmental governors, political party
 leaders, government officials, and diplomats. President
 Betancur has appointed a large number of women to high
 government positions.
 Colombian Indians enjoy all rights and privileges of full
 citizenship. Notwithstanding their constitutional rights,
 however, Colombian Indians have at times suffered a wide
 variety of abuses at the hands of local landowners, cattlemen,
 and prospectors. The Government has curtailed the worst of
 such abuses and is now seeking to promote improved local
 relations through community action, public education, and legal
 aid.
