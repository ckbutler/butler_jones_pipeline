 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain has been ruled since the late 18th century by the
 Al-Khalifa family, which dominates society and government.
 Bahrain's Constitution lays out a separation of powers between
 the Prime Minister, the National Assembly, and the courts.
 Political rights (including the right of election) and other
 human rights are enshrined as ideals, but there is no judicial
 check on the authorities. The provision confirming the Amir
 as hereditary ruler ratifies the continued supremacy of the
 Al-Khalifa family. The National Assembly was suspended in
 1975, and has not been reconvened.
 Bahrain's leadership has been torn between two aims. It
 desires to foster the open social and commercial environment
 needed to attract international business, but it also wants to
 protect the ruling family's preeminence, prevent potential
 sectarian violence, and thwart efforts by Iran and other
 revolutionary states to destabilize Bahrain. Bahrainis are
 divided between Shi'a and Sunni Muslim religious communities.
 Although about two-thirds of the native population is Shi'a
 and the remaining one-third, as well as the ruling family,
 Sunni, the Sunnis overshadow the Shi'a in wealth and
 influence. Most Bahrainis are Arab, but a significant
 minority are of Iranian origin. While extreme poverty is rare
 and the Government makes great efforts to assure employment,
 the Shi'a and Bahrainis of Iranian origin are disadvantaged as
 groups with respect to Sunnis and to those with Arab ties
 going back many generations. This economic disparity has
 given the Iranian revolution potential appeal with these
 groups and encouraged Iran to support anti-regime activities.
 An Iranian-sponsored coup attempt in December 1981 caused the
 Government to implement extraordinary security measures, but
 these measures have become less stringent as the Government
 has regained its confidence. However, there is no perceptible
 movement toward reconvening the National Assembly, although
 many sectors of Bahraini society see this as an important step.
 In 1984, the trend toward a generally less repressive
 atmosphere has continued. However, there have been a few
 arrests of persons for political activities, principally in
 connection with the Islamic Enlightenment Sodiety. Alleging
 that it had been used as a base for anti-regime activity, the
 Government closed the Society in February, thus shutting off a
 principal vehicle for Shi'ite religious expression. In early
 1984, the Government expelled two foreign journalists based in
 Bahrain for their reporting on events in Kuwait. Joint
 worker/management committees continued to function in 1984 but
 had little scope for free representation of worker interests
 and won little credibility.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of political killing in 1984.
 0. Disappearance
 Some persons detained by the security forces for investigation
 of suspected illegal political activity have not been
 immediately accounted for. Periods of incommunicado detention
 
 
 1179
 BAHRAIN
 can be lengthy, but relatives are usually able to find out if
 and where the detainee is being held. There are no reports of
 permanent disappearance at the hands of the security forces.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical abuse is common during arrest and interrogation, but
 rarely occurs after interrogation. It is not known what
 happens during detention in security prisons (where
 questioning may continue after sentencing) since visits by
 non-government persons are not allowed. Medical examinations
 by non-prison doctors have also been denied. Policemen
 sometimes beat a suspect as a matter of course after stopping
 him for questioning or arrest, whether or not the subject has
 offered resistance. The evidence is insufficient to confirm
 whether this practice is pursuant to systematic policy or
 merely indicative of inadequate discipline among the police.
 The Government relies on hiring foreigners, usually
 Pakistanis, Yemenis, and Arabian Peninsula Bedouins, for most
 positions in the security forces. The gratuitous nature of
 reported cases of physical abuse by the police suggests that
 they result primarily from poor training and discipline in the
 police force, exacerbated by the lack of empathy between
 foreign policemen and native Bahrainis.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Participation in political activities outside the narrow
 confines tolerated by the regime is carefully scrutinized by
 the police, and political activists are often detained for
 questioning. Periods of detention for anti-regime political
 activity are usually short, although detention for periods of
 one or two months without formal charges is not unknown.
 There are between 15 and 20 persons currently being detained
 indefinitely without trial for political activities.
 Activities of a political nature which can bring arrest
 include membership or suspected membership in *subversive
 organizations,* expression of extreme anti-regime opinion in a
 public setting, or engaging in public acts of defiance against
 the regime. Examples of acts that would lead to arrest also
 include painting slogans on walls, joining demonstrations
 against public authority, possessing or circulating
 anti-regime propaganda, or harboring persons committing such
 acts. While some persons have been tried for attempting to
 form political and labor organizations, the Government
 customarily does not put persons charged with such offenses on
 trial and approximately 80 to 100 persons are now being held
 in this category. Of the approximately 20 persons arrested in
 connection with the closing of the Islamic Enlightenment
 Society, a few have been tried for holding arms caches, but
 the rest are still being held without trial. There is no
 right of habeas corpus.
 Although exile is banned by the Constitution, the Government
 has in recent years summarily expelled Bahraini residents of
 Iranian origin, some of whom were from families that had lived
 in Bahrain for generations. While these expulsions reached
 high numbers after the 1981 coup plot, fewer Bahrainis have
 been exiled in 1983 and 1984. It is believed that expulsions
 numbered between 10 and 20 in 1984.
 
 
 1180
 BAHRAIN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Shari'a courts in Bahrain confine themselves to questions of
 family law and inheritance. A person arrested may be tried in
 either a civil court or a security court. The two are very
 different. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees
 including open trial, right to counsel (including legal aid
 for indigents), and right to appeal. Security courts, where
 the 73 accused of plotting the 1981 coup attempt were tried,
 lack the rights to a public trial and appeal. Amnesty
 International expressed concern that the right to counsel also
 was impaired by not allowing the defense counsels adequate
 opportunity to prepare their cases or to cross-examine
 prosecution witnesses. Sentences imposed by the security
 court can oe referred to the Amir for clemency, a procedure
 not customarily allowed in civil court cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Authorization for entry of private premises must come from
 senior levels in the Ministry of Interior, but there appears
 to be no judicial oversight. International telephone calls
 are routinely monitored, and the police commonly open mail.
 Bahrainis, particularly among lower economic classes and
 groups with political leanings toward the Iranian revolution
 or leftist causes, fear police informer networks and this
 undoubtedly inhibits their political expression. Political
 ideas associated with Western democracy are generally not as
 vigorously controlled as radical Islamic and Marxist ideas,
 but democratic ideas are also not as vigorously advanced by
 their proponents. Members of the privileged classes openly
 discuss ways to broaden political participation in an
 evolutionary fashion.
 While Islam is the religion of virtually all Bahrainis and has
 official status, the Government permits a considerable degree
 of social freedom. The restrictions that do exist are based
 on custom and social pressure.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Bahrainis are free to express political views informally, but
 any attempt to give them wider circulation in the media is
 subject to regulation. Criticism of the Government's
 performance in some areas--such as the adequacy of municipal
 services, the need to move Bahrainis into jobs held by skilled
 foreign workers, or better ways to encourage economic
 development--is tolerated and commonly seen in the press.
 Criticism of the Amir, attempts to mobilize the public into
 unauthorized political associations, and subject matter deemed
 pornographic or un-Islamic are all prohibited.
 The Ministry of Information exercises wide powers over the
 local media and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. Minor deviations in recent years have brought
 closure of the offending newspapers. There have been no
 closures since 1980, primarily because editors fully
 understand the rules and abide by them. Several international
 agencies and publications use Manama as a base for operations
 in the Gulf. In early 1984, the Government deviated from its
 tolerant policy toward the foreign press by expelling two
 
 
 1181
 BAHRAIN
 journalists whose reporting on Kuwait offended the Government
 of that country.
 All radio and television stations are state-owned. Newspapers
 are privately owned. The editor of the largest paper is a
 former Information Ministry official, and his publication is
 regarded as semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are prohibited in Bahrain.
 While the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, trade unions are illegal. However, the Government
 has encouraged the formation of elected workers' committees in
 several major companies.
 Committee representatives are empowered to bargain with
 management over wages and working conditions. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs acts as arbiter if no agreement is
 reached. Fifteen percent of the work force is now represented
 by these committees, which in turn choose members of a
 national committee. This body represents Bahrain in
 international labor organizations. Expatriate workers (about
 60 percent of the work force) may vote and stand for election
 on local committees but may not serve at the national level.
 The worker/management committees fostered by the Government
 are not independent trade unions and are unlikely to evolve in
 that direction. The scope of action permitted the joint
 committees in individual companies is limited to consultation
 and advice and, since they have equal worker and management
 representation, there is no opportunity to set forth a
 uniquely worker point of view. Operating under the shadow of
 the Government, the National Committee has not manifested an
 identity nor established a leadership position in the labor
 sector. Ground rules of the December 1984 elections for the
 joint committees have not been announced, but it is not
 expected that any greater degree of freedom will be allowed
 than in 1982, when the Government vetted lists of candidates
 and removed names of politically suspect persons.
 A number of professional organizations exist that cover
 various groups in Bahrain, such as lawyers, physicians,
 engineers, and businessmen. There has been some discussion of
 permitting the establishment of a teachers' association.
 There are also a number of social and sports clubs that have
 traditionally been significant institutions for political
 action and discussion. These organizations are generally
 small and limited in scope and the Government monitors their
 activities closely to assure that they do not stray from a
 narrow attention to sectoral concerns.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. A variety of Islamic and
 Christian sects maintain places of worship and freely practice
 tneir religion in Bahrain. Several Christian churches are
 long established, serving large foreign communities. The
 Government allows them to conduct active programs benefiting
 their own communities and society at large. The teaching of
 non-Islamic religions outside the confines of recognized
 religious establishments is not permitted. Bahrainis may
 convert from one religion to another, but attempts to convert
 Muslims to other faiths is traditionally resisted by Muslim
 society.
 
 
 1182
 BAHRAIN
 Membership in the Sunni sect generally confers a more favored
 status on Bahraini nationals and on Muslim non-Bahrainis;
 Sunnis are given preference for employment that involves
 national security interests. There are Shi'a religious
 societies which promote the study of Islam and serve as social
 and sports clubs. The largest of these, with about 1,600
 members, was the recently banned Islamic Enlightenment
 Society. Members of the Shi'a sect have been subjected to job
 discrimination, and the numerous and active Shia religious
 establishments are subjected to close vigilance by the
 security forces. Public religious demonstrations,
 particularly marches by members of the Shi'a community, are
 closely monitored by the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Babrainis are free to move within the country, to travel
 abroad, and to emigrate. Shi'a Bahrainis are permitted to
 make pilgrimages to Shi'a holy sites in Iran, although their
 numbers are carefully controlled because of fears of
 subversion of Shi'a pilgrims by Iranian intelligence
 authorities. Refugees are not repatriated to countries they
 have fled, but they are obliged to depart Bahrain immediately.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There are no elections for government positions. The average
 Bahraini is able to influence the political process only by
 means of informal contact with senior officials and by
 attending public audiences of the Amir. No political parties
 are permitted. There are two clandestine political groups,
 with ties to Iran which attract younger militant Shi'as: the
 Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the group
 responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, and the Islamic Call
 Party. Both advocate overthrow of the Government and
 establishment of an independent Islamic republic. Both groups
 are believed to have several hundred members. There are also
 two underground leftist groups, the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain and the National Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain, which have ties with revolutionary Arab
 regimes in the area and some Soviet support. Both groups call
 for violent revolution and probably have several hundred
 members each.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Bahrain has not been the subject of resolutions or
 investigations by official international human rights
 organizations. No private human rights group is known to have
 visited Bahrain this past year. The last indication of the
 Government's attitude toward such investigations was in 1982,
 when Amnesty International sent a team to observe the trial of
 those accused of plotting the coup attempt. The team was able
 to meet with government officials and defense counsel but was
 not allowed to attend the closed trial. There are no non-
 governmental organizations established to protect individual
 liberties. Bahrain was the object of a complaint lodged with
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1983 on freedom
 of association. The Government maintained that the complaint
 was invalid because two persons arrested in connection with
 
 
 1183
 BAHRAIN
 the complaint had not in fact been detained for seeking to
 form a trade union. In the absence of evidence to the
 contrary, the ILO decided to take no further action. Amnesty
 International in its 1984 report expressed concern about the
 long-term detention without charge or trial of political
 prisoners, the imprisonment of possible prisoners of
 conscience, the incommunicado detention and imprisonment of
 both untried and convicted individuals, and the ill-treatment
 of prisoners. Freedom House has rated Bahrain "partly free.'
 Banrain has not played a prominent role in international
 organizations nor has it worked in cooperation with private
 organizations in the human rights area.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government has devoted a major part of its resources to
 meeting the economic and social needs of Bahrain's
 population. According to World Bank statistics, Bahrain's
 population is 411,000, of which about 32 percent, including
 about 60 percent of the labor force, is non-Bahraini. The
 population growth rate for the native population is 3.8
 percent. Free public health care is available to all
 residents. Free education and subsidized housing are
 available only to Bahrainis. The Government's social
 insurance plans and protection against unfair labor practices
 primarily benefit Bahrainis. The labor code draws no
 distinction between Bahraini and foreign workers, but
 foreigners are, in practice, less protected. They generally
 receive lower wages for equal work and employers routinely
 deny them benefits to which they are entitled.
 The right to private property is protected, While foreigners
 other than citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council countries are
 not normally permitted to own real estate in Bahrain, their
 rights to possess other personal property are protected under
 law.
 Life expectancy in Bahrain is about 69 years. World Bank
 statistics show an infant mortality rate of 35 per 1,000 live
 birtns for 1984. The Ministry of Health gives this rate to be
 23 per 1,000 for 1983. Food and safe drinking water are
 available in adequate supply to the entire population, and an
 ongoing sewerage project promises to improve public
 sanitation. The prices of basic food items are subsidized by
 the Government. Approximately 73 percent of Bahrainis between
 the ages of 4 and 19 attend primary or secondary schools;
 48 percent are female. The literacy rate is estimated to be
 79 percent (above age 10). The Government has begun a
 campaign to eradicate remaining illiteracy.
 According to the World Bank, per capita income is now
 estimated at over $9,284. Income distribution patterns are
 skewed in favor of the ruling family and allied merchant
 families. There is no significant domestic taxation.
 Although statistical data are not available, it is generally
 recognized that there is some poverty at the village level and
 among some foreign temporary workers. The Government, faced
 with declining oil revenues, receives financial assistance
 from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. From
 the 1982-83 budget, 13 percent was allocated to education,
 10 percent to health, 7.6 percent to housing, and 24 percent
 to social services.
 
 
 1184
 BAHRAIN
 The Government continues to emphasize Bahrainization of most
 sectors of the economy, but currently both menial and
 high-skilled positions tend to be held by expatriate
 employees. The Government plans to train 10,000 Bahrainis in
 the present decade in order to replace foreign workers holding
 skilled jobs, but this effort is undermined by employers who
 prefer foreign workers who can be paid less and are more
 docile than Bahrainis.
 Bahraini women have traditionally constituted a 'separate
 society" in accord with Bahrain's Islamic heritage. The
 integration of male and female societies began with the
 development of a modern economy, and women have increasingly
 taken on roles previously reserved for men. Bahraini women in
 the work force increased from about 1,000 to 12,000 between
 1970 and 1980, and they now constitute 12 percent of all
 Bahraini workers. The Government has encouraged the trend
 toward equality, has enacted special labor laws to encourage
 female entry into the work force, and is itself a leading
 employer of women. Most of these positions are clerical, but
 a small number of senior positions are held by women. Labor
 law grants women 60 days paid maternity leave and nursing
 periods during the working day. Women may not be discharged
 for marriage or pregnancy. However, women generally do not
 enjoy equal access to many government benefits. In 1984,
 complaints were aired in the press that women were
 discriminated against in the award of scholarships for study
 abroad. The responsible government official defended the
 discrimination and indicated it would continue. Many legal
 rights of concern to women are subject to Shari'a law; women
 have rights to their own property but daughters receive less
 inheritance than sons, and widows must share their husband's
 estate with their children. While a wife may divorce, she
 must specify grounds for the plea, whereas a man may divorce
 without cause. In the case of a male child, custody remains
 with the mother until he reaches the age of 12; a girl stays
 with her mother until she marries. Women are allowed to drive
 and appear in public without male escort. However, permission
 from a male family member is sometimes required to leave the
 country.
