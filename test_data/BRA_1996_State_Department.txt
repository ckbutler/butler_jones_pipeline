 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic composed of 26 states and the federal
 district. In 1994 voters elected a new president, two-thirds of the senate, and 513
 federal deputies. It was the second time since the end of military rule in 1985 that
 citizens freely chose their president and elected the legislative bodies in accordance
 with the 1988 Constitution. Fernando Henrique Cardoso became President on Janu-
 ary 1, 1995, and is serving a 4-year term, reduced from 5 years by a 1994 constitu-
 tional amendment.
 Police forces fall primarily under the control of the states. State police are divided
 into two forces: The civil police, who have an investigative role, and the uniformed
 police, known locally as the "Military Police," who are responsible for maintaining
 public order. Although controlled by the individual state governments, the Constitu-
 tion provides that the uniformed police can be called into active military service in
 
 
 the event of an emergency, and they maintain some residual military privileges, in-
 cluding a separate judicial system. The federal police force is very small and plays
 little role in maintaining internal security. State police officers are charged with
 many serious human rights abuses.
 Brazil has a market-based economy, although the Government has traditionally
 played a dominant role in shaping economic development. The Government is en-
 couraging greater private sector participation in the economy through privatization
 of state enterprises, deregulation, and removal of impediments to competition. In-
 dustrial production, including mining operations, and a large and diversified capital
 goods sector, accounts for approximately 34 percent of gross domestic product
 (GDP); agriculture contributes about 13 percent. Brazil exports both manufactured
 and primary goods. Among the principal exports are coffee, soybeans, textiles, leath-
 er, metallurgical products, and transportation equipment. GDP was $563 billion in
 1995, and the economy grew at a rate of 4.1 percent. The large gap in income dis-
 tribution narrowed slightly in 1995. The poorest tenth of the population earned 1
 percent of national income, compared with 0.7 percent in 1993, while the richest
 tenth earned 47.1 percent, down from 49 percent in 1993.
 The most serious human rights abuses continued to be extrajudicial killings and
 torture. State police killed 19 landless workers in southern Para in April; they sum-
 marily executed at least 10 of the victims. In urban areas, the police are frequently
 implicated in killings and abuse of prisoners, but special courts for the uniformed
 police are, in many cases, overloaded, rarely investigate effectively or bring fellow
 officers to trial, and seldom convict abusers. This separate system of special state
 police courts contributes to a climate of impunity for police elements involved in
 extrajudicial killings or abuse of prisoners and is thought to be the single largest
 obstacle to eliminating such abuses by police. It is too early to tell what may be
 the effect upon impumty of the new legislation giving civil courts jurisdiction over
 crimes of intentional homicide committed by uniformed police officers.
 The poor bear the brunt of most violence, whether committed by the police or by
 criminals. Prison conditions range from poor to harsh. The judiciary has a large case
 backlog and is often unable to ensure the right to a fair trial. Justice is slow and
 often unreliable, especially in rural areas where powerful landowners use violence
 to settle land disputes and influence the local judiciary. Violence against homo-
 sexuals and women and discrimination against women and minorities are problems.
 Child prostitution is also a problem. Despite constitutional provisions safeguarding
 their rights, indigenous people continue to be victimized by outsiders who encroach
 on Indian lands and to be neglected by governmental authorities. The authorities
 do not adequatel enforce laws against forced labor, and the sugar and charcoal in-
 dustries exploit children. A free press and active human rights organizations expose
 abuses and demand action to atop them.
 The Government introduced an action plan to address human rights abuses, but
 many human rights groups expressed concern about congressional opposition to
 some elements of the plan and about what specific means would be used to accom-
 plish its goals. President Cardso created an interministeria grup in late 1995 to
 fight what he publicly acknowledged as Brazil's seriousprob em with racism and
 discrimination. In addition, the Government has increasedsignificantly the number
 of roving inspectors charged with clamping down on forced labor, and it launched
 a national effort, in partnership with state governors and local organizations, aimed
 at eradicating child labor. The government tourist agency embarked on a nationwide
 campaign against sex tourism and the attendant problem of child prostitution. fow-
 ever, the increased commitment by politicians at the national level still has not had
 a significant impact in many of the states where human rights violations are most
 comm~on.
 RESPECTr FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings continued to
 be a serious problem throughout the country. In urban areas, a high crime rate, a
 failure to apprehend most criminals, and an inept criminal justice system all con-
 tribute to public acquiescence in police brutality and killings of criminal suspects.
 According to the newly created Ss Paulo police ombudsman office, police killed
 119 citizens in the first 6 months of 1996, a figure that does not include persons
 who are wounded and die later in a hospital The figure reflects bth the city's high
 level of violent crime and excessive use of force by the police. Man Sao Paulo-based
 human rights groups claim that the uniformed police, who openly doubt the judi-
 ciar's abiity to convict those they apprehnen   ofe  decide to summarily execute
 suspected crinminals rate th an apprehend them.

 In May the authorities arrested a Sao Paulo police officer, Jose Rogerio de Araujo
 Felismino, and his brother and charged them with the murder of a prominent AIDS
 activist; they were awaiting trial at year's end. In a separate case, Sao Paulo police
 badly beat 36-year-old Jaerte Antonio at his home, where a drunk Antonio had
 threatened his mother with violence. They took Antonio to a hospital, where he died
 soon afterward. The polie Inspector General is investigatinlg Antonio's death but
 had charged no one by the end of the year. In February poie shot a man in the
 coastal town of Peruib, Sao Paulo, twie after his arrest an drug possession
 charges. According to the man's family, the police shot him while in custody, later
 tortured him, then took him to a hospital, wher he died 3 days later from his iiiju-
 ries. An internal police investigation was still in progress at the end of the year.
 By mid-December, there had been 155 victims in 47 instances of "mass murder"
 in Sao Paulo. Although suspects had been identified in only 10 of these execution-
 style killings, most appeared to be perpetrated by criminal gangs and drug traffick-
 ers. Human rights monitors and public prosecutors believe that police are respon-
 sible for some of the unresolved cases, which often result from police involvement
 in drug deals gone awry or from retaliation for witnesses' cooperation with prosecu-
 trs or investigators. These monitors point as evidence to the wave of arrests of low-
 ranking police officers, and some semor officers, in the first half of the year for in-
 volvement in a variety of criminal activities. For example, the authorities arrested
 4 military police officers, all members of the elite Rota" strike force, and charged
 them with the murders of 25 people in 6 separate massacres, and with 3 bank rob-
 beries. The leader of the four, Hellmans Hoffman de Oliveira, was known as
 "Robocop" because he illegally carried a .45 caliber revolver. The gang members are
 under detention pending trial in a civil court.
 San Paulo Governor Maria Covas continued to push for reforms intended to curb
 abuses by the state police. He appointed human rghts activists as his attorney gen-
 eral and secretaries of public security, justice, and state prisons; he also created ao
 Paulo's first civilian police ombudsman. The ombudsman has been effective in call-
 ig attention to police abuses and bringing to trial criminal elements within the po-
 lice. From November 1995 through June-principally due to the ombudsmans ef-
 forts--Sa Paulo police opened mare than 100 internal criminal investigations; prior
 to 1996, the annual number of internal investigations had never exceeded 40. Pri-
 vate citizens seemed to take full advantage of the opportunity to lodge complaints,
 as the ombudsman's office received an average of90 clls a week on its tll-free tele-
 phone numbr. The ombudsman convinced the police to increase community patrols
 in peripheral neighborhoods, where violence is common, while the state public secu-
 rity secretary ad ed courses on human rights and discrimination to the civil ) lice
 training curriculum. In addition, since September 1995, San Paulo police offcers
 who kill citizens are removed from their jobs and obliged to participate in a program
 in which they receive psychological counseling as well as classes on community po-
 licing, abuse of power, and the Penal Code. According to the weekly magazine Veja,
 the number of people killed by Sao Paulo police droppd from an average of 33 per
 month when the program was instituted to 18 per month by the end of March.
 Acts of intimidation often hindered investigations, including death threats against
 witnesses, prosecutors, judges, and human rights monitors. In May Valdemir Lima
 de Oliveira, a witness against three policemen accused of corruption, was murdered
 as he was leaving a Sa Paulo police station after givin a deposition. The civil po-
 lice chief in Franca da Rocha, and members of his staff, ave received death threats
 since beginning their investigation of the clandestine dumping site for the victims
 of death squads; one investigator resined as a result.
 At least 596 minors inRio de Janeiro were victims of homicide in 1995, according
 to the Rio-based Advanced Institute for Religious Studies. Execution-style killing of
 street children continued in 1996, but comprehensive statistics were not available.
 On April 23, twa unidentified street youths were shot at point-blank range in the
 head and neck in Rio de Janseiro's affluent Laranjeiras neighborhood. The use of un-
 professional autopsy procedures and inexplicable delays in the investigation led
 human rights groups to suspect at t    the murders were the work of police officers.
 No suspects have been identified.
 In early March, three street ehildren-Gimar Ferreira de Franca, 14, Jamil Mar-
 tins Murilo, 15, and Junior Santos Ma1es Leo, 17-were found dead in the
 Taquaril neighborhood of Bela Horizonte. Their hands were tied, and they had been
 shot in theback. A grup calling it self "Reaction" claimed responsibility, writing in
 a note that the minors had boen klled to protest the low salaries paid to civil polaie.
 According to human rights rups in Bea   Horizonte, there is significant evidence
 that Reaction is composed of active duty and farmer police officers. A olice inves-
 tigator chareed one poie offier in the slaying and said that severl others are
 under investigation.

 The number of citizens killed in conflicts with Rio police rose significantly. Accord-
 ing to the daily newspaper Jornal do Brasil, prior to June 1995, an average of 3.2
 persons per month were killed by police, while that figure rose to 20.5 per month
 in the first 6 months of 1996. Human rights groups blame financial awards and pro-
 motions for police "bravery" instituted in November 1995 by Nilton Cerqueira, the
 Rio state secretary for public security, for encouraging police to use excessive force.
 When the Brazil-based representative of Human Rights Watch/Americas privately
 urged Cerqueira to announce that he would give the awards only to police officers
 who brought in suspets alive, Cerqueira reportedly replied that the important point
 was that criminals should be stpped, dead or alive.
 In June the President of the FerC    br of Deputies human rights commit-
 toe visited Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, to urge state officials to inves-
 tigat the activities of a death squad known as "the firm  According to the state
 bar association, local human rights organizations, and a state prosecutor, current
 and former police officers comprise this group, which is involved in summary execu-
 tions, illegal arrest, torture, and drug trafficking. The death squad is suspected,
 among other crimes, of executing 20 people and torturing 8 adolescents in the first
 6 months of 1996.
 A deputy prosecutor general in Brasilia recommended that the President order
 federal intervention in the western state of Acre to prevent the systematic violation
 of human rights there. Federal prosecutors in Acre reported that there had been a
 "dizzying increase in urban violence" during the previous 2 years, due almost exclu-
 sively to widespread human rights violations committed by the state's uniformed po-
 lice. The situation worsened dramatically on June 30, when convicted drug traf-
 ficker Jorge Hug shot and killed Itamar Pascoal, a police officer and brother of a
 state deputy (and retired policeman) Hidelbrando Pasoal. Hugo went into hiding,
 while the police, under the personal command of Hidlbrando Paacoal (according to
 the prosecutors' report), went on a rampage of kidnaping, torture, and murder. The
 federal prosecutors report quoted Hidelbrando Pascoal as saying he would kill Hugo
 and anyone who had helped him to escape. The state governor was unwilling or un-
 able to exercise any control over the military police.
 The Permanent Forum Against Violence, a human rights organization in the
 northeastern state of Alagoas, condemned what it called an "uncontrollable rise in
 criminality and brutal disrespect for human rights" in the state and involvement by
 elements of the public security apparatus. The Forum reported that 192 murders
 were committed in the state in the first 3 months of 1996, a 21 percent increase
 over the same period in 1995. Suspects were identified in only 47 cases, 25 percent
 of whom were military or civil policemen.
 The state police killing of 19 landless workers on April 17 in El Dorado de
 Carajas, in the northern state of Para, illustrates the tensions created by land inva-
 sions and the excessive violence often used by policemen in dealing with squatters.
 Several hundred landless workers blocked a highway to focus attention on the
 group's demand to be resettled, and to have state officials provide food and buses
 to take the marchers to Belem, the state capital. The state authorities sent 157 po-
 licemen to clear the highway. After erecting barricades on either side of the
 protestors, the police launched canisters of tear gas into the crowd and fired ma-
 chine guns into the air to disperse it. It is unclear who began firing first-each side
 accused the other-but the police opened fire with machine guns from both sides
 of the crowd. Autopsy reports subsequently revealed that 10 of the victims had been
 summarily executed, 3 had been shot at point-blank range and 7 had been killed
 with knives or sickles. The authorities chiarged all 157 policemen involved in the
 massacre with intentional homicide and will try them in a civil court.
 Human rights groups cite the high level of crime and the failings of the judicial
 system as contributing factors to public tolerance of vigilante lynchmgs of suspected
 criminals. According to the daily newspaper Correio Braziiense, citizens lynched 22
 people in the northeastern state of Bahia, usually the leader among states in this
 category, through mid-December. In an incident on September 3, 15 bus passengers
 in the city of Salvador beat to death a man who had tried to rob 2 couples riding
 on the bus.
 In rural areas, new conflicts between rural landowners and the landless intensi-
 fied in 1996, in part due to land invasions organized by the rural Landless Workers'
 Movement (MST) to pressure the federal Government to speed up settlement of
 landless families. TheMS  illegally occupied hundreds of plots of land identified as
 unproductive, blocked highways, and occupied government buildings, raising ten-
 sions and increasing confrontations with landowners, their gunmen, and, in many
 cases, policemen. Forty-five people died in land disputes in the first 8 months of
 1996. Such killings usually go unpunished, because the landowners thought to be
 
 
 368
 responsible for many of them often control the police in isolated areas, and intimi-
 date local judges and lawyers with violence and trats of violence.
 After significant pressure from human rights groups, the governor of the north-
 eastern state of Rio Grande do Norte suspenddi his assistant secretary for public
 security, Maurilio Pinto de Medeiros, pending clarification of his involvement in se-
 rious human rights abuses. The most serious allegation against Medeiros is that he
 is suspected ofheading a death squad omposed of uniformed and investigative po-
 licemen, according to a report by a special commission of prosecutors formed in May
 1995 to investigate the many aIlegations against Medeiros. As a result of the com-
 mission's investigation  the authorities fied a number of criminal complaints
 against Medeiros in a focal court, but no trial date has been set. Francisco Gilson
 Nogueira, a prominent local human rights attorney and public critic of Medeiros
 was fatally sot on October 20. The federal police are investigating the case but had
 not arrested any suspects at year's end.
 The authorities charged the commander and 19 other police officers involved in
 the August 1995 massare of 9 squatters in Corumbiara, Rondonia, with intentional
 homicide, meaning the accused wil be tried in regular ourts rather than a special
 police tribunal. They also charged four squatter leadrs with intentional homicide
 for the deaths of two policemen, as well as for the deaths of the nine squatters. The
 authorities justified the latter chargesb  declaring that the leaders were respon-
 sible for the land invasion that spar ked the onfrontation. The medical examiner re-
 ported that most of the squatters killed had been shot in the back at short range
 and that many of the bullets had traveled from the top of the body downward, indi-
 cating that the victims had been killed from behind while kneeling.
 In Akpril a ourt onvicted Rio de Janeiro polie offier Maros Vinicius Emmanuel
 for his involvement in the 1993 massacre of eight street children in downtown
 Candelaria square after he confessed to the crime, and sentenced him to 309 years
 in prison (reduced to 89 years on appeal). The courts convicted another policeman,
 Nelson Cunha, on similar charges in November and sentenced him to 261 years in
 prison. Cunha has the right to a retrial, but no date has been set. The trial of a
 third policeman, Marcos Aureio Alcantara, who also confessed his involvement in
 the Candelaria killings, is set for May 1997. Candelaria survivor and key witness
 Wagner dos Santos identified policeman Carlos Jorge Liaffa Coelho as one of those
 who shot him. Although the authorities briefly detained Liaffa after they found a
 gun reportedly used in the massacre in his father's home, they subsequently re-
 leased him for lack of evidence. A jury acquitted three of the original suspects in
 the case on December 10, at the request of both the _prosecution and the defense
 even though Dos Santos had consistently maintained that one of them was involved
 in the killings.
 The investigation of police gang members accused of murdering 21 Vigario Geral
 residents in 1993 continues to progress slowly.
 In March the Sao Paulo civil police's Department of Homicides and Personal Pro-
 tection (DHPP) took over the investigation from the local police in the case of Fran-
 co da Rocha, one of Sao Paulo state's poorest communities, and location of a clandes-
 tine dumping site for the victims of death squads. Since 1993 at least 212 bodies
 have been found there, 50 victims killed with bullets to the head, while the arms
 and heads of some of the bodies had been removed in an apparent attempt to con-
 ceal the victims' identities. Investigators succeeded in identifying most of the vic-
 tims, and linking them to previously unexplained disappearances. By year's end, the
 DHPP had not arrested or charged any suspects, but both human rights groups and
 Franco da Rocha police agreed that a thorough investigation was being conducted.
 Progress in the investigation of the 121 Sao Paulo police accused of the 1992
 Carandiru prison massacre was effectively stalled by disagreement over which court
 had jurisdiction-the special police courts or a civil court. The legislation signed in
 August by President Cardoso transferring all trials of uniformed police charged with
 intentional homicide to regular courts is likely to apply to the defendants in the
 Carandiru case. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) began
 censure proceedings against the Government in October for its failure to punish
 those responsible for the Carandiru killings. However, the expected transfer of the
 case to ordinary courts, and the human rights reforms being implemented by the
 state government, led the IACHR to suspend consideration of censure.
 In a high profile Sao Paulo case-the 42nd Delegacia"-uniformed and civil police
 were accused of the 1989 murder of 18 prisoners asphyxiated when police crammed
 51 prisoners into a tiny, unventilated cell as punishment. Although the civil police
 defendants have been tried and sentenced in civil court, the 7-year-old case against
 the uniformed police officers continues to languish in the special police tribunal. In
 March the IACHR censured the Government for the lack of progress in bringing to
 justice those responsible for the 42nd Delegacia massacre.

 In the Chico Mendes murder case, almost 3Y2 years after his convicted killers es-
 caped through the front door of a penitentiary in the western state of Acre, where
 they had been serving a 19-year sentence for the 1988 murder of the renowned rub-
 ber tapper and rural union leader, federal police agents recaptured Darly Alves da
 Silva in southern Para on June 30 and his son Darci on November 25. Both men
 were returned to prison.
 The case of the 1985 murder of Joao Canuto, the first president of the rural work-
 ers union in Rio Maria, Para, has been in the state prosecutor's office awaiting a
 trial date since August 1993, 8 years after the beginning of the investigation. -No
 one has been charged in the case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 However, human rights groups often blamed the police or vigilante groups for the
 dis appearanc of street children or persons believed to be criminals.
 On January 10, an eyewitness in a rape case against a Sao Paulo police officer
 disappeared. Shortly after she and the victim reported the December 1995 rape, the
 witness began receiving threats. By midyear the rape investigation was in progress,
 and bth the civil police and police ombudsman were investigating the disappear-
 ance.
 In 1995 Congress passed legislation recognizing and assuming government re-
 sponsibility for the deaths of 136 political activists who "disappear~ed" during the
 military regime while in the custody of public officials, and obligating the Govern-
 ment to pay indemnities of between $100,000 and $150,000 to each of the families.
 The law created a commission to determine the amount of each indemnity and to
 evaluate additional requests from families who believed that they might qualify as
 well. By mid-December, the commission had approved 108 additional indemnity re-
 quests and rejected 43, with 84 cases still pending.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and contains severe legal penalties for torture or
 acquiescence in it. The Penal Code fails to define torture, however, and there are
 frequent credible reports that police beat and torture criminal suspects to extract
 information, confessio ns, or money. Such torture can result in death (see Section
 l.a.) The Government estimated in its 1994 report on the internal human rights sit-
 uation that fewer than 10 percent of cases of mistreatment by police are reported.
 Victims are generally poor, uneducated about their rights, and-most of all- afraid
 to come forward for ear of reprisals.
 Fabio Luciano dos Reis, age 20, and Emerson Moreira da Silva, age 21, accused
 Sao Paulo policemen of beating them in March. Reis further alleged that police had
 held hini clwn and "scalped" him; he was later treated at a Sao Paulo hospital for
 knife wounds to the ski coveiing the cranium. Three officers were charged with
 the crime. In a case that received widespread media attention, the authorities
 charged 11 Sao Paulo policemen with causing bodily injury and abuse of authority
 in the alleged torture of a couple in October 1995. The police officers raided the
 house of M1essias Francisco de Souza, age 63, and his wife, Dirce Maria Anaclet,
 age 52, in the mistaken belief that the couple had been involved in the recent mur-
 der of a policeman. They subjected De Suza and Anacleto to kicks, electric shocks,
 and beatings with pistols, sticks, and fists. At year's end, the 11 policemen were
 awaiting trial, and the authorities were protecting the couple, who complained of
 receiving threats.
 Mario Cesar Machado Monteir, a military court judge in Rio de Janeiro, ant-
 ted two army captains accused of torturinga army corporal who had deserted dur-
 ing 'Operation Rio" the 1995 joint army-police operation agninst crime and drug
 trafficking in Rio, des pite evidence suggestindg that the captains had used smother-
 ing and other forms of torture on the corporal. The judge, however, justified his deci-
 sion by ruling that the necessary rigor was used to intimidate the corporal into ad-
 mitting his involvement in drug trafficking." Human rights groups widely criticized
 the ruling. r
 Prison conditions range from poor to harsh. According to the Government's 1995
 penitentiary census the overcrowded prisons held 129,169 inmates in space de-
 signed for 59,954. There are often six to eight prisoners in a cell meant for three;
 some prisoners force others to pay for the use of a bed. Due to the severe overcrowd-
 ing in prisons, police stations are often used as prisons, where sentenced criminals
 share cells with detainees.
 Sms Paulo's prison system in particular suffers from chronic overcrowding, corrupt
 and abusive local prison management, and prisoner access to weapons and drugs.
 The police precincts and state's 43 penitentiaries-the majority of them  plapidated
 and dhity-house 68,500 prisoners in facilities designed to hold less than 32,000.
 Discipline is difficult to main in under such cnditions, and prison officials often
 resort to inhuman treatment to maintain order. A report issued in April by the Sao
 
 
 Paulo state assembly revealed extremely harsh prison conditions, including rat- and
 mosquito-infested cells, lack of sanitary facilities, and kitchens that served raw or
 spoiled food. Scabies and tuberculosis, diseases not common in the general popu-
 lation, are endemic in Sao Paulo prisons. The report indicated that denial of ifrst
 aid and other medical care is sometimes used as a form of punishment.
 In the second half of the year, the severe overcrowding in Sao Paul prisons led
 to an increase in the number of prisoner revolts and the violence associated with
 them. An October riot at Carandiru prison left four prisoners and one guard dead,
 while in November, police killed four prisoners when they quelled an uprising at a
 prison in Praia Grande. A total of 1,442 prisoners escaped from Sao Paulo's prisons
 through the end of June. A surge in crime rates among minors has overwhelmed
 juvenile detention facilities, where conditions are no better than in regular prisons.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution limits arrests to those
 caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial au-
 thority. The authorities usually respect the constitutional provision for a judicial de-
 termination of the legality of detention, although some convicted inmates are held
 beyond their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits provisional de-
 tention for up to 5 days under specified conditions during a police investigation, but
 a judge may extend this period. According to groups that work with street children,
 however, the police sometimes detain street youths illegally without a judicial order
 or hold them incommunicado.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment, but in many instances it is unable to ensure the right to fair trial.
 The judicial system, with the federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes courts
 of first instance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial systems but
 must adhere to the basic principles in the federal Constitution. There is also a sys-
 tem of specialized courts dealing with police, labor, elections, juveniles, and family
 matters.
 Special police courts have jurisdiction over state uniformed police; the record of
 these courts shows that punishment is the exception rather than the rule. A human
 rights group in the northeast, studyingpolice crimes against civilians tried in police
 courts from 1970 to 1991, found that only 8 percent of the cases resulted in convic-
 tions. In Sao Paulo, another study found that only 5 percent of cases resulted in
 convictions. The courts (which are separate from the courts-martial of the armed
 forces, except for the final appeals court) are composed of four ranking state uni-
 formed police officials and one civilian judge. With too few judges for the caseload
 there are backlogs, and human rights groups note a lack of zeal among police
 charged with investigating fellow officers.
 In August the President signed legislation giving ordinary courts jurisdiction over
 cases in which uniformed police officers are accused of intentional homicide against
 civilians. Human rights groups are dubious about the new law's likely impact on
 impunity, since it is the internal police investigation that determines whether the
 homicide was intentional or not, and the police tribunal that decides whether to for-
 ward a case to civil court for trial.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. According to the Ministry of Justice, approximately 85 percent of pris-
 oners cannot afford an attorney. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an at-
 torney, the court must provide one at public expense; courts are supposed to appoint
 private attorneys to represent poor defendants when public defenders are unavail-
 able, but often no effective defense is provided. Juries try only cases of willful crimes
 against life; judges try all others.
 The right to a fair ublic trial as provided by law is generally respected in prac-
 tie, although in ruraIareas the judiciary is generally less capable and more subject
 to the influence of local landowners, particularly in cases related to indigenous peo-
 ple and rural union activists. Similarly, local police are often less zealous in inves-
 tigating, prosecutors are reluctant to initiate proceedings, and judges find reasons
 to delay when cases involve gunmen contracted by landowners to eliminate squat-
 ters or rural union activists.
 The need for judicial reform is widely recognized because the current system is
 inefficient, with backlogs of cases and shortages of judges. Lawyers often drag out
 cases as long as possible in the hope that an appeals court might render a favorable
 opinion and because they are paid according to the amount of time they spend on
 a case. According to the Institute bf Economic, Social, and Political Studies of Sao
 Paulo, however, 90 percent of appeals court decisions confirm decisions made in
 lower courts. Low pay, combined with exacting competitive examinations that in
 some years eliminate 90 percent of the applicants, make it difficult to fill vacancies
 
 
 on the bench. The system requires that a trial be held within a certain period of
 time from the date of the crime (similar to a statute of limitations). However, due
 to the backlog of cases, old cases are frequently dismissed. According to a former
 judge, this encourages corrupt judges purposely to delay certain cases, so that they
 can De dismissed.
 A federal law approved in September 1995 created small claims courts to handle,
 and resolve quickly, less serious criminal and civil cases. In Sao Paulo, the new
 courts resolved 80 percent of their cases within 60 days, and cleared from the state
 docket some 45,000 backlogged cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home, although
 wiretaps authorized by judicial authority are permitted. There were no reports of
 illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes without a warrant oc-
 curs in searches for criminal suspects. The inviolability of private correspondence
 is respected. The law regulating the conditions under which wiretaps may be used
 appears to strike a fair balance between giving the police an effective law enforce-
 ment tool and protecting the civil liberties of citizens. Several test cases are re-
 quired, however, to determine whether that balance is maintained in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of
 censorship and provides for freedom of speech and a free press. The authorities re-
 spect these rights in practi~e. Newspapers and magazines, which are privately
 owned, vigorously report and comment on government performance. Both the press
 and broadcast media routinely discuss controversial social and political issues and
 engage in investigative reporting.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned; but the Government has
 licensing authority, and politicians frequently obtain the licenses. Many television
 and radio stations are owned by current or former congressmen, some of whom are
 or were members of the committee overseeing communications. It is difficult to de-
 termine how many media outlets are indirectly controlled by politicians since con-
 cessions are often registered in the names of family members or friends linked to
 them. In addition, concessions are regularly transferred to other names, with little
 oversight by the Government.
 The penalty for libel under the 1967 press law-a prison term--is considered ex-
 treme by judges. Press criticism has described it as an archaic and authoritarian
 law inherited from the military regime. Congress has considered, but has not yet
 eliminated, the press law's provisions for prison terms.
 There were reports of harassment against journalists. According to the Inter-
 American Press Association, radio commentator Carlos Alberto Salvador received
 death threats from the mayor of Boa Viagem, in the northeastern state of Ceara,
 after denouncing a number of irregularities in the mayor's administration. Salvador
 filed a criminal complaint with the state secretary of public security in January. On
 January 24, a police officer, Major Adalberto Carvalho de Seuza, tried to prevent
 the Recife-based newspaper, Jornal do Comercio, from reporting the arrest of a ser-
 geant from his battalion, who was accused of stealing 10 cases of beer from a super-
 market. Late on the night of February 19, two shots were fired through the windows
 of the central office of the national daily newspapr Jornal do Brasil, based in Rio
 de Janeiro. Only six journalists were in the building at the time, and none was in-
 jured. The police are investigating but have identified no suspects. On May 15, re-
 porters Warner Filho and Tina Coelho, of the Brasilia daily Correio Braziliense,
 were covering police carrying out an eviction order of squatters in Cristalina, Goias.
 When the reporters tried to photograph police destroying six temporary shelters
 erected by the squatters, the police handcuffed and beat them and arrested them
 for obstruction of justice and disrespect for authority.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil; prior review of films, plays,
 and radio and television programming is practiced only to determine a suitable
 viewing age.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Permits are not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings
 occur frequently,
 The Constitution also provides for the right of freedom of association, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no favored or state religion. All
 
 
 aiths are free to establish places of worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although
 the Government controls entry into Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for the
 protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return. A
 parent, however, is not allowed to leave the country with children without the per-
 mission of the other parent.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in assisting refugees. The Government does not pro-
 vide first asylum; rather, those physically present in the country whom the UNHCR
 determines to be refugees are accepted for resettlement. In 1996, 375 people applied
 for refugee status. The Government approved 115 applications, denied 167, and de-
 cisions were pending on the others at year's end. There were no reports of forced
 repatriation of persons to countries in which they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections, and citizens most recently exercised this right in 1994, filling
 executive and legislative offices throughout the country. Voting is secret and manda-
 tory for all literate Brazilian citizens age 18 to 70, except military conscripts who
 may not vote. It is voluntary for minors age 16 to 18, for the illiterate, and for those
 age 70 and over.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution and are becoming active
 in politics and government. However, they comprise only 6.5 percent of the national
 Congress; 34 women serve in the Chamber of Deputies (out of 513 seats), and 6
 serve in the Senate (out of 81 members). In the 1994 elections, voters elected one
 female governor. To boost the participation of women in government, Congress
 passed legislation requiring that 20 percent of each party's candidates in the 1996
 municipal elections be women. In November voters in Sao Paulo elected the city's
 first black mayor. The 1988 Constitution gave Indians the franchise, but their abil-
 ity to protect their own interests is severely limited (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) actively investigate allegations of human
 rights violations and often initiate legal proceedings. Government officials are gen-
 erally cooperative with them. Several international NGO's either maintain offices in
 Brazil or visit periodically. In a 10-day visit to Brazil in August, the executive direc-
 tor of Human Rights Watch/Americasidentified a number of areas of concern but
 found the federal officials open in discussing human rights problems. Government
 offices such as the Ministry of Justice's secretaries for citizenship and human rights
 and the federal prosecutor's office respond readily to inquiries about human rights
 cases and launch their own investigations.
 Both the federal and some state governments formed partnerships with NGO's in
 a number of significant initiatives. For example, the Ministry of Justice asked the
 University of Sa Paulo-based Nucleus for the Study of Violence to draft the na-
 tional human rights action plan. In addition, in a series of seminars around the
 country, the Government solicited the input of a broad range of human rights
 groups for the final version of the plan, announced by President Cardoso in May.
 The northeastern state of Pernambuco created a witness protection program, the
 first in Brazil, to protect witnesses or victims of violent crimes. Development and
 administration of the nascent program was the result of a unique partnership be-
 tween the state government and GAJOP, a human rights NGO.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional, yet women, blacks, and indigenous people continued to experience discrimi-
 nation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) notes that important differences
 in wages continue to exist to the detriment of women and blacks, particularly in
 rural areas.
 There continued to be reports of violence against homosexuals, although it was
 not always clear that the victims' sexual orientation was the reason. The Grupo Gay
 da Bahia, Brazil's best known homosexual rights organization, reported that 65 ho-
 mosexuals were killed in the first 7 months of 1996, but the group's report did not
 specify whether all the victims were specifically targeted because they were homo-
 sexual or were killed for other motives. Ten homosexuals were murdered, and 3 dis-
 appeared, in Brasilia in the first 7 months of 1996. Most were apparently the vic-
 
 
 373
 tins of male prostitutes, some of whom reportedly were low-ranking soldiers trying
 to earn extra money.
 There were several attacks by neo-Nazi skinhead groups in cities in southern
 Brazil. In March neo-Nazi skinheads murdered Carlos Adilson de Siqueira, a 23-
 year-old gay black man, in the southern city of Curitiba. The confessed killer, a 17-
 year-old office boy, was a member of "Carecas do Brasl," a skinhead gang composed
 of adolescents from well-ff families. The group denied that it targets blacks but ad-
 mitted to persecuting homosexuals and drug addicts. According to the Curitiba po-
 lice, at least three neo-Nazi groups, totallng about 30 members, were active in
 Curitiba. In June a gang of some 30 neo-Nazis stormed into two gay bars in Sao
 Paulo, assaulted many customers, and killed a gay artist, Nilton Verdini Silva. No
 one has been charged for Silva's murder.
 Women.-There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women. Most major cities
 and towns have established sjecial police offices to deal with crimes against women,
 including 124 cities in Sao Paulo state, 54 in Minas Gerais, and 5 in the state of
 Rio de Janeiro. The special police office in Brasilia has seen a steady increase in
 reports of crimes against women during the last 6 years, from 1,003 in 1992 to 3,818
 in 1995, and 2,404 in the first 7 months of 1996. Police and social workers attribute
 the increase in reported complaints not to a rising level of violence against women,
 but to greater awareness by women of their rights and less willingness to tolerate
 abuse than in the past. The Brasilia office produced and distributed widely a pam-
 phlet containing tips for women on how to avoid being raped, which played an inte-
 gral role in making women throughout the Federal District aware of the special of-
 ice's services. The office for protection of human rights in the Belo Horizonte may-
 or's office noted a "frightening escalation of violence against women" in that city.
 In the first 5 months of 1996, 90 rapes, 68 murders of women, and 1,237 cases of
 bodily harm were reported to Belo Horizonte police stations.
 In rural areas, abused women have little recourse since there are no specialized
 police offices available to them. Men who commit crimes against women, including
 sexual assault and murder, are unlikely to be brought to trial. Although the Su-
 preme Court in 1991 struck down the archaic concept of "defense of honor" as a jus-
 tification for wife murder, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict men
 who attack their wives. In April the Supreme Court voted to absolve a man con-
 victed by a lower court of rape for having sexual intercourse with a 12-year-old girl.
 Even though the age of consent is 14, the court stated in its ruling that the man
 had not committed a crime because the girl had given her permission. One federal
 deputy praised the "courage: of the court's decision and introduced a bill to lower
 the age of consent from 14 to 12.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment or pay and
 provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. However, the provision against wage
 discrimination is rarely enforced. According to the most recent officia statistics,
 women earn, on average, 54 percent of the salaries earned by men. A recent study
 by a sociologist showed that women who started working in positions in which they
 earned twice the minimum wage advanced in pay after 10 years to a wage of seven
 times the minimum wage. Men starting in the same positions earned 2.6 times the
 minimum wage and advanced to a wage of 10.9 times the minimum wage after 10
 years. A Ministry of Labor survey revealed that the average starting salary for high
 school-educated women in Sao Paulo hired between January and May was about
 $850, fully one-third less than the $1,300 average starting salary for high school-
 educated men during the same period.
 In Sao Paulo in early September, several thousand students took the entrance
 exam to become judges. According to the daily newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo,
 women wearing pants were not allowed to take the exam, as test administrators
 told them that they were not dressed in accordance with the "tradition of the judici-
 arj response to the maternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certifi-
 cates from female job applicants or try to avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 Hoping to clamp down on such practices, President Cardoso signed a law in April
 1995 prohibiting employers from requiring applicants or employees to take preg-
 nancy tests or present sterilization certificates. Employers who violate the law are
 subject to a jail term ranging from 1 to 2 years, while the company must pay a fine
 equal to 10 times the salary of its highest paid employee.
 Children.-Despite progressive laws to protect children and a growing awareness
 of their plight through media and NGO campaigns, millions of children continue to
 fail to get an education, must work to survive, and suffer from the poverty afflicting
 their families. In a positive development, a report issued by the Brazilian Institute
 for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) stated that the number of children between the
 ages of 10 and 14 who were employed decreased by 163,000 from 1993 to 1995.
 
 
 374
 However, more than 3 million children in the same age range continue to work
 many of them together with their parents under conditions approximating forced
 labor or debt bondage (see Section 6.d.). Many other children beg on the streets of
 cities.
 There are no reliable figures on the number of street children, some of whom are
 homeless, but the majority of whom return home at night. In Rio de Janeiro, an
 organization aiding street children estimated recently that 30,000 frequent the
 streets by day but probably less than 1,000 sleep there. NGO's have made enough
 shelters available for homeless children, but some children prefer the freedom and
 drugs that street life offers. In Sao Paulo, NGO's aiding street children estimated
 that some 12,000 children roam the streets by day and that from 3,000 to 5,000 of
 them live permanently on the streets. The NGO a report that extreme poverty at
 home or sexual abuse by fathers and stepfathers are the principal reasons so many
 children choose to live on the streets. An IBGE stud  reprted that 47 percent of
 Sao Paulo children come from families that earn less tan  200 per month.
 Because street children have a high rate of drug use and have been involved in
 assaults and robberies, a significant portion of the public supports harsh police
 measures against them, viewing the issue as one of crime and security, not human
 rights. Of the 562 reported homicides in the northeastern state of Pernambuco in
 the first 8 months of 1995, 10 percent of the victims were under 18 years of age.
 A local human rights group suspects that many of these minors are killed by off-
 duty policemen and private security guards hired by area businessmen to rid their
 areas of street children. Rio de Janeiro's AdvancedInstitute for Religious Studies
 reported that 596 minors were murdered in Rio in 1995, a significant increase from
 the 513 killed the previous year. Federal, state, and local governments devote insuf-
 ficient resources to street children. NGO's sponsor relief efforts, but demand far out-
 strips available resources.
 In January Embratur, the national tourist agency, embarked on a national cam-
 paign against sex tourism and child prostitution, a significant problem throughout
 Brazil, but particularly prevalent in the major tourist cities in the northeast. The
 agency banned the use of images of scantily clad women in its promotional mate-
 rials, and launched a nationwide program, in conjunction with private travel agen-
 cies and NGO's, to warn hotel guests of the prohibition on sex with minors by plac-
 ing posters inside their rooms. Through a series of workshops, Embratur also at-
 tempted to educate travel agents and state tourism agencies about existing legisla-
 tion on child prostitution. The gvernment of the Federal District launched a com-
 prehensive program, 'Brasilia Crianca," aimed at combating the sexual exploitation
 of children. The program involves a broad range of concrete actions, including creat-
 ing a 24-hour number for reporting cases of sexual abuse; creating a special police
 office to investigate sexual crimes against children; requiringschools to discuss vio-
 lence against children; requiring the formation of teams within each clinic and hos-
 pital trained to treat child victims of violence or sexual abuse; and developing for-
 mal education classes and professional training for adolescents from low-income
 families who have had little education.
 People With Disabilities.-The 1988 Constitution contains several provisions for
 the disabled, stipulating a minimum wage, educational opportunities, and access to
 public buildings and public transportation. Groups that work with the disabled,
 however, report that state governments completely failed to meet the legally man-
 dated targets for educational opportunities and work placement.
 There was little progress in the elimination of architectural barriers to the dis-
 abled. However, the Federal District government made some efforts to eliminate ar-
 chitectural barriers by building access ramps and enlarging restrooms at Brasilia's
 central bus station, the zoo, the city park, and the southern commercial area. In ad-
 dition, the city opened bidding for the acquisition of five access lifts to be installed
 in buses by yers end. Federal District legislation requires public buses to reserve
 four seats for the disabled, but other riders normally do not respect the rule, and
 drivers rarely enforce it. The Federal District government offered 22 professional
 training courses to 750 disabled people, and was negotiating with private companies
 to find positions for course graduates. Through the end of August, 12 people with
 disabilities had begun working for the city after receiving training.
 Indigens People.-Brazil's approximately 320000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferent anguages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. Indigenous
 rights groups, however, expressed concern that in practice the authorities allow
 most indigenous people only limited participation in decisions affecting their lands,
 cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. The 1988 Constitution
 charged the federal Government with demarcating 519 indigenous areas within 5
 years, but the authorities have yet to complete more than half the demarcations and
 entitling decrees. In January the Government issued decree 1775, altering the de-
 
 
 375
 marcation process to permit challenges to proposed demarcations from nonindige-
 nous interested parties, despite the fact that the Constitution allows the federal
 Government to expropriate land with just compensation.
 A total of 419 separate challenges, covering 34 Indian areas, were filed. FUNAI,
 the National Indian Foundation, rejected all of the claims, and forwarded them to
 Justice Minister Nelson Jobim, who made the final decision. Jobim rejected all but
 33 challenges, covering 8 different areas. He returned these to Funai asking for clar-
 ification of what he called technical errors in the anthropological reports, the basis
 for each demarcation.
 The concerns of Indian rights groups and the federal prosecutor's office that the
 change in the demarcation process would reopen land claims in previously demar-
 cated' Indian reserves, and encourage land invasions by non-Indians hoping to stake
 new claims, resulting in increased violence, seem to be well-founded. According to
 COIAB, an umbrella group of indigenous rights organizations in the Amazon region,
 lumberjacks, fishermen, agricultural workers, and miners intensified invasions of at
 least 18 indigenous lands in Amazonas, Para, Parana, Rondonia and Roraima with-
 in 2 weeks after the new demarcation decree took effect. Lumberjacks invaded the
 Mamia reservation in Amazonas, home to 150 Munduruku Indians, where they cut
 down dozens of trees, and beat an Indian resident. Some 100 miners invaded the
 Munduruku reservation of Jacareacanga in southern Para, raising tensions with the
 Indians, who threatened to attack the miners if they were not removed.
 The challenge to the Raposa-Serra do Sol reserve in Roraima, inhabited by some
 12,000 Macuxi, Wapixana, Ingariko, and Taurepang Indians, was among the 8 that
 Justice Minister Jobim did not reject. The area was identified as traditional Indian
 land by Funai anthropologists in 1993, but the demarcation order awaited the Jus-
 tice Minister's approval for 3 years. The area has been torn by constant conflict be-
 tween Indians and nonindigenous occupants. Jobim had asked for further informa-
 tion on Raposa-Serra do Sol, citing the existence of a recently created municipality
 near the boundaries of the area. On December 20, Jobim ordered a reduction in the
 boundaries of the reservation and determined that several settlements by non-Indi-
 ans would be allowed to remain within the area.
 The Constitution provides Indians with the exclusive use of the soil, waters, and
 minerals found in their lands, subject to congressional authorization. The regula-
 tions necessary for economic exploitation, however, are still pending before the Con-
 grew as part of the bill known as the statute of indigenous societies. Illegal mining,
 logging, and ranching are a constant problem on Indian lands, as a majority of these
 lands have been occupied by non-Indians.
 Several thousand gold miners invaded the Yanomami reserve in the state of
 Roraima, after the Government, citing a lack of resources, suspended its efforts to
 expel miners from the area. The influx of miners caused a surge in the number of
 Indians dying from malaria. At least 36 Yanomami died from malaria, and 136 from
 other diseases, including pneumonia and tuberculosis, in part due to the federal
 Government's failure to provide adequate medical care for indigenous people. The
 Catholic Church-affiliatedIndigenist Missionary Council (CIMI) was alarmed at the
 lack of access to health care of the Deni Indians, who live in groups of some 60 Indi-
 ans each along the Xerua river in the Amazon region. According to CIMI, a measles
 epidemic in 1991 killed 60 of 500 Deni Indians, and approximately 25 percent of
 the Deni population has died sine then of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis
 and malaria. Since the Deni live in extremely isolated areas, sick Indians must trav-
 el 10 days _by boat to get to the nearest Funai health clinic in Manaus. According
 to a report by the Manaus-based Institute of Tropical Medicine, the average life ex-
 pectancy of Brazilian Indians dropped from 48.2 years in 1993 to 42.6 yeara in 1995.
 The 1993 case againat the Brazilian gold miners who were accused of killing 16
 Yanomami on the eneelan side of the border remains mired in legal problems.
 None of the accused miners is in custody. Yanomamni witnesses failhdto recognize
 two of the acused, and other witnesses have disappeared. Indigenous rights groups
 expressed concern that the process was completely paralyzed and that those respon-
 sib~le for the massacre may never be brought to justice.
 CIMI reported that more than 7,000 Indians were trapped into forced labor (see
 Section 6.c.). The majority were Guarani Indians in the state of Mate Grosso do Sal,
 where a high rate of suicide (11 among the Guarani through July) was reported.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although racial discrimination has been ile-
 gal since 1951, darker skinned citizens say they frequently encounter discrimina-
 tion. Most blacks are found among the poorer sectors of society. Even though nearly
 half of the population has some African ancestry, very few senior officials in govern-
 ment, the armed forces, or the private sector are black. Black consciousness organi-
 zations challenge the view that Brazil is a racial democracy with equality for a6 re-
 
 
 376
 gardless of skin color. They assert that racial discrimination becomes most evident
 when blacks seek employment, housing, or educational opportunities.
 According to government statistics, the monthly per capita income for white males
 is 6.3 times the minimum wage; for white women, 3.6 times the minimum wage;
 for black men, 2.9; and for black women, 1.7.
 A 1995 survey conducted by a prominent polling service provided insight into the
 perceptions of different segments of the population about the problem of racism. The
 survey showed that 89 percent of the punation believes that whites are prejudiced
 against blacks. Ten percent of nonblacks admitted that they were prejudiced against
 blacks, and, according to the pollsters, 87 percent of whites [ipaysigns of rac-
 ism in their answers to at least 1 of 12 questions asked in the poll. A 1996 survey
 (by a different polling group) of people in 11 state capitals revealed that 83 percent
 of those interviewed believe that blacks suffer from discrimination. In Sao Paulo
 58.9 percent of respondents and in Belo Horizonte 68.1 percent of respondents be-
 lieved that measures should be taken to discourage natives of the noreast, many
 of whom are black, from migrating to those cities.
 Blacks are often the victims of violence at a level disproportionate to their per-
 centage in the population. For instance, a well-respected human rights NGO active
 in the northeast, the Luiz Fre   Cultural Center, reported that, of the 1,378 murder
 victims in Recife in 1994, 87 prcent were black. The weekly newsmagazine, Isto
 E, reprted that, on June 17, Lciano Soares Ribeir, a black data entry operator,
 was riding his bicycle in the town of Canoas, near Porto Alegre, the capita of Rio
 Grand do Sul, when he was hit by a white man driving a car. The driver, Rogero
 Ferreira Pansera, later told the police that he had not stopped to help Ribeiro be-
 cause he assumed that Ribeiro was a bike thief. Two passers-by took Ribeiro to a
 nearby hospital. When his mother arrived 4 hours later, she learned that the neu-
 rologst, Antonio Carlos Marrone had refused to treat her son because he assumed
 that he was a common criminal and would not be able to pay his medical bill.
 Ribeiro died 2 dar s later from cranial trauma.
 Racism as a crime is difficult to prove, although both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janer-
 ro have designated special police units to investigate it. In a positive development,
 however, the daily news ae r, Folha de Sao Palo, reported that, in January, a Rio
 de Janeiro court ordered Pires security services to pay an indemnity of $1 million
 foremoral damages to the family of a black bookseller, Valdemir Damiao     da
 Purificacao. In Februar 1995, a security guard shot and killed Purificacao as he
 entered a Bank of Bra hoffice in the Tijuca district of Rio de Janeir where he went
 regularly to sell books. In his statement to police aferward, the security guard said
 he thought Purificacah was a thief, "because he was black and was carrying a large
 vinyl bag."
 In a case that generated considerable media attention, a well-known entertaner
 named I'iririca" released a record called "look at her hair," whose lyrics many criti-
 cized as racist. The lyrics describe his wife, who is black, as a "stinking beast whose
 odor is worse than a skunk." Tiririca himself is the son of an Afro-Brazilian mother
 and is considered a mixed-race mulatto by Brazilian standards. The Ministry of Jus-
 tice filed racism charges against Tiririca in Rio de Janeiro, where the judge ordered
 Sony records to withdraw all copies of the compact _disc and cassettes. Subsequently,
 a federal prosecutor told Sony's president that producing or makingte song public
 would be considered a criminal act, and recommended that he withdraw all copies
 from the national market. He told Sony that it would be allowed to re-release it only
 aftr the song is removed.
 A much higher percentage of blacks are convicted by Brazilian courts than whites,
 according to professor Srgia Adorno, of the University of Smo Paulo's Nucleus for
 the Stuy ofViolene. Adorno analyzed 500 criminalcases judged in Sao Paulo
 courts in 1990 and found that 60 percent of whites able to afford their own lawyers
 were acquitted, while only 27 percent of blacks who hired lawyers were found not
 guilty.
 President Cardoso created in November 1995 an interministerial workinc group
 to fight what he acknowledged as Brazil's serious problem with racism and discrimi-
 nation. The group was charged with proposing public aicies to increase the partici-
 pation and access of Afro-Brazilians in society. The Prsident's public acknowledg-
 ment that racism and discrimination existed in Brazil was unprecedented for Brazil-
 ian presidents, who have maintained in the past that people were discriminated
 against because they were poor, not because of their skin color. The interministerial
 group's subgroup on health launched a national campaign to educate health workers
 and other about sickle cell anemia, and began requiring that rac ee indicated on
 all birth and death certificates, intending to use the information gathered to build
 a comprehensive database of statistics on race. Another subgroup is studying the
 possibility of implementing affirmative action programs in three principal areas:
 
 
 Education, the labor market, and government-sponsored radio and television adver-
 tising.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code provides for union representation
 of all workers (except for military, police, and firemen) but imposes a hierarchical,
 unitary system, funded by a mandatory "union tax" on workers and employers.
 Under a restriction known as "unicidade" (one per city), the code prohibits multiple
 unions of the same professional category in a given geographical area. The 1988
 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones without prior au-
 thorization by the Government but retained other provisions of the old labor code.
 Elements of the labor movement and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU) criticize the retention of unicidade and the union tax.
 In practice, unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as more liberal
 interpretations of its restrictions permitted new unions to form and-in many
 cases--to compete with unions and federations that had already enjoyed official rec-
 ognition. The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register with the
 Ministry of Labor which, by judicial decision, is bound to receive and record their
 registration. The primary source of continuing restriction is the system of labor
 courts, which retain the right to review the registration of new unions and to adju-
 dicate conflicts over their formation. The power of the labor courts to define jurisdic-
 tions came to the fore again during 1996 when the Sole Workers Central (CUT-
 the largest and most activist of the three labor confederations) ABC metalworkers'
 federation was riven by a goup of dissidents who attempted to establish their own
 local union in one of the su urban Sao Paulo municipaities that the federation com-
 prises. Although a majority of federation members clearly appeared to favor the uni-
 fied structure, the dissidents sought redress by filing suit with the labor court.
 Otherwise, unions are independent of the Government and of political parties. Ap-
 proximately 20 to 30 percent of the work force is organized, with well over half of
 this number affiliated with an independent labor central. Intimidation of rural labor
 union organizers by landowners and their agents continues to be a problem (see Sec-
 tion l.a.).
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, including civil serv-
 ants (except again, for military, police, and firemen). Enabling legislation passed in
 1989 stipulates that essential services must remain in operation during a strike and
 that workers must notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout.
 The Constitution prohibits government interference in labor unions but provides
 that "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not maintaining essential services or fail-
 ure to end a strike after a labor court decision) is punishable by law.
 The Constitution specifies the right of public employees to strike, subject to condi-
 tions enacted by the Congress. Since the Congress has yet to pass the complemen-
 tary legislation, labor law attorneys continue to debate the limits on the right to
 strike of public employees. In practice, the Government has not interfered with their
 right to strike, though a month-long strike by Petrobras (the public oil monopoly)
 employees in May 1995, which greatly inconvenienced the public, was judged abu-
 sive by the Supreme Labor Court, and led man-including some labor leaders-
 to call for limits on public employees' right to Cte.
 CUT, the parent central to the petroleum workers, submitted a complaint to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association in
 May 1995 arguing that the firing of 59 union members for their involvement in the
 stre violated their right to strike. In November 1995 the ILO body found that the
 nature of the labor court's procedures, which allow either party to submit a dispute
 for what amounts to binding arbitration, "may effectively undermine the right of
 workers to strike and does not promote effective collective bargaining." The ILO sug-
 gested that the legislation be amended to permit submission of disputes to judicial
 authorities only with the permission of beth parties or in case of the interruption
 of essential services. The ILO also suggested that the 59 workers be rehired.
 Train and municipal transit workers, autoworkers, metalworkers, university pro-
 fessors, electrical generating authority employees, and dockworkers all went on
 strike. In addition, the three trade union confederations called a 1-day general
 strike in June in which nearly all organized sectors of the economy participated to
 some degree. Formerly, the courts ruled almost automatically that strikes were abu-
 sive; in recent years, however, the courts have applied the law with more discretion.
 The 1989 strike law prohibits dismissals or the hiring of substitute workers during
 a strike, with certain exceptions, provided the strike is not ruled abusive.
 Although the law makes no provision for a central labor organization three major
 groups have emerged. The Sole Workers Central, the General Woriers Confed-
 eration, and Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing to represent
 
 
 378
 professional categories of workers, but all three centrals can effectively acquire such
 standing by affiliating with existing statewide federations or nationwide confed-
 erations orby forming new federations and confederations.
 Unions and centrals freely affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 All three major confederations are affiliated with the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize. With government assistance, businesses and unions are work-
 ing to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. The scope of issues
 legally susceptible to collective bargaining is narrow, however, and the labor court
 system exercises normative powers with regard to the settlement of labor disputes,
 thus discouraging direct negotiation. The Cardoso Government made expansion of
 collective bargaining one of its major objectives in the labor sector. In mid-1995, the
 Government promulgated a provisional measure that ended the indexing of wages
 to inflation, reduced the role of labor courts in wage negotiations, allowed for medi-
 ation if the parties involved requested it, and provided greater latitude for collective
 bargaining. VJnions welcomed these changes, since previously labor courts and the
 Labor Ministry had mediation responsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute
 settlement. In many cases, free negotiations set wages; labor court decisions set
 them in others. Under the terms of the provisional measure, parties may now freely
 choose mediation. The ILO notes that important differences in wages continue to
 exist to the detriment of women and blacks, particularly in the rural sectors (see
 Section 5).
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code that prohibits the
 dismissal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership posi-
 tions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort to
 a usually lengthy court process for relief. In general, the authorities do not effec-
 tively enforce laws protecting union members from discrimination. Union officials
 estimate that only 5 percent of such cases reaching the labor court system are re-
 solved within days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent gen-
 erally take 5 to 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies equally in the free trade zones. However unions in the Manaus
 Free Trade Zone, like rural unions and many unions in smaller cities, are relatively
 weaker vis-a-vis industry compared with unions in the major industrial centers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor, there were credible reports of forced labor in many parts of
 Brazil. In 1996 the Catholic Church-affiliated Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) re-
 ported 21 cases of forced labor, involving a total of 26,047 workers in 8 states. The
 number of workers involved represents a small increase over the 25,193 reported
 the previous year and a large increase over the 19,940 reported in 1994. Forced
 labor is common on farms producing charcoal for use in the iron foundries and steel
 industries and in the sugar industry (see also Section 6.d.).
 Local police admitted that overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay from
 migrant laborers and use force to retain and intimidate them, but such violations
 fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Labor
 increased the number of roving inspectors from 2,300 in 1995 to some 3,000 in 1996,
 but admits that its enforcement mechanisms are still inadequate. Labor organiza-
 tions allege that in mining and the rural economy thousands of workers, including
 minors, are hired on the basis of false promises, subjected to debt bondage and
 forced prostitution, with violence used to retain or punish workers who attempt to
 escape. The people responsible for exploiting forced labor usually go unpunished be-
 cause freed workers are often afraid to testify against those who recruited and
 oversaw them, and because the authorities have found it difficult to identify and lo-
 cate the owners of farms or businesses that exploit forced labor.
 The CPT reported that local authorities varied in their responses to allegations
 that forced labor existed in their jurisdictions. The governor of Minas Gerais denied
 that forced labor existed in his state even though, according to the CPT, inspections
 found some 8,000 people who were being forced to work on charcoal farms without
 payment and under subhuman conditions. In the western state of Acre, however,
 the state prosecutor general for labor appointed two special prosecutors to inves-
 tigate allegations of forced labor there.
 In mid-i995 the largest trade union confederation, CUT, initiated a 24-hour hot
 line with a toll-free number for reporting instances of forced labor. CUT president
 Vicente Paulo da Silva inaugurated the campaign by personally inspecting charcoal
 refineries in the state of Mato Giosso do Sul. Shortly after the CUT initiative, Presi-
 dent Cardoso announced the formation of a task force to combat forced labor.
 Cardoso said that the Government would no longer provide loans, subsidies, or roll-
 over of outstanding debt to farms or companies found to employ forced labor and
 that they would be ineligible to bid on public contracts. One important practice in-
 
 
 379
 stituted by the task force was the use of federal law enforcement officers from other
 states for inspections, so that enterprises using forced labor cannot rely on friendly
 local authorities to avoid detection and punishment. The CPT noted that the effec-
 tiveness of surprise inspections was often hampered by the inability of inspection
 teams to arrive in an area without advance warning and by often spotty collabora-
 tion from the federal police. The Minister of Labor issued a decree in late 1995 pro-
 viding that farms caught a second time using forced labor would be seized, and used
 to settle landless families as part of the federal Government's agrarian reform pro-
 gram.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age under
 the Constitution is 14 years, except for apprentices. Judges can authorize employ-
 ment for children under 14 years of age w en they feel it appropriate. However, in
 October the Cardoso administration introduced a proposed constitutional amend-
 ment that would prohibit all child labor under the age of 14. The authorities rarely
 enforce legal restrictions intended to protect working minors under the age of 18,
 however and the problem is widespread. The law requires permission of the parents
 or guardians for minors to work, and they must attend school through the primary
 grades. The law bars all minors from night work, work that constitutes a physical
 strain, and employment in unhealtbhful, dangerous, or morally harmful conditions.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws, but it has
 too few inspectors to do so effectively. The widely held view that it is better for mi-
 nors to work than to be involved in street crime also hampers enforcement efforts.
 Despite legal restrictions, however, official figures state that more than 3 million
 10- to 14-year-old children (or 4.6 percent of the work force) were employed. Many
 children work alongside their parents in cane fields, cutting hemp, or feeding wood
 into charcoal ovens; accidents, unhealthy working conditions, and sqalor are com-
 mon in these work places. According to a omprehensive 1995 report in the weekly
 magazine Veja on the problem of child labor, it is common to find children in the
 interior of Bahia who have lost fingers and forearms feeding sisal into grinding ma-
 chines. Carlos Silva de Jesus, age 14, for instane, has been blind since the age of
 8 when, while working in a sisal fid in Retirolandia, Bahia, he stabbed his left
 eye with a sisal leaf and shortly afterward punctured his right eye with a knife be-
 cause he could not see very well.
 In a public ceremony in the Presidential Palace on September 6, President
 Cardoso, accompanied by eight state governors and much of his cabinet, signed
 three protocols with state governors and NGO's expressing the commitment o the
 signatories to eradicate child labor in Brazil. In remarks at the signing ceremony,
 Cardoso said that child labor was "unacceptable" because it involved the degrada-
 tion of human beings, which reflected badly on all Brazilians. Cardoso acknowledged
 that child labor has long existed in Brazil, but he insisted that the situation was
 different now because the federal Government, in cooperation with state govern-
 ments, businesses, and NGO's, was taking concrete steps to combat it.
 Cottage industry subcontractors for independent shoe manufacturers in Franca
 (Sao Paulo) have, in the past, employed thousands of children under the age of 14,
 in violation of the law. Public prosecutors, however, brought several suits in late
 1994 and 1995 against Franca manufacturers for illegally subcontracting work that
 led to the exploitation of child labor. The labor court fined the manufacturers and
 ordered the practice stopped. Subsequently, the Franca shoe manufacturers' associa-
 tion signed an agreement with ABRINQ (the Brazilian toy manufacturers' founda-
 tion for children's rights) agreeing to end the use of child labor by its subcontractors.
 According to a recent 2-year study carried out by an NGO based in Pernambuco,
 the Centro Josue de Castro, the use of child labor is common on sugar cane planta-
 tions. The study estimated that 54,000 minors work on sugar cane plantations in
 Pernambuco, and 40,000 in Sao Paulo. In 40 percent of the families the researchers
 interviewed, children contributed 30 to 50 percent of the family income. In the sugar
 cane industry in Pernambuco, 25 percent of the workers are younger than 18 years,
 90 percent of whom began working on the plantations between the ages of 7 and
 13. CUT, the nationwide labor confederation, reported that child labor is common
 among orange pickers in Sao Paulo. The CPT received reports of child labor in the
 charcoal production industry in Minas Gerais Mate Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul,
 and Para; on sisal plantations in Bahia ana Paraiba; on cotton plantations in
 Parana; and in the area of reforestation, where children are used principally to put
 toxic chemicals on trees and anthills, in Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Espirito Santo.
 ABRINQ has been active in trying to remedy many of these abuses. It convinced
 the state's sugar producers and Abecitrus, the association of state citrus exporters,
 to sign accors ag  ing to remove child labor from their operations. At ABRINQ's
 encouragement, Volkswagen, General Motors, and other auto manufacturers are in-
 vestigating the role of child labor in operations related to their plants (children are
 
 
 380
 involved in producing charcoal, which is used to produce the cast iron and steel used
 in cars).
 In its efforts to convince state governments to crack down on child labor, ABRINQ
 has emphasized the need to provide educational opportunities for the children in-
 volved. The state government of Mato Grosso do Sul, in conjunction with the federal
 Government, implemented a pilot project intended to take children from charcoal
 farms and place them in classrooms. The parents are paid a sala   slightly higher
 than the child's monthly earnings on the charcoal farm so long as the child remains
 in school If the pro    is successful, the state government plans to expand it from
 the initial group of 1,000 children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Prior to July 1994, the Government adjusted
 the national minimum wage every month. Upon introduction of the economic sta-
 bilization plan in 1995, it set the minimum wage at $83 (70 reais) per month. In
 May 1995, President Cardoso raised the minimum wage to $111 dollars (100 reais)
 per month, and, in May 1996, raised it again to $115 (112 reals). The minimum
 wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics estimated that
 the minimum wage is slightly mre than one-fourth that necessary to support a
 family of four (the standard set by the 1988 Constitution). The most recent national
 survey (for 1990) showed that 35 percent of economically active individuals, includ-
 igminors from 10 to 14 years of age, earned no more than the minimum wage.
 Many workers, particularly outside the regulated economy and in the northeast, re-
 portedly earned less than the minimum wage.
 The 1988 Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly
 rest period of 24 consecutive hours, preferably on Sundays. The Constitution ex-
 panded pay and fringe benefits and established new protections for agricultural and
 domestic workers, although not all of these provisions are enforced.
 Unsafe working conditions are prevalent throughout the country. Incomplete fig-
 ures from the Ministry of Social Velfare on wor place accidents and fatalities i
 1995 showed 424,137 reported accidents, of which 3,967 were fatal and 15,156
 caused permanent disabilities. Fundacentro, part of the Ministry of Labor, sets occu-
 pational' health and safety standards. However, the Ministry has insufficient re-
 sources for adequate inspection and enforcement of these standards. There were also
 credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system. If a worker has a
 problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly from his employer,
 he or his union can file a claim with the regional labor court, although in practice
 this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 The law requires employers to establish internal commissions for accident preven-
 tion in workpaces. The law protects employee members of these commissions from
 being fired or their activities. Such irings, however, do occur, and legal recourse
 usually requires years for resolution. While an individual worker does not have the
 legal right to remove himself from workplaces with hazardous conditions, workers
 may express such concerns to the internal commission, which would conduct an im-
 mediate investigation.
