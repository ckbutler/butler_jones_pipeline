 COLOMBIA
 Colombia enjoys a strong, functioning multiparty democracy.
 The country has been ruled by freely elected Governments for
 all but five years (1953-57) of the present century. Its
 politics have been dominated by two political parties, the
 Liberal and Conservative, since the mid-19th century.
 Colombia's constitution provides for a popularly elected
 president and congress and an independent judiciary. The
 Constitution also provides that the President's party must give
 the second principal party "adequate and equitable"
 representation in the Government. Other minority parties exist
 and are legal in Colombia, but none has attracted widespread
 popular support in recent years. The 1982 congressional and
 presidential elections produced the largest voter turnout in
 years.
 Civil and political liberties are guaranteed by the
 Constitution. However, prior to its abrogation this year, a
 constitutionally authorized state of siege, which permitted
 the curtailment of some civil and political freedoms, had been
 imposed in varying degrees for the last 30 years because of
 insurgency problems. Activities undertaken during the state of
 seige, particularly by the armed forces, have been widely
 criticized by international human rights organizations.
 As part of a continuing effort to bring about understanding
 among all Colombians, former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala
 (1978-82) established a Peace Commission to examine ways to
 reintegrate into society those engaged in armed rebellion.
 Amnesty (or pardon) for the guerrillas was a main issue for the
 Commission to explore. As a result of preliminary suggestions
 by the Commission, on February 19, 1982, President Turbay
 issued a new decree offering a pardon to those still engaged in
 rebellion, provided they had not committed crimes of homicide
 (outside of combat), kidnapping, extortion, or prison escape.
 The decree also provided that the subversives who were detained
 could be released, "providing a majority of the members of the
 same criminal organization have laid down their weapons." (A
 second decree offered economic assistance to those seeking to
 reintegrate themselves into legitimate society.)
 Many believed that the President's decree did not go far enough
 and questioned what constituted a "majority ..... of the same
 criminal organization." The chairman of the Peace Commission,
 former President Carlos Lleras Restrepo, and several of its
 members resigned as a. result of a disagreement over what
 further recommendations would be acceptable. The subversive
 groups' leaders flatly rejected the President's offer, although
 some individual followers took advantage of it. The leftist
 April 19th Movement, "M-19," threatened to disrupt the national
 elections. Nonetheless, there was an exceptionally high voter
 turnout for the congressional and especially the presidential
 contest. With less than two months of his administration
 remaining, President Turbay lifted the state of siege on June
 20, 1982. Turbay also abolished the 1978 security statute,
 thus enabling civilian courts to assume jurisdiction in cases
 involving charges of rebellion or of committing subversive acts.
 In December 1981, an organization known as MAS (Muerte A
 Secuestradores - Death to Kidnappers) appeared. According to
 Ministry of Defense figures, there were at least 100
 kidnappings for ransom in Colombia in 1981. MAS, allegedly
 formed by a group of drug traffickers, publicly announced that
 it would execute kidnappers, even those in the hands of
 government authorities. In fact, the kidnapper who brutally
 murdered a small girl was killed in prison. Although MAS'
 initial objective was the release of the daughter of a wealthy
 rancher, its activities soon expanded beyond targeting
 kidnappers. MAS has been most active in Medellin and Bogota.
 Throughout 1982, groups using its name have killed, threatened,
 or captured and turned over to military or police authorities
 
 
 445
 labor leaders, lawyers, professors, and journalists with
 alleged Marxist-beliefs or who have connections with guerrillas
 and known subversives. Colombian leaders have condemned MAS
 activities, and some have charged that MAS has connections with
 lower-level elements of the police and military. Amnesty
 International has alleged that MAS is linked to the army's
 intelligence division. President Betancur has ordered a full
 investigation of MAS.
 Following his inauguration, President Betancur indicated his
 support for a broader amnesty for subversives, reconstituted
 the Peace Commission, and encouraged direct contact with
 insurgent groups in the search for peace. The Colombian
 congress approved a new amnesty in early November. The bill
 provides amnesty for political crimes, defined as such in the
 Colombian penal, code. Homicides, not committed in battle, will
 not be considered within the amnesty if brutally committed or
 if the victim was defenseless. The Colombian courts will be
 the final arbitrators in disputed cases. Betancur signed the
 amnesty on November 19, to take effect the following day.
 Colombian guerrilla groups had expressed varying degrees of
 interest in the amnesty proposal, and one, the M-19, even made
 preliminary overtures toward forming a legal political party.
 However, while some individual lower-level insurgents have
 accepted the November 20 amnesty, guerrilla leaders for the
 most part have rejected it. These leaders state that while
 they will not sdrrender their arms, they will lay them down if
 the Government declares a truce, demilitarizes certain areas,
 and begins a national dialogue on socio-economic issues.
 Although rejecting demilitarization, President Betancur
 responded to the guerrilla proposal by noting that the
 Government had already freed those guerrilla prisoners eligible
 for release under the new amnesty (approximately 343) and that
 he had been proposing a national dialogue through the Peace
 Commission since his inauguration.
 Since 1980, Colombian economic growth has lagged well behind
 the high rates of expansion achieved during the 1970's,
 inflation has persisted in the 25-30 percent range, and
 unemployment hovers around nine percent. More worrisome,
 fiscal deficits and the balance of payments have become
 increasingly adverse. On the positive side, Colombia has ample
 foreign reserves and one of Latin America's lowest per capita
 debt ratios. The economy's long-term prospects are quite good,
 especially in the critical energy sector. Colombia will become
 self-sufficient in petroleum in the mid-1980's and will produce
 an exportable energy surplus through the end of the decade.
 The key economic priority of the Betancur administration is to
 reactivate the :economy while stabilizing or lowering
 inflation. Betancur's action plan has centered on fiscal and
 financial reform, increased domestic protectionism, revival of
 the agricultural sector, and the promise of massive low-cost
 housing. To date, the program has generated a significant rise
 in aspirations, but actual progress is not expected until 1983
 at the earliest.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, a
 local human rights organization, listed 267 murders during 1981
 that it attributed to official repression, the great majority
 of which occurred in rural areas in which the military is
 fighting guerrilla groups and where confirmation of reports is
 often difficult. During the same period, the natioha- police
 reported that 154 of its officers and men had been killed in
 action against common criminals and subversives and 987 had
 been wounded. The police killed 175 members of various
 guerrilla groups and 141 common criminals. For the same
 
 
 446
 period, the Ministry of Defense reported 200 members of the
 armed forces had been killed in action against guerrillas, and
 278 guerrillas lost their lives in confrontations with the
 military. In 1982, more than 50 peasants are alleged to have
 been assassinated by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
 Colombia, the country's largest and most threatening guerrilla
 group. At least 20 common criminals were found dead in Cali,
 in a mass execution carried out by a death squad called "The
 Cobras." MAS alledgedly has killed at least half a dozen
 persons. In retaliation for MAS' alleged murder of an M-19
 defense lawyer, the leftist National Liberation Army and the
 M-19 claimed responsibility for the killing of the Secretary-of
 Education of the Santander Department. The National Liberation
 Army also allegedly killed a Bucaramanga councilman and a
 Medellin high school biology teacher during 1982. At the end
 of 1981, four ex-policemen were found guilty of killing three
 people and wounding others in a district of Medellin known for
 drug trafficking. At his inauguration, President Betancur said
 he did not want more Colombian blood spilled and since then has
 promised an investigation of MAS and a suppression of common
 crime.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1981 the Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 alleged approximately 100 disappearances, the majority in rural
 areas. The Government reported 100 kidnappings in 1981, 63
 committed by terrorist groups and 37 by common-criminals. The
 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia kidnapped 29-persons,
 the M-19 24, the People's Liberation.Army nine, and the
 Workers' Self Defense Movement one. The Ministry of Defense
 indicated that a total of about $857,000 was paid in ransom to
 terrorist groups for 19 of the kidnap victims.
 With a few exceptions, the information available at year-end on
 alleged disappearances in 1982 is too disparate and
 inconsistent for inclusion at this time. The most noteworthy
 exceptions involve the disappearances and subsequent
 assassinations of the Director of Colombia's Office of
 Community Development and Integration, Mrs. Gloria Lara de
 Echeverri, and three children from the Alvarez family. Because
 of the involvement of a highly respected female official and
 three small children, both cases generated heavy press coverage
 and widespread popular indignatiop,. Mrs. de Echeverri was
 kidnapped in June and assassinated in November by a small
 left-wing group called the Popular Revolutionary Organization,
 whose principal goal was fund raising. Some of those involved
 have been arrested and have confessed. The three Alvarez
 children, ages 5, 6, and 7, were kidnapped in 1981 and found
 shot to death last September.  Police officials and the father
 of the slain children have alleged guerrilla responsibility.
 The single suspect now in custody has reportedly provided
 evidence substantiating guerrilla involvement.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution states that public officials may be held
 responsible for abuses of authority and for acts of omission in
 the exercise of their authority. Torture is forbidden by law
 and is contrary to custom. However, the human rights report of
 the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, which was released
 in August 1981, indicated that there have been cases of torture
 and recommended that the'Government act more swiftly to
 investigate and punish those responsible. The Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights listed 451 cases of
 torture in 1981, again mostly in rural militarized areas. The
 Government promised to investigate the allegations.
 In the Echeverri assa.ssination, the suspects, who had confessed,
 later recanted claiming they had been tortured. The Office of
 the Attorney General investigated the allegations and reported
 that, while force had been used in making the arrests, there
 was no evidence of torture.
 
 
 447
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Colombian Council of State, the organization ultimately
 responsible for adjudicating administrative claims, has awarded
 indemnities for wrongful death at the hands of government
 forces found.guilty of committing'abuses of authority. In a
 recent case, the council ordered the Ministry of Defense to pay
 $228,833. to a person abused by military personnel in Medellin.
 In July 1982, prisoners at Bellavista Prison in Medellin rioted
 and at least '13 were seriously wounded. The prison's normal
 capacity is 1,500 and there were 3,143 under detention. In
 most prisons, inmates are fed a typical Colombian diet but can
 supplemeht it with purchases from prison stores. Prisoners
 with financial resources live better than those without.
 Family members and friends are normally allowed to visit
 regularly :and to bring food and clothes. Most prisoners
 accused-of security-related crimes have been incarcerated in
 regular prisons, although segregated from common criminals.
 Prior to the ending of the state of siege in June, such
 prisoners, were consolidated in military-installations where
 conditions are at least equal to regular prisons.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Colojnbia's Constitution provides for habeas corpus (access to a
 lawyer or judge) within 72 hours of arrest in most cases.
 However, habeas corpus does not apply to persons detained under
 Article 28 (relating to disturbance.of public order) during the
 first ten days of detention. Thus; in practice, prisoners are
 sometimes held incommunicado during the first 72 hours, and in
 the case of .Article 28, for longer periods of time.
 The Permaneht Committee for tlie Defense of. Human Rights
 tabulated 2,203 political arrest-s in 1981. Amnesty
 International states that 'either shortly before lifting of the
 state of siege or in the period thereafter, several hundred
 persons were given their freedom.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right, of public trial and of due process are guaranteed by
 the Constitution and generally honored in civilian trials.
 Prisoners may be represented by attorneys of their choice and,
 if they have none, the court will appoint one. Court
 proceedings are closed until the investigation of the
 circumstances is, completed and an indictment handed down. In
 military proceedings, prisoners did not always enjoy the same
 protection. Owing to an overburdened judicial system, many
 persons indicted for common crimes never come to trial, but are
 simply released after serving the minimum sentence applicable
 to the crime in question. Technically, this could represent a
 denial of trial. There were 28,680 prisoners in jail at the
 end of 1981, but only 7,573 had been formally tried. With the
 lifting of the state of siege and abolition of the security
 statute on June 20, 1982, all security-related cases are now
 tried in civilian courts. The armed forces turned over to
 civilian courts 6,382 cases and 1,227 persons detained under
 the security statute. To clear the backlog of cases, the
 Ministry of Justice is considering declaring another "judicial
 emergency," which would empower it to hire additional judges on
 a temporary basis. At the same time, the Ministry is
 considering longer-term plans to streamline the court system
 and revise the penal code.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution requires a court order before authorities can
 enter a private home, except in the case of "hot pursuit" of a
 person seen committing a crime. While some human rights
 organizations allege widespread violations in some remote areas
 
 
 448
 of the country, where the military is predominant, the concept
 is widely respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally-guaranteed rights have been generally
 respected and the press often vigorously criticizes the
 Government and its leaders. The print media are under no
 government restraints. Daily and weekly newpapers and
 magazines print a wide variety of political views.
 Radio and TV broadcasters have been requested occasionally not
 to broadcast on-going events such as airline hijackings or
 terrorist actions. Television channels are controlled by the
 state, which leases time to private companies. The Government
 does not permit private news programs to broadcast interviews
 which last longer than ten minutes; during political campaigns,
 news programs cannot broadcast the Voice of a candidate, whose
 campaign rally is being filmed. There are no such restrictions
 on "talk shows."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings, marches,.and demonstrations are normally and
 frequently held without interference, although the Government
 can prohibit public assembly when-it anticipates violence.
 Generally, prior permission is required for large
 demonstrations, but it is almost always granted.
 Colombian workers freely exercise the right to form unions and,
 in the private sector, to bargain collectively and strike.
 There are four labor confederations (including one associated
 with the Communist Party) and an estimated 7,000 unions. Among
 the four, the Confederation of Colombian Workers and the Union
 of Colombian Workers are affiliated with-the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The remaining two, the
 Trade Union Confederation of Colombia and the General
 Confederation of Labor, are affiliated with the World
 Federation of Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labor
 respectively. Approximately 12-13 percent of the total work
 force is unionized. The labor code is administered impartially
 regardless pf the ideology of the union. Trade union-leaders
 participate fully in the electoral process and are often
 members of the National Congress and Municipal Assemblies.
 In the public sector, "public employees" do not have the legal
 right to negotiate or strike, while "official employees" may
 negotiate, but not strike. "Official employees" work for
 autonomous, government entities, while "public employees" work
 for the ministries. In practice, however, both groups do
 negotiate and strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Colombian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion.
 Although an overwhelming majority of Colombians are Roman
 Catholics, there is no official discrimination against any
 religious group.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Any Colombian with a valid passport and proof that he has paid
 his taxes is free to leave the country without unusual
 restrictions. Colombian minors must have written permission
 from both parents to leave the country. Foreigners who are
 found guilty of misdemeanors are usually deported.
 International travel controls consist of airport and highway
 document checks and inspection for illegal arms. Foreign
 residents leaving the country must have an exit permit. In
 
 
 449
 areas under military control, where operations against rural
 guerrilla groups are underway, the movement of civilians has
 been subjected to more severe restrictions.
 Colombians who have sought and been granted asylum in foreign
 embassies have been allowed to depart. Expatriates are allowed
 by law to repatriate. Colombia is a member of the
 Inter-Governmental:Committee for Migration and it has accepted
 refugees in the past. However, because of its own high
 unemployment~and subemployment, the Government is now reluctant
 to accept further refugees.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Colombia has a strong democratic system of government and
 elections are generally honest. Freedom House classifies
 Colombia as "free."  The authorities respect the constitutional
 right of persons over 18 years of age to vote.  Persons
 convicted of certain crimes may be disenfranchised. Public
 employees are..forbidden by law to participate in political
 campaigns but; with the-exception of military personnel, can
 vote. National -elections are held every four years and local
 electiond every two years.
 Colombian politics are dominated by the country's two major
 parties,' the-Liberal and the Conservative. The current Chief
 Executive is a member of the Conservative Party. The major
 political parties encompass sectors with widely divergent
 political views. :Opposition parties function freely, are able
 to raise'funds,, field candidates, hold public meetings, and
 have access to the media; some groups publish their own.
 newpapers.. During the*March"14, 1982 congressional elections,
 5.5 million :Colombians voted,..or almost 40 percent of the
 officially registered 13.7 million voters. That number was
 considerably.;hbigher than the 33.4 percent who cast ballots in
 the 1978 congressional elections. The almost seven million
 turnout .for the May 30, 1982 presidential election represented
 approxiifiAtely 60 percent of eligible voters, the heaviest voter
 turnout in, recent history.
 Since his election, President Betancur has invited all sectors
 of Colombian society to consult with him on the public order
 problem and its underlying social causes. His newly
 re-established Peace Commission consists of approximately 40
 members from all walks of life, who will advise him on the
 .process of reintegrating into legitimate society those engaged
 in rebellion.  When, On November 19, the President signed into
 law the new amnesty bill, he also announced a program to
 rehabilitate guerrillas who accepted the amnesty.
 As more Colombian womenigraduate from universities and
 participate in the work force, they are increasingly active at
 all levels of-society. They serve as legislators, judges,
 departmental governors, party leaders, government officials,
 and diplomats. Under the-current administration, ten vice
 ministers are women, as are several presidential advisers.'
 Colombian Indians enjoy all rights and privileges of full
 citizenship, including the right to vote. Notwithstanding
 their constitutional rights, Colombian Indians have suffered
 abuses at the hands of local landowners, cattlemen, and
 prospectors who seek to expand their own fortunes at the
 expense of the Indians. The Government, working through two
 public institutions to enhance the welfare and protection of
 Indians, has curtailed the worst of such abuses and is now
 seeking to promote improved local relations through community
 action, public education, and legal aid.
 
 
 450
 f. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Colombian Government has actively participated in
 international and regional human rights bodies. Colombia was
 one of the first nations to ratify the American Convention on
 Human Rights. It has invited both Amnesty International and
 the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit Colombia on
 human rights matters. A Colombian judge was elected President
 of the latter organization in June 1982. Americas Watch made a
 visit to Colombia in September 1982 and issued a report the
 following month.
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active national organization monitoring the local human
 rights situation. Statistics prepared by this committee on the
 situation before the state of siege was lifted have been
 extensively used by international organizations such as Amnesty
 International, Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on
 Latin America. Colombian human rights organizations follow
 trials of those accused of rebellion, investigate reports of
 human rights violations, provide defense lawyers and publish
 newletters. Periodic human rights forums are also held.
 A number of Colombian human rights organizations have severely
 criticized Colombian military and paramilitary organizations
 for participating in "official repression." Thus, the
 Colombian Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 has prepared extensive lists, drawn in large part from local
 press reports, of individuals who are alleged to have
 disappeared or have died at the hands of paramilitary groups.
 The Jesuit-sponsored Center for Investigation and Popular
 Education, together with the Permanent Committee and the
 Committee for Solidarity with Political Prisoners, has also
 published a document listing deaths and disappearances between
 1979 and 1981 in the Department of Caqueta, a center of rural
 insurgent activity. This latter publication included personal
 testimonies by individuals who state that they witnessed deaths
 or tortures in that Department. The Americas Watch, basing its
 finding on the publications of the Colombian Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights and the Center for
 Investigation and Popular Education, concludes that there
 exists "pervasive oppression" in militarized zones such as the
 Department of Caqueta.
 Colombian officials have shared the concerns of the local human
 rights groups regarding such alleged violations, and they have
 been responsive to requests by international groups to
 investigate reported violations of human rights. President
 Betancur, the Colombian Attorney General (elected by congress
 from a list of prominent members of the opposition party), and
 high military officials have publicly stressed their intention
 to expose and to end paramilitary violence. Many of these
 reported violations of human rights, however, have been
 attributed to shadowy organizations such as the MAS, or have
 occurred in remote and isolated areas (such as the Department
 of Caqueta), where it is often difficult to determine with
 certainty the circumstances surrounding the alleged
 violations. Some of the crimes attributed to the military are
 believed to have been perpetrated by leftist insurgent groups
 in an effort to terrorize the local population or as
 retribution for having informed on the insurgents. One
 well-publicized example of executions by leftist groups was the
 murder of two alleged military informers, perpetrated in
 Caqueta in late 1981 by M-19 guerrillas in the presence of
 journalists and photographers.
 In reviewing the overall Colombian human rights situation, the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has concluded that
 while there have been cases of torture and of illegal search
 and detention, these do not reflect official Colombian
 
 
 451
 Government policy. Moreover, the Inter-American Commission in
 its latest report (November 1982) lauds Colombia for notable
 advances in the protection and promotion of human rights over
 the last twelve months and for the efforts of the Government -
 including the lifting of the state of siege and promulgation of
 an amnesty for insurgents - in response to the recommendations
 made by the Inter-American Commission.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The economic slowdown which began in 1980 continues to hinder
 efforts to improve real living standards of the majority of the
 population. It is unlikely that the real GDP growth rate for
 1982 exceeded 1981's disappointing 2.5 percent. Inflation
 probably dipped slightly in 1982 from the 26 percent increase
 registered in 1981, in part due to reduced consumer demand and
 continued pursuit of tight, anti-inflationary monetary and
 credit policies. Official government data shows unemployment
 rising from seven percent in December 1981 to nine percent in
 June 1982. Underemployment is between 14 and 16 percent.
 Omitted from any official labor statistics are an estimated 2.5
 million children under age 15 who work for low pay under poor
 conditions and with little protection from the Colombian labor
 code. While increases in minimum wages have kept pace with
 increases in the cost of living in recent years, workers have
 not recuperated from losses experienced in 1968-75 and a large
 percentage of workers do not earn the minimum wage.
 Per capita GNP in 1980 was $1,184, but this conceals
 substantial inequality in the distribution of the nation's
 income and wealth. According to a 1979 World Bank report, the
 wealthiest four percent of Colombia's 27 million population
 received 28 percent of the national income, while the poorest
 40 percent got only 10 percent. Colombia has a highly
 progressive income tax, but tax evasion is widespread and
 direct taxation is declining as a proportion of government
 revenue. In December 1982, the Betancur administration decreed
 a 50-day tax amnesty period in which previously unreported
 assets could be declared with no questions asked. Land tenure
 also shows distortions: The top 10 percent of the landowners
 hold 80 percent of the land, while the bottom 10 percent own
 only 0.2 percent. Significant regional inequalities also
 exist, with the best economic opportunities, health care
 facilities, and education available in the largest cities.
 This has contributed to the problem of heavy, though
 decreasing, migration from the countryside to urban areas. A
 notable exception to income maldistribution is in Colombia's
 important coffee growing regions, where farms have
 traditionally been small to medium-sized.
 Colombia has made progress in recent years in social services.
 According to 1975 World Bank statistics, 64 percent of the
 population has access to safe water -- a significant
 improvement over 1964, when only 30 percent had such access.
 There is a severe teacher shortage, particularly in the
 countryside where educational facilities are substandard.
 While primary school enrollment has increased, the adjusted
 enrollment ratio of 128 percent in 1979 is misleading because
 of low retention rates; the figure is partially explained by
 frequent repetition and the presence of adolescents and adults
 in the primary grades. The adult literacy rate was estimated
 at 81 percent in 1973, a significant improvement over the 63
 percent registered in 1963. Colombia's infant mortality rate
 was 56 per 1,000 live births in 1980 which, while still high,
 is a marked improvement over the 1978 figure of 65. Life
 expectancy at birth was 63 years in 1980. Colombia's
 population growth rate was 2.1 percent in 1980, indicating that
 family planning programs have been quite successful. Regional
 differences in population growth are substantial. While the
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements in 1977 was a satisfactory 102
 percent, it does not tell the whole story. Per capita
 
 
 452
 consumption of important commodities such as meat, eggs, and
 milk declined between 1948 and 1978. Malnutrition is a leading
 cause of death among children under 5 years.
 The Betancur administration has given improved social services
 a high priority. The country's housing deficit, estimated at
 800,000 units, is growing at an annual rate of 5.3 percent.
 The Betancur Government has promised to provide 500,000 low-
 cost units between 1982-86. Education will also be a top
 priority of the Betancur administration, which plans to
 concentrate on rural adult literacy and vocational training.
 The Government will offer additional opportunities at the
 university level through extension courses. The 1982 budget
 for the social sector ministries (Labor, Government, Health,
 and Education) accounted for approximately 28 percent of the
 total government budget.
 The economic situation of women, though improving, is
 inferior. Women have equal civil and property rights. They
 comprise just over 25 percent of the economically active
 population, but are concentrated in low-productivity and
 low-income sectors. Historically, the unemployment rate for
 women has been higher than for men, but this difference has
 decreased in recent years. Although Colombian women are
 legally entitled to pay equal to that of their male
 counterparts and are normally paid equal salaries when employed
 by'the Government, in private industry they are almost always
 paid less than men for the same work. An increasing number of
 females are receiving higher education, and women currently
 comprise 40 percent of the university population. President
 Betancur has appointed a record number of women to high
 government positions.
