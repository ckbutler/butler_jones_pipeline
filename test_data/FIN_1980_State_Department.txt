 FINLAND
 Finland's respect for human rights is reflected in its
 constitution, its laws and in the customs and practices of
 its institutions. Concern for the integrity of the person
 is protected both in theory and in practice by two coequal
 public investigatory institutions, the Chancellor of
 Justice, i.e. a public prosecutor, and the parliamentary
 ombudsman.
 Finland has been in the forefront in providing protection
 to women and minorities. The Swedish speaking minority
 enjoys protection of language and cultural heritage and
 participates fully in the economic life of the country.
 Finland was the second country in the world to give women
 the vote (1906). A 1975 law removes all legal
 restrictions on the employment of women in the civilian
 and military work forces. An official Equality Council
 helps supervise compliance with that law. Women
 participate fully in the political life of the country.
 In addition to the Swedish language minority in Finland
 there are three other minority groups: Lapps, Gypsies and
 Jews. Freedom of religion is guaranteed constitutionally
 and respected in practice. Finland has joined with other
 Nordic countries to provide special education to their
 Lapp minorities in the Lapp language and also taken steps
 to develop a written language system for its own Gypsy
 population. Finland shares with its Nordic neighbors a
 comprehensive social welfare system. It has developed a
 modern industrial economy with a strong and democratic
 labor movement, and privately-owned, cooperative and
 state-owned enterprises operate side-by-side within a
 market economy system.
 In international affairs, Finland is a supporter of
 international human rights objectives. It is a party to
 most of the treaties on the subject, including the United
 Nations Convention on Refugees, the International Covenant
 on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 Finland has also signed the new Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,
 and has made a special effort to implement and incorporate
 these covenants and conventions into its laws.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The most relevant laws protecting the
 individual from torture are contained in the Police Acts
 (Act No. 84 of February 18, 1966; Act No. 53 of January
 25, 1975; Decree No. 119 of February 14, 1969 and Decree
 No. 163 of February 15, 1973). These provide that *police
 must not intervene in the rights of private persons more
 than is necessary for the maintenance of public order and
 security." Article 6 of the Finnish Constitutional Act
 provides that *every citizen shall be protected by law as
 to life, honor, personal liberty and property." There are
 no reported cases of torture being used in Finland.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Capital punishment has been abolished totally,
 in time of war as well as peace, by Act No. 343 of May 5,
 1972. The death penalty has not been administered in
 Finland in peacetime since 1826. The sentence of
 confinement to hard labor was abolished in 1972. Finnish
 law (Decree No. 430 of June 13, 1975) provides that "the
 execution of the penalty of imprisonment shall be so
 arranged that the loss of liberty is the sole punishment
 and that it does not unnecessarily hamper the social
 rehabilitation of the prisoners but, on the contrary,
 promotes it. The inconveniences caused by the loss of
 liberty shall be prevented as much as possible."
 Furthermore, "prisoners shall be treated justly and with
 respect for their human dignity. No distinction shall be
 made on the basis of race, color, sex, language,
 nationality, religious or political conviction, social
 position, wealth or on any other grounds."
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reported cases of disappearances occurring in
 Finland as a result of official action. There are no
 cases of abduction or clandestine detention by official or
 quasi-official security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The
 circumstances of an arrest are examined initially when an
 accused is brought to trial, and should the arrest be
 shown to have been false or should the accused be
 acquitted, the accused is entitled to collect civil
 damages from the same court. At present there is no
 pre-trial examination of the arrest.  (A proposal to
 institute pre-trial examinations remains under study.)
 The institution of habeus corpus does not exist as such in
 Finland. Act No. 615 of July 19, 1974, concerning custody
 pending trial, states that "a person arrested and pending
 trial shall be segregated from convicted persons and his
 liberty shall be restricted only to the extent necessary
 for the purpose of his arrest and the maintenance of
 order." In rare exceptional circumstances a suspect may
 be detained up to 17 days without being formally charged.
 Within 10 days of detention his case must be examined by a
 judge. Prison and police authorities function under the
 supervision of the Ministry of Justice and Minister of
 Interior. According to a report submitted by the
 Government of Finland to the United Nations on July 11,
 1978 "the parliamentary ombudsman takes regularly
 inspection tours of all prisons and reports to the
 parliament on his observations; he may also take immediate
 action if necessary." Preventive detention is authorized
 only during a declared state of war for narrowly defined
 offenses such as treason, mutiny and trafficking in
 weapons. Procedural safeguards are mandated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens have
 
 
 776
 tne right to effective counsel. Charges must be clearly
 stated and the state will pay for counsel of one's choice
 in cases of indigence. Finnish law, Act No. 26 of
 February 5, 1926, provides that court trials and
 judgements are public and open to the casual observer.
 Courts may decide that a trial will be held behind closed
 doors in juvenile, matrimonial and guardianship cases, as
 well as when publicity would offend morality or endanger
 the national security of the state. In the latter case,
 the judgement may also be restricted and sanctions imposed
 if it is made public. Public prosecutors are charged with
 submitting all evidence available to them, including that
 which may assist the defendant. The judiciary is
 independent of both the executive and the legislature. It
 may hear appeals from any government decision by military
 or civilian authorities. For strictly administrative
 matters, a Supreme Administrative Court hears appeals
 relating to the conduct of local or national government.
 Minor administrative courts sit in every province in
 Finland. Provisional tribunals are expressly prohibited
 by Article 60 of the Finnish constitution. In the event
 or a police-ordered expulsion of an alien, the Minister of
 Interior's decision is final and may not be appealed.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home, including prohibition of
 eavesdropping and mail tampering, is guaranteed by
 Articles 11 and 12 of the Finnish constitution and
 respected in practice. Under Act No. 260 of June 12, 1959
 search warrants may be issued only by judicial authorities
 empowered to issue warrants of arrest for crimes
 punishable by imprisonment of more than six months. The
 Ministry of Interior or the Chancellor of Justice may also
 authorize a search subject to subsequent judicial scrutiny
 and possible civil and criminal penalities for abuse of
 this power (including compensation to the victim).
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Finland has an excellent record in the field of social
 justice. The nation has a modern industrial economy with
 privately-owned, cooperative and state-owned enterprises
 operating within a market economy system. The government
 follows an economic policy aimed at maximizing economic
 growth and stability and equalizing distribution of income
 along broad lines among individuals residing in urban and
 rural sectors.
 Finland has a comprehensive social welfare system which
 includes provision for housing, health and medical
 services, family benefits, unemployment benefits,
 disability insurance and welfare. Women are guaranteed
 equal rights under the Finnish constitution and under
 Decree 455 of June 9, 1972, which establishes an Equality
 Council, and Act 1020 of December 19, 1975, which
 abolishes all legal restrictions to the employment of
 women in both the civilian and military labor force.
 Women are not subject to military conscription. Finland's
 constitutional Article 6 guarantees to all Finnish
 citizens the right to own property and to be compensated
 fully for property taken for public use. Aliens are not
 
 
 777
 permitted to own real property in Finland except by
 special permission.
 Finland guarantees to all its citizens the right to just
 remuneration and a safe workplace. Constitutional Article
 6 states;"the labor of the citizens shall be under the
 special protection of the state." Labor unions are free
 to organize, meet, speak freely and strike. Finland has
 ratified the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention on equal pay for equal work. In practice, the
 strong democratic labor movement, representing over 80% of
 the eligible blue collar, white collar and professional
 work force ensures compliance with equal pay laws. Women
 have a somewhat lower average earning power than men in
 Finland. Women industrial workers, the category for which
 statistics are readily'available, receive an average of
 75% of a male industrial worker's average wage. In the
 last quarter of 1979 these women received an average wage
 of $4.20 per hour, while industrial male workers received
 $5.60. Large numbers of women are employed in the
 textile, agricultural, electronics and service industries,
 which probably accounts for the differences in average
 earnings. By law, all persons in Finland are paid equal
 salaries for equal work.
 finland enjoys a high standard of living. Its estimated
 per capita income for 1980 is $10,500. The unemployment
 rate in June 1980 had declined to 4.5%, which means that
 113,000 persons were looking for work at that time. Male
 unemployment in June was 3.9%, female 5.2% and youth (from
 15 to 24 years old) 10.4%. The total working age
 population from 15 to 74 years old is 3.6 million. The
 labor force is 2.48 million, of which 2.04 million are
 wage or salary earners. The labor force participation
 rate is 69%. Female participation in the labor force is
 61% and male participation 77%. Finland provides both
 unemployment and hearth insurance to all employed persons
 resident in Finland. Its population over 65 years of age
 is 11.4% and its life expectancy at birth for men is 67.5
 years and for women 76.1 years (1976). About 59% of the
 Finnish population lives in urban areas now, compared to
 only 25% in 1945. There are 8,134 doctors (30% women) in
 Finland, or one doctor for every 575 persons. There are
 3,658 dentists (68% women) in Finland, or a dentist for
 every 1301 persons. The infant mortality rate in Finland
 is 8.7 per thousand (1977). It has a population of 4.77
 million people occupying a land mass of 130,119 square
 miles (337,035 square kilometers).
 Inflation became a major concern for Finland during 1980
 as consumer and wholesale prices began moving upwards
 during the year at a fast pace. This development added to
 the debate within the center-left coalition government
 over an appropriate anti-inflation program. Left-wing
 groups supported a revaluation of the finmark, which was
 carried out in September 1979 and repeated in March 1980.
 Some reduction of the velocity at which prices were rising
 did occur, although inflation is expected to be about
 13.4% for the whole of 1980, up from 8.5% in 1979.
 Finnish exports are the mainstay of the economy and grew
 about 8.5% in 1979, but the faster growth of imports
 pushed the trade account into deficit. Unemployment is
 declining and is expected to reach 4% by year end. In
 1979 private households received'67% of national
 
 
 778
 disposable income, corporations 4.5% and the public sector
 29%. General transfers to the private sector grew by 12%
 of GDP and the government spent 22% of national income
 (GDP) on social expenditures. The net tax rate (taxes
 paid minus transfers) fell by almost 3%, to 23% of GDP.
 Finland's economy is expected to grow this year by about 6
 to 7%. Finland enjoys an almost 100% literacy rate. It
 has compulsory free education up to the age of 16 with
 nominal fees for higher education thereafter. Language
 minorities are given the right to state-supported schools
 and educational materials in their native languages.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Civilian and political liberties are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Discrimination on the basis of
 race, national or ethnic origin is a criminal offense
 under Articles 5 and 6, Chapter 13 of the Penal Code.
 There is no censorship, and prior restraint is expressly
 prohibited in Finland. The right of a citizen to own and
 operate a printing press is constitutionally protected
 under Article 10 and supplemented by Act No. 1 on the
 Freedom of the Press of January 4, 1919. All religions
 may be practiced freely in Finland under Articles 8 and 9
 of the constitution and Act No. 267 of November 10, 1922.
 The vast mqjority of Finns are Lutherans. The right of
 assembly is guaranteed (any group may hold a meeting
 without a permit upon six hours notice to local
 authorities) under Article 10 of the constitution,
 supplemented by Act No. 6 of February 20, 1907 and Act No.
 492 of August 9, 1968 and Decree No. 687 of December 20,
 1968. Freedom of association is also guaranteed by Act
 No. 1 of January 4, 1919 and Article 10 of the
 constitution. If the purpose of the association is to
 influence political issues, only Finnish citizens may
 belong. Trade union organization and activity are
 protected constitutionally.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice under Article 7 of the Finnish constitution and
 Decree No. 9 of February 4, 1960. Aliens are restricted
 from residing in Finnish border areas under Act No. 403
 and Decree No. 404, both of May 17, 1947. Finns have the
 right to voluntary repatriation, which is protected by
 constitutional Article No.7. Finland has signed the
 United Nations Convention on Refugees and has admitted
 approximately 60 West African and Ethiopian refugees, 150
 Chilean refugees in 1974, and 115 Vietnamese refugees in
 1979. There are about 200 persons still in refugee status
 in Finland. Refugees are provided with housing, training
 and education, and have the same rights as citizens in
 access to social services. Around 500,000 Finns have
 emigrated from Finland since 1949, mostly to Sweden. Of
 these, about 1% have returned to Finland.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Finland is a multiparty democracy. An association may
 register as a political party if it includes more than
 
 
 779
 5,000 citizens, practices internally democratic procedures
 and publishes a party program. Opposition parties
 function freely, have media access and hold public
 meeting. Political parties, youth groups, athletic
 associations and newspapers are entitled to government
 subsidies for their operating costs. All Finnish citizens
 over 18 may participate freely in the political process.
 Traditionally, about 80% of the eligible population votes
 in national and municipal elections. During the October
 1980 municipal elections 78% of the population voted.
 Women are well integrated into the political process at
 all levels. In December 1980, for example, women held
 three of 17 cabinet positions and 49 of 200 seats in the
 parliament. Any person born in Finland of Finnish
 parentage is a Finnish citizen. Foreigners born in
 Finland are entitled to Finnish nationality if they do not
 receive another nationality at birth. Statistics provided
 by the government to the United Nations report that ethnic
 minority populations of more than 5,000 Gypsies, about
 4,000 Lapps, 1,200 Jews and 1,000 Tartars living in
 Finland are Finnish citizens.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There are no known requests for investigations of human
 rights in Finland. There is an Amnesty International
 office, and an Equality Council, charged with
 investigating discrimination charges against women, which
 has been able to conduct its investigations freely and
 without interference. Finland participates actively in
 international and regional human rights bodies.
