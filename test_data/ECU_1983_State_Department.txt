 ECUADOR
 Ecuador, under a democratic government since 1979, is now in
 the midst of electoral campaigning leading to national
 elections in 1984. Voters will go to the polls in January 1984
 to choose among candidates for President, Vice President,
 Congress, Provincial Prefect, Mayor, and local Councilmen and
 Aldermen. Seventeen political parties, representing all
 political shades, will take part in the elections.
 Since the return to democracy, the principles of democratic
 government and respect for civil liberties established in the
 Constitution have been vigorously upheld. The public
 commitment of President Osvaldo Hurtado to protect human rights
 has earned praise from international human rights
 organizations. Freedom House's 1983 report described Ecuador
 as "free." The Latin American Association of Human Rights
 maintains its headquarters in Quito. Control over the police
 is exercised by the President through the Ministry of
 Government. Local human rights organizations have focused
 attention on reports of police and military brutality but have
 acknowledged that the Government is effectively investigating
 these cases. In 1983, the Ministry of Government submitted for
 the first time a written report to the Congress enumerating its
 efforts to investigate 69 formal complaints of misconduct by
 police and military officials. Except for cases involving
 mistreatment of prisoners, there were no substantiated
 instances of major human rights violations in Ecuador in 1983.
 Ecuador has a per capita Gross Domestic Product of $1,471. As
 of 1980, 59 percent of a population of over eight million were
 estimated to live in absolute poverty. Large'sectors of the
 Indian population in rural areas are not fully integrated into
 the national political and economic structure.
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no reports of killings for political motives.
 However, two workers died when they fell from a roof during an
 illegal factory occupation in June 1983. This led to a Supreme
 Court review that absolved the police of responsibility.
 Deaths resulting from official evictions of land invaders in
 Guayas and Chimborazo Provinces prompted sharp criticism from
 human rights organizations and by the Solicitor General who
 later initiated court action that is still pending against
 those believed responsible.
 b. Disappearance
 The one alleged case of official abduction in 1983 concerned a
 peasant union organizer reportedly seized by soldiers in May.
 Concern about the disappearance generated inquiries from 16
 international human rights organizations. In mid-June, the
 alleged victim appeared in a television news interview,
 denying that he hod been seized or held against his will. A
 local human rights organization subsequently confirmed his
 well-being.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and inhuman or degrading punishment are prohibited
 under Ecuadorean law and happen only rarely. Occasional
 charges of police brutality often resulted in administrative or
 judicial action against the perpetkators. At least six
 (544)
 
 
 545
 policemen were suspended from duty in 1983. In September, the
 Director of the Guayaquil Penitentiary was incarcerated in his
 own institution on charges of torturing prisoners involved in
 an escape attempt. Seven prison guards and other officials
 have been charged in the same case.
 In February, the Minister of Government sent letters to senior
 police officials warning that any officer found to have engaged
 in torture or who threatened human life would be immediately
 separated from service. The Minister also issued instructions
 to prison officials throughout Ecuador that disciplinary
 measures directed at prisoners, including solitary confinement,
 must be first authorized by a Central Diagnostic and
 Evaluations Department.
 Limited economic resources account for the generally poor
 quality of Ecuadorean prisons. Cells are frequently
 overcrowded and lack adequate ventilation, light, sanitary
 facilities, and potable water. Prison authorities punish
 prisoners for disciplinary reasons; beatings and solitary
 confinement, while contrary to government policy, probably
 occur.
 In practice, prisoners with money can pay officials to avoid
 punishment or obtain better living conditions. Some prisoners
 can qualify for such privileges as day passes, conjugal visits,
 and the right to establish a business within the prison.
 The military was accused in May of physical and psychological
 torture of a Cuban basketball trainer who was subsequently
 deported from Ecuador. Investigation by the Ministry of
 Government and the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal did not
 substantiate these charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Preventive detention is illegal, and the penal code forbids
 confinement incommunicado for more than 24 hours and detention
 without charge for more than 48 hours. In a few instances,
 however, people have been held beyond these time limits. In
 practice, bail is granted liberally, often by mayors,
 irrespective of whether the charges are serious.
 In one such case, 15 youths were discovered in October in a
 suspected guerrilla training encampment in Esmeraldas
 Province. While in military custody, the youths signed
 confessions of complicity in subversive activities, but they
 were transfered to the custody of civilian authorities who
 released them two days later. Subsequent allegations of
 brutality and forced confessions by military authorities have
 been made by parents of several youths involved in this
 incident.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ecuador has a three-tiered court system. The lowest level
 consists of civil and criminal courts and specialized labor
 relations, housing, and traffic courts. At the intermediate
 level are the Superior Courts located in most of Ecuador's 20
 provinces. The highest level is the Supreme Court, whose 15
 judges are selected by the Congress. The Supreme Court
 justices in turn select the civil, criminal, and the
 specialized court judges. The outgoing President of the
 Supreme Court, at the conclusion of his two-year tenure in
 September, received extensive praise in the local media for his
 dismissal of 17 judges on grounds of corrupt practices.
 
 
 546
 In Ecuador, judges play a central role in investigations as
 well as in deciding guilt or innocence. Most judges are
 underpaid and lack the technical and financial means to conduct
 thorough investigations. Defendants have the right to counsel,
 to refrain from testifying against themselves, and to appeal to
 the Superior and Supreme Courts. Several judicial branch
 spokesmen have complained that the recourse to multiple levels
 of appeal has often resulted in excessive reversals of lower
 court convictions. The judiciary is independent from the
 executive branch.
 Defendants may also request the autonomous Constitutional
 Guarantees Tribunal to investigate charges that their
 constitutional or human rights have been denied. Military
 courts are empowered to try only those cases involving acts
 against military installations, personnel, or activities and
 infractions by servicemen of military regulations.
 Trial and pretrial procedures are often lengthy; prisoners
 frequently wait up to two years between arrest and sentencing.
 Ecuador's Solicitor General has estimated that 70 percent of
 the 5,500 criminal suspects in prison have not yet been brought
 to trial. At least some of the overcrowding of Ecuador's
 prisons is attributed to the large number of suspects awaiting
 trial. Time spent in prison awaiting trial counts toward
 completion of the final sentence. Some long-term detainees
 have eventually been found innocent.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Ecuadorean Government respects the sanctity of the home and
 privacy of correspondence. The law requires police to have a
 warrant before entering a home except in case of hot pursuit.
 Any judge may issue a search or arrest warrant. The only
 noteworthy allegation of an abuse in this area in 1983 occurred
 when the Ecumenical Human Rights Commission, linked to the
 Catholic Church, charged that military patrols scouting for
 subversives in Pastaza Province had disrupted Indian
 communities by quartering themselves for 15-day periods in
 private dwellings and had made arbitrary demands upon the
 inhabitants. These charges were determined to be
 unsubstantiated by an interagency government commission.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression,
 and this right is vigorously exercised in the Ecuadorean mass
 media. The Supreme Court held unconstitutional in October a
 government regulation and provisions of the election law
 limiting the amount of media publicity candidates could
 purchase during the election.
 Thirty-six newspapers, nine television channels, and 460 radio
 stations, representing a wide range of political opinion, are
 privately owned and free from government intervention. There
 is no media censorship and no political censorship of foreign
 or domestic books, films, or works of art. The Inter-American
 Press Association, however, criticized Ecuador for requiring
 that journalists join the National Journalists' Association.
 There is no government interference with academic inquiry.
 
 
 547
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of free assembly and association is established in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. Public rallies
 require prior consent from the local governments, but this is
 routinely given.
 Labor unions, which represent less than 10 percent of the
 economically active population, are organized into three major
 confederations, reflecting differing political orientations,
 and into several independent labor organizations. All private
 sector employees and government blue collar workers enjoy the
 right to organize unions, bargain collectively, and strike.
 Government white collar workers may not legally strike.
 The Ecuadorean labor code provides for considerable government
 involvement in the resolution of labor-management disputes,
 especially through the Labor Ministry's mediation service and
 the system of labor courts. Trade union leaders are elected by
 their membership. The Constitution provides for formal labor
 participation in government through representation on the
 executive boards of several national institutions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion. Clergymen may not become high-level elected or
 appointed government officials. Ecuadoreans are free to
 practice the religion of their choice, and foreign missionaries
 of many faiths operate freely in Ecuador. HCJB, the Voice of
 the Andes, a U.S. based evangelical broadcasting company in
 Ecuador, is reputed to operate the world's most powerful
 private radio transmitter.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ecuadoreans may travel freely at home or abroad. There is no
 discriminatory treatment of women or other groups in regard to
 travel, emigration, or repatriation. Individuals from other
 Latin American countries find asylum readily in Ecuador. No
 cases of involuntary repatriations of persons fleeing political
 persecution were reported in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Ecuador is a functioning multiparty democracy, with 17
 certified parties, including two Communist parties,
 representing a wide political spectrum. Ecuadoreans 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote. Voting is mandatory
 for literates and voluntary for illiterates. Citizens lacking
 a valid reason for not voting are subject to fines. All
 citizens have the right to form and join political parties.
 Groups not fulfilling party certification requirements, such as
 obtaining a minimum number of signatures of previously
 unaffiliated voters, are not entitled to field candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An Ecuadorean is a member of the Human Rights Committee of the
 U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on the U.N.
 Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
 Discrimination. President Hurtado met with the President of
 the Inter-American Court on Human Rights during the latter's
 
 
 548
 courtesy visit to Quito in September. No entity has seriously
 questioned the human rights performance of the Hurtado
 administration.  Freedom House's 1983 report called Ecuador
 "one of the freest countries in Latin America.* Amnesty
 International did not report on Ecuador in 1983.
 Among the many human rights organizations based in Ecuador are
 the regional Latin American Human Rights Association (ALDHU),
 the Catholic Church-linked Ecumenical Human Rights Commission,
 and the National Human Rights Commission. ALDHU is primarily
 concerned with human rights conditions in other countries, but
 it also monitors the status of human rights in Ecuador. The
 Ecumenical Human Rights Association is among the most active
 organizations concerned with Ecuadorean human rights issues.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1983, severe weather damage, an external debt of $6.8
 billion, a November 1982 to November 1983 inflation rate of
 55.7 percent, and economic recession contributed to some
 erosion of living standards for much of the populace. Ecuador
 had an estimated per capita Gross Domestic Product of $1,471 in
 1983, down 1.4 percent from 1982, according to Ecuadorean
 Central Bank estimates.
 Ecuador's 1983 population has been estimated by the World Bank
 at 8.1 million with a growth rate of 3.1 percent. Health care
 continued to improve, owing to expanded health delivery systems
 and an increased number of doctors. The average life
 expectancy at birth increased to 61.17 years in 1980. The
 infant mortality rate in 1983 was 76.3 per 1,000. An
 inoculation program launched in 1982 had vaccinated 80 percent
 of children under age one against polio, tuberculosis,
 diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles by the end of 1983.
 Although 84 percent of the urban population has access to clean
 water and 70 percent to sewage disposal, these figures drop to
 13 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for rural areas. In
 1980, 59 percent of the population (40 percent in urban areas,
 65 percent in rural areas) lived in absolute poverty. The
 ratio of caloric supply relative to nutritional needs was 90.06
 percent in 1977.
 The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio in 1979 was 107.
 Literacy among adults was 74.2 percent in 1974, 78.2 percent
 for males and 70.4 percent for females. Literacy in urban
 areas in 1974 reached 90.3 percent; in rural areas it was 61.8
 percent. An intensive campaign to eradicate illiteracy reached
 393,000 adults between 1979 and 1983, increasing overall
 literacy in the 15-50 age group to 90.5 percent, according to a
 September 1983 Ecuadorean Government report.
 Unemployment in urban areas is officially 10 percent but
 according to some sources is higher. Underemployment runs as
 high as 45 percent in the cities and 75 percent in the
 countryside. Special concerns of the five-year development
 plan are low-income housing and rural development.
 There are no laws discriminating against women or other groups
 with regard to political participation or suffrage. There are
 few highly placed women in the political structure. One of the
 leading female politicans heads the Alfarist Radical Front
 political party. She and another woman are among the
 candidates for Mayor of Guayaquil. Several women, including a
 Provincial Governor and two Vice Ministers, have served in
 prominent positions in the present Government. Parties and
 candidates in the 1984 elections have actively courted the
 female vote. Candidates also compete vigorously for the vote
 of rural and urban slum dwellers. The 69-member Congress
 includes blacks and persons of Indian origin, and several
 congressional alternates are women. Ecuador has several female
 judges, one of whom serves as a Supreme Court official.
