 CHILE
 Chile has been ruled by a military government since 1973 when,
 following a period of economic dislocation, violence, and
 concern in the armed forces and among large segments of Chilean
 society that Chile was moving toward a Marxist-Leninist state,
 the Chilean armed forces overthrew the elected government of
 Salvador Allende. Following an initial period of de facto
 military government, which saw harsh actions against opponents
 of the regime, Chile adopted a new constitution in March 1981,
 approved by a two-thirds majority in a national plebiscite held
 in September 1980.
 The Constitution provides for a further eight years of military
 government (1981-1989) headed by President Augusto Pinochet who
 is the dominant figure in the Government. In 1989 a plebiscite
 will be held on a government-approved candidate to serve as
 president until normal elections are held in 1997. If he is
 rejected, a direct, contested presidential election will be
 held in 1990. Congressional elections will be restored in
 1990. In the meantime, the military junta exercises the
 legislative power of state. The protection of individual
 rights spelled out in the 1981 Constitution is circumscribed by
 the extensive executive powers in its transatory provisions,
 particularly Article 24.
 The human rights situation in Chile has improved significantly
 in comparison with the post-coup period, 1973-77, when the
 regime undertook a series of strong repressive measures in
 response to what was perceived as a state of virtual civil
 war. Recent trends, however, show that the pace of
 improvements has slowed in the past two years. Human rights
 groups charge that the Government has constrained peaceful
 political opposition and relied excessively on the arbitrary
 action of police and security officials to suppress dissent.
 Arrests for non-violent political offenses and allegations of
 torture continued in 1982. The number of cases in some
 categories has declined or leveled off in the last three years,
 but in 1982 arrests and instances of internal exile increased.
 This is attributable to numerous mass detentions arising from
 unauthorized rallies and demonstrations organized in the final
 months of the year.
 A continuing "state of emergency' has been extended regularly
 every three months since 1973. It gives the Government
 extraordinary authority to deal with an extremist threat,
 although the same powers are often used against non-violent
 dissenters as well. Government actions taken under these
 emergency powers are not subject to judicial modification. In
 several instances, however, the courts and press have taken
 .positions defending human rights. Police detentions are
 author-ized prior to public notification of the arrest, but in
 most cases such detentions are-limitedto an investigatory
 period of five days. Iii general it appears that both police
 and judicial procedures for avoiding infringements of
 constitutionally-guaranteed rights have improved recently.
 There are, on the other hand, continued credible reports of
 torture and abuse by the police and security forces. According
 to the Inter-American-Human Rights Commission, a large part of
 
 
 433
 the rights and liberties guaranteed by the.Inter-American
 Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man is severely
 restricted in Chile. In addition, both administratively
 authorized internal exile and expulsion from the country are
 permitted under the transitional articles of the Constitution
 and have been used by the Government.
 In October 1982, President Pinochet established a commission to
 review the cases of those currently exiled. The commission
 completed its report in mid-December and on December 24, 1982
 the Government announced that 125 exiles would be re-admitted
 to Chile. The commission was then disbanded, but it is
 understood that others from the large exile community abroad
 will be readmitted subsequently. Nevertheless, there were
 several new expulsions during the existence of the commission.
 Political parties remain formally dissolved and freedom of
 speech and assembly are restricted, although some political
 activity and considerable criticism and press discussion are
 tolerated. Labor union activity is restrained but collective
 bargaining and a limited right to strike were restored in 1979
 under a new labor law.
 In 1975 the Government embarked on a new socio-economic policy
 with a program to reduce the role of government, to open the
 economy to world market competition and to reform fiscal policy
 to overcome the large inflationary government deficits of the
 past. Following a difficult readjustment period, the economy
 experienced a period of strong growth averaging seven percent
 in real terms from 1976 through 1981, with declining inflation
 and rising employment. This pattern persisted through
 mid-1981, at which time Chile began to suffer from the adverse
 effects of the international recession-and its own overvalued
 exchange rate. The year 1982 was characterized by growing
 economic problems and high unemployment. The recession has
 affected all strata of society but lower income groups have
 been the most seriously affected by the loss of jobs. New
 public works projects are being initiated and old ones
 augmented to help provide jobs. In addition, social spending
 has grown to about 59 percent of the government budget and is
 now more carefully focused on poorer segments of the
 population. Important efforts in health and nutrition programs
 have substantially cut infant mortality over the past decade.
 The Government has increased real expenditure levels on
 education, with the largest amount devoted to the pre-primary,
 primary and intermediate levels.
 The first six months of 1982 were relatively free of political
 violence but extremist violence showed a moderate increase
 beginning about mid-year. Bombings resulted in one death and
 several persons injured. Groups associated with the Movement
 of the Revolutionary Left -- many members of which reportedly
 received Cuban training -- claimed responsibility for most of
 these incidents.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killiny
 There has been a continued decline in politically motivated
 deaths when compared to the 1973-77 post-coup period. Five
 killings occurred in 1982 which very probably were politically
 motivated. Two persons were killed in January, when Government
 security forces shot two members of the Movement of the
 Revolutionary Left in armed clashes resulting from
 investigations into the November 1981 assassination of three
 police detectives. In February, Chilean labor leader Tucapel
 Jimenez was murdered. Continuing official efforts to find his
 
 
 434
 killers have not been successful. Allegations have been made
 that the Government was responsible. In March, a former
 communist youth leader, Rene Basoa, was killed, allegedly by
 former comrades because of information he had given Government
 security forces. His killers have not been found. In August a
 twelve-year-old boy was killed when a bomb exploded. On the
 same day, bombs were placed in three government offices, for
 which the Movement of the Revolutionary Left took credit. In
 September, a Carabinero corporal was seriously wounded in a
 terrorist attack upon a police station. In late November,
 Dagoberto Cortez, a Movement of the Revolutionary Left leader,
 was killed in a shoot-out with security forces. The details of
 and responsibility for these incidents were unclear.
 The Government's control over its security and military forces
 is strong. A police detective was arrested, charged, and
 released on bail for the 1981 killing of:an alleged Movement of
 Revolutionary Left member in a reported violent encounter. He
 is still awaiting trial. In January 1982, two Government
 security agents were sentenced to death by a Calama court for
 the murder and robbery of two bank employees. The death
 sentence was upheld by all appeal courts, including the Chilean
 Supreme Court, and the convicted murderers were executed.
 Terrorist attacks in 1982 concentrated on property,
 particularly-bombings of electrical power stations. At least
 23 bombings occurred in 1982 and others were attempted. The
 Movement of the Revolutionary Left generally claimed credit for,
 the attacks, although there is also some -evidence-of. communist
 youth involvement. Considerable evidence exists to show Cuban
 and East European training and other support for terrorist
 groups whose announced objective is to overthrow the military
 regime and replace it with a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
 state.
 b. Disappearance
 There were noallegations in 1982 of disappearances. The last
 reported disappearance attributed to government security forces
 occurred in 1977. The Chilean Supreme Court appointed special
 judges in 1979 to investigate many of these disappearances, but
 none of the 635 cases from the period 1973-1977 have been
 resolved. While investigations continue in some cases, in
 others action has been suspended or referred to military
 justice officials when military or police involvement was
 suspected.   Some families of the disappeared have appealed the
 suspension or referral to the military courts. To date, the
 appeals have had little effect in resolving the whereabouts of
 those who disappeared.
 c. Torture
 According to human rights sources, in 1982 57 persons filed
 complaints of torture or cruel and unusual punishment before
 the courts, compared with a 1981 total of 68. Most individuals
 alleged that they were subjected to beatings, electric shocks,
 or threats, particularly during the first days of their
 detention prior to arraignment. The 1981 Constitution
 prohibits "use of all illegal pressure" and 'guarantees to all
 persons the right to life and to the physical and psychic
 integrity of the individual,* and high-level Government
 officials publicly and privately deny that the use of torture
 is authorized. While the courts have required investigations
 of some complaints, to date none has been officially
 substantiated. Most charges of torture were against the
 National Center for Information, which is the successor
 security agency to the National Intelligence Directorate, known
 widely as the 'DINA'.   Torture was generally alleged to have
 
 
 435
 taken place at secret detention centers. Amnesty International
 lists numerous cases of torture in its 1982 report. Some of
 the allegations of torture appear credible.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Human rights sources, including Amnesty International, report a
 number of allegations of serious mistreatment during 1982.
 While most detainees do not file formal claims of mistreatment,
 some persons detained during unauthorized demonstrations or on
 suspicion of proscribed political activities have complained of
 beatings and being forced to remain unclothed for extended
 periods of time. The InternatiOnal Committee of the Red Cross,
 Amnesty International, and other organizations have sought to
 promote humane treatment of prisoners in Chile.
 Until January 1981, persons detained in prison for illegal
 political or terrorist activities were normally separated from
 common criminals, in keeping with an informal agreement between
 the Chilean Government and an ad hoc working group of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Since January
 1981, in conformance with the Government's position that there
 are no political prisoners in Chile, all violators of internal
 security laws have been lodged in the same penal facilities
 with other offenders. They have the rights of visitation and
 communication with family, friends, legal counsel, and
 representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC). There have been no allegations that physical
 conditions in Chilean prisons are worse now than under previous
 governments.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 When people are detained for political activities, friends or
 relatives normally report the detentions, the press publicizes
 them and the Government subsequently acknowledges them. Under
 the transitional provisions of the 1981 Constitution, security
 officials may detain individuals for investigation for a period
 of up to five days and up to twenty days in cases involving
 terrorist acts, involving death, injury, or kidnapping. During
 this.specified period security officials are not obligated to
 honor writs of habeas corpus (amparo).
 Although the Government denies holding political prisoners, at
 the end of 1982, 249 persons were in the judicial process
 charged with seditious activity or with having illegal arms.
 Of these, 126 were in jail awaiting trial and 113 were out on
 bail. Ten others have been convicted and are now serving
 sentences. Most are accused of violating either the Internal
 Security Law or the Arms Control Law. People detained for
 participating in banned public demonstrations or illegal
 meetings are often held under executive discretion for the full
 five days. They may then be released, as in the large majority
 of reported cases, sent into internal or external exile, or
 charged with internal security violations. In those cases
 reaching the courts, the investigating judges may take up to
 five more days to deliberate but, in practice, they have rarely
 issued indictments.
 There were 1213 security arrests in Chile in 1982, of which 312
 were individual detentions and 901 mass arrests. The great
 majority were released within five days of their arrest without
 charges for lack of sufficient evidence. Sixty-six persons,
 including some of the above, were 'internally exiled', normally
 for periods of three months, by adminstrative order not subject
 to judicial review. Most were sent to distant villages as
 punishment for illegal political activities. The
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission has stated that the
 Government has returned to its previous practice of arresting
 dissidents without reference to due process of law.
 
 
 436
 While the National Center for Information has limited legal
 authority of arrest, in practice it has been able to obtain
 vaguely-worded warrants which give it considerable latitude in
 making searches or arrests. Under the new Consitution, the
 courts have become firmer in demanding a prompt accounting from
 the Government. In May 1982 the Executive and the Supreme
 Court publicly agreed that the National Center for Information
 should comply with court orders. Since the agreement,
 Government security forces have given more prompt notification
 to courts and families concerning detained persons. Writs of
 habeas corpus can be and are accepted during the initial arrest
 period, but the judge is technically required only to verify
 the legal authority under which the person was detained.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Chile's civilian judges are career officials and most served in
 the judiciary before the present Government took power in
 1973. Since 1978, most violations of the present ban on
 political activity and most cases relating to alleged human
 rights abuses have been handled in the civilian court system.
 First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of proscribed
 political activities lies with regular civilian courts, whose
 proceedings are conducted in accordance with Chile's civil code
 tradition. As throughout Latin America, there is no trial by
 jury, and reliance is on the written record rather than oral
 testimony. In the civilian courts of first instance, a judge
 serves multiple functions: as prosecutor, sometimes as defense
 attorney, and ultimately as the one who decides innocence or
 guilt. Decisions may be appealed up to the Supreme Court.
 Arms control violations, often forming the basis of charges
 against subversives, are tried before a military court.
 Appeals may be made to a military court of two civilian judges
 and three professional military judges and, in the last resort,
 to the Supreme Court. Defendants have the rights of any
 Chilean citizen before the law, including the right to legal
 counsel of their choice. Criticisms of the functioning of the
 courts focus on the perceived general unwillingness of judges
 to assert a vigorously independent role or, with rare
 exceptions, to challenge effectively the legality of actions by
 the executive under emergency powers.
 The Government issued a decree in February 1981 granting
 jursidiction over attacks on government personnel to a military
 council of war acting under wartime procedures which limit
 defendants' rights. Use of these special procedures has been
 appealed to the Supreme Court in the case of self-described
 terrorist Guillermo Rodriguez Morales, but a decision has not
 yet been handed down. The decree was invoked only once in 1981
 and not at all in 1982. Otherwise, there are no special courts
 for security violations.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The 1981 Constitution prohibits searches of the home and
 interception of private communications and documents except as
 determined by law. Provisions in the penal code require search
 warrants issued by either a judge or military prosecutor for
 specific locations. In practice, however, such searches are
 carried out under a general order issued by the judge or
 prosecutor. Human rights organizations report that in a number
 of searches legal requirements, such as the display of a
 warrant, have not been observed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1981 Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and of
 the press. Although there are no constitutional provisions for
 government censorship, control is exercised under the authority
 of Article 24 of the 1981 Constitution. The Government,
 
 
 437
 usually through informal channels, reqularly advises print,
 radio, and television editors when their coverage is considered
 to depart too far from official policy. To forestall such
 notification, self-censorship is widely practiced by the media,
 with most editors adopting a cautious approach to editorial
 commentary. Nevertheless, articles critical of certain
 government policies appear regularly in leading publications.
 The criticism is usually general and not directed against the
 head of state or ministers by name. Under Article 24, the
 Minister of Interior has restricted media coverage of acts of
 terrorism and internal state security cases and forbidden
 publicity on the private activities of high ranking government
 officials. He also can prevent the publication and
 distribution of new publications.
 Freedom of speech in private discussions is the norm in Chile,
 while curtailments on public statements are minimal.
 Opposition and human rights activists have alleged numerous
 cases of wiretapping and surveillance over the years. It
 appears that personal liberties are restricted only in cases of
 fairly direct conflict with the interests of the Government.
 These specific instances of information control occurred in
 1982: one editor charged (but found innocent) of giving
 excessive coverage to a terrorist act; two radio talk shows,
 potentially critical forums, discouraged before being
 broadcast; one publisher prohibited from reprinting a
 compilation of previously-published critical commentaries; and
 one opposition-oriented magazine closed on the grounds that it
 violated its license to print only on international themes.
 This last case was decided in favor of the magazine in January
 1983 by the Supreme Court which ruled that the magazine could
 continue publication, but only on international themes.
 Appeals continue.
 The Government owns one newspaper, one radio network, and the
 only truly nationwide television network. All other media are
 held privately by individuals or groups. Most media engage in
 a limited amount of modest criticism with radio being the most
 critical, television by far the least and print falling
 somewhere between.
 Imported books are subject to Government approval. Individuals
 distributing publications considered subversive are subject to
 arrest and prosecution. All films must obtain approval from a
 film censorship board, which authorizes cuts of politically-
 oriented scenes. Some films are not permitted to enter Chile.
 Occasionally, issues of US and other foreign news magazines are
 confiscated upon entry. In all of these cases, the print media
 and radio stations inform the public of such government
 actions. The Inter-American Press Association noted once again
 in 1982 that basic freedom of expression exists in Chile, but
 added that requiring government approval of new publications
 limits full press freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Most public meetings require prior approval of the local
 military zone commander. In practice, permission is regularly
 denied when the subject is politically sensitive, although
 small, inconspicuous opposition party meetings have been
 tolerated. Political groups espousing Marxism are outlawed.
 More centrist groups have their right of free assembly
 restricted. Student political activity is also restricted,
 although the right to elect student government representatives
 was restored at the universities in 1979. A law passed in
 1981, however, virtually prohibits all political activity in
 the country's state-supported universities.
 Many trade union rights, suspended after the military takeover
 in 1973, were reinstated in July 1979 by a series of decree
 laws known as the 'Labor Plan' , although these rights are
 
 
 438
 often limited. The trade union movement had little effective
 participation in the formulation of the Labor Plan and little
 or no influence in governmental decisions. Trade union
 organizations can elect their leaders, with certain
 limitations. Plant level collective bargaining has resumed for
 the large majority of private sector unionized workers,
 although not specific sectors. The right to strike is limited
 to 60 days, after which workers are considered to have
 voluntarily resigned their jobs. The right to strike does not
 apply to designated strategic industries, such as public
 utilities. Management is legally permitted to hire
 strikebreakers. Following the abolition of the labor courts in
 1981, no special grievance procedure exists and all labor cases
 are handled by the regular courts.
 Although unions in certain industries (copper, petroleum,
 steel) have remained important and influential, many other
 unions have diminished in size and importance since the labor
 plan. The number of organized workers has declined from
 approximately 1,000,000 in 1978 to 400,000 in 1982, about 11
 percent of the total work force, excluding the public sector.
 The scope for bargaining has been limited to wages, benefits
 paid in cash or in kind, and certain common conditions of
 employment, such as safety. Until June 1982, workers were
 guaranteed their existing wage and benefit package, plus any
 increase in the consumer price index. The Government does not
 now require adjustment of wages for inflation and after
 substantial increases during the period 1976-81, real wages
 declined by about ten percent in 1982..:
 The Government publishes a yearly list of "strategic" entities
 which are forbidden to strike'but are allowed to bargain
 collectively. Approximately 30 were listed in 1981 and 1982,
 mostly public utilities, the government copper mine and the
 petroleum industry. For these companies, failure to reach
 agreement during negotiations leads to binding arbitration.
 The civil service is allowed to form associations but not
 unions. It does not have the right to bargain collectively or
 to strike. The dock workers national unions, as previously
 constituted, and the union card which severely restricted
 access to port jobs, disappeared in 1982. National dockworkers
 unions were replaced by small independent unions established in
 individual private companies which contract ship handling
 services.
 Official constraints on labor unions include the blocking of
 efforts directed toward the formation of national unions, which
 had been highly politicized in the past. Organized labor
 continues to press for a full investigation of the death of
 labor leader Tucapel Jimenez. Individual labor leaders have
 sometimes been dismissed under circumstances suggesting that
 they lost their jobs because of criticism of management or of
 the Government. Professional groups and associations have not
 been hindered in their operation, but their powers have been
 limited by recent decree laws which were aimed at eliminating
 compulsory licensing privileges. Regular labor unions are
 permitted to maintain relations with recognized non-Marxist
 international bodies in their fields.
 In 1982, the International Labor Organization (ILO) maintained
 the same position on Chile as it had in 1981. It rejected a
 credentials challenge from east bloc countries but continued to
 express its concern about the violation of ILO Convention 87 on
 the freedom of association and the protection of the right to
 organize.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Chile, predominantly a Catholic country, respects freedom of
 religion. A number of Protestant denominations and other
 
 
 439
 groups are active. The Jewish community reports full freedom
 and tolerance.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Chileans are free to leave their country. As many as one
 million Chileans live abroad, principally for economic
 reasons. Over half this number have resided for many years in
 Argentina. In the judgment of international organizations
 dealing with migrants, the volume of, skilled and unskilled
 workers returning to Chile now slightly exceeds the number
 leaving. Most of the current migrants seem to be motivated by
 economic rather than political factors.
 Many thousands, however, also left Chile for political reasons
 when the current Government took power. Hundreds sought asylum
 in foreign embassies, and others left subsequently. The
 Government was eventually willing to grant safe conduct passes
 to people who obtained asylum and wanted to leave Chile and, in
 all but a half dozen cases, they were allowed to keep their
 Chilean citizenship and passports. Many others were convicted
 of internal security violations and had jail sentences commuted
 to exile.. Others, were simply expelled from the country. The
 number of people exiled externally has decreased markedly in
 rebent years. During 1982 four Chileans were forced to leave
 the country.
 In recent years, there were several cases of
 adminstratively decreed exile of well known political figures,
 including the former president of the Christian Democratic
 Party, Andrps Zaldivar, and human rights activist leader Jaime
 Castillo. In each of these cases the Government held that the
 individual had violated the ban on political activity. The
 efforts of both Zaldivar and Castillo to return to Chile
 without government authorization have been rebuffed. In late
 1982, several prominent Chilean labor leaders were also
 expelled.
 Government decrees require those who are exiled or who are
 considered to have left Chile illegally to file a petition with
 a Chilean Consul, if they seek to return, and to promise to
 refrain from political activity. The Interior Ministry reviews
 all petitions and, in nearly all cases, the courts have upheld
 Interior Ministry decisions barring individuals from
 returning. The Government has released no current figures on
 petitions acted upon, but local in-country representatives of
 international refugee organizations estimate the yearly number
 of returnees at 800-1,000 persons. In its 1982 report, the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission said that while the
 number of Chileans exiled has decreased of late, the practice
 continues and is a violation of the Inter-American Declaration
 on the Rights and Duties of Man.
 .In late October 1982, President Pinochet established a high
 level commission to review cases of exiles. The stated purpose
 of the review was to allow the return of all Chileans in exile
 who accepted the legitimacy of the current Government and the
 1981 Constitution and who renounced those activities which led
 to their exile. It is estimated that perhaps 10,000 Chileans,
 accompanied by nearly 20,000 family members, left the country
 voluntarily or involuntarily for political reasons. The
 commission issued a confidential report to the President in
 mid-December. The Government subsequently announced on
 December 24 that 125 persons would be allowed to return,
 apparently without having to accept any special conditions for
 their return. The commission was then disbanded, but
 additional lists of authorized returnees are anticipated.
 Several expulsions occurred during the comiission's existence.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees in recent years and makes
 regular, modest financial contributions to international
 organizations aiding refugees.

 440
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Chile is ruled by a military government (junta) headed by a
 powerful president who has sole exercise of executive power.
 Portions of the 1981 Constitution, including provisions
 relating to politico-civic rights and protections, as well as
 elections, will not go into effect until 1989. The junta has
 legislative authority, subject to presidential approval.
 Partisan political activity is legally banned. In 1973, the
 Government permanently dissolved the parties forming the
 Popular Unity (Unidad Popular) political front and all other
 Marxist parties. A 1977 decree law indefinitely disolved all.
 remaining parties. There was universal suffrage in the
 September 1980 plebiscite. Voting is required by law. The
 first elections scheduled are the Congressional elections of
 1990. Opposition elements criticized the absence of electoral
 registers or other acceptable safeguards during the 1980
 plebiscite, and their inability to publicize fully their
 objections to the proposed charter.
 Notwithstanding the formal ban on political activity,
 non-Marxist parties are able to operate openly on a limited
 basis. Marxists found engaging in political activities are
 generally detained, expelled, or internally banished to a
 distant town for violating the internal security code or the
 1973 law prohibiting Marxist activity.
 Women form part of the governing structure, including one who
 holds a ministerial portfolio. The Minister of Justice, a
 woman, has served longer in the Chilean cabinet than any other
 member. There are two women on the Council of State and a
 number of women serve as mayors of Chilean cities including
 some important metropolitan areas.
 The only sizeable minority, the Mapuche Indians, hold public
 offices only rarely but that is considered to be more the
 result of custom, lack of education, and geographic isolation
 than any deliberate attempt to exclude them from public
 office. There have been no problems of nationality,
 citizenship, or statelessness in recent years.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 In July 1978, the Government allowed members of a special ad
 hoc working group of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) to conduct a visit to Chile. Although the group
 subsequently disbanded, a special rapporteur was appointed to
 submit human rights reports on Chile to the commission and to
 the United Nations General Assembly. The Government has
 officially communicated 'to UN authorities yearly since 1979 its
 objection to and refusal to cooperate with the UNHRC's special
 rapporteur, contending that Chile's special status has no legal
 or moral validity and is unjustifiable discrimination against
 Chile. The Government has also refused to cooperate with the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission. In 1978 and 1980, the
 Government allowed visits by direct contact missions from the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) to check on alleged
 abuses of trade union rights, particularly freedom of
 association. While the cases remain pending, ILO reports
 specifically noted the cooperation of the Chilean Government in
 the investigations.
 In the years following the 1973 change of government, the
 Intergovernmental Committee for Migration was active in Chile,
 conducting a program giving convicted political prisoners an
 opportunity to serve out their sentences through exile in lieu
 of prison. The Chilean Government cooperated in making this
 program possible. Including those departing for economic
 reasons and with family members, the Committee moved some
 20,000 people out of Chile, the vast majority in the years
 immediately after 1973.
 
 
 441
 Amnesty International, the.Lawyers' Committee for International
 Human Rights, and other non-governmental organizations have
 expressed special concern over Chile. Although the Government
 contends that virtually all of the reports produced by these
 foreign organizations exaggerate or deliberately distort the
 scope and volume of abuses, it has permitted visits by their
 representatives. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) also regularly visits Chile. Freedom House, in its 1982
 report, regards Chile as 'partly free*.
 The Catholic Church has taken the lead in defending human
 rights and supplying legal counsel to those accused of
 politically-related crimes and to alleged victims of human
 rights abuses. The Church's human rights group, the Vicariate
 of Solidarity, monitors the human rights situation from Church
 offices spread throughout Chile and issues monthly reports.
 The Vicariate has been effective in protecting and defending
 significant numbers of people over the years. Its activities
 have resulted in visible tensions between the Government and
 the Church, and disagreement with the Church position by more
 conservative Catholics. Some Church activists and human rights
 lawyers-have during 1982 been anonymously threatened.
 The Chilean. Commission for Human Rights, a private organization
 now four years old, has also publicized alleged abuses and
 spoken out strongly against them, as well as issuing monthly
 reports on the human rights situation in Chile. It and the
 other-human rights groups operate openly, albeit cautiously, in
 Chile. Some members have experienced harassment in the form of
 arrests and searches. In August 1981 the Commission's
 President, Jaime Castillo, was forced into exile and has not
 been permitted to, return.
 A group, of eight alleged members of the proscribed Christian
 Left political organization, sendtnced to 541 days of exile in
 August, included two Human Rights Commission officials.
 However, in December the Supreme Court reversed the lower court
 decisions, annulled the sentences of exile and placed the eight
 on probation,.
 4. Economic, social, and Cultural Situation.
 Government intervention in the Chilean economy reached a peak
 during the Allende years (1971-1973) with disastrous economic
 results. The present Government has introduced free
 market-oriented economic policies and has taken steps in th'-
 direction of reducing the role of the state in the economy.
 Major economic policy changes implemented by the present
 Government have included: opening the economy to foreign
 competition, selling hundreds of nationalized companies to the
 private sector, and requiring those under state control to
 .operate without subsidies. It has ended price controls and
 many cumbersome government regulations, reduced the government
 payroll, and eliminated excessive fiscal deficits. The tax
 system has been overhauled, capital restrictions liberalized,
 and discriminatory treatment of foreign investment largely
 eliminated.
 From 1976 until late 1981, under the free-market oriented
 policies, the Chilean economy achieved rapid rates of growth in
 the gross national product, steady progress in reducing the
 traditional problem of inflation, which declined to zero by
 mid-1981, and significant progress in creating jobs. Per
 capita GNP reached $2,160 in 1980. By mid-1981, however,
 Chile's open economy was severely buffeted by adverse
 international economic conditions . Export earnings
 (particularly copper receipts) fell by more than 20 percent and
 financing requirements on the country's large foreign debt rose
 in the face of unprecedentedly high interest rates. Economic
 activity which had begun to slip in the latter part of 1981,
 declined precipitously through mid-1982 and unemployment rose
 to over 23 percent at mid-year.

 In an effort to alleviate the burden of the economic decline,
 the Government increased spending on social programs such as
 unemployment compensation. It has also expanded a minimum
 employment program, established a modest subsidy for private
 enterprises to hire new workers, intensified low-income housing
 programs and initiated a nationwide public works program. In
 mid-1982, the Chilean Government announced new housing programs
 to stimulate employment and address the housing problems of the
 poor. While limited by the economic capability of the country,
 these programs are aimed at lower income groups and should help
 alleviate, to cushion to some degree, the severe impact of the
 economic recession.
 For many years, Chile has had one of the more extensive social
 service networks in Latin America. The present Government has
 made efforts to improve this network by devoting the major
 portion of its budget (59 percent in mid-1982) to social
 expenditures. These have reached the highest level in Chilean
 history, measured either in absolute or per capita real terms.
 At the same time the Government has attempted to make its
 social programs more effective by focusing its efforts on the
 poorest sectors of the population and it has declared the
 elimination of "extreme poverty* to be a primary socio-economic
 objective. Estimates of Chileans living under conditions of
 "extreme poverty" range from 14 to 23 percent of the population.
 Health and nutrition programs have led to reductions in the
 ,incidence of malnutrition in the infantile population (some one
 million children under six years of age) from 15.4 percent in
 1975 to 11.56 in 1980. There have been steady declines in
 infant mortality from 71.1 per thousand live births in 1972 to
 a rate of 27.2 in 1981. Average life expectancy at birth has
 increased from 64 years to 67.1 years over the same period. In
 1977 the ratio of calorie supply for Chileans relative to
 nutritional requirements was 109 percent. Eighty-four percent
 of the population had access to a safe water supply in 1979.
 The Government has increased funding at all levels of
 education, particularly for pre-primary, primary, and
 intermediate levels. The primary school enrollment ratio was
 119 percent in 1979 (i.e. enrollment in primary education
 exceeds the primary school age population by 19 percent). The
 adult literacy rate is high and rose from 88.1 percent in 1970
 to 94.2 percent in 1980. In that year, a special adult
 iteracy campaign was initiated in order to further increase
 the literacy rate.
 Although school attendance is intended to be compulsory through
 the eighth grade, the 4.33 average number of years of school
 attendance for the total population is low. Government
 programs attempt to improve this average by linking special
 family welfare payments for the children of the poor to school
 attendance. School feeding programs are also viewed as a means
 of encouraging school attendance among the poor.
 Vestiges of legal distinctions between the sexes remain in
 Chile. For example, the legal retirement age for women remains
 five years lower than that for men. Nonetheless, traditional
 attitudes toward the role of women in society have been
 changing gradually over the years and have contributed to the
 removal of some constraints on a woman's access to education
 and employment. Women now constitute roughly 30 percent of the
 labor force and 39 percent of the university student
 population. Middle and upper class women generally have good
 access to entry-level professional jobs but women do not occupy
 a proportional share of upper level decision-making positions.
 Similarly, there is no legal discrimination against minority
 groups. The distinction of Chile's Mapuche Indians as a
 minority depends more on economic status which is influenced by
 educational, cultural and residential factors rather than
 official policy. In fact, official, non-discriminatory policy
 toward the Mapuches, which entails granting individual family
 land titles rather than maintain reservation status, has been
 eril4tzed for not recoqnizinq cultural differences.
