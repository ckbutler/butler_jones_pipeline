 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been governed by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 1929. The
 Constitution of 1917 provides for the separation of powers
 among a bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive,
 but the powers of the presidency far outweigh those of the
 other branches in Mexico~s highly centralized system.
 The PRI dominates politics at the federal and state levels.
 Opposition parties, viewed by the Government as outlets for
 criticism and dissatisfaction, have been able to make some
 inroads on the municipal level. Opposition strength,
 especially that of the conservative National Action Party
 (PAN), is growing but has yet to challenge the PRI
 successfully on the state level, let alone for the
 presidency. Most opposition party opportunities have been
 thwarted by nation-wide PRI voting strength and organizational
 power, by maneuvers to divide the opposition, extensive public
 patronage, and, the opposition claims, by continuing electoral
 fraud. In the July 1985 gubernatorial elections, the PAN
 mounted particularly strong campaigns in the northern states
 of Nuevo Leon and Sonora. According to official Government
 election returns, the PRI won substantial victories in both
 states. The opposition and many journalists asserted that
 massive fraud took place in the elections. Others, however,
 asserted that attractive PRI candidates, hard campaigning, and
 PAN failure to get out its vote were determining factors.
 Nationwide, the PAN won eight out of 300 Deputy seats in the
 single-member constituencies. In addition, opposition parties
 split the 100 seats reserved for them in the Chamber of
 Deputies.
 Mexico is an urbanized country with a sizeable and modern
 industrial sector. There are also large peasant and
 indigenous populations in the rural areas which continue
 greatly to rely on manual labor. The pattern of income
 distribution is severely uneven.
 In 1985 human rights organizations continued to express
 concern over the fate of Mexico's "disappeared" and to make
 allegations concerning arbitrary arrests, especially of
 members of opposition parties, unions independent of the PRI,
 and peasant organizations. The National Committee in Defense
 of Prisoners, Persecuted, Disappeared, and Political Exiles in
 Mexico currently estimates there are 475 Mexicans who have
 disappeared since 1969 and whose whereabouts are unknown. The
 Committee states that 11 of them have disappeared during the
 current administration. The Committee charges that all of
 those unaccounted for are being held clandestinely in
 government prisons, a charge which the Government denies. The
 Committee also currently alleges the existence of 140
 political prisoners who have been arrested during the current
 administration and remain in jail; the vast majority are
 peasants involved in land disputes.
 Concern over alleged use of torture by police reached a peak
 in the aftermath of the September earthquakes which destroyed
 the Mexico City Attorney General's building. A number of
 bodies, both Mexican and Colombian, were found, allegedly
 bearing signs of torture. Though this was officially denied,
 by the end of the year the Senate had passed an anti-torture
 bill, the Attorney General of the Republic had admitted that
 Mexican police had used torture in some instances but that
 torture was not "institutionalized," and the Mexico City
 
 
 604
 MEXICO
 Attorney General had been replaced. Her successor had
 publicly stated that "bad public officials" had been
 responsible for torture in the past and promised to eliminate
 such practices. A number of deaths have also taken place,
 especially in the rural sector in disputes over land. The
 Federal Government continues efforts to curb misuse of
 political authority; local leaders on the municipal level,
 however, especially those involved with influential private
 landowners, allegedly place a low priority on the protection
 of human rights, and abuses appear to stem largely from that
 sector.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The investigation into the 1982 Tula River killings, reopened
 last year, is continuing. During 1985, some members of the
 former Division of Investigation for the Prevention of
 Delinquency (DIPD), the main body implicated in the killings,
 were interrogated. Of those members for whom arrest warrants
 have been issued, many remain fugitives, but at least four
 have been arrested and are in jail pending completion of the
 investigation. On November 18, a former Commander of the
 DIPD, also in prison in connection with the Tula River
 killings, was found dead in his cell in the Reclusorio
 Oriente, an apparent suicide. In addition, three members of
 the former Federal Security Directorate (DFS), for whom
 warrants also are outstanding, remain fugitives. The former
 Director of the Federal and Transit Police, on whose
 instructions, according to testimony, the killings took place,
 is currently awaiting extradition from the United States.
 Peasant organizations charged that, during 1985, at least 21
 peasants were killed in confrontations in the states of
 Chiapas, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Sonora, Oaxaca, Puebla, and
 Guanajuato. Such charges have come not only from independent
 peasant organizations such as the Independent Center of
 Agricultural Workers and Peasants (CIOAC) and the National
 Coordinator for the Plan of Ayala (CNPA) among others, but
 also from the PRI-affiliated National Confederation of
 Peasants (CNC). The independent groups attribute the killings
 to paramilitary bands supported by local landowners (caciques)
 as well as to members of the CNC, and to local police. For
 its part, the CNC attributes fatalities in its ranks to
 members of the independent unions, encouraged, they say, by
 leftist political activists, Others, however, suggest that
 for the most part CNC members who have been killed were
 victims of internal CNC struggles.
 A major incident in 1985 involved the killing of Alejandro
 Cardenas Peralta, a Unified Socialist Party of Mexico (PSUM)
 Federal Deputy, on February 27 in Oaxaca. The PSUM accused an
 agent of the State Attorney General and two agents of the
 State Judicial Police in Oaxaca of having carried out the
 murder. Other allegations are that his opposition to a
 tourist project which would have entailed expropriation of
 communal lands was a factor in his murder. An investigation
 has been ordered, but its results, if any, have not been made
 public and no arrests have been made.
 
 
 605
 MEXICO
 Representatives of the peasant organization Campesinos Unidos
 de la Sierra Oriental (CUSO) in the states of Hidalgo and
 Veracruz charged in 1985 that powerful landowners' interests
 are being protected by local judicial police. They have
 alleged that such activities have resulted in the murder of 20
 peasants and they have asked the Governor of Hidalgo to order
 an investigation. Peasant organizations in Oaxaca have
 charged that large local landowners, with the complicity of
 local authorities, have been able to carry out campaigns of
 murder, intimidation, and attacks on their members. The
 Triquis, an indigenous group which is concentrated in Oaxaca,
 claim they have been singled out as a target of such tactics,
 and have accused the Governor of Oaxaca of complicity.
 Amnesty International has continued its investigations into
 incidents along the Mexican-Guatemalan border in which
 Guatemalan refugees were killed in 1984. In January 1985 the
 Mexican Government gave assurances to Amnesty International
 that the Government will continue to provide its traditional
 protection and relief to all refugees. The Government works
 in close cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees to achieve these ends, but some refugees continue to
 allege mistreatment, at the hands of not only Guatemalan
 forces but also the Mexican security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 The Committee in Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted,
 Disappeared, and Political Exiles of Mexico, led by Federal
 Deputy and Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT) 1982 presidential
 candidate Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, continued to press the
 Government for information on the fate of Mexico's
 disappeared. Alleging a total of 475 disappearances since
 1969, including eleven during the current Administration, the
 Committee continues to charge that the disappeared are being
 held in a variety of clandestine, government-controlled
 prisons, where they are subject to torture. It supports these
 claims with reports by other human rights groups, news
 reports, and letters smuggled out of prison. The Government,
 in formal reports and interviews, steadfastly denies the
 existence of any such prisons, as well as involvement in the
 disappearance of individuals, and states that those
 unaccounted for were killed in encounters with security
 forces, changed their names and went underground, or
 voluntarily went into exile. In reference to the eleven
 specific cases, there are indications the Government has made
 some efforts to determine the whereabouts of the missing but
 to date has not been able to resolve the cases.
 In February 1985 U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Agent
 Enrique Camarena and his Mexican pilot were kidnapped in
 Guadalajara and subsequently killed. The crime involved a
 gang of narcotics traffickers, as well as local and state
 police, some of whom have been arrested during the
 investigation of the killings. The investigation itself is
 continuing and the trial is expected to take place by mid-1986.
 In January 1985 an American citizen doing research for a book
 on drug-trafficking in Mexico and a friend disappeared in
 Guadalajara. Their bodies were discovered months later. It
 appears that at least some of the individuals implicated in
 the Camarena case were involved in these murders as well.
 
 
 606
 MEXICO
 In December 1984 four Jehovah's Witnesses missionaries
 disappeared in Guadalajara. They are still missing.
 Investigations are continuing. Their disappearance while
 conducting door-to-door missionary work may be related to
 inadvertent contact with drug traffickers.
 The UN Human Rights Commission's Working Group on enforced and
 involuntary disappearances considered evidence presented by
 Mexico at the 39th session of the Commission. At that time,
 Mexico was removed from the list of countries considered by
 the Working Group.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, human
 rights organizations have charged that the police have
 tortured both political prisoners and those arrested for
 common crimes with electric shocks, often applied to the
 genitals; beatings; deprivation of light, food, and water;
 exposure to the elements for long periods; and other means.
 During 1985 two American citizens arrested on narcotics
 trafficking charges filed complaints of various abuses during
 their arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment. In response to
 these allegations the Government has initiated an
 investigation.
 Rosario Ibarra de Piedra alleges that the Oaxaca State
 Government has tortured members of the Coalition of Workers,
 Peasants, and Students of the Isthmus (COCEI). On April 13,
 the PAN municipal head of Zimol, Chiapas, Roberto Alfonso
 Ruiz, accused Chiapas State officials of arresting and
 torturing peasants on a regular basis, naming the State
 Attorney General as culpable. Following the July-September
 occupation by members of the National Action Party (PAN) of
 the City Hall in Agua Prieta, Sonora, in protest of the July
 election results, the PAN National Executive Committee alleged
 that 16 of its 21 arrested activists had been tortured while
 in custody.
 In August the magazine "Proceso" published an open letter from
 six prisoners held in the Reclusorio Oriente, a prison in the
 Federal District, asserting that they had been repeatedly
 tortured with electric shocks to their genitals to extract
 spurious confessions on various crimes. They alleged that the
 real motive for their mistreatment was their membership in the
 Popular Tacuba, a party of workers and peasants. The
 Government states that the prisoners' allegations of
 mistreatment are simply a means to escape punishment and that
 they are guilty of the charges made against them, and it
 denies that their confessions were coerced.
 In the aftermath of the severe earthquakes in Mexico City
 which occurred in September and destroyed the Federal District
 Attorney General's office building, the local press reported
 that the bodies of four Colombian prisoners were found,
 bearing signs of torture. The discovery sparked inquiries
 from the Colombian Government, as well as other governments
 providing disaster relief. Also found in the structure was
 the body of a criminal lawyer, Saul Ocampo, which reportedly
 showed signs of beating and asphyxiation. Ocampo had
 disappeared a week before the earthquake, on September 13.
 The then Attorney General for the Federal District denied
 before the Justice Commission of the Federal Chamber of
 
 
 607
 MEXICO
 Deputies that the Colombians had been tortured, and she
 presented forensic statements that injuries and deaths were
 caused by the collapse of the building itself, though she
 admitted the Colombians had been arrested without warrants.
 On December 3, the Attorney General of the Republic admitted
 that police had tortured detainees in Mexico, although he
 emphasized that the practice was not "institutionalized."
 Media editorial comment on his statement was critical,
 observing that torture had become an established method of
 police investigation, based on inefficiency, corruption and
 lack of democratic controls on police bodies. On December 26,
 the Federal District Attorney General resigned after being
 named a Supreme Court Justice by President de la Madrid. Her
 successor stated in his first press conference that no
 attorney general had ever ordered police to conduct torture.
 He said, however, that some bad public officials had engaged
 in torture, and vowed to eliminate any such practices.
 The Government's official position is that in the rare
 circumstances where torture occurs it is not officially
 condoned. However, on September 18, following allegations of
 torture of the Colombian detainees, the newly formed Senate
 Commission on Human Rights held a press conference to announce
 its drafting of a bill which, augmenting constitutional
 prohibitions against torture, would specifically prohibit the
 practice, as well as providing punishment for officials
 engaging in torture. In response to a question whether the
 Committee's position was a tacit acceptance that torture
 exists in Mexico, the Committee responded affirmatively.
 The de la Madrid Administration, in apparent response to
 continuing allegations of torture by law enforcement
 :officials, has conducted new recruitment into the various
 police forces and has emphasized education and training in
 legitimate investigative skills.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and there are complaints about lack
 of trained personnel, a high turnover both in staff and
 administration, and mistreatment of prisoners which is related
 to corruption of prison officials. Since the current
 Administration took office, reforms have been carried out in
 the prisons of the Federal District, where two new prisons are
 under construction. In some other parts of Mexico,
 overcrowding has in a few instances been somewhat alleviated
 by new prison construction, but in actuality little appears to
 have been done to remedy the poor conditions outside the
 Federal District.
 In March 1985 Mexico signed the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment and the Mexican Senate gave its consent to
 ratification of the Convention in December. President de la
 Madrid signed the formal instrument of ratification on January
 20, 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Leaders of peasant organizations and unions outside the
 framework of the PRI, as well as opposition party activists,
 claim that the police frequently make arbitrary arrests which
 result in extended periods of detention.
 Allegations have appeared in the Mexican press that during a
 February demonstration of peasants in Tuxtla Gutierrez,
 
 
 608
 MEXICO
 Chiapas, local police were responsible for killing one
 demonstrator, injuring 154, and arresting six. The Catholic
 Bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz, asserted
 that there has been a deliberate increase in the number of
 incidents of arbitrary arrest, harassment, and other
 repressive measures being taken against peasants in Chiapas on
 the part of state authorities.
 Representatives of Campesinos Unidos de la Sierra Oriental
 (CUSO) in the States of Hidalgo and Veracruz have demanded a
 state investigation into the continued detention of twelve
 peasants in Pachuca. The press reported in March that a
 peaceful demonstration of the Unidad Obrero Campesino Popular
 (UOCP) in front of the Secretariat of the Interior was
 violently suppressed by police; one person was killed and
 another was arbitrarily arrested. In protest, the UOCP first
 staged a hunger strike and then seized the Greek and Dutch
 Embassies in Mexico City for a brief period of time.
 Amnesty International has adopted as prisoners of conscience
 four members of the Coalition of Workers, Peasants, and
 Students of the Isthmus (COCEI), including one of its
 founders, Leopoldo de Gyves Pineda, who have been in prison
 since December 1983. The four have been charged with offenses
 against the public order, illegal carrying of arms, and
 incitement to riot. The COCEI claims that the charges are
 politically motivated, following the forcible ousting of the
 PSUM/COCEI municipal government of Juchitan, Oaxaca, in July,
 1983. (The PSUM/COCEI coalition had won the 1981 election).
 Practically all opposition parties have lodged charges of
 arbitrary arrest against PRI-controlled local authorities. In
 Tamaulipas, both the PSUM and the PAN claim that the police
 are harassing and arresting opposition leaders solely on the
 basis of their political views. The PAN alleges that four of
 its members were held in jail for 20 days in January 1985
 without any charges before finally securing release. In the
 Yucatan, the PAN reported that 11 PAN members in the town of
 Peto were arrested in April for their political activities,
 and that four of the group were held for 60 days before their
 release. Peasants marched in Oaxaca in April to protest the
 detention of thirty-three peasants whom they termed political
 prisoners.
 Jose Francisco Velazquez, President of the Bar Association in
 Mexico State, asserted in an address on April 17, 1985, that
 fully 40 percent of the prisoners held in the State of Mexico
 are innocent of all charges, and that torture and kidnappings
 characterize police methods there. He demanded that the
 Government either formally charge all prisoners and bring them
 to trial, or release them. In response, the Assistant
 Attorney General for the state denied that prisoners are being
 mistreated or arrested without cause. According to press
 accounts, the state Attorney General's own records show that,
 though there were over 7,500 detainees in 1984, only 1,914
 orders of detention had been issued.
 The Mexican Senate has approved a change in the criminal code
 preventing any "unregistered" arrests by the judicial police.
 The new section of the law Article 197, requires that those
 arrested be brought before a judge from the moment they are
 placed in a holding cell and that the arrest be immediately
 registered. Supervisors of holding cells will be required to
 note the date and time the prisoner is brought in.
 
 
 609
 MEXI CO
 There are legal prohibitions against forced or compulsory
 labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed
 within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at
 least a 2-year sentence. Despite efforts at reform, this
 standard is often not met because of delays caused by
 cumbersome court procedures, backlogs of cases, and the
 defendants' inability or unwillingness to pay bribes to bring
 their case to trial. Especially in the criminal field, lack
 of judicial independence and low pay for judges combine with
 procedural inflexibility and an overburdened bench to weaken a
 judicial system which is highly advanced in many respects, and
 make it vulnerable to corruption.
 Allegations have been made by the political opposition that
 the failure to bring to trial detained peasant activists,
 independent union members, and those in the political
 opposition is politically motivated. All judges are placed in
 position via renewable appointments made by the President,
 State Governors and the head of the Federal District, as the
 post dictates. The political opposition alleges that the
 judiciary is not independent of the Executive Branch of
 Government, especially where the opposition has sought legal
 recourse to combat purported electoral fraud.
 Defendants have a right to counsel and public defenders are
 available. Although certain sections of the criminal code
 provide for the convoking of tribunals with juries, in
 practice this almost never takes place. In most cases, a
 judge, generally acting alone, examines written statements,
 expert opinion and, less commonly, oral testimony and then
 renders his verdict.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Mexican Government generally does not intrude on
 the-privacy of individuals, and search warrants are required
 by law, Mexican human rights activists and members of the
 political opposition have complained that they are followed by
 the police and their telephone lines are tapped. Members of
 independent workers' and peasants' organizations, particularly
 in the northern states, say they have been frequent targets of
 these practices. There have also been charges of invasions of
 peasants' homes by local landowners accompanied by police
 without warrants, and allegations that these incidents
 sometimes involved robbery, rape, and the burning of homes.
 Urban squatters allegedly have been similarly victimized.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed by law. The
 Government is tolerating more direct public criticism, and
 bolder press articles have appeared. Certain topics, such as
 direct criticism of the President and the military, have
 traditionally been avoided by the media. Mexico's press is a
 primary source for reporting allegations of human rights
 violations, and although there continue to be instances where
 reports of violations are not carried, the coverage generally
 speaks positively for press efforts in this area.
 
 
 610
 MEXICO
 Despite the trend towards press liberalization, in March the
 political magazine "Contenido" had to stop publication,
 allegedly because of government warnings that its political
 coverage was offensive and dangerous to the public interest.
 Notable among the articles in the last issue was extensive
 coverage of former President Jose Lopez Portillo, alleging
 that he had profited personally from his term in office.
 Press sources report that the Administration influences the
 press by giving financial supplements to individual reporters
 for favorable articles, by withholding newsprint and ink
 (government monopolies) from critical papers, and, more
 significantly, by selectively placing government advertising,
 an important source of income for the press. Some payments to
 journalists have reportedly been reinstituted by the de la
 Madrid Administration, after having been suspended following
 the Administration's entry into office. In some cases, the
 payments are indirect, as when a journalist receives a
 percentage of the advertising sold to the entities which he
 covers. Opposition parties and some journalists have publicly
 accused the PRI's Office of Information of making large
 payments directly to other journalists. They say that this
 explains the reduction in direct government subsidies to
 journalists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right to peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose throughout the country, but a government permit
 is generally required for major demonstrations. Within the
 Federal District, opposition political groups, as well as
 peasant and indigenous organizations, are allowed frequent
 access to both main boulevards and the city's large central
 square for demonstrations. However, various opposition groups
 have alleged that peaceful demonstrations were broken up by
 police and security forces, and some participants have been
 assaulted and arrested. The Government generally defends its
 tactics by asserting that the demonstrators pose a threat to
 public order.
 Basic trade union, worker, and employer rights are protected
 under Mexican law, and most, such as the right of workers to
 organize trade unions, to bargin collectively, and to strike,
 are guaranteed in Article 123 of the Constitution.
 Mexico has a multiplicity of trade union organizations, most
 but not all of which are affiliated with the PRI. By far the
 largest of these are the CTM, or Confederation of Workers of
 Mexico, and the FSTSE, or Federation of Government Workers
 Unions, which includes most government workers. The CTM and
 FSTSE, along with various much smaller confederations and
 various independent but PRI-affiliated unions which are
 outside any trade union confederation, all belong to a loose
 umbrella labor organization known as the Congress of Labor.
 There are also a number of independent unions outside of the
 Congress of Labor, some with a conservative orientation, and
 others of a pronounced leftist, Communist, or radical
 orientation. Some independent unions continued to complain of
 occasional harassment from bodies associated with the PRI, but
 these complaints appear to have declined significantly during
 1985. The majority of organized peasants belong to the
 National Conference of Peasants (CNC), an organization also
 affiliated with the PRI.
 
 
 611
 MEXICO
 Unions in Mexico are permitted to affiliate and maintain
 relations with recognized international trade union and labor
 bodies. The CTM is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in Brussels, and is
 a leading member of the democratic ICFTU's Interamerican
 Regional Organization of Workers, the ORIT, headquarted in
 Mexico City.
 A number of CTM unions and occasional independent Mexican
 unions are also affiliated with various international trade
 secretariats. The CTM also always provides the Mexican Worker
 delegate to the International Labor Organization (ILO). The
 Communist World Federation of Trade Unions' regional
 interamerican organization is permitted by the Mexican
 Government to maintain its own headquarters in Mexico City,
 although the regional group reportedly has only one small
 Mexican affiliate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, individuals are free to practice the
 religion of their choice; however, no religious body has
 legal standing. The clergy is prohibited from participating
 in politics, voting, owning real estate, or wearing religious
 habits in public. Some of these prohibitions are not strictly
 enforced; neither is a constitutional restriction against
 pre-university religious schools, many of which exist. In
 practice, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Mexico
 maintains a close liaison with the Government. Although
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish
 communities also exist.
 Protestant Evangelists, especially from outside Mexico, are
 active and are especially successful in certain rural, largely
 indigenous communities. Some critics have stated that the
 Government is selectively enforcing the anti-clerical laws in
 favor of the predominant Roman Catholic Church. Other critics
 have asserted that, in some outlying areas, the laws are not
 being enforced against the evangelists, so as to reduce the
 influence of the Catholic Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted, except for some areas along the Guatemalan
 border which have been closed'to the public by the military.
 Mexico has in the past traditionally followed a liberal asylum
 policy and its borders have been open to Central Americans
 fleeing from their countries. During the past year, there has
 been some attempt to control these entries without closing the
 southern border. The process of relocating the refugee camps
 from the border to the Yucatan Peninsula has continued, with
 the Government asserting that the purpose of the move is to
 protect the refugees and improve their living conditions.
 However, critics have charged that the real motivation is to
 discourage additional refugees from coming. According to the
 Mexico City office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), there were 39,600 Guatemalan refugees situated in
 Mexico's southeast region as of December 1985. Estimates of
 displaced Salvadorans in Mexico continue to be unavailable
 from the Mexican Government. The UNHCR will not estimate the
 total number of Salvadorans present in Mexico, limiting itself
 
 
 612
 MEXICO
 to stating that the number of refugees assisted by the office
 in 1985 was 2,300, of whom 70 percent were Salvadoran.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mexico has been governed since 1929 by the PRI, the dominant
 party. To secure its continuance in power, the PRI has relied
 on revolutionary legitimacy, cooption of the opposition,
 extensive public patronage, massive government and PRI
 organizational resources and -- opposition parties charge --
 electoral fraud in some cases. The PRI has broad
 representation from labor, peasants, and other sectors of
 society.   Opposition parties have been able to make some
 inroads, especially, among the peasants and the middle class.
 President de la Madrid, in all three of his Annual Reports to
 the Nation, emphasized his commitment to political pluralism
 in Mexico. In the second address, he pointed to the
 registration of two additional opposition parties, the
 Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM) and the
 Mexican Workers Party (PMT). Critics have observed, however,
 that it is in the interest of the PRI to keep the opposition
 fragmented. They also charge that the PARM joins the ranks of
 other so-called opposition parties, such as the Popular
 Socialist Party (PPS), which generally support the PRI.
 The President of the Republic and Senators are elected
 concurrently for one six-year term. The Lower House is
 elected for a three-year term, once during the elections for
 President and thereafter mid-way through the presidential
 term. State Governors are elected for six-year terms, with
 elections staggered in the Various states throughout the
 course of the presidential term. Members of the unicameral
 state legislatures and all mayors are elected for three-year
 terms and these elections are also staggered throughout the
 President's term.
 Before the July 1985 gubernatorial elections, the opposition
 asserted that the results in states with a developed
 opposition, particularly Sonora and Nuevo Leon, would
 represent a test of the PRI's commitment to political
 pluralism. The PRI's victories in both states' gubernatorial
 contests raised the possibility of electoral fraud. However,
 it is also true that, in response to the PAN's expected strong
 showing, the PRI fielded more attractive and aggressive
 candidates than it has in some time, and campaigned harder.
 Previous allegations of the Government's refusal to recognize
 claimed opposition victories included the November 1984
 municipal election in Chemax, Yucatan. The opposition PAN had
 refused to accept the PRI municipal government which, it said,
 was being illegally imposed. Appeals to the state legislature
 did not result in resolution, and periodic protests continued
 through June 1985; in March, a violent confrontation between
 PRI and PAN supporters resulted in the death of one PAN
 supporter.
 Opposition parties are guaranteed access to public media and
 seats in State and Federal legislatures are reserved for them.

 MEXICO
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government participates in international human rights
 forums and allows both domestic and international human rights
 groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment. Various ranking Mexican officials have met with
 representatives of Amnesty International; the National
 Committee in Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted, Disappeared,
 and Political Exiles in Mexico; the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission; and other concerned organizations and their
 representatives to discuss allegations and share results of
 government investigations of reports of human rights
 violations. Amnesty International has an office in Mexico.
 Mexico is an active member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission, and during 1985 reported to the Commission on 75
 cases of disappeared persons, providing information on 73 of
 the cases. As a consequence of the Mexican Government's
 investigations into allegations of disappearances and torture,
 the Commission is not continuing to investigate those
 allegations, proclaiming the Mexican Government to be in
 accord with the standards by which the Commission is guided.
 The Mexican Government has pledged continued close cooperation
 with and responsiveness to the Commission, as well as other
 international monitoring organizations. In March, Mexico
 signed the United Nations International Convention Against
 Torture, which commits it against the use of torture, as well
 as to periodic reporting by representatives of the Committee
 Against Torture. President de la Madrid signed the formal
 instrument of ratification on January 20, 1986.
 Amnesty International 1985 Report, which covered calendar year
 1984, was concerned mainly with arbitrary arrest and prolonged
 incommunicado imprisonment of political prisoners, sentences
 based on confessions allegedly extracted under torture and
 ill-treatment, and disappearances. Amnesty International was
 also concerned about information on the arbitrary arrest and
 murder of members of rural communities and Indian groups, in
 some cases alleged to have been carried out directly by
 members of the official security forces, and in others by
 armed civilians who seemed to be acting in concert with the
 former. Freedom House ranks Mexico "partly free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mexico's population in 1985 is estimated at 78.6 million and
 its population growth rate stands at 2.3 percent. The gross
 national product per capita was $2,350 in 1984.
 Mexico's major domestic economic and social problems are
 poverty, inflation, generally depressed levels of economic
 activity since 1981, unemployment, underemployment and
 severely uneven income distribution. These problems have been
 exacerbated by the effects of the earthquakes in September
 1985. The Government maintains its right to regulate many
 private economic activities in the public interest.
 Restrictions regarding the ownership of property by foreigners
 generally limit foreign equity participation to 49 percent.
 Mexico has become an urbanized society, with 67 percent of the
 population liv-ing in cities as of 1980. Around 18 million
 people live in the Mexico City metropolitan area. Life

 expectancy at birth is 66.4 years and the infant mortality
 rate is 42.3 per 1000 live births. The primary school
 enrollment ratio was 121.1 percent in 1981 (male 122.7 and
 female 119.5). Primary education is both free and obligatory
 and has been extended to 10 years of schooling. Adult
 literacy as of 1980 stood at 83 percent. As of 1981, 58
 percent of the population had access to safe water (urban, 61
 percent and rural, 51 percent). The average caloric supply as
 a percent of requirement was 117 percent in 1977. There is no
 discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background
 or political opinion in the availability of food, shelter,
 health care, and education. The Mexican Government's figures
 show that unemployment is 8.0 to 8.5 percent. Underemployment
 has been estimated by many observers at 30 to 40 percent for
 several years.
 Mexican law sets the minimum age for the employment of
 children at 14 years; children over 14 but under 16 years of
 age may work but are subject to special legal protections and
 shorter working hours than adults and cannot be employed in
 certain jobs. The law also provides for a minimum wage which
 is revised semi-annually, a maximum legal work week of 48
 hours with a maximum work day of eight hours. Extensive
 regulations pertaining to occupational health and safety also
 exist. Child labor laws in Mexico are observed fairly
 strictly in medium-size and large manufacturing and commercial
 establishments, but less so in small shops and in such
 occupations as that of street vendor, where child labor is
 hard to control. Industrial safety laws are less frequently
 observed in practice, particularly in the heavy industrial
 sector and in the construction industry.
 Men and women are equal in principle under the law. Mexican
 women have the right to file for divorce and separation. There
 are no travel restrictions on women and they can own property,
 in their own names. Over the past ten years, women have
 increased their presence in non-traditional occupations.
 Although the concept of women as mothers and homemakers
 continues to dominate, the number of women's action groups is
 increasing and it appears that the objectives of women are
 becoming more diversified. Women comprise approximately 26
 percent of the work force in urban areas but continue to work
 predominantly in nonsupervisory jobs with few at the executive
 level. However, a woman is now Secretary-General of the
 dominant political party. As the result of an appointment to
 fill a vacancy, the number of women in the 1982-1988 Senate
 has increased from six to seven of 64 Senators; of the 400
 Federal Deputies elected in 1985 to the 53rd legislature, 43
 are women (an increase of eight from the 52nd legislature).
