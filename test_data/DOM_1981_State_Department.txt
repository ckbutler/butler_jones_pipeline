 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy
 with an elected president and vice-president, an
 elected bicameral legislature, and a judicial branch
 headed by a supreme court whose members are appointed
 by the senate. President Antonio Guzman Fernandez
 is now in the last year of his four-year term, which
 began in August 1978. His administration has been
 notably successful in promoting broader political
 and civil rights. Despite substantial efforts,
 it has had less success in improving the economic
 and physical well-being of the populace.
 The Dominican Republic has gone through periods
 of harsh tyranny, with only occasional interludes
 of political freedom since gaining independence
 from Haiti in 1844. Although the founders of the
 Dominican Republic set high standards for democratic
 practice and respect for civil liberties, these
 values were systematically violated by many of their
 successors, particularly during the dictatorship
 of Rafael Trujillo (1930-1961). After Trujillo's
 assassination in 1961, successive governments began
 to respect basic human rights, and the traditions
 of democracy gained strength. The peaceful transfer
 of power in 1978, the first to occur from one elected
 government to another, was a landmark in this process
 of democratization. Dominicans now enjoy in practice
 the broad range of human rights guaranteed in the
 1966 constitution.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The 1966 Dominican constitution specifically prohibits
 torture, and it is not practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the constitution.
 The Guzman administration entered office with a
 commitment to improve a poor prison system but,
 mainly because of financial constraints, much remains
 to be done to correct the unsanitary and overcrowded
 conditions that exist in most Dominican prisons.
 The access of prisoners and families to the press
 remains a major deterrent to cruel, inhuman or degrading
 punishment. Nevertheless, periodic reports of mal-
 treatment of prisoners (mainly beatings) appear in
 the press, and prisoners frequently claim, with some
 plausibility, that they were physically mistreated
 while in custody. Dominican police at times are
 reported to use prolonged interrogation techniques
 that could constitute cruel treatment. Prisoners
 
 (410)
 
 
 411
 in investigative custody have been held incommunicado
 for periods longer than the constitutionally-mandated
 48 hours without being charged.
 Of concern are several unexplained deaths of prisoners,
 either in custody or reportedly shot by police while
 attempting escape or resisting arrest. However,
 these incidents are isolated and do not represent
 a concerted government policy. Reports of lesser
 abuses of police authority frequently appear in
 the Dominican press. In certain instances, policemen
 and soldiers, including some of officer rank, have
 been tried, convicted and sentenced for abusing
 prisoners, for killing suspects allegedly resisting
 arrest and for unauthorized and fatal use of weapons
 while suppressing demonstrators, as well as for
 other abuses of police authority.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Government officials have publicly called for improvement
 in the judicial system and increased protection of
 human rights. The Guzman administration passed amnesty
 legislation in its first year in office that resulted
 in the return of many exiles and the release of over
 200 political prisoners. There are no allegations
 that any political prisoners remain in Dominican
 jails.
 The Guzman administration has not generally made
 politically-motivated arrests, but exceptions have
 occurred. During a 1981 strike by truck drivers
 protesting a government decision to establish a
 transport division for a state agency involved in
 mass-marketing, the government arrested many union
 leaders. This also occurred during strikes by taxi
 drivers in 1979 and 1980. Another incident occurred
 in late 1980 when, in connection with a teachers'
 strike, government agents ousted a group of hunger-
 striking teachers from a church, beat them and arrested
 them, along with four priests. All soon were released,
 after a major outcry from civil and religious groups
 and the press. Almost all persons arrested for
 political or partially-political reasons are released
 within the mandated 48-hour period and are not formally
 charged.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Laws providing for fair public trials are respected, and
 court-appointed lawyers are provided free of charge for
 the indigent. The defendant is generally charged
 shortly after arrest, and the charges are clearly
 stated and made available to the defending counsel.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch.
 No special political or security courts exist, and
 civilians may not be tried by a military court nor.
 members of the armed forces by civilian courts. An
 appeals procedure, including appeals courts and a
 supreme court, is extensively utilized. The Dominican
 judiciary system is understaffed, often moves slowly
 and faces a backlog of cases.
 
 
 412
 f. Invasion of the Home
 A residence may not be searched without due process,
 which typically consists of a search made in the
 presence of a prosecutor or assistant prosecutor,
 except in cases of "hot pursuit" or sound presumption
 that a crime is actually occurring within the residence.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the
 home are generally observed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and are largely
 respected. Dominican newspapers engage heavily in
 political commentary and are rated among the freest
 in the hemisphere by the Interamerican Press Association.
 Nine daily newspapers flourish in Santo Domingo and
 two in Santiago, the country's second city. They are
 distributed throughout the country. The government
 has been charged with intervening to an extent in
 both the press and in radio and television broadcasting
 through the offering and withholding of advertising
 revenues. This does not seem to dampen press criticism,
 and the government advertises extensively in periodicals
 that regularly criticize administration policies.
 The country's numerous radio and television stations
 air almost all political points of views.
 There have been reported instances of travelers
 returning from abroad who have had Marxist-oriented
 literature taken from them upon passing through
 Dominican customs, and shipments of leftist literature
 have reportedly been confiscated or delayed by customs.
 However, both leftist and rightist political materials
 are widely available, and the country's numerous
 political parties publish their literature without
 hindrance.
 While outdoor public meetings require a government
 permit, indoor gathering of political parties, labor
 unions and other associations are unrestricted.
 Permits for outdoor demonstrations have at times
 been denied to leftist groups, and such demonstrations
 have been dispersed. On the other hand, many leftist
 groups never apply for the permits and have reportedly
 sought to provoke the authorities into breaking up
 their demonstrations. During early 1981 some opposition
 party rallies were denied permits and consequently
 suppressed. The government has recently pledged not
 to require such permits in the future. Opposition
 groups have nevertheless alleged interference in their
 meetings by supporters of the governing party, and
 such confrontations have occasionally resulted in
 exchange of gunfire. Electoral violence has been
 strongly condemned by both the government and the
 opposition.
 Labor unions historically have not played a major
 role in the Dominican Republic, and only 12 percent
 of the labor force is organized. However, many active.
 labor unions flourish, and various key sectors of the
 economy are organized, including sugar processing,
 transport, communications and mining. Unions operate
 under the handicaps of an antiquated labor code
 
 
 413
 enacted during the Trujillo regime that gives unions
 few rights vis-a-vis management. During the past
 three years, the secretary of labor has allowed
 unions to exercise their rights under the existing
 law and has not shown undue favoritism to the labor
 confederation affiliated with the governing party.
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman
 Catholic, and the church's preeminent position is
 recognized by a concordat between the Dominican
 Republic and the Holy See. Discrimination on racial,
 religious and ethnic grounds is prohibited by the
 constitution, and there are no restrictions on the
 practice of other religious faiths.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is no restriction on travel within the country,
 but foreign travel can be legally prevented on various
 administrative grounds, such as outstanding tax
 claims or civil and criminal suits. There still
 exists a legal ban against the return of certain
 members of the Trujillo family. The government
 has been unwilling to allow certain foreigners with
 leftist connections to enter the Dominican Republic
 and has deported three foreign religious (but not
 church-authorized) workers from the country, allegedly
 for engaging in political activity or otherwise
 violating the conditions of their residence.
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the
 Dominican Republic has been the focus of critical press
 and public attention both in the Dominican Republic
 and abroad. Haitians constitute the country's largest
 minority, with estimates of Haitians permanently (and
 in many cases, illegally) residing in the Dominican
 Republic ranging between 200,000 and 500,000. There
 is little evidence of systematic discrimination
 against legal Haitian residents, and the Haitians
 living in rural areas have greatly benefited from
 government health and development programs.
 Recent criticism of government policy regarding the
 Haitian community has centered on the government-
 to-government agreement for the recruitment and
 admission of approximately 15,000 canecutters each
 year for the December-to-May sugar harvest. The
 terms of this agreement cover only a small portion
 of the Haitian migrant agricultural workers in the
 Dominican Republic. Most earn less than four dollars
 a day on a piecework basis and live in very poor
 conditions. There is no evidence that workers are
 involuntarily recruited, or that they are not free
 to return to Haiti. Sporadic incidents involving
 brutal treatment of canecutters by soldiers and
 guards employed by the sugar companies have been
 reported by the local press.
 Most Haitians permanently resident in the country
 are undocumented and are subject to the same kinds
 of exploitation that illegal aliens suffer in other
 countries. Canecutters, along with illegal Haitians,
 have at times been rounded up in certain areas by
 the military and returned to work in the canefields,
 
 
 414
 although for pay. A small number of Haitian illegal
 aliens have reportedly been returned involuntarily
 to Haiti.
 Although most Haitians living in the Dominican Republic
 are there for economic reasons, there are also a
 number of Haitian political exiles and several exile
 organizations. The Dominican constitution prohibits
 foreigners from engaging in any political activity
 within the Dominican Republic. The government does
 not permit Haitian exiles to work actively against
 the Haitian government, but has not resorted to
 sanctions harsher than deportation or denial of entry.
 Still, a number of Haitian political groups and
 their leaders are active in the Haitian community
 and maintain contact with other Haitian groups abroad.
 The only other refugee group of note in the country
 is the small Cuban community of several thousand
 which arrived in the early 1960's. They generally
 were members of the Cuban middle class and have
 easily assimilated into Dominican society. The
 government has warned Cuban exile groups to refrain
 from political activity in view of the previously-
 mentioned constitutional prohibition.
 President Guzman has stated that the government
 does not wish to accept refugees from any country
 because of domestic economic conditions.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Thirteen parties, ranging from rightist to communist,
 participated in the 1978 elections. Opposition
 groups of the left and right are allowed to operate
 freely. While certain opposition parties (mainly
 small extreme leftist groups) do exist illegally,
 their status is rooted more in their own refusal
 to register with the central electoral board than
 in any government policy of repression.
 The Guzman administration has taken steps to remove
 the military from politics and to institutionalize
 and professionalize the armed forces and the police.
 Although women's political rights have been recognized
 in legislation since 1942, women have not traditionally
 and do not now share equal economic and social status
 with men. Females hold approximately ten percent of
 elective offices. The secretary of state for interior
 and police is a woman, and many other women have been
 appointed at the sub-cabinet level and as provincial
 governors. A female deputy is campaigning actively
 for the vice-presidential nomination of the governing
 party. President Guzman has announced a series of
 initiatives to end traditional discrimination against
 women, and Santo Domingo has been chosen as the site
 of the headquarters of the United Nation's international
 research and training institute for the advancement
 of women.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 
 
 415
 International and domestic human rights organizations
 have not been obstructed in their investigative
 efforts in the Dominican Republic.
 Various local organizations are engaged in reporting
 and commenting on human rights violations. They
 include the Dominican Union of Solidarity with Latin
 America (mainly concerned with Haitian and Central
 American issues), the Ecumenical Center for Human
 Rights (CEDH) (mainly concerned with the treatment of
 Haitians in the Dominican Republic) and the Dominican
 Union for the Defense of Human Rights. All have
 criticized the Dominican government at various times,
 and neither they nor their leaders apparently have
 suffered for human rights activities. Although
 a former CEDH executive director and his wife, both
 Haitian political exiles, remain banned from entering
 the Dominican Republic, it is believed to be because
 of their political activity in the Haitian exile
 movement rather than their involvement in a human
 rights organization.
 Non-governmental human rights organizations from
 abroad have been allowed free access into the country.
 A group of staff members of the American Friends'
 Service Committee visited the Dominican Republic
 in 1981. The Dominican government has not discouraged
 such investigations, even into such sensitive areas
 as the treatment of Haitian migrant workers and
 exiles.
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in
 international and regional human rights bodies and
 generally gives strong support to human rights issues
 in international fora.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Dominican Republic has a population of approx-
 imately 5,500,000, which has increased over the
 past decade at the annual rate of approximately
 2.6 percent. Half of the population is under 16
 years of age. Unemployment, now estimated at between
 24-26 percent, has increased as economic growth
 has slowed and as more individuals enter the labor
 force and are unable to find work. At least another
 25 percent of the labor force is believed to be
 underemployed. In the last two decades a middle
 class has emerged, and per capita income is now
 estimated to be over $1,000 per person. Approximately
 500,000 Dominicans live outside of their country
 (mostly in the United States), mainly in order to
 improve their economic opportunities.
 Poverty is endemic. The World Bank estimated that in
 1979, 49 percent of the urban population and 43 percent
 of the rural population were living below the Latin
 American.poverty line. Per capita calorie consumption
 continues to be below the minimum requirement, although
 it has increased to 93 percent of the minimum in
 1979 from 88 percent in 1970. Malnutrition and
 hunger remain a problem for sectors of the population.
 While 55 percent of the population has access to
 safe drinking water, according to 1979 World Bank
 figures, as opposed to 37 percent in 1970, only
 27 percent of the rural population has access to
 
 
 416
 safe water up from 14 percent in 1970. The literacy
 rate is approximately 62 percent.
 Steady improvement in the economic well-being of the
 Dominican people has been frustrated by a number of
 factors: natural disasters, managerial deficiencies,
 corruption and a chronic lack of financial resources.
 World prices of sugar, gold, coffee and cacao --
 which together constitute approximately 75 percent
 of the country's exports -- have declined since
 early 1981, and an increasingly large proportion
 of the export earnings must be used to pay for the
 country's totally imported petroleum supply. However,
 the Guzman administration has attempted to improve
 the lot of the Dominican poor and has allocated a
 higher proportion of public resources than previous
 governments to programs designed to meet basic needs.
 Life expectancy has been on the rise (from 56.9
 years in 1970, according to World Bank statistics,
 to 60.3 years in 1979) and infant mortality rates
 have dropped steadily to 96.0 deaths per 1,000 live
 births in 1979. The government has given priority
 status to preventive medicine and paid special attention
 to extending basic health services to the entire rural
 population. However, the devastation caused by two
 severe hurricanes in 1979 and the resulting $800 million
 in losses greatly impaired development and caused
 the diversion of international and domestic resources
 to a recovery and reconstruction program.
