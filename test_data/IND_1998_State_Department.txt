 INDIA
 India is a longstanding parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament.
 Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led a 13-
 party coalition, took office in March and heads the Government. Parliamentary elec-
 tions were held in February and March after the President dissolved the lower
 house of Parliament in December 1997. President MR. Narayanan, who was elected
 by an electoral college made up of Members of Parliament and members of state
 
 
 1886
 
 assemblies, is Head of State and also has special emergency powers. The judiciary
 is independent.
 Although the 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order, the central government provides guidance and support through use
 of paramilitary forces throughout the country. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs
 controls most of the paramilitary forces, the internal intelligence bureaus, and the
 nationwide police service; it provides training for senior-police officers for the state-
 organized police forces. The armed forces are under civilian control. Security forces
 committed significant human rights abuses, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir
 and in the northeastern states.
 India is in a transitiori from a government-controlled economy to one that is large-
 ly market oriented. The private sector is predominant in agriculture, most non-
 financial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy industry. Eco-
 nomic liberalization and structural reforms begun in 1991 continue, although mo-
 mentum has slowed. The country's economic problems are compounded by rapid
 population growth of 1.7 percent per year with a current total above 950 million.
 Income distribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban population
 and half of the rural population live below the poverty level.
 There continued to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitu-
 tional and statutory safeguards. Many of these abuses are generated by intense so-
 cial tensions, violent secessionist movements and the authorities- attempts to re-
 press them, and deficient police methods and training. These problems are acute in
 Jammu and Kashmir, where judicial tolerance of the Government's heavy-handed
 anti-militant tactics, the refusal of security forces to obey court orders, and terrorist
 threats have disrupted the judicial system. Separatist insurgent violence in the
 northeastern states continued, along with reported incidents of security force
 abuses.
 Serious human rights abuses include: Extrajudicial executions and other political
 killings and excessive use of force by security forces combating active insurgencies
 in Jammu and Kashmir and several northeastern states; torture and rape -by police
 and other agents of the Government, and, deaths of suspects in police custody
 throughout the country; poor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and incommunicado
 detention in Jammu andKashmir and the northeast; continued 'detention through-
 out the country of thousands arrested under special security legislation; lengthy pre-
 trial detention; prolonged detention while undergoing trial; occasional limits on free-
 dom of the.press and freedom of movement; legal and societal discrimination against
 women; extensive societal violence against women; female bondage and prostitution;
 trafficking in women; child prostitution, trafficking, and infanticide; discrimination
 and violence against indigenous people and scheduled castes and tribes; widespread
 intercaste and communal violence; increasing societal violence against Christians;
 and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded, and child labor.
 During 1998 India made further progress in resolving human rights.problems. In
 Punjab~the serious abuses of the early 1990's were acknowledged and condemned
 by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court d elegated responsibility, for investigation
 of these abuses in the Punjab to the National Huan Rights Commission (NHRC),
 whose investigation continues., Continuing International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC)-prison visits in Jammu and Kashmir demonstrated some government
 transparency on human rights problems. However, researchers for international
 human rights organizations like Amnesty International (Al) and Human Rights
 Watch (HRW)'were not permitted to visit Jammu and Kashmir or the northeast;
 local nongovernmental organizations were permitted access to these areas. The
 NHRC continued to play-an important role in investigating and redressing human
 rights abuses.
 The number of insurgency-related deaths in Jammu and Kashmir and the north-
 east was slightly lower than the previous year, due in part to negotiated cease-fires
 in the northeast between the Government and insurgent forces and between some
 tribal groups. However, the proportion of civilian deaths in Jammu and Kashmir in-
 creased markedly due to a concerted campaign of-brutal, execution-style killings of
 civilians by Kashmiri militant groups. Separatist militants were-responsible for nu-
 merous, serious abuses, including extrajudicial -executions and -other political
 killings, torture, and brutality. Separatist nilitants -also were responsible for kid-
 naping and extortion in Jammu and Kashmir and northeast India.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Persorn, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings by government
 forces (including deaths in custody and faked encounter killings) continued at a high
 
 
 1887
 level in the state of Jammu and Kashmir and several northeastern states, where
 separatist insurgencies continued. Security forces offered bounties for wanted mili-
 tants brought in dead or alive.
 The Government stated that security forces killed 999 militants in Jammu and
 Kashmir during the year, many in armed encounters. Kashmiri separatist groups
 maintain that many such "encounters" are faked and that suspected militants offer-
 ing no resistance are summarily executed. Human rights groups allege that this is
 particularly true in the case of security force "encounters" wi  non-  shmiri mili-
 tants who have crossed into Jammu and Kashmir illegally. Although well-docu-
 mented evidence to corroborate cases and quantify trends is lacking, most observers
 believe that the number of killings attributed to regular Indian forces showed no
 improvement from the previous year. According to press reports and anecdotal ac-
 counts, those killed typically had been detained by security forces, and their bodies,
 bearing multiple bullet wounds and often marks of torture, were returned to rel-
 atives or were otherwise discovered the same day or a few days later. On May 16,
 for example, 18-year-old Murshid Ali failed to return to his Baghat Barzalla,
 Srinagar, home after a day's work. When his father reported the disappearance to
 police the following day, he was told that his son had crossed the line of control into
 Pakistan for guerilla training. On May 24, police handed over Murshid Ali's body
 to his family; the body bore signs of torture, and police told the family they had
 found it in the Jehlum river.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) active in Jammu and Kashmir reported
 that on May 18, Abdul Rashid Rather of Sanglor Tangmarg district, Baramulla, was
 arrested by the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Jammu and Kashmir police,
 who turned the victim's body over to the police post at Bemina, Srinagar, on May
 24. Several witnesses saw the victim's arrest by the SOG, but a police spokesman
 maintained that Rather was killed in an armed encounter with the SOG. On June
 13, Mohammad Ramzan Wani was arrested at his Nai Bagh, Tral district home in
 Pulwama by SOG members in the presence of relatives. One day later, his body was
 handed over to family members; it-bore bullet holes and marks of torture. The ar-
 resting SOG personnel have not been held accountable for this crime. The National
 Human Rights Commission has directed that all deaths in encounters be imme-
 diately investigated by an independent agency, but members of the security forces
 are rarely heldaccountable for these killings. The NHRC itself may inquire into al-
 leged human rights abuses by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, but does not
 have the statutory power to investigate such allegations if it is not satisfied with
 the responses to its inquiries. Authorities generally have not reported so-called en-
 counter deaths occurring in Jammu and Kashmir to the NHRC. Human rights
 groups alleged that security forces summarily executed a number of captured non-
 Kashmiri militants in Jammu and Kashmir.
 Civilians also were killed by soldiers during military counterinsurgency oper-
 ations. For example, on January 30, soldiers killed at least nine villagers in
 Qadrana, Jammu and Kashmir, after the villagers began throwing rocks at them
 during a search operation. On March 1, the bodies of six residents of a Manipur
 fishing community, including two women, were found in a river near Serou village
 in Thoubal district; they were last seen alive near the village on February 25. Evi-
 dence suggests that soldiers who were hunting for members of the People's Libera-
 tion Army of Manipur, who had been active in the area, killed them. In a 1997 re-
 port, Amnesty International concluded that the pattern of killings in the northeast
 pointed to an official policy sanctioning extrajudicial killings.
 According to the Government, 867 civilians, 232 members of the security forces,
 and 999 militants were killed in Jammu and Kashmir during the year. In its 1996-
 1997 report, the NHRC stated that 1,375 armed forces personnel had been killed
 and 2,237 injured in-Jammu and Kashmir between January 1, 1988 and April 30,
 1997. In 1997 the totals were 918 civilians, 189 security force personnel and 1,114
 militants, according to reliable press reports. In the northeastern states, the Gov-
 ernment acknowledged that 632 civilians, 126 members of the security forces, and
 270 militants were killed during the year. The NHRC report also noted that be-
 tween January 1, 1995 and April 30, 1997, 459 army and police personnel had been
 killed and 250 injured in the northeast.
 Impunity has been and remains a serious problem in Jammu and Kashmir. Secu-
 rity forces have committed thousands of serious human rights violations over the
 course of the conflict, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture.
 Despite this record of abuse, the Indian Defense Minister told Parliament that dur-
 ing the period from January 1 to July 22, no members of the army had been pros-
 ecuted and punished for any of these crimes, nor had any compensation been paid
 to the victims or their families. According to the Union Home Ministry, between
 January 1990 and September, 1998, only 295 members of the security forces were
 
 
 1888
 
 punished for human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. Between January 1,
 1990 and June 30, 1998, 113 members of the security forces were punished for
 human rights abuses in the northeastern states. Punishments ranged from reduc-
 tion in rank to imprisonment for up to 10 years. According to the NHRC's most re-
 cent report, released in 1998, 259 complaints of alleged human rights violations by
 the border security force had been registered between January 1, 1990 and March
 31, 1997. During the same period, only 31 investigations into allegations of human
 rights abuses by members of the army had been completed, resulting in the convic-
 tion and sentencing of 81 armed forces personnel, including 29 officers.
 Scrutiny by the NHRC and international human rights organizations, when per-
 mitted, and the persistence of individual magistrates have resulted in greater ac-
 countability of the security forces-in Jammu and Kashmir over the years. However,
 in July, the Government rejected the NHRC's recommendations to bring the army
 and paramilitary forces under closer scrutiny by the NHRC to allow it to probe com-
 plaints of their excesses. The NHRC-in its 1996-1997 report noted that the security
 forces are making a conscious and serious effort to exercise restraint. Despite this
 effort, the NHRC continues to receive complaints alleging human rights violations
 by the security forces, especially from Jammu and Kashmir and the northeastern
 states. The vast majority of violations by security forces have gone and continue to
 go uninvestigated and unpunished.
 There were many allegations that military and paramilitary forces in the north-
 east engage in -arbitrary detention, abduction, torture, and extrajudicial execution
 of militants, as well as rape (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). The Armed Forces Special
 Powers Act of 1958 and the Disturbed Areas Act remained in effect in several
 states, i.e., in Jammu and Kashmir, Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, and parts of
 Tripura. Human rights activists remain concerned about the reports of deaths that
 are described as having occurred during "encounters" between insurgent groups and
 security forces. Several activists allege that the "encounters" are staged and that
 those insurgents reported dead were killed after being detained by security forces.
 On March 18, United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) militant Deepak Das was
 killed by the army in Bhalukmari in Nagoan district; on March 21, an ULFA cadre
 was killed in an encounter with police in Guwahati when he came to collect ransom
 money from a. local businessman; on- April 6, an ULFA militant was killed in an
 encounter with police in Surajnagar in Guwahati; on April 10, an ULFA militant
 was killed in Nalbari district in an encounter with the army and two other persons
 were killed in the cross-fire. On May 28, at least three National Democratic Front
 for Bodoland (NDFB) militants were killed in- an encounter with the army in
 Nalbari district. On May 31, army troops reportedly killed six members of the
 Harkat-ul-Ansar (HUA) outside of the town of Rajouri in a counterinsurgency oper-
 ation. In October, authorities killed 2 ULFA militants and I NDFB militant in en-
 counters in Assam and 10 National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) militants
 in Tripura. On August 27, army major Jamir Khan reportedly confessed to killing
 three former ULFA members whom he believed knew the whereabouts of a signifi-
 cant sum of money held by an ULFA leader who himself had been killed in an en-
 counter several days earlier. Khan is expected to be court-martialed and tried for
 murder. Between mid-October and mid-December, 12- insurgents and 2 policemen
 were killed in clashes in Assam; 4 militants and two policemen were killed in
 Tripura, 1 policeman and an insurgent were killed in Manipur, and 6 insurgents
 were killed in Bihar. For example, two policemen were killed when their vehicle was
 shot at in Garopara in West Tripura; and on November 23, 3 Bodo Liberation Tiger
 Force (BLTF) militants were killed in an encounter with army personnel near
 Musalpur in Nalbari district.
 Since 1980 clashes between police and Naxalite Maoist revolutionaries of the Peo-
 ples' War Group (PWG) have taken place in northwestern Andhra Pradesh. Over
 the past few years, hundreds of policemen and suspected Naxalites have been killed,
 according to press reports and human rights organizations. According to local
 human rights groups, 174 persons- were killed in police "encounters" in the first 8
 months of the year. Seventeen years of guerrilla-style conflict have led to serious
 human rights abuses by both sides. Human rights groups allege that "encounters"
 are usually faked by the police to cover up the torture and subsequent murder of
 Naxalite suspects, sympathizers, or informers. These groups cite as evidence the re-
 ftusal of poice to hand over the corpses ofsuspects killed in "encounters," which are
 often cremated before families can view the bodies. Villagers in PWG-dominated
 areas com p lain of regular harassment and arbitrary detention by police. Police offi-
 cials rarely if ever are held accountable for human rights abuses. The Andhra
 Pradesh Civil Liberties Union documented more than 100 encounter killings by po-
 lice that Were not prosecuted.
 
 
 1889
 The Disturbed Areas Act has been in force in a number of districts in Andhra
 Pradesh for more than a year. It-gives police extraordinary powers of arrest and de-
 tention. Human rights groups allege that security forces have been able to operate
 with virtual impunity in parts of Andhra Pradesh under the act. They further allege
 that Andhra police have contributed to the establishment of an armed vigilante
 group known as the "Green Tigers," whose mission is to combat Naxalite groups in
 the state. The NHRC is investigating some 285 reported cases of so-called "fake en-
 counter deaths" allegedly committed by the Andhra police in connection with anti-
 Naxalite operations. In its 1996-97 report (the latest available), the NHRC stated
 that the evidence on record did not show in any of the cases "that any prior at-
 tempt" was made by the police to arrest the deceased persons. The report observed
 that in "none of these encounters, did police personnel receive any injury", while one
 or more persons from the other side died. The Commission further observed that
 "no attempt whatsoever" was made to ascertain the identity of the police officers
 who fired the bullets that caused the deaths, and that no attempt was made to in-
 vestigate the circumstances under which the police opened fire. "As this appeared
 to be the pattern of the procedure followed by the police", the report concluded, "the
 Commission felt it necessary to conclude that the procedure followed by them was
 opposed to law".
 Police also used excessive force indiscriminately against demonstrators, killing
 many citizens. For example, on January 12, 19 demonstrators were killed when po-
 lice opened fire on a group of protesters in Multai, Betul district, Madhya Pradesh.
 The victims were farmers protesting a lack of government compensation for crops
 lost to bad weather; police alleged that the victims were part of a violent mob and
 that several police officers had been injured in the encounter. On August 11, Bihar
 police opened fire on a group of approximately 1,000 protesters who had gathered
 to demonstrate against the state government's failure to provide adequate relief to
 flood victims. Four persons were killed and more than a dozen wounded in the inci-
 dent, which the NHRC is investigating.
 Throughout the country, numerous accused criminals continue to be killed in en-
 counters with police. For example, the West Bengal Human Rights Commission
 (WBHRC) in August found evidence to support a charge of murder against a police
 official who allegedly killed Khagen Majhi of Kalyani Thana, West Bengal, after tak-
 ing him from his home in the early morning of April 30, 1997. Police alleged that
 Majhi died when unknown persons armed with bombs attacked the arresting officer.
 The WBHRC reportedly found no evidence to support the police contention that
 Majhi had been killed accidentally in the ensuing exchange of fire, finding instead
 that he had been shot at point blank range.
 According to the Government, 462 civilians and 106 police died in exchanges of
 gunfire involving police in 1997 (the most recent statistics available). In December
 1997, human rights organizations and victims' families in Mumba petitioned the
 High Court to look into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of three persons
 in alleged "fake encounters" with police: A peanut seller named Javed Sayama, and
 two members of a criminal gang, Sada Pawale and Vijay Tandel. In June, the
 NHRC directed the Bihar government to pay $2,500 in immediate interim relief to
 the widow of a Ranchi-based businessman who had been shot and killed by police
 in December 1993.
 Security forces also held persons in incommunicado detention; on occasion, as in
 the 1996 case of human rights activist Jalil Andrabi, such missing persons later
 were found dead (see Sections 1.b. and 4). As of December 1997, 55 cases of dis-
 appearance and custodial death were still pending against Border Security Force
 (BSF) personnel in Jammu and Kashmir (see Section 1.c.).
 While extrajudicial killings continued in areas buffeted by separatist insurgencies,
 the press and judiciary also continued to give attention to faked encounter killings
 and to deaths in police custody. According-to NHRC statistics, 188 persons died in
 police custody and 700 persons died in judicial custody between April 1, 1996 and
 March 31, 1997 (latest statistics available). Many such persons were tortured (see
 Section 1.c.). The NHRC has focused on torture and deaths in custody. It has di-
 rected district magistrates to report all deaths in police and judicial custody and
 stated that failure to do so would be interpreted as an attempted coverup. Mag-
 istrates appear to be complying with this directive. However, the NHRC has no au-
 thority directly to investigate abuses by the security forces, and security forces
 therefore are not required to-and do not-report custodial deaths in Jammu and
 Kashmir or the northeast In May the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probed
 the custodial death of Hari Shankar at the hands of the Hau Kazi police. A crimi-
 nal complaint was filed against the deputy commissioner of police.
 
 
 1890
 
 According to the Government, 817 persons died in prisons between January 1 and
 September 30, many from natural causes, in some cases aggravated by poor prison
 conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 During the year, an army major was arrested for the 1996 killing of human rights
 activist Jalil Andrabi. The case was still in progress at year's end. There were no
 developments in the 1996 killing of human rights activist Parag Das, who was alleg-
 edly killed by a militant who had previously surrendered and was supported by the
 Government (see Section 4).  '
 Killings  and  abductions  of suspected  militants  and  other persons by
 progovernment countermilitants continued as a significant pattern in Jammu and
 Kashmir. Counter-militants are former separatist militants who have surrendered
 to government forces but have retained their arms and paramilitary organization.
 Government agencies fund, exchange intelligence with, and direct operations of
 countermilitants as part of the counterinsurgency effort. Countermilitants are
 known to screen passersby at roadblocks and guard extensive areas of the Kashmir
 Valley from attacks by militants. In sponsoring and condoning countermilitant activ-
 ity, which takes place outside the legal system, the Government cannot avoid re-
 sponsibility for killings, abductions, and other abuses committed by these irregulars.
 Perhaps as many as 3,000 continue to operate in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly
 in the countryside, outside major towns. Although precise numbers are unavailable,
 the Hizbul Mujahideen, a Kashmiri militant group, told the press in June that
 progovernment countermilitants had killed 350 of its members. The Government
 has recruited countermilitants into the Special Operations Group of the Jammu and
 Kashmir police and into the border security force.
 Militant groups in Jammu and Kashmir targeted members of the security forces
 and civilians during the year. On February 12, militants-in Baramulla district en-
 tered the house of a special police officer and killed three members of his family
 and injured a fourth. On February 17, a senior national conference political activist
 was killed by suspected militants in Anantnag district. One soldier was killed on
 February 24 near Wakoora when security forces'reportedly foiled an attack on the
 life of-the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister (who was not hurt in the incident).
 On March 22, All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) militants at the Dhoopcherra-
 Gogomoni Para in Khowai killed six soldiers of the Tripura State Rifles. Militants
 killed a Congress party worker on April 30 in Anantnag district and two-BJP politi-
 cal workers in a drive-by shooting at a restaurant in Udhampur town. On May 13,
 militants killed a National Conference worker in Baramulla. On May 18, suspected
 ATTF militants attacked a police outpost and killed a constable in West Tripura.
 On May 31, militants murdered the brother-in-law of former Union Home Minister
 Maqbul Dar. In a separate incident, militants kidnaped Ghulam Nabi Dar, brother
 of Maqbul Dar, on May 29.
 Between January and August, militants carried out six mass killings of Hindu vil-
 lagers in Jammu and Kashmir. The execution-style killings were carried out with
 ruthless efficiency and the victims often included women and children. rn a seventh
 incident, unidentified gunmen killed 19 Muslim villagers, including 14 children, on
 August 4 (see'Section 1.g.). On April 12, suspected ATTF militants killed two per-
 sons in south Tripura. On May 16, suspected ATTF militants killed three persons
 in Khowai. On August 3, suspected militants executed 35 migrant road workers
 while they slept in the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh.
 Insurgency and increased ethnic .violence took a heavy toll in the northeast. Ex-
 tensive, complex patterns of violence continued in the seven states of northeastern
 India. The main insurgent groups in the northeast include two factions of the Na-
 tional Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) in Nagaland; Meitei extremists in
 Mur; the ULFA and the Bodo Security Force in Assam; and the ATTF and the
 in Tripura. The proclaimed object of many of these groups is to break out
 of. the Indian union, creating new, independent nations. Their stated grievances
 against the Government range from charges of neglect and indifference to the en-
 demic poverty of the region, to allegations of active discrimination against the tribal
 and nontribal peoples of the region by the center. The oldest of these conflicts, in-
 volving the Nagas, started with India's independence in 1947. On August 1, 1997,
 a cease-fire between the Government and the Isak-Muivah faction of the NSCN
 (NCSN-IM) went into effect and has been largely observed by the Government and
 all insurgent groups in the state. In August, the cease-fire was extended for another
 year. The K    and Paite ethnic tribes also entered into a cease-fire in March,
 which was signed in the presence of Manipur's Chief Minister. Both sides observed
 the cease-fire, and-in October a peace accord between them was signed. In 1997 vio-
 lence between the Kuki andPaite communities led to hundreds of deaths and the
 burning ofmany homes. Elsewhere in the northeast, the upsurge in Bodo-Santhal
 ethnic clashes, which began in April, intensified in July and August. More than
 
 
 1891
 260,000 persons are currently living under poor conditions in relief camps in As-'
 sam's Kokrajhar, Gosaigaon, and adoining districts as a result of the ongoing vio-
 lence between Bodos and Santhals. The brutal killings of relatives of ULFA leaders
 renewed concerns about the situation in Assam. In Nagaland clashes between the  4
 Naga groups not participating in the cease-fi-e and the NSCN-IM occurred (albeit
 with less frequency than in 1997), leading to a number of deaths. There were also
 encounters between security forces and the NSCN-Khaplang faction throughout the
 year.
 In Tripura, there was a noticeable increase in the number of kidnapings commit-
 ted by militant groups operating in the state. For example, Human Rights Watch
 reported that on April 30 an armed group abducted bus passengers; 24 were re-
 leased, and 6 were held for ransom. Even after ransom is paid for captives, many
 are murdered. According to a compilation of newspaper accounts, more than 230
 persons have lost their lives in insurgency-related violence in Assam; 142 in
 Manipur; 81 in Tripura and 19 in Nagaland. On March 31, NLFT insurgents killed
 Tripura minister of health and urban development Bimal Sinha and his brother,
 Vidyut The minister and his brother were seeking the release of another brother
 who had been kidnaped by the militants. On Aprl 5, the personal security guard
 of the Additional Deputy Inspector General of the Border Security Force (ADIG) was
 killed in Guwahati when UA   militants attempted to kill the ADIG. On May 25,
 suspected ULFA militants killed 5 paramilitary personnel in Churachandpur. On
 May 30, suspected NLFT militants klled a CPI (M) leader and a state intelligence
 officer in West Tripura; on May 31, a lieutenant of the Assam Rifles was killed by
 the NLFT Dalanbari in West Tripura. On June 30, ULFA militants killed two po-
 licemen in Imphal, Manipur. On July 14, Meitei militants belonging to the People's
 Liberation Army in Manipur killed eight Central Reserve Police Force personnel in
 an ambush. Also in July, Bodo militants killed seven policemen in Kokrajhar dis-
 trict.
 The kidnapping of NGO environmental activist Sanjay Ghosh in 1997 and his
 death at the hands of his ULFA captors continued to attract wide public criticism.
 On August 6, 1997, ULFA confirmed that Ghosh died in captivity after being "ar-
 rested and tried." ULFA still has not produced Ghosh's body. In May, two persons
 were killed by Bodo militants in Barpeta district, and on May 31, suspected NDFB
 militants killed a Santhal woman in Kokrajhar. In June, suspected Bodo militants
 killed a student and wounded another in Nagoan district. In mid-June, ULFA mili-
 tants killed 16-year-old Rashmi Bora, alleging that she had been an army inform-
 ant. An ULFA member had earlier warned her to stop dancing in public; her body
 was not returned to her family. In Assam, 32 persons died in Santhal-Bodo clashes.
 On October 5, suspected NDFB militants killed a man accused of raping several
 women in his village, and during the first two weeks of October, killed 8 other per-
 sons.
 Groups representing several ethnic tribal peoples in Assam, including the
 Santhals, Mundas, Oraons, Gonds, Savars, BEs, Koyas, Kharias, Lohars and
 Paijas, allege that they have been the target of systematic violence at the hands
 of the National Democratic Front for Bodoland. For example, NGO's state that 14
 tribal people, including 6 women, were hacked to death by NDFB militants after
 being dragged from a bus on May 3 in Kokrajhar. On June 17, four tribal people
 were abducted by NDFB militants in Kachgaon forest in Kokrajhar district and
 later killed. On June 27, suspected NLFT militants killed two tribal women in a
 forest in the Atharomura range. In September, 700 homes reportedly were bprned
 in clashes between the Bodos and Santhals in Assam. Between October and mid-
 December, 51 persons were killed by insurgents in Assam. For example, on Decem-
 ber 12, suspected NDFB militants killed 20 ethnic Bengali Muslim woodcutters and
 injured several others in Panijani forest near Gosaigaon in Kokrajhar. During the
 same period, two civilians were killed by insurgents in Tripura, two in Bihar, and
 one in Manipur.
 Naxalite Maoist revolutionaries of the Peoples' War Group (PWG) have killed doz-
 ens of persons, declaring them "class enemies" or police informers. In June,
 Naxalites attacked a tribal village in Andhra Pradesh's east Godavari district,
 where they killed the village chief and beat eight women and shot two men. On Feb-
 ruary 22, an Orissa policeman was killed by suspected PWG militants, who had en-
 tered the state from neighboring Andhra Pradesh. In areas under their control,
 Naxalites dispense summary justice in "People's Courts", which in some cases con-
 demn to death suspected police informers, village headmen, and others deemed to
 be "class enemies" or "caste oppressors." The Naxalites also extort money from busi-
 nesses. Their victims, in addition to police and local government officials, include
 suspected police informers, village headmen, and landlords whom they accuse of op-
 pressing scheduled caste members. The PWG also used land mines to kill police (see
 
 
 1892
 Section 1.g.), -and insurgents used bombs to kill government officials, police, and ci-
 vilians.
 On November 19, 1997, an independent commission of inquiry set up by Par-
 .liament in August 1991 to investigate the May 21, 1991 assassination of former
 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi tabled an interim report of its findings in the Lok
 Sabha. The report pointed clearly to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
 as having been responsible for the assassination, but was inconclusive on the ques-
 tion of whether the LTTE had received assistance in carrying out the murder. It
 criticized the then-Indian government for an alleged failure to provide comprehen-
 sive security for the former prime minister. On January 28, a designated lower
 court in Chennai sentenced to death all 26 persons accused in the assassination.
 The Central Bureau of Investigation originally charged 41 persons in the case; 12
 have since died, and 3 have evaded capture (including LTTE leader Velupillai
 Prabakharan). Many of those sentenced, who include both Indian and Sri Lankan
 nationals, were alleged to have played a peripheral role in the assassination plot,
 but the court upheld the CBI contention that all of them were aware that they were
 conspiring in a common cause.
 b. Disappearance.-According to human rights groups, unacknowledged, incommu-
 nicado detention of suspected militants continued in Jammu, andKashmir, although
 the practice decreased compared with previous years.
 The Jammu and Kashmir police acknowledged that 1,228 suspected militants
 were arrested during the year and that an additional 187 had surrendered. Of this
 number, 529 were released after preliminary questioning, 457 were charged under
 special security laws, and the remainder were released at a later stage of judicial
 review. In addition, the Jammu and Kashmir police stated that they held 514 per-
 sons at year's end under the Public Safety Act (PSA). The Government was unable
 to provide complete statistics for the number of persons held under special security
 laws in the northeast, but acknowledged that 43 persons were in detention under
 the National Security Act at year's end. In April a Home Ministry official stated
 publicly that 354 suspected -militants were being held in Assam alone. Although the
 Government allowed the TADA to lapse in 1995, several hundred persons remained
 in detention awaiting prosecution under the law. Several thousand others are held
 in short-term confinement in transit and interrogation centers.
 Human rights groups maintain that as many as 2,000 more are held by the mili-
 tary and paramilitary forces in long-term unacknowledged detention in interroga-
 tion centers and transit camps in Jammu and Kashmir and in the northeast which
 are nominally intended for only short-term confinement. Human rights groups fear
 that many of these unacknowledged prisoners are subject to torture and
 extrajudicial killing. According to one NGO, there were 300 to 350 writs of habeas
 corpus pending in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court at year's end. The United
 Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture reported in 1997 that more than 15,000 ha-
 beas corpus petitions have been filed in India since 1990, "but that in the vast ma-
 jority of these cases the authorities had not responded to the petitions." In 1998,
 the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances of the U.N. Commis-
 sion on Human Rights transmitted 28 newly reported cases of disappearance to the
 Government, 7 of which reportedly occurred in 1997. The Government submitted in-
 formation on seven cases of disappearance to the working group in 1998. In one
 prominent case in Jammu and Kashmir, the Government responded to the U.N.
 Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions in 1997 and
 stated that human rights activist Jalil Andrabi was not arrested by security forces,
 as alleged by human rights groups, but was abducted by "unidentified armed per-
 sons." Andrabi was last seen alive in the presence of countermilitants and members
 of the security forces on March 8, 1996 in Srinagar. Despite the Government's state-
 ment, the army in February 1996 identified to a Srinagar court a major with a tem-
 porary commission as the individual primarily responsible for Andrabi's death.
 Andrabi's body was dumped in the Jhelum river, allegedly by security forces. His
 case is also the subject of inquiry by the NHRC. During the year, an army major
 was arrested for the killing of Andrabi,,and the case was still in progress at year's
 end (see Sections l.a. and 4). In April the Government stated that it would inves-
 tigate the fate of eight persons reported to have disappeared in Jammu and Kash-
 mir during 1997: Fayaz Ahmad Beigh, Fayaz Abmad Khan, Abdula Rashid Wahid,
 Mohammed Ashraf Dar, Mohammed Afzal Shah, Nisar Abroad Wani, Manzoor
 Ahmad Dar, and Bilal Ahmad Sheikh. By September the Government could account
 for only one of the eight, claiming that Fayaz Ahmad Beigh had escaped police cus-
 tody on September 9, 1997, and was believed to have crossed the line of control into
 Pakistan. As of December 1997, 55 cases of disappearance and custodial death were
 still pending against Border Security Force (BSF) personnel in Jammu and Kashmir
 (see Section 1.c.).
 
 
 1893
 The Government maintains that screening committees run by the state govern-
 ments provide information about detainees to their families. However, other sources
 indicate that families are able to confirm the detention of their relatives only by
 bribing prison guards. Authorities have been able to provide no clue as to the fate
 of Sajad Ahmad Bazaz, who was arrested by members of the 30th Battalion of the
 Border Security Force at his Hazratbal, Srinagar home on February 12, 1992, de-
 spite persistent efforts by family members to discover his whereabouts. A program
 of prison visits by the ICRC, which began in October 1995, is designed in part to
 help assure communications between detainees and their families. Between January
 andAugust, the ICRC visited approximately 1,200 detainees in 28 places of deten-
 tion, All acknowledged detention centers in Jammu and Kashmir and Kashmiri de-
 tainees elsewhere in the country have been visited. The ICRC is not authorized to
 enter interrogation centers or transit centers, nor does it have access to regular de-
 tention centers in the northeast.
 In Punjab the pattern of disappearances prevalent in the early 1990's appears to
 be at an end. Hundreds of police and security officials have not been held account-
 able for serious human rights abuses committed during the counterinsurgency of
 1984-94. However, steps have been taken against a few such violators. The Central
 Bureau of Investigation is actively pursuing charges against dozens of police officials
 implicated in the "mass cremations" case. Police in the Tarn Taran district secretly
 disposed of bodies of suspected militants believed to have been abducted and
 extrajudicially executed, cremating them without the knowledge or consent of their
 families.-The CBI, in its report to the Supreme Court of December 9, 1996, stated
 that more than 2,000 bodies had been secretly cremated by Punjab police in Tarn
 Taran; of this number, 585 bodies had been fully identified, 274 partially identified,
 and 1,238 were unidentified. Most reportedly were killed, by border security forces
 while trying to cross into India from Pakistan, were unidentified victims of accidents
 or suicide, or died in clashes between militant factions. However, 424 were appar-
 ently militants killed in the interior of the district, 291 of whom were subsequently
 identified. These numbers demonstrate the extent of the bloodshed during those
 years and, given the pattern of police abuses prevalent during the period, credibly
 include many killed in extrajudicial executions. The NRC is seeking to obtain com-
 pensation for the families of those victims whose remains have been identified, but
 the Government has challenged the NHRC's jurisdiction in the case. In September,
 the Supreme Court upheld the right of the NHRC to investigate the case., In August,
 the Committee for the Coordination on Disappearances in Punjab (CCDP) member
 and former Supreme Court justice Kuldip Singh presented the chief minister of Pun-
 jab with a list of some 3,000 people who either were missing or had died in encoun-
 ters with security forces during the period of unrest in Punjab. Former justice Singh
 also announced that the CCDP would form a three-member commission to look into
 the mass cremations.
 In April Amnesty International expressed its concern that the judicial inquiry into
 the death of human rights activist Jaswant Singh Khalra was being obstructed by
 olice in Punjab. Khalra had been investigating the cremation of unidentified bodies
 y Tarn Taran police. Several witnesses observed Punjab police arrest Khalra out-
 side his Amritsar home on September 6, 1995. Police subsequently denied they had
 arrested Khalra and he has not been seen since. On July 30, 1996, following its in-
 vestigation, the CBI identified nine Punjab police officials as responsible for
 Khalra's abduction and recommended their prosecution. One of the suspects subse-
 quently died, reportedly by suicide; none of the others has yet been charged. In July
 Jaspal Singh Dhilon, another member of the CCDP who was active in the Tarn
 Taran investigation, was arrested by Punjab police on suspicion of conspiring to free
 several convicted Sikh separatists from a Chandigarh jail. At year's end, Dhillon re-
 mained in remand custody but had not been charged.with any crime. These events
 prompted extended public debate over the accountability of Punjab police for ex-
 cesses during the suppression of a bloody insurgency. According to human rights ac-
 tivists in Punjab, approximately 100 police officials were either facing charges, had
 been prosecuted, or were under investigation for human rights .abuses at year's end.
 There are credible reports that police throughout the country often do not file re-
 quired arrest reports. Aa rest there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances
 in which relatives claim that an individual was taken into police custody and never
 heard from again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no
 records of arrest. In Manipur 14-year-old Yumlembam Sanamacha of Thoubal dis-
 trict has been missing since his arrest by soldiers on February 12. The army report-
 edly detained him because of his alleged links with insurgent groups. The All
 Manipur Students' Union petitioned the Guwahati High Court for Sanamacha's re-
 lease. The court ordered the army to produce the boy, but it has failed to do so and
 his whereabouts remain unknown.
 
 
 1894
 In August a retired Supreme Court Justice set up a People's Commission to inves-
 tigate the fate of persons who disappeared in Punjab, but it received little coopera-
 tion from state government authorities (see Section 4).
 Militants in Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast continued to use kidnapigs
 to sow terror, seek the release of detained comrades, and extort funds. Between Feb-
 ruary 17 and the end of April, there were 63 abductions carried out by suspected
 militants in Tripura, many for the purpose of extorting ransom money. In November
 1997, the Home Secretary reported that militants had engaged in 1900 kidnapings
 since 1989, and that 700 persons were released, 700 were killed, and the fate of 500
 was uncertain. There were no new developments in the case of the 1995 kidnaping
 of American, British, German, and Norwegian nationals.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, and confessions extracted by force are generally inadmis-
 sible in court. Nevertheless, torture is common throughout the country, and authori-
 ties often use torture during interrogations. In other instances, they torture detain-
 ees to extort money and sometimes as summary punishment.
 Although human rights organizations welcomed the Government's decision to ac-
 cede to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
 or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, they believe that its decision not to accept
 Articles 20, 21, and 22 of the Convention would effectively undermine the U.N.
 Human =tights Commission's ability to investigate allegations of torture once the
 Convention is ratified. In July the Home Minister told Parliament that "the ques-
 tion of ratifying the Convention is engaging the Government." By year's end, the
 Government had not ratified the Convention.
 In 1997 the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture reported that torture was prac-
 ticed -systematically by the security forces against persons in Jammu and Kashmir
 "in order to coerce them to confess to militant activity, to reveal information about
 suspected militants, or to inflict punishment for suspected support or sympathy with
 militants!' According to the Special Rapporteur, "on no occasion had information
 been made public regarding instances of action taken against security force person-
 nel in Jammu and Kashmir for acts of torture." As of December 1997, 55 cases of
 disappearance and custodial death were still pending against Border Security Force
 (BSF) personnel in Jammu and Kashnir. According to human rights organizations
 active in the state, 12 young men from Kurhama Ganderbal were arrested by per-
 sonnel of the Dogra regiment in July and taken to an army camp, where they were
 beaten severely and had a mixture of water and chili powder poured on their geni-
 tals. On June 12, personnel of the 19th Rashtriya Rifles arrested and severely tor-
 tured Shabir Ahmed Malik of Galmoona district, Kupwara. He was admitted to
 SMHS hospital,-Srinagar, following his release on June 13; examination revealed ex-
 tensive damage to internal organs. In May army personnel from Malangam
 Bandipora -district, Baramullah, invaded the home of Ghulam Rasool Bhat in
 Malangam and tortured Bhat and his wife Nisara. According to human rights
 groups, both were stripped and subjected to electric shocks and cigarette burns.
 Human rights activists maintain that there is a similar pattern of abuse by security
 forces in the northeast. Police atrocities against indigenous people include torture
 (see Section 5).
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions received responses from
 the Government to several inquiries. In the case of Purushottam Kumar and Monoj
 Kumar, who reportedly-died in police custody as a-result of torture, the Government
 stated that four police officers had been found guilty and that further investigations
 by the state police were under way. The Government denied wrongdoing by the po-
 lice in several other cases involving allegations of death from torture while in police
 custody, telling the Special Rapporteur that those in question had died of cardiac
 arrest or other illness, or-by mishap during, altercations with police. The Special
 Rapporteur also made new inquiries into allegations of extrajudicial executions dur-
 ing the year. The Special Rapporteur on Torture  noted that methods of torture in-
 cluded beating, rape, crushing the leg muscles with a wooden roller, burning with
 heated objects, and electric shocks. Because many alleged torture victims die in cus-
 tody, and others are afraid to speak out, there are few firsthand accounts, although
 the marks of torture have often been found on the bodies of deceased detainees. The
 U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Torture and on Extrajudicial Killings renewed their re-
 quests to visit Jammu and Kashmir to the Government in 1998, but they were not
 permitted to do so.
 The prevalence of torture by police-in- detention facilities throughout the country
 is borne out- by- the number of cases of deaths in police custody -(see Section l.a.).
 -Delhi's Tihar jail is notorious for mistreatment of-prisoners, with I of every 11 cus-
 todial deaths taking place there. Police and jailers- typically assault new prisoners
 for money and personal articles. In addition police commonly torture detainees dur-
 
 
 1895
 
 ing custodial interrogation. Although police officers are subject to prosecution for
 such offenses under Section 302 of the Penal Code, the Government often fails to
 hold them accountable. The NHRC has ordered a CBI investigation of the torture
 death of Delhi leather merchant Hari Shankar Pal, who was arrested along with
 five other persons and beaten by Hauz Kazi police on December 8, 1997. After 2
 days of abuse, police took Pal to the city's Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where he
 was pronounced dead on arrival. On April 26, three Tibetan hunger strikers were
 arrested and taken to a local hospital in New Delhi where they were forcibly iven
 intravenous fluids (see Section 2.b.). On August 24, 1997, Ramesh, a 14-year-ol bo
 from Chennai, was arrested by city police on suspicion of stealing a bicycle. Ramesh
 and his 12-year-old brother allegedly were chained together and beaten with wooden
 poles. The brother was released, but Ramesh's body was found on a nearby railway
 track later that evening. In March the Chennai High Court reprimanded the former
 Tamil Nadu chief secretary for having ignored an earlier NHRC directive to the
 state of Tamil Nadu to pay $125 compensation to a lawyer tortured by police in
 1994. In censuring the former chief secretary, the court ordered the state govern-
 ment to pay $375 in additional costs for the "irresponsible attitude adopted by the
 then-chief secretary."
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture stated in 1997 that torture victims or
 their relatives reportedly have had difficulty in filing complaints because police in
 Jammu and Kashmir were issued instructions not to open a case without permission
 from higher authorities. In addition, Section 7 of the Armed Forces (Jammu and
 Kashmir) Special Powers Act provides that unless approval is obtained from the
 central Government, no "prosecution, suit, or other legal proceeding shall be insti-
 tuted. . . against any person in respect of anything done or purported to be done
 in exercise of the powers of the Act. This provision reportedly allows the security
 forces to act with virtual impunity.
 In February newspapers reported a police attack on Gundupatti village, Tamil
 Nadu. According to these accounts, the villagers had decided to boycott the Lok
 Sabha elections to protest government negligence in providing essential services.
 Villagers allegedly detained and intimidated a local leader of the ruling Dravida
 Munnetra Kazhagarn (DMK) party who had come to the village to canvass votes.
 On February 26, a frce of some 200 poicemen entered the vlage and reportedly
 attacked unarmed persons with iron rods, destroyed property, and threw children
 into thorny bushes. A four-member team headed by the Tamil Nadu Home Sec-
 retary investigated, but its members could not agree on their findings. The National
 Commission for Women criticized the police for taking sides with a political faction,
 and recommended that steps be taken to punish those responsible. In Mumbai, the
 Police Commissioner announced in May that the police could use armed force "bullet
 for bullet" against gangsters in response to growing mafia style crime. Several "en-
 counter" deaths were reported in the city during the year (see Section l.a.). There
 also were incidents in which police beat journalists (see Section 2.a.) and demonstra-
 tors (see Section 2.b.).
 The rape of persons in custody is part of the broader pattern of custodial abuse.
 Limits placed on the arrest, search, and police custody of women appear effectively
 to limit the frequency of rape in custody, although it does occur on occasion. The
 NHRC received reports of only three cases of custodial rape between April 1, 1996
 and March 31, 1997. The 24-hour reporting requirement applies to custodial rape
 as well as custodial death. However, the requirement does not apply to rape bypo-
 licemen outside police stations. NGO's claim that rape by police, including custodial
 rape, is more common than NHRC figures indicate. Although evidence is lacking,
 a larger number appears credible, in light of other evidence of abusive behavior by
 police and the likelihood that many rapes go unreported due to a sense of shame.
 e National Commission for Women in July reported that it had sought an expla-
 nation from the Director General of Police, Hyderabad, as to why no action had been
 taken to investigate allegations that a police officer earlier had raped a 12-year-old
 girl. The Advocate General of Orissa, Indrajit Roy, was forced to step down in Au-
 gust, nearly 1 year after attempted rape charges were fied against him. The victim
 had gone to him seeking assistance in a dowry case against her husband (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Human rights activists allege that army personnel entered the village of Samoo,
 Kulgam district, Anantnag, in the early morning hours of May 25 and raped several
 of the village women. On June 27, members of the Special Operations Group are
 alleged to have gang-raped a 16-year-old girl in Hanjipora, Kupwar district. The
 army has initiated an inquiry into the alleged rape of two women by army personnel
 on June 16 in IPaikarkuchi, Nalbari district, Assam. In Manipur a soldier raped a
 pregnant woman on April 5. The assailant since has been court-martialed, convicted,
 and sentenced to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment. In Assam two army soldiers were
 
 
 1896
 
 tried on July 8 for the June 8 rape of a woman. Both were court-martialed, dis-
 missed from service, and sentenced to 10 years'in prison. In June, soldiers molested
 women in Sogam village, Kupwara district (see Section 1.g.).
 A pattern of rape by paramilitary personnel allegedly exists in Jammu and Kash-
 mir and the northeast (see Section 1.g.), but is not included in NHRC statistics be-
 cause it involves military forces.
 Militants used rape as a tactic to terrorize the populace (see Section 5).
 Prison conditions are severely overcrowded, and provision of food and medical care
 is inadequate.
 Prisons operate above capacity, because of thousands of trials awaiting hearings.
 In Calcutta, a 17-year-old girl was recently released after awaiting trial for 10
 years. Overcrowding in jails also is severe. Tihar jail, with a capacity of 3,300,
 houses 9,000 prisoners. The states are waiting for a national jail manual to facili-
 tate reform; however, aside from distributing financial aid to the states, the central
 Government has not initiated any standard reforms. The Prison Act of 1894 remains
 unamended. According to the South Asia Human Rights Documentation Center, in
 the poorest states, such as Bihar, where 265 stations have no lock-up facilities, the
 lack of prison infrastructure has led police to shackle prisoners to trees. An NHRC
 investigatory team visiting Meerut jail in Uttar Pradesh found some 3,000 inmates
 in a facility designed to hold 650. As a result of this and other jail visits, the NHRC
 has contracted for the preparation of a draft prison reform -bill to be submitted to
 the Government. The 700 deaths in judicial custody, occurring in a prison Ipopu-
 lation of approximately- 155,000, many of whom are held for years, include a large
 proportion of deaths from natural causes, in some casds aggravated by poor condi-
 tions in prisons. Deaths in police custody, which typically occur within hours or days
 of initial detention, more clearly imply violent abuse. The NHRC has no authority
 to investigate abuses by security forces directly, and security forces in Jammu and
 Kashmir and the northeast are not required to report custodial deaths to the Com-
 mission.
 With the exception of an agreement with the ICRC for visits to detention facilities
 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Government does not allow NGO's to monitor- prison
 conditions. However, 15 states and union territories have authorized the NHRC to
 conduct surprise check-ups on jails. Although custodial abuse is deeply rooted in po-
 lice practices, -increased press reporting and parliamentary questions provide evi-
 dence of growing public awareness of the problem. The NHRC has identified torture
 and deaths in detention as one of its priority concerns. It has also created a panel
 to conduct uniform medical check-ups, and to make recommendations to states for
 implementation.
 In addition to the 888 complaints of custodial death (700 in judicial custody and
 188 in police custody) and 3 cases of custodial rape received by the NHRC between
 April 1, 1996 and March 31, 1997, 1,643 complaints of other police excesses were
 filed with the NHRC. As a result of NHRC action during this period, criminal pros-
 ecutions have been brought against 144 police officials and 23 civilians and mone-
 tary compensation in amounts ranging from $1,250 to $3,750 has been rec-
 ommended for payment in 55 cases. In its annual report for the period, the NHRC
 remarked that more than half of the more than 20,000 complaints it received "relate
 to the conduct of the police."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-During the early 1980s, the Government
 implemented a variety of special security laws intended to help law enforcement au-
 thorities fight separatist insurgency. There were credible reports of widespread arbi-
 trary arrest and detention under these laws
 Although the law that had been subject to the most extensive abuse-the Terror-
 ist and Disruptive Practices (Prevention) Act (TADA)--lapsed in May 1995, 1,502
 persons previously arrested under the act continued to be held as of January 1, 1997
 in a number of states, according to the NHRC most recent report. A small number
 of arrests under TADA continued for crimes allegedly committed before the law
 lapsed. In 1997, the Government asserted that all TADA cases would be reviewed.
 However, few persons have been released as a result of government review of their
 cases. Criminal cases are proceeding against most of those still held under TADA,
 with more than 3,000 charged under other laws in addition to TADA. In 1996, the
 Supreme Court eased bail guidelines for persons accused under TADA, taking into
 account the large backlog of cases in special TADA courts. In reply to a question
 in the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly in 1997, the Government reported that
 15,826 people were detained under TADA in the state between 1990 and 1995.
 TADA courts use abridged procedures. For example, defense counsel is not per-
 mitted to see witnesses for the prosecution, who are kept behind screens while testi-
 fying in court. Also, confessions extracted under duress are permitted in evidence.
 
 
 1897
 
 On May 31, the Tamil Nadu state assembly passed a bill, the "Prevention of Ter-
 rorist Activities Act," which resurrects provisions of the lapsed TADA. The bill had
 not yet been signed into law by year's end. It provides for special courts to try of-
 fenses under the act, places the burden of proof at the bail stage on the accused,
 makes confessions to a police officer of the rank of superintendent of police admissi-
 ble as evidence, extends the period of remand from 15 to 60 days, and sets manda-
 tory sentences for terrorism-related offenses.
 The Constitution provides that detainees have the right to be informed of the
 grounds for arrest, to be represented by counsel, and, unless the person is held
 under a preventive detention law, to appear before a magistrate within 24 hours of
 arrest At this initial appearance, the accused either must be remanded for further
 investigation or released. The Supreme Court has upheld these prvisions. An ac-
 cused person must be informed of his right to bail at the time of arrest and may,
 unless he is held on a nonbailable offense, apply for bail at any time. The police
 must file a charge sheet within 60 to 90 days of arrest; if they fail to do so, court
 approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits preventive detention laws in the event of threats to pub-
 lic order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the length of deten-
 tion and for judicial review. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in the country (except Jammu and Kashmir) may de-
 tain suspects under NSA provisions. Under these provisions the authorities may de-
 tain a suspect without charge or trial as long as 1 year on loosely defined security
 9rounds   he state government must confirm the detention order, which is reviewed
 y an advisory board of three high court judges within 7 weeks of arrest. NSA de-
 tainees are permitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be informed
 of the grounds for detention within 5 days (10 to 15 days in exceptional cir-
 cumstances). According to the Government, 1,163 persons were being held under the
 NSA at the end of 1997 (latest statistics available). The NSA does not define "secu-
 rity risk." Human rights groups allege that preventive detention can be ordered and
 extended under the act purely on the opinion of the detaining authority. Such a sub-
 jective decision cannot be overturned by any court.
 The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1978 covers corresponding
 procedures for that state. Over half of the detainees in Jammu and Kashmir are
 held under the PSA. Jammu and Kashmir police stated that 514 persons were being
 held under the PSA at year's end.
 On November 27, 1997, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of
 the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) of 1958. In a representation made
 to the NHRC, the South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre (SAHRDC) as-
 serted that the aces powers were "too vast and sweeping and pose a grave threat
 to the fundamental rights and liberties of the citizenry of the (disturbed) areas cov-
 ered by the Act." The SAHRDC asserted that the powers granted authorities under
 section 3 of the act to declare any area to be a "disturbed area," and thus subject
 to the other provisions of the act, were too wide. Moreover, SAHRDC noted that sec-
 tion 4(a) of the act empowers any commissioned officer, warrant officer, noncommis-
 sioned officer or any other person of equivalent rank in the armed forces to "fire
 upon and otherwise use force, even to causing death" if he believes that it is nec-
 essary for the maintenance of law and order. Further, section 6 of the act states
 that "no prosecution, suit or other legal proceedings shall be instituted, except with
 the previous sanction of the central Government against any person in respect of
 anything done or purported to be done in exercise of powers conferred by this Act."
 The court system is overloaded. The result has been the detention of persons
 awaiting trial for periods longer than they would receive if convicted. Prisoners may
 be held for months or even years before obtaining a trial date. According to a reply
 to a parliamentary question in July 1994, more than 111,000 criminal cases were
 pending in the Allahabad High Court, the most serious case backlog in the country,
 of which nearly 29,000 caseshad been pending for 5 to 8 years. A statement to Par-
 liament in July 1996 indicated that criminal and civil cases pending before the
 country's high courts numbered nearly 2.9 million in 1995, roughly the same as in
 1994 but an increase from 2.65 million in 1993. According to the Union Home Min-
 istry, the total number of civil and criminal cases pending for 3 or more years in
 all courts throughout the country was 5,116,895 at year's end. In its most recent
 report, the NHC reported that nearly 80 percent of all prisoners held between
 April 1, 1996 and March 31, 1997 were so-called "under-trials," i.e., unconvicted re-
 mand prisoners awaiting the start or conclusion of their trials.
 In June 1997, Rongthong Kunley Doiji, a Bhutanese dissident, was placed in judi-
 cial custody pending review of an extradition request from the Government of Bhu-
 tan on charges that included political offenses as well as financial malfeasance. On
 
 
 1898
 June 12, Dorji was released on bail following the New Delhi High Court's decision
 to deny a government appeal and let stand a lower court's order to grant bail in
 the case. Doiji still awaits conclusion of his extradition hearing.
 On April 26, three Tibetans staging a hunger strike in an attempt to reinitiate
 talks on the Tibetan issue were arrested by New Delhi police and taken to a local
 hospital where they were given intravenous fluids by force. The three were arrested
 on charges of creating a public disorder and attempting to commit suicide. They sub-
 sequently were released and the charges were not pursued.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is an independent judiciary with strong con-
 stitutional safeguards. Under a Supreme Court ruling, the Chief Justice, in con-
 sultation with his colleagues, has a decisive voice in selecting judicial candidates.
 The President appoints judges, and they can serve up to the age of 62 on the state
 high courts and up to the age of 65 on the Supreme Court.
 Courts of first resort exist at the subdistrict and district levels. More serious cases
 and appeals are heard in state-level high courts and by the national-level Supreme
 Court, which also rules on constitutional questions. State governments appoint sub-
 district and district judicial magistrates. High court judges are appointed on the rec-
 ommendation of the Federal Law Ministry, with the advice of the Supreme Court,
 the High Court Chief Justice, and the chief minister of the state, usually from
 among district judges or lawyers practicing before the same courts. Supreme Court
 judges are appointed similarly from among high court-judges. The Chief Justice is
 selected on the basis of seniority.
 When legal procedures function normally, they generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from a bar that is fully independent of the Government.
 There are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases, but it al-
 lows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be-made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation. Sentences must be announced in public.
 Muslim personal status law governs many noncriminal matters involving Mus-
 lims-including family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government does not
 interfere in the personal status laws of the minority communities, with the result
 that personal status laws that discriminate against women are upheld.
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the judicial system barely functions due to threats by
 militants against judges, witnesses, and their family members; because of judicial
 tolerance o7the Government's heavy-handed antimilitant actions; and because of the
 frequent refusal by security forces to obey court orders. Courts there are not willing
 to hear cases involving terrorist crimes and fail to act expeditiously on habeas cor-
 pus cases, if they act at all. As a result, there have been no convictions of alleged
 terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir since before 1994, even though some militants
 have been in detention for years.
 In April the Supreme Court criticized the government of Kerala in a case involv-
 ing the harassment, of a foreign national accused of espionage. Miriam Rasheeda,
 a Maldivian citizen, was arrested in Trivandrum in 1994. The state government
 asked the CBI to take over the investigation in December 1994. The CBI found that
 there was no basis to the allegation of espionage and advised acquittal in 1996. A
 change of government occurred in the state in 1996 and the new Communist-led
 government reversed the decision of the previous, Congress-led government to grant
 investigative authority to the CBI, proposing instead to conduct its own investiga-
 tion. It was not until April that the original CBI finding was upheld and Rasheeda
 was released.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the
 police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay, but they must
 justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the
 offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special
 powers to search and arrest without a warrant.
 The government Enforcement Directorate (ED) searches, interrogates, and arrests
 thousands of business people and management professionals each year, often with-
 out search warrants. Ultimately, the ED convicts very few persons. In 1997, only
 28 persons out of thousands arrested were convicted, according to the Times of
 India.
 The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, includ-
 ing monitoring telephone conversations and intercepting personal mail, in case of
 public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquillity." Every state
 
 
 1899
 overnment has used these powers. The Union Government also uses the powers of
 e Indian Telegraph Act to wiretap phones and open mail. ,
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 fticts.--Government forces continue to commit serious violations of humanitarian
 law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Between 350,000 and 400,000
 army and paramilitary forces are deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. The Muslim
 majority population in the Kashmir Valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the
 security forces. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the
 Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, both passed in July 1990,
 security forces personnel have extraordinary powers, including authority to shoot
 suspected lawbreakers and those disturbing the peace, and to destroy structures
 suspected of harboring militants or arms.
 Civilian deaths caused by security forces appeared to diminish for the fifth con-
 secutive year in Jammu and Kashmir, although final statistics for 1998 were not
 available at year's end. This decrease apparently is due to press scrutiny and public
 criticism of abuses in previous years, increased training of military and paramilitary
 forces in humanitarian law, and greater sensitivity of commanders to rule of law
 issues. The improvement has taken the form of increased discipline and care in
 avoiding collateral civilian injuries and deaths (i.e., deaths in crossfire). The Union
 Home Ministry was unable to report how many such deaths occurred during the
 year, but reported that 84 such deaths occurredin Jammu and Kashmir in 1996-
 1997. The security forces have not abandoned the abduction and extrajudicial execu-
 tion of suspected militants, nor accepted accountability for these abuses. However,
 the inclination of many commanders to distance their units from such practices has
 led to reduced participation in them and a transfer of some of such actions to
 countermilitants.
 According to Kashmiri human rights groups, personnel of the 197th army field
 regiment fired on a group of villagers on August 20 in Prang Tehsil, Kangan dis-
 trict, Srinagar, killing one person and injuring four others. The villagers had been
 attending the funeral of a neighbor whose body had been returned to the village by
 police after his arrest on August 19; police interference in the funeral caused villag-
 ers to protest and led to the firing. On June 25, personnel of the 18th Garhwal umt
 opened fire indiscriminately on residential buildings in Sogam village, Kupwara dis-
 trict. According to human rights groups, soldiers of the same unit had earlier threat-
 ened to take revenge against the villagers for an earlier massacre of Hindu villagers
 by Kashmiri militants. After the firing, soldiers moved in to beat many of the villag-
 ers and molest many of the women. Finally, the soldiers reportedly set fire to some
 50 homes and prevented efforts to extinguish the blazes; 40 persons were injured
 in the attack.
 Government forces fired mortar and artillery shells across the Pakistani border
 in Kashmir, killing a number of persons. For example, on July 30, government
 troops fired mortars that killed 11 persons and wounded 20 others in the Pakistan-
 ruled part of Kashmir, according to press reports. Pakistan government forces fired
 mortar and artillery shells across the line of control into Jammu and Kashmir, kill-
 ing a number of persons. In an August 5 statement to Parliament, the Union De-
 fense Minister said that Pakistani firing across the line of control into Jammu and
 Kashmir on July 27 and 28 had killed 31 civilians and 16 members of the security
 forces, and wounded 77 civilians and 81 members of the security forces.
 Kashmiri militant groups also committed serious abuses. In addition to political
 killings and kidnapings of politicians and civilians (see Sections l.a. and 1.b.), ter-
 rorists engaged in extortion and carried out acts of random terror that killed hun-
 dreds of Kashmiris. Militants carried out several execution-style mass murders of
 Hindu villagers in Jammu and Kashmir. Terrorist acts by Kashmiri groups also
 have taken place outside Jammu and Kashmir. Many of the terrorists are not In-
 dian citizens, but are of Afghan, Pakistani and other nationalities. On January 25
 in Wandama, north of Srinagar, terrorists killed 23 persons from 4 Hindu families;
 the victims included 10 women and 4 children. The army accused the Harkat-ul-
 Ansar terrorist organization of the massacre. On March 17, NLFT militants killed
 4 persons from the Reang community at Debipur; on April 12, militants killed 2 per-
 sons at a police outpost and set fire to homes and shops in south Tripura. On April
 17 in Thub, Udhampur district, suspected militants massacred 26 Hindu villagers,
 including 2 women and 2 children. On May 4-5, militants killed 13 civilians in 2
 separate incidents near Poonch in Doda district. In Poonch district, Jammu, on May
 6, terrorists killed five family members in the midst of a funeral procession. On May
 16, militants killed seven persons in Binola Choura village, north of Jammu. On
 June 19 in Champnari village, Doda district, Kashhmir, militants attacked 2 mar-
 riage parties, killing 26 Hindu men; police blame the attack on the Hizbul-
 Mujahideen organization. On July 28, militants killed 16 Hindu villagers in 2 sepa-
 
 
 1900
 rate attacks in the villages of Channa and Sarwan, outside of Ishtwar, in Doda
 district. On March 22, six suspected militants killed three family members, set fire
 to a Hindu temple, and blew up a van in Punjab. In July Bodo Liberation Tiger
 Force militants killed 6 persons in a village at Tipkal reserve forest. On August 3
 in Chamba district, Himachal Pradesh, suspected militants executed 35 migrant
 road workers while they slept. On .August 4, gunmen killed 19 Muslim villagers, in-
 cluding 14 children and 2 women, ,in what the press reported as a feud between
 rival members of the Harkat-ul-Ansar. Clashes between the Bodos and the Santhals
 continue in Assam. On September 15, 50 persons were killed in a Bodo-Santhal
 clash in Kokrajhar district. On October 8, Bodo militants killed 13 persons in 4 dif-
 ferent villages in Darrang district.
 On January 11, a small bomb exploded near the U.S. consulate in Chennai, injur-
 ing four persons. The Al-Ummah militant organization claimed responsibility for the
 blast. On February 14, Muslim extremist groups retaliated for the November 1997
 killing of Muslims by police and Hindu rioters in Coimbatore with a series of bomb-
 ings there that took the lives of 68 persons and left at least 200 others injured (see
 Section 2.c.). Following the Coimbatore bombings on February 14, police recovered
 nearly 500 pounds of explosives in Chennai and defused additional bombs in
 Chennai and Coimbatore. On March 31, one person was killed in Panipat, Haryana,
 in the bombing of a New Delhi-bound passenger train. On May 23, National Youth
 Congress President Gulam Nabil Shaheen was injured seriously along with six oth-
 ers in a bomb blast in Srinagar. The Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility. On
 May 28, 4 persons were killed and 20 injured by an explosion during local elections
 'in West Bengal. ULFA insurgents destroyed an oil depot in Assam on August 11,
 causing $18 million in damage. On August 24, a bomb blast at the Guwahati,
 Assam, railway station killed 2 persons and seriously injured 10 others; ULFA
 claimed responsibility. On August 3, ULFA set off a remote-controlled device that
 killed three army personnel traveling by jeep in Nalbari district. On July 30, a bomb
 exploded in- the main market in Nalbari, killing nine; the Bodo Liberation Tiger
 Force claimed responsibility. On June 5, the BLTF blew up three bridges and
 brought railway and road traffic in the northeast to a standstill.
 Kashmiris continued to be caught.in the crossfire between militants on one side
 and security forces and countermilitants on the other. Unlike past years, however,
 there were no large-scale or prolonged clashes resulting in extensive loss of civilian
 life or property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeck and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and
 with some limitations they are exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a wide
 variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Newspapers and magazines regularly
 publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived government
 lapses.
 The Press Council of India is a statutory body of journalists, publishers, academ-
 ics, and politicians with a chairman appointed by the Government. Designed to be
 a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates complaints of irresponsible
 journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This code includes not publish-
 ing articles or details that might incite caste or communal violence. The Council
 publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes have broken the code of con-
 duct, but its findings, while noted by the press community, carry no legal weight.
 A draft freedom of information bill was forwarded to central ministries and depart-
 ments and state government administrations in January 1997; in late May 1997,
 the bill was forwarded to the cabinet secretary. If passed the bill would allow access
 to information held-by the central and state governments and by virtually every in-
 stitution or department "substantially" funded by the Government. Only records re-
 lating to national security and sovereignty and to issues covered by the Official Se-
 crets Act (OSA) would be exempt. At year's end, the bill had not passed. However,
 in May the Madhya Pradesh legislature passed a bill giving citizens the right to
 government information, regarding land records and other vital information, but ex-
 cluding information relating to national security and sovereignty and to topics cov-
 ered by the Official Secrets Act. During the year, the Tamil Nadu state government
 also passed a freedom of information bill.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. However, inter-
 national satellite television is widely distributed in middle class neighborhoods by
 cable and is gradually eroding the GovernmenVs monopoly on television.
 Under the Official Secrets Act, the Government may restrict publication of sen-
 sitive stories, but the Government sometimes interprets this broadly to suppress
 
 
 1901
 criticism of its policies. Human rights activists state that government pressure
 caused one national English-language daily to suppress some stories and to transfer
 a staff reporter. The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remains in effect
 in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the Act, a district magistrate may prohibit the press
 from publishing material resulting in "incitement to murder" or "ny act of violence."
 As punishment the act stipulates that the authorities may seize newspapers and
 printing presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar regularly pub-
 lish militant press releases attacking the Government and report in detail on al-
 leged human rights abuses. The authorities allowed foreign journalists to travel
 freely in Jammu and Kashmir, where they regularly spoke with militant leaders,
 and filed reports on government abuses.
 According to local human rights groups, members of the Special Operations Group
 of the Jammu and Kashmir police attacked and beat photojournalist Habibullah
 Naqash on June 5 inside the press enclave in Srinagar. In Punjab, the NHRC in
 July called for a CBI investigation into the 1992 abduction of journalist Avtar Singh
 Mander, who has not been seen since his disappearance in Jalandhar. Witnesses al-
 lege that police officials picked up Mander, a charge the police deny. A May 1994
 investigation by Punjab state authorities found that Mander had not been taken
 into custody, and no further effort was made by authorities to trace his where-
 abouts. In Assam the state government has attempted to quiet its critics by filing
 a number of "criminal defamation" charges against journalists. In April four
 Doordarshan employees who were covering Bodo-Santhal clashes were detained for
 allegedly inciting communal tension. Kanak Sen Deka, the editor of Dainik
 Agradoot (the highest circulation Assamese language daily) was arrested in a defa-
 mation case. Prakash Mahanta, a reporter for the Assamese-language daily Natoon
 Samoy, was attacked at his home, beaten, arrested, and held by police at Nagaon
 state police station. Press freedom campaigners allege that Mahanta's "crime" was
 to write an article detailing alleged campaign irregularities by the wife of Assam
 chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. According to news reports, the chief min-
 ister denied the charge and said that Prakash Mahanta had been involved in "anti-
 national" activities. In 1997, Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, editor of Natoon Samoy, was ar-
 rested by police in Nagaon on suspicion of having links with the militant ULFA.
 On February 28, approximately 50 armed persons attacked the office of the Tamil
 daily Dinamalar in Mad   , Tamil Nadu. The attackers hurled a gasoline bomb at
 the building, attacked the watchman, damaged property, and intimidated the staff.
 The attack occurred not long after the paper had criticized the ruling DMK party
 and made allegations that local results of the February-March parliamentary elec-
 tions had been rigged. The Tamil Nadu chief minister condemned the attack and
 ordered an investigation. In October, the Manipur state government announced
 curbs on the publication of insurgency-related news. The publication of insurgent's
 press releases, public invitations to slain militants' funerals, and calls to boycott Re-
 public Day and Independence Day functions were prohibited. Penalties for violating
 the prohibition included arrest and criminal prosecution of newspaper owners and
 editors and cancellation of newspapers' registration.
 A government censorship board reviews films before licensing them for distribu-
 tion. The board deletes material deemed offensive to public morals or communal
 sentiment. Producers of video news magazines also must submit their products to
 the board, which occasionally censors stories that portray the Government in an un-
 favorable light. The board's rulings may be appealed and overturned.
 Kashmiri groups threatened journalists and editors and even imposed temporary
 bans on some publications. In May and June in Mumbai, Hindu extremists stoned
 an art gallery and ransacked the apartment of painter M.F. Hussain, to protest the
 artist's depiction of a Hindu goddess in the nude in a 20-year-old painting entitled
 "Sita Rescued," which they found offensive. In April, also in Mumbai, Hindu extrem-
 ists surrounded a concert hall, preventing a performance by Pakistani singer
 Ghulam Ali.
 Citizens enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are empowered to accredit locally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respected this right
 in practice.
 The authorities sometimes require permits and notification prior to holding pa-
 rades or demonstrations, but local governments ordinarily respect the right to pro-
 test peacefully. At times of civil tension, the authorities may ban public assemblies
 or impose a curfew under the Criminal Procedure Code.
 Srinagar and other parts of Jammu and Kashmir occasionally came under curfew,
 but more often were affected by strikes called by the militants. The Kerala High
 
 
 1902
 Court ruled in July 1997 that "bandhs," or forced public closures, as opposed to
 demonstrations or rallies, forcibly interfered in the affairs of others, and thus rep-
 resented a violation of the constitutional right to assemble peaceably. Critics of the
 ruling say that the court overstepped its bounds by restricting the right to protest.
 In February Haryana police fired on a group of textile workers peacefully dem-
 onstrating outside the Pushupati Textile Mill in Dharuhera, Rewari district, and
 killed five persons. Labor leaders called on the state government to punish the po-
 lice officers responsible and to compensate victims' families. On April 26, New Delhi
 police forcibly removed three of six Tibetan hunger strikers from their protest site
 and took them to a local hospital where they were given intravenous fluids. In pro-
 test, a supporter of the strikers committed self-immolation on April 27 and later
 died of his injuries.
 The Constitution provides for the right to form associations, and the Government
 generally respected this right in practice.
 c. Freedom ofReligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. India is a secular state in which all
 faiths generally enjoy freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor any re-
 ligious group. There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians.
 Foreign missionaries generally can renew their visas, but since the mid-1960's the
 Government has refused to admit new resident foreign missionaries. Those who ar-
 rive now do so as tourists and stay for short periods. As of January 1993, there were
 1,923 registered foreign Christian missionaries. As in the past, state officials refused
 to issue permits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter some northeastern
 states. Tension between Hindus and Muslims continues to pose a challenge to the
 secular foundation of the state (see Section 5).
 During the year, there was a sharp increase in attacks against Christian commu-
 nities and Christian missionaries. According to' Indian human rights organizations,
 there were over 90 incidents, primarily of mob violence that took the form of the
 destruction of churches and religious property and violent attacks on Christian pil-
 grims and leaders. The National Minorities Commission initiated investigations into
 many of these cases (see Section 5).
 On occasion, Hindu-Muslim violence led to killings and a cycle of retaliation. For
 example, on November 30, 1997, police in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, incensed over
 the killing of a colleague by Muslim youths, joined forces with armed Hindu rioters;
 18 Muslims were killed in clashes with police. The People's Union for Civil Lib-
 erties, a prominent human rights organization, reported that police took advantage
 of the civil unrest to wreak vengeance on Muslim traders who had stopped paying
 them bribes. Houses and shops owned by Muslims were looted and set ablaze in full
 view of police; police and Hindu rioters hacked to death riot victims at the govern-
 ment hospital. In February Muslim militants retaliated for this incident with a se-
 ries of bombings in Coimbatore (see Section 1.g.).
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur for All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination
 Based on Religion or Belief published a report in February 1997 on his visit of De-
 cember 2-14, 1996, at the invitation of the Government. Having studied the situa-
 tion of the majority Hindus and minority Muslims, Christians, and Sikhs, the
 Rapporteur concluded that the country's constitutional and legislative protections of
 religious freedom contributed to religious tolerance in India, as did "a conception of
 secularism implying not the rejection of religion but equality for all religions." He
 warned, however, that tolerance was susceptible to attack by religious extremists
 (see Section 5).
 In July Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee told Parliament that he opposed a proposal
 by the Delhi Union Capital government to remove churches from a list of tax-ex-
 empt religious places because sacramental wine is served there. Vajpayee stated
 that the proposal was wrong and said that the Government was committed to pre-
 serving full religious freedom. The proposal subsequently was dropped.
 In October the Union Human Resource Development Minister floated a plan to
 "Indianize and spiritualize" public school curriculums at all levels and to make the
 study of Sanskrit compulsory from grade 3 through grade 10. The plan also con-
 templatd the teaching of Hindu texts from the Vedas an dUpanishads in secondary
 school. The plan was withdrawn after protests from educators, most of the country's
 state Education Ministers, and many members of the public.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country except in cer-
 tain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are required. Under
 the Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engage outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India." The Government uses this provision to prohibit the
 
 
 1903
 foreign travel of some government critics, especially those advocating Sikh inde-
 pendence.
 Citizens may emigrate without restriction.
 Since 1990, 235,000 Bangladeshis have been deported from India, many from
 Maharashtra and West Bengal. In July the government of Maharashtra initiated a
 program of rounding up and deporting to Bangladesh suspected Bangladeshi illegal
 immigrants. According to press reports, on July 1 police in Mumbai began a system-
 atic campaign to remove suspected illegal Bangladeshis. Reports indicated that Ben-
 gali-speaking Muslims were rounded up for deportation, and that when some sus-
 pected illegals provided documentation of Indian citizenship, police declared them
 forgeries and tore up the documents. Manish Gupta, Chief Secretary of the govern-
 ment of West Bengal, admitted that at least 50 Indian citizens had been deported
 to Bangladesh in the last year. On July 24, as a train carrying deportees from
 Mumba passed through West Bengal on the way to Bangladesh, it was forced to
 halt by a large crowd that blocked the tracks and stormed the train. Mumbai police
 were assaulted and 34 deportees were set free. These events led the Maharashtra
 government to reassess its deportation policy, and subsequently to announce the
 suspension of new deportations until October. The Government estimates that there
 are 10 million Bangladeshis living illegally in the country.
 The law does not contain provisions for processing refugees/asylum seekers in ac-
 cordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 Protocol. The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the care of certain groups of refugees
 (notably Afghans, Iranians, Somalis, Burmese, and Sudanese), but not in the case
 of other groups, most notably the Sri Lankan Tamils to whose camps in Tamil Nadu
 the Government has barred access by the UNHCR and NGO's. India provides first
 asylum to refugees, most notably in recent years to Tibetan and Sri Lankan Tamil
 refugees. However, this policy is applied inconsistently. For example, the insistence
 of some border authorities on the presentation of passport and visas by those claim-
 ing refugee status occasionally has resulted in individuals or groups being refused
 admittance. This has occurred in recent years in cases involving Iranians who had
 transited Pakistan to enter India, and some Chin and Rakhine refugees from
 Burma. After initial reports by human rights groups that Jumma refugees feared
 repatriation to Bangladesh, members of this group willingly participated in their re-
 turn to the Chittagong Hill Tracts after the signing of a peace agreement between
 the Government of Bangladesh and the tribal insurgents ofthe Shanti Bahini in De-
 cember 1997; in all, about 43,000 Jumma refugees were repatriated. Refugees are
 not required to make claims in third countries. Cramped and unhygienic conditions
 are reported to exist in some of the camps for Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu.
 The Government recognizes certain groups, including Chakmas from Bangladesh,
 Tamils from Sri Lanka, and Tibetans, as refugees, and provides them with assist-
 ance in refugee camps or in resettlement areas. According to UNHCR and Govern-
 ment statistics, there were 98,000 Tibetans, 70,337 Sri Lankan Tamils in 131 camps
 and perhaps as many as 50,000 Sri Lankan Tamils outside of the camps, and 588
 Burmese refugees living in the country at year's end. Many Chakmas from Ban-
 gladesh have been repatriated voluntarily, including all of the estimated 56,000 who
 had been residing in Tripura. Some 80,000 Chakma permanent residents remain in
 Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram; their right to citizenship has been upheld by the
 Supreme Court. The UNHCR reports that 16,058 Afghans, 203 Iranians, 178 Soma-
 lis, 81 Sudanese, 44 Iraqis, and 4 Ethiopians were living as refugees in India and
 were receiving assistance from the UNHCR at year's end. Although the Government
 does not recognize formally persons these persons as refugees, it does not deport
 them. Instead, these people receive renewable residence permits or their status is
 ignored.
 There are ethnic Chins among nonrecognized refugees in the northeastern states,
 particularly Mizoram. They and Chakma refugees in the state have been the targets
 of student-led demonstrations protesting their presence in the state. Recent tensions
 between security forces and Chin National Force (CNF) insurgents operating in
 Burma allegedly have resulted in detention, interrogation, and expulsion of some
 persons associated with the CNF. In Manipur the Manipur underground attempted
 to impose a $3 "tax" on all non-Manipuris above the age of 12 as the price for con-
 tinued permission for them to live in the state.
 NGO's report refugee complaints about deteriorated housing, poor sanitation, de-
 layed dole payments, and inadequate medical care in the Tamil refugee camps. The
 Tamil Nadu state government, using central Government resources, provides shelter
 and subsidized food for those in the camps. Enforcement of a Tamil Nadu govern-
 ment ban on NGO assistance to the camps has been relaxed and NGO's have visited
 the camps. The NHRC has intervened to uphold the right of several Sri Lankan
 
 
 1904
 
 Tamils detained in so-called "special camps" to remain in India. The Government
 uses these camps to hold suspected members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
 Eelam (LTTE) terrorist organization.
 Mizoram human rights groups estimate that some 30,000 Reangs, a tribal group
 from Mizoram, displaced due to sectarian conflict, are presently sheltering in
 Tripura; conditions in their camps are poor and the Tripura state government has
 asked the central Government to allot funds for their care. There were no reports
 during the year of the forced return of persons to countries where they feared perse-
 cution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right freely. India has a democratic, parliamentary system
 of government with representatives elected in multiparty elections under universal
 adult suffrage. A parliament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elec-
 tions, except under constitutionally defined emergency situations. State govern-
 ments are elected at regular intervals except in states under President's Rule, i.e.,
 rule by the central Government.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 gency in any part of the national territory in the event of war, external aggression,
 or armed rebellion. Similarly, President's Rule may be declared in the event of a
 collapse of a state's constitutional machinery. The Supreme Court in May 1995
 upheld the Government's authority to suspend fundamental rights during an emer-
 gency. As of September, none of the 25 states was under President's Rule.
 President Narayanan dissolved the lower house of Parliament on December 4,
 1997, and elections were held in February and March. Some 374 million voters, or
 62.04 percent of the electorate, cast ballots. There were reports of election related
 violence in parts of the country, as well as localized allegations of voter fraud. How-
 ever, the Election Commission noted at the conclusion of voting that the election
 had been the most peaceful in recent memory. The new Government, a coalition of
 13 parties led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, took office under Prime Minister
 Vajpayee in March.
 There are no legal impediments to participation by women in the political process.
 A large proportion of women participate in voting throughout the country, and nu-
 merous women represent all major parties in the national and state legislatures.
 There are 61 women among the 790 Members of Parliament, including the deputy
 speaker of the upper house, and -there are 4 women in the 40-member Cabinet.
 However, only 4 percent of elected state assembly representatives are women, ac-
 cording to the National Commission for Women. The 1993 passage of the
 "Panchayati Raj" constitutional amendments reserved 30 percent of seats in elected
 village councils (Panchayats) for women. In July debate over the Women's Reserva-
 tion Bill, which was designed to reserve one-third of Parliamentary seats for women,
 subsided when the bill's formal introduction was prevented due to opposition from
 members of both the governing and the opposition parties. However, the Women's
 Reservation Bill was introduced in parliamentary sessions in November and Decem-
 ber despite strong opposition.
 The Constitution reserves seats in Parliament and state legislatures for "sched-
 uled tribes" and "scheduled castes" in proportion to their population (see Section 5).
 Indigenous people participate actively in national and local politics, but their impact
 depends on their numerical strength. In the northeastern states, indigenous people
 are a large proportion of the population and consequently exercise a dominant politi-
 cal influence in the political process. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, on the other
 hand, tribal peoples are a small minority and have been unsuccessful in blocking
 projects that they oppose.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude' Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations operate throughout most of the country
 investigating abuses and publishing their findings. Human rights activists in
 Jammu and Kashmir, however, have been unable to move around the state to docu-
 ment human rights violations due to fear of threats by countermilitants and security
 forces. Since 1992 several individuals closely involved in the documentation of viola-
 tions there, including lawyers and journalists, have been attacked and in some cases
 killed. International human rights groups have had difficulty in obtaining visas to
 visit India for research purposes. For example, the authorities denied a visa applica-
 tion by a Human Rights Watch researcher in March. Moreover, the police and secu-
 rity forces have targeted human rights monitors for arrest and harassment.

 No definitive resolution of the case of abducted and murdered Kashmir human
 rights activist Jalil Andrabi was reached. The army and other branches of the Gov-
 ernment have issued conflicting statements as to the responsibility of security forces
 in this death (see Sections L.a. and 1.b.). A warrant for the arrest of an army major
 has been issued in connection with the case. He reportedly resigned his commission
 shortly after the crime was committed and is now in custody, and the case was in
 progress at year's end. In Assam the investigation into the murder of human rights
 activist and journalist Parag Das has yielded no definitive information on the iden-
 tity of his killer. Das was killed in May 1996. The assailant was allegedly a militant
 who had previously surrendered and was supported by the Government. On June
 8, Special Operations Group personnel of the Jammu and Kashmir police arrested
 Ali Mohammad Sheikh, a researcher for a locally based human rights organization,
 in Dalgate, Srinagar. Sheikh initially was held at the Khanabal, Anantnag SOG
 camp and family members were denied permission to see him. Also in June, the
 state government of Andhra Pradesh issued a directive to faculty members of state
 universities not to associate with the Andhra Pradesh civil liberties committee
 (APCLC), a well-respected human rights organization. The state government pro-
 vided no explanation as to why it had taken this action.
 The Government appointed a National Human Rights Commission in October
 1993 with powers to investigate and to recommend policy changes, punishment, and
 compensation in cases of police abuse. In addition, the NHRC is directed to contrib-
 ute to the establishment, growth, and functioning of nongovernmental human rights
 organizations. The Government appoints the members and finances the operations
 of the NHRC. The NHRC is seriously understaffed and prohibited by statute from
 directly investigating allegations of abuse involving army and paramilitary forces.
 Between April 1, 1996 and March 31, 1997 (the most recent reporting year), the
 NHRC received 20,514 new complaints of human rights violations. At the end of
 that period, 4,010 complaints awaited consideration. Of the 16,823 cases considered
 during the year, 8,048 were dismissed; 2,272 were transmitted to other govern-
 mental authorities for disposition; 528 were concluded, and 5,975 were pending. In
 the preceding 12-month period (April 1, 1995-March 31, 1996), the Commission re-
 ceived 10,195 complaints. The increased number of complaints made to the Commis-
 sion in its most recent reporting year is thought to be the result of its increased
 visibility. That trend continued, and the Commission estimated that it would receive
 more than 70,000 complaints during its 1997-98 reporting year.
 On April 16, Human Rights Watch released a report based on the findings of an
 investigative team that it sent to the Singrauli region of central India to look into
 allegations that persons protesting the National Thermal Power Corporation
 (NTPC) project in Singrauli were harassed by police and NTPC officials. Human
 Rights Watch concluded that there was merit to these allegations. The NHRC also
 investigated these allegations and in February reported to Human Rights Watch
 that it had found them without foundation. In June the NHRC ordered the Chief
 Secretary of Kerala to furnish a report on the allegation that hundreds of families
 were about to be displaced to make way for a water supply project in Aluva and
 Kanayannoor. The NHRC is itself investigating a report that police in Karnataka
 attacked residents of eight villages in Channarayapatna Taluk, Karnataka on July
 20-21. The villagers reportedly were demanding compensation for crops lost to a
 nearby tunnel project.
 The NHRC has pursued the building of a culture of human rights by fostering
 human rights education in schools and universities, by offering support and encour-
 agement to human rights NGO's, by supporting training programs for the police,
 military forces, and paramilitary forces, and by making recommendations to the cen-
 tral and the state governments. During the year, the NHRC carried out, with the
 assistance of NGO's, a human rights training program, including stress counseling,
 for state police. The NHRC also has influenced the legislative process (particularly
 in advocating abolition of the TADA, by proposing prison reform legislation, and by
 advocating India's accession to the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment). State human rights com-
 missions have been established in West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, and
 Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir; Manipur and
 Uttar Pradesh have taken legal steps to set up commissions, but have yet to name
 members. In addition, special courts to hear human rights cases have been estab-
 lished in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.
 The NHRC also was involved in programs to eliminate child labor (see Section 6).
 The state human rights commission established in Jammu and Kashmir by act
 of the state legislature on May 30, 1997 has no power to investigate independently
 alleged human rights violations committed by members of the security forces. Credi-
 
 
 1906
 
 ble human rights activists state that the Jammu and Kashmir commission has not
 yet demonstrated effective, independent protection of human rights in the state.
 A People's Commission set up in August by retired Supreme Court Justice Kuldip
 Singh to bring to light the fate of more than 2,000 persons who "disappeared" dur-
 ing the period of political unrest in Punjab received little cooperation from state gov-
 ernment authorities.
 The prison visits program in Jammu and Kashmir by the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross, initiated in October 1995, continued in 1998. ICRC representa-
 tives also continued training police and border security force personnel in inter-
 national humanitarian law. In 1998, the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Torture and
 on Extrajudicial Execution renewed their requests -to the Government to visit
 Jammu and Kashmir, but the Government did not permit them to do so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 guage deeply divide society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination, there
 are other laws as well as social and cultural practices that have a profound discrimi-
 natory impact. According to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and
 Scheduled Tribes, caste clashes are frequent in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil
 Nadu.
 Women.-Domestic violence is common. According to a, 1996 survey in Uttar
 Pradesh, 30 percent of married men acknowledge physically abusing their wives.
 Dowry disputes are also a serious problem. In the typical dowry dispute, a groom's
 family members harass a woman they believe has not provided a sufficient dowry.
 This harassment sometimes ends in the woman's death, which family members
 often try to portray as a suicide or kitchen accident. Although most "dowry deaths"
 involve lower- and middle-class families, the phenomenon crosses both caste and re-
 ligious lines. The Government reported that 3,260 dowry deaths occurred during the
 year. Uttar Pradesh state has the most, with an average of 1,900 deaths per year,
 followed by Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar.
 Under a 1986 amendment to the Penal Code, the court must presume that the
 husband or the wife's in-laws are responsible for every unnatural death of a woman
 in the first 7 years of marriage-provided that harassment is proven. In such cases,
 police procedures require that an officer of deputy superintendent rank or above
 conduct the investigation and that a team of two or more doctors perform the post
 mortem procedures. According to human rights activists, in practice police do not
 consistently follow these procedures.
 The issue of rape has received greater political and social attention. At Rajasthan
 University campus, a double gang rape case in January received wide attention, and
 the media has been critical of the state government's failure to energetically inves-
 tigate the crimes. Raping women and parading them around a village is a tactic
 used by militants. The press consistently reports that such violence against women
 is increasing, although local women's organizations claim that there simply has
 been increased reporting. Only 10 percent of rape cases make it through the courts,
 and police typically fall to arrest rapists. The Advocate General of Orissa,, Indrajit
 Roy, was forced to step down in August, nearly 1 year after attempted rape charges
 were filed against him. The victim had gone to him seeking assistance in a dowry
 case against her husband. The February 27 rape of a Bangladeshi woman at Cal-
 cutta's main (Howrah) railway station by several railway employees and railway po-
 lice personnel led to major protests by women's groups throughout the city.
 On July 22, Home Minister L.K. Advani told Parliament that there had been
 14,341 cases of rape reported in 1997. At year's end, the Union Home Ministry re-
 ported that there had been 15,452 cases of rape reported in 1998. In 1995, the last
 year for which full statistics were available, 11,679 rapes were registered, along
 with 7,699 abductions, 3,994 dowry deaths, 23,615 cases of molestation, 4,449 cases
 of sexual harassment, and 23,242 cases of cruelty by husband or relatives. In 1996
 a total of 115,723 crimes against women were recorded, a figure that dropped to
 112,785 in 1997. Also in 1997, 678 cases of gang rape were recorded. Gang rapes
 often are committed as punishment for alleged adultery or as a means of coercion
 or revenge in rural property disputes and feuds.
 There is an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women, including the
 Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, the Sati (widow
 burning) Prevention Act, and the Dowry Prohibition Act. However, the Government
 often is unable to enforce these laws, especially in rural areas where traditions are
 deeply rooted.
 Prostitution is widespread, with an estimated 2.3 million prostitutes in the coun-
 try; some 575,000 of them are children. Many indigenous tribal women are forced
 
 
 1907
 into sexual exploitation. In Assam's Chars river islands, some women work in pros-
 titution for as little as 10 rupees. In 1998, prostitutes began to demand legal rights,
 licenses, and rehabilitation provisions, especially in Mumbai and New Delhi. In
 1997, Karnatka's government made sexual harassment a criminal offense.
 Women's rights organizations and NGO's estimate that more than 7,000 women
 and children are trafficked into the country annually from neighboring states for the
 sex trade. Within the country, women from economically depressed areas move into
 the sex trade in the cities. The number of women being trafficked out of India to
 other countries is comparatively small. In a study published in 1996, the National
 Commission for Women reported that organized crime plays a major role in the sex
 trafficking trade in the country and that women and children who are trafficked fre-
 quently are subjected to extortion, beatings, and rape. The law, notably the Immoral
 Traffic Prevention Act, makes such trafficking illegal. However, enforcement of the
 law is inadequate. In its 1996-97 annual report, the National Commission for
 Women stated that "The Immoral Traffic Prevention Act has not made any signifi-
 cant difference either in preventing or in suppressing the crime or rehabilitating the
 women. The police has failed to crack the mafia working at both the inter-state and
 international levels." The same report noted that there are 80 NGO's in 10 states
 around the country that are working for the emancipation and rehabilitation of
 women and children trafficked into the sex trade.
 Higher female mortality at all age levels, including female infanticide and gender
 selective abortion, accounts for an increase in the ratio of males to females to 107.9
 males per 100 females in 1991, from 104.7 males per 100 females in 1981, and from
 102.9 males per 100 females at the turn of the century.
 Literacy rates for women are significantly lower than for men; one recent study
 found that 38 percent of women were literate, compared to 66 percent of men.
 The personal status laws of the religious communities discriminate against
 women. Under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, a Christian woman may demand di-
 vorce only in the case of spousal abuse and in the case of certain categories of adul-
 tery; for a Christian man, adultery alone is sufficient. In May 1997, the Mumbai
 High Court recognized abuse alone as sufficient grounds for a Christian woman to
 obtain a divorce. Under Islamic law, a Muslim husband may divorce his wife sponta-
 neously and unilaterally; there is no such provision for women. Islamic law also al-
 lows a man to have up to four wives but prohibits polyandry.
 The Hindu Succession Act provides ecqual inheritance rights for Hindu women, but
 married daughters are seldom given a share in parental property. Islamic law recog-
 nizes a woman's right of inheritance but specifies that a daughter's share should
 be only one-half that of a son.
 Under tribal land systems, notably in Bihar, tribal women do not have the right
 to own land. Other laws relating to the ownership of assets and land accord women
 little control over land use, retention, or sale.
 There are thousands of grassroots organizations working for social justice and the
 economic advancement of women, in addition to the National Commission for
 Women. The Government usually supports these efforts, despite strong resistance
 from traditionally privileged groups.
 Children.-The Goverment does not provide compulsory, free, and universal pri-
 mary education, and oniy approximately 59 percent of children between the ages of
 5 and 14 attend school. There is a significant gender gap in school attendance, par-
 ticularly by secondary school. According to UNICEF, 59 percent of boys and 38 per-
 cent of girls were enrolled in secondary school. On taking office in March, the
 Bharatiya Janata Party-led government pledged to "implement the constitutional
 provision (article 45) of making primary education free and compulsory," and to do
 so, stated that it would increase gradually "Government and non-government"
 spending on education to 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The Govern-
 ment further pledged to present a "national charter for children," to "take measures
 to eliminate child labor," and to ensure that "no child remains illiterate, hungry, or
 lacks medical care." Budgetary allocations for this work have not been forthcoming,
 and little has been done to fulftil this pledge.
 There are an estimated 500,000 street children nationwide. Child prostitution oc-
 curs in the cities, and there are an estimated 575,00 child prostitutes nationwide.
 There is also a growing pattern of traffic in child prostitutes from Nepal. According
 to one estimate 5,000 to 7,000 children, mostly between the ages 10 and 18, are
 drawn into this traffic annually. According to an International Labor Organization
 estimate, 15 percent of India's estimated 2 million prostitutes are children. The traf-
 fic is largely controlled by organized crime. Corruption at the enforcement level and
 lack of government resolve to combat the problem tend to perpetuate it. A core
 group on child prostitution set up by the NHRC and comprised of representatives
 from the National Commission for Women, the Department of Women and Child De-
 
 
 1908
 
 velopment, NGO's and UNICEF continued to meet throughout the year to devise
 means of improving enforcement of legal prohibitions.
 Runaway children, especially in larger cities, are at high risk for sexually trans-
 mitted diseases and HIV. They work 18 to 20 hour days and suffer sexual and men-
 tal abuse: Many children also suffer abuse at school, specifically beatings by teach-
 ers. In Maharashtra 23 students walked 66 kilometers to the Tribal Development
 Commission to complain about their poor facilities, including bad food and the ab-
 sence of school uniforms.
 In its most recent annual report, the NHRC detailed its efforts to examine condi-
 tions in juvenile homes and to recommend improvements. The Commission also
 issued directions to all state governments to report within 24 hours of occurrence
 any instance of death or rape in such institutions. The Commission reported that
 it had taken this initiative following receipt of reports of the death of a young boy
 in such a home in Delhi in early 1996.  -
 The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act of 1929, as amended in 1978, pro-
 hibits child marriage, a traditional practice in northern India. The act raised the
 age of marriage for girls to 18 from 15, but the Government does not enforce it effec-
 tively. According to one report, 50 percent of the gis in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar
 Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh are married at or before age 16. The Union Home
 Ministry reported that just 21 cases were registered under the Child Marriage Re-
 straint (Amendment) Act during the year. On April 29, a large number of child mar-
 riages took place in several villages in Rajasthan, prompig an investigation by the
 National Human Rights Commission. In addition, the NHRC, in consultation with
 the National Commission for Women and the Department of Women and Child De-
 velopment, recommended that a new draft "marriage bill" be enacted to strengthen
 the prohibitions of the 1929 act. The NHRC, in its 1996-1997 report,,criticized the
 then-government for rejecting this suggestion, a response that the Commission con-
 cluded amounted, "essentially, to a total disinclination to strengthen or alter the
 law, in any respect,. or indeed to see to its better implementation in any manner.
 The traditional preference for male children continues. Although a law passed in
 September 1994 prohibits the use of amniocentesis and sonogram tests for sex deter-
 mination, the tests are widely misused for this purpose, and termination of a dis-
 proportionate number of pregnancies with female fetuses occurs. -In the 10 years
 since the southern state of Maharashtra passed a law banning the use of such tests
 for sex determination, the state government has filed charges against one doctor;
 he was acquitted. Human rights groups estimate that at least 10,000 cases of female
 infanticide occur yearly, primarily in poor rural areas. Parts of Tamil Nadu
 (Dharmapuri, Salem, and Madurai districts) still have high rates of female infan-
 ticide. According to statistics compiled by the Dharmapuri office of the Directorate
 of Health Services, 1,260 female infants were killed in the district in 1997. Police
 have not investigated these cases. The Tamil Nadu Human Rights Commission has
 suggested creation of a separate mandatory police investigation into death of every
 female infant. In addition, parents often give priority in health care and nutrition
 to male infants. Women's rights groups point out that the burden of providing girls
 with an adequate dowry is one factor that makes daughters less desirable. Although
 abetting or taking dowry is theoretically illegal under the Dowry Prohibition Act of
 1961, it still is practiced widely.
 The Government continued previous governments' efforts initiated in 1994 to pass
 more laws banning child labor and to enhance the enforcement of existing laws. The
 Government's program to eliminate child labor is aimed at progressively withdraw-
 ing children from the workplace in hazardous industries and placing them in schools
 through initiatives in education, rural development, woman and child development,
 health, and labor programs. Government efforts to eliminate child labor have
 touched only a small fraction of children in the work place. The Bharatiya Janata
 Party-led government did not renew the pledge of the previous government to elimi-
 nate child labor by 2010. A 1996 Supreme Court decision raised penalties for em-
 ployers of children in hazardous industries and established a welfare fund for for-
 merly employed children (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Ministry of Welfare has principal responsibility for
 programs for the disabled, and it delivers comprehensive rehabilitation services to
 the rural population through 16 district centers. A national rehabilitation plan com-
 mits the Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each of more than 400
 districts, but services still are concentrated in urban areas. The Government re-
 serves 3 percent of positions in official offices and state-owned enterprises for people
 with visual,, hearing, or orthopedic disabilities. The Government provides special
 railway fares, education allowances, scholarships, customs exemptions, and rehabili-
 tation training to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation or otherwise
 
 
 1909
 mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled. In June activists held a work-
 shop in Delhi on changing the city's architecture to ensure equal access to roads and
 public facilities. Save the Children facilitated an international conference in Agra
 in March to discuss integrating disabled children into the educational mainstream.
 The National Human Rights Commission continued its efforts to improve condi-
 tions in mental hospitals and enhance awareness of the rights of those with mental
 disabilities during the year. In 1997 it commissioned an assessment of conditions
 at mental hospitals throughout the country, to be conducted by the National Insti-
 tute of Mental Health and Neuroscience. The rights of the mentally ill and mentally
 retarded are protected by the Constitution and the Mental Health Act of 1987. The
 NHRC noted, however, that despite these protections, conditions in many mental
 hospitals "are far from satisfactory. They continue to embody old concepts of mental
 health care and function essentially as custodial rather than therapeutic institu-
 tions. Overcrowded and serving as 'dumping grounds' by desperate relatives, some
 of them lack even basic amenities and have poor medical facilities."
 Indigenous People.-The Innerline Regulations enacted by the British in 1873 still
 provide the basis for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of the
 northeast. They are in effect in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and
 Mizoram, but not in Tripura, where the tribal population has been reduced to 30
 percent of the total population due to increased Bengali migration since partition.
 These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other states, from
 going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber, wax, ivory, or
 other forest products may be removed from the protected areas without prior au-
 thorization. No outsiders are allowed to own land in the tribal areas without ap-
 proval from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 often are ignored. Indigenous people suffer discrimination and harassment, have
 been deprived wrongly of their land, and have been subject to torture and to arbi-
 trary arrest. There has been encroachment on tribal land in almost all the states
 of eastern India, including by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and by busi-
 nesses that have removed forest and mineral products without authorization. More-
 over, persons from other backgrounds often usurp places reserved for members of
 tribes and lower castes in national education institutions. Mob lynchings, arson, and
 police atrocities against tribal people occur in many states. In Khandwa, Madhya
 radesh, a group of tribal youths have complained of impotency caused by police tor-
 ture and electric shocks.
 Such violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding protec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand Movement in Bihar and Orissa,
 and the Bodo movement in Assam, reflect deep economic and social grievances
 among indigenous people. In the Jharkhand area, tribal people complain that they
 have been relegated to unskilled mining jobs, 'have lost their forests to industrial
 construction, and have been displaced by development projects. The Government
 has considered the creation of an independent Jharkand state, but the affected state
 governments oppose the idea.
 However, there is some local autonomy in the northeast. In Meghalaya tribal
 chiefs still wield influence in certain villages. The Nagaland government controls
 the rights to certain mineral resources, and autonomous district councils in Tripura,
 Assam, and Meghalaya control matters such as education, rural development, and
 forestry in cooperation with the state governors.
 The 1991 census, the last conducted, showed that 8.08 percent of citizens belonged
 to scheduled tribes. According to the Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal
 People (ICITP), 80 percent of the tribal population lives below the poverty line. The
 NHRC in May set up a panel to look into the condition of the country's 20 million
 denotifled tribal people. These are tribal people who, in 1871, were labeled by the
 British colonial power as belonging to "criminal tribes." The Colonial Act listing
 these tribes was repealed in 1951, but the stigma remains and many of these tribal
 people still are actively discriminated against. According to the ICITP, more than
 40,000 tribal women, mainly from Orissa and Bihar, have been forced into economic
 and sexual exploitation; many come from tribes driven off the land by national park
 schemes. Special courts to hear complaints of atrocities committed against tribal
 people were to have been set up under the protection of civil rights act of 1976, but
 this has not been done.
 Religious Minorities.-Controversy between Hindus and Muslims continues with
 regard to three sites where mosques were built centuries ago on sites where temples
 are believed to have stood previously. The potential for renewed Hindu-Muslim vio-
 lence remains considerable. In February the Sri Krishna Commission, set up by the
 Government to inquire into the cause of Hindu-Muslim riots in Mumbai in Decem-
 ber 1992 and January 1993, released its report. The riots, which followed the de-
 
 
 1910
 
 struction of an historic mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992, left more than 1,000
 people, mostly Muslims, dead. Maharashtra's Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena
 ruling coalition rejected the report, which laid responsibility for much of the violence
 on leaders of both of those parties. Several Muslim organizations have requested
 that the Supreme Court reverse the Maharashtra government's rejection of the re-
 port. On June 5, Hindu-Muslim -clashes occurred in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh,
 following the distribution of leaflets that "hurt religious sentiment," according to the
 press. More than 30 persons were injured in the violence.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 cused or convicted of crimes. While specifically designed to deal with Sikh places
 of worship in the Punjab, the law applies to all religious sites. In western India,
 Hindu extremists set fire to Muslim shops and forced Muslims to-flee their homes
 in retaliation for the intermarriage of Muslim men and Hindu women, and the al-
 leged forced conversion of Hindu women to Islam.
 Fear of political violence drove most Hindus in the Kashmir Valley (Pandits) to
 seek refuge in camps in Jammu or with relatives in New Delhi or elsewhere. The
 Pandit community criticizes bleak 'conditions in the camps and fears that a nego-
 tiated solution giving greater autonomy to the Muslim majority might threaten its
 own survival in Jammu and Kashmir as a culturally and historically distinctive
 group. Throughout the year, separatist militants in Jammu and Kashmir targeted
 members of the state's remaining Hindu community with violence (see Section l.a.).
 In his report on his 1996 visit, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for All Forms of Intoler-
 ance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief cited- the "traumatic situa-
 tions" in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab, as well as intercommunal rioting in
 Mumbai and incidents of religious extremism. The Special Rapporteur warned that
 the country's tradition of religious tolerance is susceptible to attack by religious ex-
 tremists (see Section 2.c.).
 There were several attacks by violent Hindu extremists on Christian communities
 and Christian missionaries during the year. Commenting on the phenomenon, a
 member of the National Minorities Commission told the press that "in the past year,
 we've got many more complaints regarding attacks on the Christian community and
 encroachment on church properties. There is a definite trend." Such attacks oc-
 curred in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Gujarat. The press re-
 ported the following incidents: In December 1997 and January 1998 in Ahwa-Dang,
 Gujarat, there was a series of attacks on Christian tribal people allegedly carried
 out by the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad. On January 6 in Bangaon, Bihar, Vilian
 Topno, a priest, was attacked and seriously injured. His assailants were never iden-
 tified. In February in Hansi, Haryana, a 200-year-old Christian cemetery was occu-
 p ied and a tomb was damaged. On February 15, in Latur, Maharashtra, a Catholic
 Hospital Association of India camp was attacked, allegedly by members of the
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu extremist organization. On March
 13, in Khanvel, Dadra, and Nagar Haveli, Holi revellers attacked Christian pil-
 grims. On April 3, in Baroda, Gujarat, a Christian convention held on the polo
 grouds was attacked. In April in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, Gipson's Central Bap-
 tist Church was threatened with demolition, allegedly by members of the Vishwa
 Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu religious organization affiliated with the RSS. On
 April 11, in Palanpur, Gujarat, worshipers at a prayer meeting were attacked. On
 April 16, in Naroda, Gujarat, a 200-member mob allegedly led by activists of the
 Bajrang Dal, a Hindu extremist organization, demolished a chapel. On May 5 in
 Koshippilly, Kerala, the Little Flower Church was vandalized and a crucifix dese-
 crated.
 Christian groups in India reported a number of other incidents later in the year.
 For example, on September 23, four Catholic nuns in Jabhua, Madhya Pradesh,
 were victims of a gang rape. Also on September 23, a Catholic priest was attacked
 by a crowd led by a local politician belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party in
 Jhamli, Madhya Pradesh. On September 26, members of three extremist Hindu or-
 ganizations broke into the Union Church in Amaun, Uttar Pradesh, and placed a
 statute of the Hindu god Shiva in the church. On September 30, the Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad publicly warned Christian missionaries to leave
 India. On October 16, a gathering in a prayer hall in Kumbale village, Nasik,
 Maharashtra was attacked by armed assailants and the prayer hall was demolished.
 On October 30, delegates attending the National Christian Conference in Baroda,
 Gujarat were attacked and beaten with belts, chains, and sticks. On November 4,
 a group of unidentified assailants attempted to set fire to -a church in Borigautha
 iage,iDans district, Gujarat. On November 5, a church was burned down in
 Gadhavi village, Gujarat. On November 9 in Kheda Khummar village, Haryana, as-
 -sailants broke into a Catholic covenant and threatened 2 nuns. On November 12,
 
 
 1911
 a church was burned down in Kamath village, Gujarat. On November 14, a church
 was burned down in Lahanchariya village, Gujarat. On November 22 in Kulai,
 Karnatka, a Christian prayer service was at St. Thomas Evangelical Church of
 India was attacked by approximately 40 armed persons; the pastor and several wor-
 shipers were beaten. The Union government reacted with statements criticizing the
 violence against Christians, but efforts to prevent such incidents from occurring and
 to prosecute those responsible at the state and local levels were inadequate. In some
 instances, local police and government officials abetted the violence. Other violence
 included attacks on convents in Baghpat and West Bengal; the demolition of a chap-
 el in Malad; Bible burning in Rajkot; disruption of Christian prayer meetings in
 Baroda and Rajkot; the burning of a church in Nasik, Maharashtra; and the exhu-
 mation of a Christian grave in Kapdwanj. Priests and nuns also have been killed
 in Bihar.
 At year's end, a wave of apparently organized attacks against Christians began.
 On December 25, 12 armed members of the Hindu extremist Bajrang Dal organiza-
 tion accosted 1,000 persons attending a dance at the St. Francis school in Borivili,
 Bombay; several of the assailants were detained by police and later released. Also
 on December 25, three members of the Christian community in Ahwa, Dangs dis-
 trict, Gujarat, were attacked and seriously injured by members of the Hindu
 Dharmajagaran Manch organization. On December 25, assailants set fire to several
 vehicles in the parking lot of the Seventh Day Adventist church in Subir village,
 Gujarat, while worshippers were inside. During Christmas week in Ahmedabad, Gu-
 jarat, members of the Shiv Sena political party attempted to disrupt local Christian
 observance of Christmas by decorating Christian neighborhoods with Hindu symbols
 and directing shop owners in commercial districts to remove Christmas decorations.
 On December 26, approximately 30 members of the Hindu extremist Bajrang Dal
 organization attacked the Navjyot school in Subir village, Gujarat, setting fire to a
 jeep and a motorcycle on the premises and assaulting the school principal.
 On Dember 4, Christians staged a nationwide protest agalnst the recent wave
 of attacks. In New Delhi, six thousand protesters marched on Parliament and de-
 manded that the Government intervene with Hindu groups that are allegedly be-
 hind the attacks. In Gujarat, the state government threatened to cease giving ad
 to educational institutions that closed to observe the protest; there were no reports
 that the state government carried out this threat.
 Hindu Daits lose their minority status upon conversion to Christianity, but not
 upon conversion to Buddhism or Sikhism.
 In July the government of Maharashtra initiated a program  of rounding up and
 deporting to Bangladesh suspected Bangladeshi illegal immigrants. According to
 press reports, on July 1 police in Mumbal began a systematic campaign to remove
 suspected illegal Bangladeshis. Reports indicated that Bengali-speaking Muslims
 were rounded up for deportion; and that when some suspected illegals provided
 documentation of Indian citizenship, police declared them forgeries and tore up the
 documents. Manish Gupta, Chief Secretary of the government of West Bengal, ad-
 mitted that at least 50 Indian citizens had been deported to Bangladesh in the last
 year (see Section 2.d.). A case currently is pending in the Bombay High Court which
 claims that these actions were taken in contravention of the law.
 National/Racial IEthnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specify historically disadvantaged castes and tribes, which are entitled to af-
 firmative action in employment and other benefits. These "scheduled" castes and
 tribes benefit from special development funds, government hiring quoteas, and spe-
 cial training programs. According to the 1991 census, scheduled castes made up 16
 percent and scheduled tribes 8 percent of the country's 1991 population of 846 mil-
 lion.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 specifies new offenses against disadvantaged people and provides stiffer penalties
 for offenders. However, this act has had oniy a modest effect in curbing abuse. The
 Union Home Ministry reported that 14,109 crimes against scheduled castes and
 2,413 crimes against scheduled tribes were recorded during 1998. This represents
 a significant decrease from the 20,312 crimes against scheduled castes and 3,193
 crimes against scheduled tribes recorded in 1997.
 The practice of untouchability was outlawed in theory by the Constitution and the
 1955 Civil Rights Act, but it remains an important aspect of life. Intercaste violence
 claims hundreds of lives each year it was particularly pronounced in Uttar Pradesh,
 Bihar, and Tamil Nadu states.
 In Bihar violence spilled over in the early part of the year from the December 1,
 1997 massacre of 63 Dalits (formerly "untouchables") in Lakshmanpur Bathe village
 by the Ranvir Sena, a militia controlled by high-caste landlords. There were reports
 that five teenage girls were raped and mutilated before being killed in the attack.
 
 
 1912
 
 On January 9, members of a violent left-wing organization, the Communist Party
 of India-Marxist-Leninist (Liberation), killed nine persons belonging to the upper-
 caste Bhumihar and Brahmin community of Rampur-Chauram village, Jahanabad
 district, in apparent retaliation for the Lakshmanpur Bathe killings. More than 60
 people died in caste-related violence in the state during the first 9 months of 1998.
 On February 26 in Gundupatti, Tamil Nadu, police and other armed persons at-
 tacked Dalits and bonded laborers in two villages in Kukool Panchayat. Homes were
 looted and destroyed in the incident, which was apparently carried out in retaliation
 for the villagers' boycott of national elections. In Andhra Pradesh, the NHRC
 launched an investigation into the killing of at least eight Dalit villagers in
 Vempenta village, Kurnool district on July 16. In a complaint filed with the NHRC,
 Human Rights Watch alleged that the murders were carried out by high-caste land-
 lords of a neighboring village in the belief that the Vempenta villagers were sympa-
 thetic to the People's War Group, a radical Marxist-Leninist organization. In Feb-
 ruary the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes warned
 that increasing caste violence could force Dalits into militancy. "Whenever Dalits
 have tried to organize themselves or assert their rights, there has been a backlash
 from the feudal lords resulting in mass killings of Dalits, gang rapes, looting and
 arson," the Commission wrote.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion. Workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. There are five major recognized national trade union centrals, each of
 which is associated with, but not necessarily controlled by, a political party. Some
 15 to 20 percent of the approximately 28 million persons employed in the so-called
 "organized sector," that is, "all public sector and non-agricultural establishments
 employing more than 10 people," according to government definition, belong to
 unions. The vast majority of the country's approximately 397.2 million workers are
 employed in the "informal," i.e., not the "organized," sector.
 Trade unions often exercise the right to strike, but public sector unions are re-
 quired to give at least 16 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws re-
 quiring workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to give prior strike notice.
 The Essential Services Maintenance Act allows the Government to ban strikes
 and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries. Legal mech-
 anisms exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope
 of this act. The Industrial Disputes Act prohibits retribution by employers against
 employees involved in legal strike actions. This prohibition is observed in practice.
 When abuses, such as intimidation or suppression of legitimate trade union activi-
 ties, are perpetrated against nationally organized or other large-scale unions or
 unionized workers, civil authorities generally respond by prosecuting and punishing
 those responsible. Unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers are not able,
 in all instances, to secure for themselves the protections and rights provided by law.
 However, six men were convicted in June on charges related to the 1991 killing of
 tribal union leader Shankar Guha Niyogi. The gunman was sentenced to death,
 while industrialist Chandrakant Shah and four others received life sentences. On
 appeal, the Madhya Pradesh High Court released four of the six, including Shah.
 The Government is now considering whether to appeal the High Court judgment to
 the Supreme Court.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations. The In-
 dian National Trade Union Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, while the All India
 Trade Union Congress is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively has existed for decades. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against
 union members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they discrimi-
 nate against employees engaged in union activities.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in unionized plants in the organized industrial sector. Trade unions vigorously de-
 fend worker interests in this process. Although a system of specialized labor courts
 adjudicates labor disputes, there are long delays and a backlog of unresolved cases.
 When the parties are unable to agree on equitable wages, the Government may set
 up boards of union, management, and government representatives to determine
 them.
 In practice legal protections of worker rights are effective only for the 28 million
 workers in the organized industrial sector, out of a total work force of more than
 397.2 million. Outside the modern industrial sector, laws are difficult to enforce.
 
 
 1913
 
 Union membership is rare in the informal sector and collective bargaining does not
 exist.
 There are seven export processing zones (EPZ's). Entry into the EPZ's ordinarily
 is limited to the employees. Such entry restrictions apply to union organizers. While
 workers in the EPZ's have the right to organize and to bargain collectively, union
 activity is rare. In addition unions, content with their role in public sector enter-
 prises, have not pursued vigorously efforts to organize private-sector employees any-
 where in the years since EPZ's were established. Women constitute the bulk of the
 work force in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by both the Constitution and specific statute. Bonded labor, as a form of
 compulsory labor, also is prohibited by statute. The Bonded Labor System (Aboli-
 tion) Act of 1976 prohibits all bonded labor, by adults and children. Offenders may
 be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison, but prosecutions are rare. Enforcement of
 this statute, which is the responsibility of state governments, varies from state to
 state and has not been effective due to lack of adequate resources available to the
 government machinery and, to some extent, to societal acceptance. Estimates for the
 number of bonded laborers range as high as 5 million; an unknown number of these
 bonded laborers are children.
 A Supreme Court decision defined forced labor as work at less than the minimum
 wage, which is usually set by the state governments. Under this definition, which
 differs from that of the International Labor Organization (ILO), forced labor is wide-
 spread, especially in rural areas.
 Bonded labor, the result of a private contractual relationship whereby a worker
 incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt plus inter-
 est, is illegal but widespread. The Government estimates that between enactment
 of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31, 1993,
 251,424 bonded workers were released from their obligations. Other sources main-
 tain that those released constituted only one-twentieth of the total number of bond-
 ed laborers. State governments are responsible for enforcing the act. In February
 1997 the Supreme Court required state governments to file detailed affidavits on
 the status of bonded labor. Some press reports indicate that Tamil Nadu alone has
 an estimated 25,800 bonded laborers, in response to which the state government is
 working on rehabilitation plans. It has allocated $1.25 million for these plans.
 The situation of some domestics and some children in the workplace amounts to
 bonded labor. Children sent from their homes to work because their parents cannot
 afford to feed them, or in order to pay off a debt incurred by a parent or relative,
 have little choice in the matter. There are no universally accepted figures for the
 number of bonded child laborers. However, in the carpet industry alone, human
 rights organizations estimate that there may be as many as 300,000 children work-
 ing, many of them under conditions that amount to bonded labor. A press report
 in June stated that parents in Orissa allegedly are selling their children to "contrac-
 tors" for $20 to $38. The children reportedly have been sent tb work as servants
 in the states of Gujarat and Kerala. Officials claim that they cannot stop this traffic
 because the children are going with their parents' consent.
 Female bondage, forced prostitution, and the trafficking of children for prostitu-
 tion are a problem (see Section 5). There were press reports that prison officials
 used prisoners as domestic servants, and that they sold female prisoners to brothels
 (see Section 1.c.). In Punjab, persons are sold in an organized trade in weekend ba-
 zaars for the purposes of forced domestic labor and forced sexual service. In April,
 one person was arrested in connection with this human trade. He was released later
 on bail.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Article 24
 of the Constitution and the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986
 are the principal protections from exploitation of children in the workplace. Provi-
 sions for the protection of children in the workplace also are made in the Beedi and
 Cigar Workers (Condition of Employment) Act of 1966, the Factories Act of 1948,
 the Mines Act of 1952, the Motor Transport Workers Act of 1961, the Plantations
 Labor Act of 1951, and the Minimum Wages Act of 1948. The Government prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this prohibition effectively
 (see Section 6.c.).
 The enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the state governments.
 Enforcement is inadequate, especially in the informal sector where most children
 who work are employed. The continuing prevalence of child labor may be attributed
 to social acceptance of the practice and to the failure of the state and federal govern-
 ments to make primary school education compulsory.
 Work by cmdren under 14 is completely barred in "hazardous" industries, which
 include passenger, goods, and mail transport by railway; carpet weaving; cinder
 
 
 1914
 picking, cleaning of ashpits; cement manufacturing; building and construction; cloth
 printing; dyeing and weaving;, manufacturing of matches, explosives, fireworks; ca-
 tering within railway premises or port limits; beedi (cigarette) making; mica cutting
 and splitting; abattoirs; wool cleaning; printing; cashew and cashew nut descaling
 and processing; and soldering processes in electronics industries. In July the Gov-
 ernment announced its intention to increase the number of industries and occupa-
 tions where child labor is prohibited from 18 to 54, and it completed -such action
 by year's end. -          I .
 Industries that utilize child labor include hand-knotted carpets, gemstone
 polishing, brass and base metal articles, glass and glassware, footwear, textiles, silk,
 and fireworks.
 In occupations and processes in which child labor is permitted, work by children
 is permissible only for 6 hours between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. with 1 day's weekly rest.
 Primary school education is not compulsory, free, and universal.
 Of a primary school-age population (between the ages of 5 and 14) of approxi-
 mately 203 million, about 120 million children attend school. No significant sectors
 or _gups actively are excluded, but the economic reality is that children of more
 well to do families are more likely to attend school than those of poor families. Ac-
 cording to a United Nations Development Program study conducted in 1993, the
 dropout rate from primary school was 34 percent.
 Estimates of the number of child laborers range widely. The government census
 of 1991 puts the number of child workers at 11.3 million. The ILO estimates the
 number at 44 million, while NGO's state that the figure is 55 million. Interpolation
 of census figures by the National Labor Institute indicates that of a total of 203 mil-
 lion children between the ages of 5 and 14, 116 million are in school; 12.6 million
 are in full-time employment, and the status of 74 million is unknown. Most, if not
 all, of the 87 million children not in school do housework, work on family farms,
 work alongside their parents as paid agricultural labor, work as domestic servants,
 or are otherwise employed.
 The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition Government has continued its prede-
 cessors' comprehensive plan to eliminate child labor from hazardous industries and
 eventually from all industries, but it has not repeated the previous government?s
 pledge to accomplish the first by 2000, and the second by 2010. This program, for
 which approximately $260 million has been budgeted, includes enhanced enforce-
 ment of child labor laws, income supplements for failies, subsidized school lunches
 in areas where child labor is concentrated, and a public awareness campaign. Rec-
 ognizing a need to ensure that primary education is made universal and compulsory
 by state governments, the Government has committed itself to fulfilling the con-
 stitutional directive (article 45) to provide free, universal, and compulsory primary
 education. It also has pledged to increase "Government and non-government' spend-
 ing on education to 6 percent of GDP. At present, about 59 percent of school-age
 children go to school.
 The-actual percentage of the union budget spent on education is approximately
 5.9 percent. The state governments also spend on education, but no comprehensive
 figure of combined federal-state expenditure is available. A 1993 study commis-
 sioned by the UNDP estimated that India as a whole (states and federal govern-
 ment) devoted about 3.7 percent of gross national product (GNP) to education. The
 NHRC, continuing its own child labor agenda, organized NGO programs to provide
 special schooling, rehabilitation, and family income supplements for children in the
 glass industry in Firozabad. The NHRC also intervened in individual cases. A De-
 cember 1996 Supreme Court decision imposed a penalty of about $570 (20,000 ru-
 pees) on an employer who violated constitutional and statutory prohibitions on the
 use of child labor in hazardous industries and ordered the creation of a child labor
 rehabilitation fund out of which parents and guardians would receive an income
 supplement payment on condition that the children removed from employment at-
 tend school. A survey of child labor throughout the country ordered by the Supreme
 Court in this judgment was completed during 1997 and documented the existence
 of some 150,000 wage-earning child laborers. However, this number understates the
 true dimension of the problem. The Government undertook a survey of children
 working in hazardous industries throughout the country, but by year's end the re-
 sults had not been released.
 According to Government estimates, inspectors in Uttar Pradesh conducted about
 50,000 inspections between 1993 and the end of 1997, releasing about 8,000 children
 from illegal workplaces and bringing charges against approximately 4,000 employ-
 ers. Since promulgation of the 1987 National Child Labor Policy, the Government
 has established 77 "rehabilitation" centers for the education and care of children re-
 moved from illegal workplaces"throughout the country. Some 200,000 to 250,000
 children have received care and schooling at these facilities, during which time their
 
 
 1915
 
 families have received a small stipend-usually $2.35 to $4.70 (Rs. 100 to Rs.200)
 monthly, at an estimated cost to the Government of approximately $17.68 million
 (Rs.750 million) per year. In the hand-knotted carpet producing area of Uttar
 Pradesh, the NHRC and NGO's have worked with the state government to establish
 a Task Force for the Elimination of Child Labor. Employers in some industries also
 have taken steps to combat child labor. The Carpet Export Promotion Council
 (CEPC), a quasi-governmental organization which receives funding from the Min-
 istry of Textiles, has a membership of 2,500 exporters who have subscribed to a code
 of conduct barring them from purchasing hand-knotted carpets known to have been
 produced with child labor. The CEPC conducts inspections to insure compliance, and
 allows members to use a government-originated label to signify adherence to the
 code of conduct. The Government also cooperates with UNICEF, UNESCO, the
 UNDP, and the ILO to eliminate child labor. Since 1992, it has participated in the
 ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). Through
 February, approximately 90,000 children were removed from work and received edu-
 cation and stipends through IPEC programs. NGO's also have helped to free chil-
 dren from the work force. The South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS) has
 freed over 34,000 children from the work force, and operates an education and train-
 ing center for children in New Delhi. Since November 1997, the SACCS and the
 NH-RC have freed 200 children and brought charges against several employers in
 eastern Uttar Pradesh
 On March 5, a pproximately 50 child marchers and adult organizers marched into
 India from Nepal to begin a 5-week long trek through India to publicize the plight
 of child laborers. They marched into Pakista n e April 13.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The directive principles of the Constitution de-
 clare that "the State shall endeavor to secure. ., to all workers. ., a living wage,
 conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure
 and social and cultural opportunities." Laws set minimum wages, hours of work,
 and safety and health standards. Laws governing minimum wages and hours of
 work generally are observed in industries subject to the Factories Act but are large-
 ly unenforced elsewhere a        e        cceptable conditions of work for the
 ninety percent of the work force not subject to the Factories Act.
 Minimum wages vary according to the state and to the sector of industry. Such
 wages provide only a minimal standard of living for a worker, and are inadequate
 to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most workers em-
 ployed in units subject to the Factories Act receive much more than minimum wage,
 including mandated bonuses and other benefits. The state governments set a sepa-
 rate minimum wage for agricultural workers but do not enforce it well.
 The Factories Act establishes an S-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards generally are enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sector, but tend not to be observed in older and
 less economically robust industries. State governments are responsible for enforce-
 ment of the Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered by a
 small cadre of factory inspectors and their limited traiinng and susceptibility to
 bribery result in lax enforcement.
 Enforcement of safety and health standards also is lax. Although occupational
 safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither state nor central Gov-
 ernment resources for inspection and enforcement of standards are adequate. Safety
 conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's. The law does not provide workers with
 the right to remove themselves from work situations that endanger health and safe-
 ty without jeopardizing their continued employment. The courts, however, have
 begun to take work-related illnesses more seriously.
