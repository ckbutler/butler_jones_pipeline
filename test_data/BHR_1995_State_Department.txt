 BAHIAIN
 Bahrain is a hereditary emirate with few democratic institutions and no political
 parties. The AI-Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th cen-
 tury and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir
 as hereditary ruler. The current Amir, Shaykh Isa Bin Suiman Al-Khalifa, governs
 Bahrain with the assistance of a younger brother, the Prime Minister; the Amir's
 son, the Crown Prince; and an appointed cabinet of ministers. In 1975 the Govern-
 ment suspended some provisions of Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those ar-
 ticles relating to the National Assembly, which the Government disbanded in the
 same year. There are few judicial checks on the actions of the Amir and his govern-
 ment. Social ties and interpereonal associations are important and are formed in a
 complex web of family, tribal, economic, and reliious affiliations. Bahrainis belong
 to the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over two-thirds of
 the indigenous population. There are important sectarian and ethnic divisions
 among the Shi'a. The Sunnis predominate because the ruling family is Sunni and
 is su pported by the armed forces, the security service, and powerful Sunni and Shi'a
 merant families.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. Under its auspices, the
 Public Security Force (police) and the extensive Security Service are responsible for
 maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) defends against ex-
 ternal military threats. It did not play an active role in internal security in 1995.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government domination of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 
 
 1129
 and natural gas reserves, Bahrain is intensifying efforts to diversify its economic
 base and has attracted companies doing business in banking, financial services, oil-
 field services, and light manufacturing. The Government has used its modest oil
 revenues to build an advanced transportation and telecommunications infrastruc-
 ture. Bahrain has become a regional financial and business center. Tourism, par-
 ticularly via the causeway linking Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, is also a significant
 source of income.
 The main human rights problems continue to include the denial of the right of
 citizens to change their government; the practice of arbitrary and incommunicado
 detention and involuntary exile; the use of torture; the absence of impartial inspec-
 tion of detention and prison facilities; restrictions on the right to a fair public trial,
 especially in the security court; and restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, assem-
 bly, association, and worker rights. Domestic violence against women is a problem.
 Governmental human rights abuses increased in 1995. The security forces com-
 mitted numerous serious abuses. In the first half of 1995, domestic unrest by Shi'a
 Muslim youths, committing hundreds of acts of arson, resulted in the deaths of 11
 people, including 7 demonstrators, 2 policemen, and 2 expatriate laborers, and the
 arrest of more than 2,700 people during that period, almost all for committing acts
 of violence during demonstrations. In keeping with tradition, on the March Eid Al-
 Fitr holiday the Government released by Amiri decree 175 prisoners, including sev-
 eral self-described political detainees. Another 2,000 were released during the course
 of the year. The Government rejected the demand of Shi'a demonstrators for a res-
 toration of the elected parliament.
 The appointive Consultative Council (Majlis Al-Shura), established by Amiri de-
 cree in 1992, completed its third session on May 29 and began its fourth session
 on October 1.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-While trying to control arson attacks
 and other civil disturbances during the first half of the year, police and security
 forces killed 7 demonstrators. In one case, the police may have beaten a boy to
 death. Four of the deaths occurred when police used force on crowds of
 antigovernment demonstrators. On January 12, an unidentified man was killed in
 the village of Diraz after police opened fire on demonstrators. On January 26, Hani
 Ali A1-Safi was shot and killed during a similar confrontation with police in the vil-
 lage of Sitra. Also on January 26, Abdul Ridha Mansur Al-Haiji died of injuries sus-
 tamed 10 days earlier in a demonstration that was broken up by police in the vil-
 lage of Bani Jamrah. An unidentified man was shot and killed by security forces
 during another demonstration in Bani Jamrah on April 1. On May 4, Nidal Habib
 Al-Nashabah reportedly was shot and killed by security forces during a demonstra-
 tion in Diraz. On May 24, a 10-year-old boy, Muhammad Shihab Al-Fardan, from
 the village of Karzakkan, died under suspicious circumstances. Opposition press re-
 leases claim that the boy was arrested, tortured, and killed by security forces. The
 Government, however, stated publicly that the boy died after falling from a building
 that was under construction. On July 9, a 15-year-old boy died in police custody re-
 portedly after being beaten during interrogation at the police station in the village
 of Khamis.
 To date, no police or security forces officials have been prosecuted for these of-
 fenses.
 Two police officers were killed by demonstrators. On March 22, Ibrahim Rashid
 Abdul Karim Al-Saidi was murdered by a group of prtestors near his home in the
 village of Nuwaidrat. A second policeman was killed in the village of Sitra in April
 when demonstrators threw a molotov cocktail into his vehicle.
 Two expatriate laborers were killed after being trapped in buildings that had been
 set ablaze by demonstrators.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment is prohibited by law.
 There are, however, credible reports of torture being used against prisoners. Local
 human rights activists report that prisoners routinely are beaten, both on the soles
 of their feet and about the face and head, burned with cigarettes, forced to endure
 long periods without sleep, and subjected to electric shock.
 The Government denies that torture takes place. However, it has not imple-
 mented minimal procedural safeguards, nor allowed inspection of detention facilities
 by impartial international organizations. The Government has difficulty in rebutting
 
 
 1130
 
 allegations of torture and of other cruel, inhuman, or degrading practices because
 it permits incommunicado detention and detention without trial.
 There were no known instances of authorities being punished for human rights
 abuses committed either in 1995 or in previous years.
 Although little is known about Bahrain's prisons, prison conditions do not appear
 to pose any threat to the health of those detained. The authorities severely restrict
 visits to inmates. Nonetheless, prisoners have regular. access to medical care and
 may receive visits from family members, usually once a month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the State Security Act of 1974,
 persons may be detained for up to 3 years without trial for engaging in activities
 or making statements regarded as a threat to the broadly defined concepts of na-
 tional harmony and security. Detainees have the right to appeal such detentions
 after a period of 3 months and, if the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter
 from the date of the original detention.
 Government security forces used the State Security Law regularly to detain per-
 sons engaging in antiregime activities, and those attempting to exercise their rights
 of free speech, association, or other rights in opposition to the A-Khalifa regime.
 Security forces are believed to have held approximately 2,700 people in detention
 in 1995, including some who were arrested, released, and then arrested again. In
 many cases, the suspects were released with a warning. About 50 were tried in the
 Security Court; fewer than 750 were tried in criminal courts, and the remainder
 were released without charge. Under proceedings used by the Criminal Court, police
 may detain a suspect for up to 7 days of questioning before filing charges.
 Activities that lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest include: member-
 ship in illegal organizations or those deemed subversive; painting antiregime slo-
 gans on wals; joining antigovernmnent demonstrations; possessing or circulating
 antiregime writings; preaching sermons with a distinct antiregime political tone;
 and harboring or associating with persons committing such acs. Of those detained
 for m re than a few days, most were held for committing illegal or violent acts in
 the course of a demonstration-i.e., skirmishing with police, breaking windows,
 damaging cars or other property, burning electrical substations, tires, cars, palm
 groves, banks, stores, schools, sports clubs, furniture, and auto showrooms-rather
 than for exercising their rights of free expression.
 In addition to overseeing the Security Service and police, the Ministry of Interior
 also controls the Office of-the Public Prosecutor, whose officers initially determine
 whether sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in investigatory de-
 tention. The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In the
 early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any au-
 thority outside the Ministry of Interior.
 Authorities continue to use exile and the revocation of citizenship to punish indi-
 viduals suspected of, or convicted of, antirene activity. Four deportations took
 place in 1995. The Government deportedShay kh Ali Salman Abmed Salman,
 Shaykh Hamza Al-Sitri and Shaykh Haydar Al-Sitri to the United Arab Emirates
 on January 15. They traveled onward to London the next day. Shaykh Adel Al-
 Sho'ala was deported on January 18. He is believed to be in Damascus. The Govern-
 ment reportedly deported these four clerics because they instigated an attack on a
 charity marathon in November 1994 in which several participants were beaten and
 stoned, and because they encouraged antigovernment rioting.
 In the past, the Government has revoked the citizenship of nationals who are con-
 sidered security threat. The Government considers these individuals to have for-
 feited their nationality under the Citizenship Act of 1963 because they accepted for-
 eign citizenship or passports, or engaged in antiregime activities abroad. Bahraini
 emige groups and their local contacts have challenged this practice, arguing that
 the Government's revocation of citizenship without due process violates Bahrain's
 1973 Constitution. According to the emigre groups, as many as 500 Bahrainis con-
 tinue to live in exile. This igure includes both those prohibited from returning to
 Bahrain and their family members who voluntarily live abroad with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, as well as an appellate system for review of lower court decisions. In practice,
 however, the courts are frequently subject to government pressure regarding sen-
 tencing and appeals.
 A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary criminal court or, if required by
 the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary civil or criminal trials provide pro-
 cedural guarantees for an open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid available
 when necessary), and the right to appeal. There is widespread, credible evidence
 that persons accused of antigovernment crimes and tried in the criminal courts were
 denied fair trials. For example, the accused were not permitted to speak with an
 
 
 1131
 attorney until their appearance before the judge at the preliminary hearing. Trials
 in the criminal courts for antiregirne activities were held in secret.
 Security cases are tried by the Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as the Security
 Court. Procedures in the Security Court do not provide adequate safeguards. For ex-
 ample, the Security Court is exempted from adhering to the procedural guarantees
 of the Penal Code. Defendants may be represented by counsel, but proceedings are
 held in secret and there is no right to judicial review of the legality of arrests. Con-
 victions may be based solely on confessions and evidence may be introduced in se-
 cret. There is no judicial appeal of a State Security Court verdict, but the defendant
 may request clemency from the Amir. The accused normally is tried in the Security
 Court at the discretion of the prosecutor, but in 1995 the Security Court rejected
 jurisdiction in some cases and remanded the cases to the criminal courts. Defense
 attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs.
 Criminal court proceedings generally do not appear to discriminate against
 women, children, or minority groups. Some attorneys and family members involved
 in politically sensitive criminal cases complained that the Government can and has
 interfered with court proceedings to influence the outcome or to prevent judgments
 from being carried out. Allegations of corruption in the judicial system have also
 been made from time to time, although this does not appear to be a pervasive prob-
 lem. In past cases, the Amir, the Prime Minister, and other senior Government offi-
 cials have all lost civil cases brought against them by private citizens. The courts
 ordered these judgments to be carried out.
 The Bahrain Defense Force maintains a separate court system for military per-
 sonnel accused of offenses under the Military Code of Justice. Military courts do not
 review cases involving civilian criminal or security offenses.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to determine because the Govern-
 ment does not release data on security cases, such cases are not tried in open court,
 and visits to prisoners convicted of security offenses are severely restricted. The
 Government denies that there are any political prisoners, claiming that all inmates
 incarcerated for committing security offenses were properly convicted of criminal
 acts such as espionage, espousing or committing violence, or belonging to terrorist
 organizations.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government continued to release and grant am-
 nesty to prisoners, including self-declared political prisoners, on major holidays. In
 1995 the Government released 175 prisoners in March during the Eid A1-Fitr holi-
 day. Throughout the course of the year, an additional 2,000 were released, and most
 were pardoned by Amiri decree.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, the Ministry of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into private prem-
 ises without specific judicial intervention. Domestic and international telephone
 calls and correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are ex-
 tensive and sophisticated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," Bahrainis are not, in practice, free to express
 public opposition to the Al-Khalifa regime in speech or writing. Press criticism of
 ruling family personalities and of government policy regarding certain sensitive sub-
 jects-such as sectarian unrest and the dispute with Qatar over the Hawar Is-
 lands-are strictly prohibited. However, local press coverage and commentary on
 international issues is open, and discussion of local economic and commercial issues
 is also relatively unrestricted. In practice there are few if any restrictions on the
 discussion of political and economic issues in private settings or in places of wor-
 ship provided these discussions do not spill over into public fora.
 rie Information Ministry exercises sweeping control over all local media. Bah-
 rain's newspapers are privately owned but routinely exercise self-censorship of sto-
 ries on sensitive topics. There was no coverage of domestic unrest, for example, for
 approximately the first 4 months of the disturbances. The Government does not con-
 done unfavorable coverage of its domestic policies by the international media and
 has occasionally revoked the press credentials of offending journalists. Since the
 Ministry also sponsors foreign journalists' residence permits, this action can lead to
 deportation. There were no reports of journalists" deportations, but the Government
 did tighten restrictions on reporters at the height of the unrest. For example,
 Ahmed Shamlan, a local columnist and attorney, was suspended from his job after
 he signed a petition calling for a return to parliamentary democracy.
 Two American journalists were denied entry visas at the height of the disturb-
 ances in the spring (one of the two later entered on a tourist visa), and two more
 received visas only after foreign diplomatic intervention. International news serv-
 
 
 1132
 
 ices, including AP, UPI, and AFP, frequently complain about press restrictions. In
 March Canal France Internationale, the French-langage cable television station,
 was taken off the air for several weeks because of government anger over the
 French media's coverage of the demonstrations.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts in Arabic and Farsi from neighboring countries and Egypt can be
 received without interference. Cable News Network has been provided without cen-
 sorship for 1 hour a day on a local television channel since 1991, and is also avail-
 able on a 24-hour basis by subscription. The British Broadcasting Corporation's
 world news service is carried on a local channel 24 hours a day free of charge and
 uncensored.
 Many senior government officials, ruling family members, and major hotels use
 satellite dishes to receive international broadcasts, as do well-to-do private citizens.
 The Ministry of Information closely controls access to satellite dishes, and the im-
 portation or installatioA of dishes without prior government approval is illegal.
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, as a prac-
 tical matter academics try to avoid contentious political issues. In general, there is
 greater latitude to discuss politics in an academic setting. Nevertheless, strict limits
 are observed, and research, publications, and public discussions critical of the Gov-
 ernment are highly infrequent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Constitution's af-
 fimation of the right of free assembly, the Government prohibits all public political
 demonstrations and meetings, and controls religious gatherings that may take on
 political overtones. Unauthorized public gatherings of more than five persons are
 prohibited by law. The Government monitors gatherings that might take on a politi-
 cal tone, and frequently disperses such meetings.
 On dozens of occasions from January through August the security forces used tear
 gas, rubber bullets, and occasionally, live ammunition to disperse gatherings during
 which protesters called for the reestablishment of an elected parliament and the re-
 lease of prisoners; objected to Al-Khalifa rule, denounced police brutality; protested
 over foreigners in the security forces and in the labor force; and demanded increased
 employment opportunities. After each of these incidents, suspected leaders and ac-
 tive participants were arrested, generally for participating in or inciting violence. At
 the height of the disturbances, approximately 2,000 people were being held in deten-
 tion. At year's end, an estimated 261 people remained in detention.
 The Government prohibits political parties and organizations. Some professional
 societies and social/sports clubs have traditionally served as forums for discreet po-
 litical discussions, but they are restricted by law from engaging in political activity.
 Only the Bahraini Bar Association has been granted an exemption to the regulation
 requiring all associations to state in their constitution that they will refrain from
 political activity. The Bar Association successfully argued that a lawyer's profes-
 sional duties may require certain "political" actions, such as interpreting legislation
 or participating in a politically sensitive trial. Other organized discussions and
 meetings are still actively discouraged. Permits are required for most public gather-
 ings, and permission is not routinely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is
 the state religion. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews, Hin-
 dus, and Baha'is are free to practice their religion and maintain their own places
 of worship. Bibles and other Christian publications are displayed and sold openly
 in local bookshops, which also sell Islamic and other religious literature.
 Adherents of faiths other than Islam maintain places of worship and may display
 the symbols of their religion. Some small groups worship in their homes. Notables
 from virtually every religion and denomination visit Bahrain and frequently meet
 with government and civic leaders. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of
 sermons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications of
 other religions are readily available. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is discouraged,
 anti-Islamic writings prohibited, and conversions from Islam to other religions,
 while not illegal, are not tolerated by society.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a sects are subject to governmental control and monitoring,
 but there is no interference with routine worship, preaching, religious courts, Is-
 lamic charitable foundations, mosque construction, religious education, or other reli-
 gious activities. Public religious events, most notably the large annual commemora-
 tive marches by Bahraini Shi'a, are permitted but are closely watched by the police.
 There are no restrictions on the number of Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages
 to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria; however, owing to conditions
 in Iraq, very few Bahrainis make pilgrimages there. Religious study in and pilgrim-
 ages to Iran were strongly discouraged in the past. Although the Government con-
 tinues to monitor travel to Iran and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue
 
 
 1133
 
 relipous study there, travel to Iran for pilgrimages, business trips, tourism, and
 family visits is common.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move within the country and change their place of
 residence or work. Passports, however, may be denied on political grounds. Approxi-
 mately 3 percent of the indigenous population, mostly Persian-origin Shi'a, do not
 have passports and cannot readily obtain them, although they may be issued travel
 documents as Bahraini residents (see Section 5). About 150 Sunni Toidoon" or state-
 less persons, mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, were granted citizenship in 1995,
 and about 15 Egyptian citizens resident in Bahrain also received citizenship.
 Bahrainis living abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may
 face arrest and trial upon return to Bahrain. Under the 1963 Citizenship Law, the
 Government may reject applications to obtain or renew passports for "reasonable
 cause," but the appicant has the right to appeal such decisions before the High
 Civil Court. The Government has also issued 'temporary passports," good for one
 trip within a year, to individuals whose travel it wishes to control or whose claim
 to Bahraini nationality is questionable. Non-citizen residents, including bidoon of
 Iranian origin, may also obtain Bahraini "laissez passers" (temporary passports),
 usually valid for 2 years and renewable at Bahraini embassies overseas. Laissez
 passer holders also require visas to reenter Bahrain.
 Bahrain does not usually accept refugees due to its small size and limited re-
 sources. In practice, however, refugees who arrive in Bahrain are not repatriated
 to countries from which they have fled. Many Iranian emigres who fled Iran after
 the Iranian Revolution have been granted permission to remain in Bahrain, but
 they have not been granted citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and political activity is strictly controlled by the Govern-
 ment. Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have been no
 formal democratic political institutions. The Government permits neither political
 parties nor opposition organizations. The Prime Minister, Shaykh Khalifa Bin
 Sulman Al-K halifa, makes all appointments to the Cabinet. All other government
 positions are filled by the relevant ministries. About one-third of the cabinet min-
 isters are Shi'a Muslim, although they do not hold security-related offices. The ordi-
 nary citizen may attempt to influence government decisions through submission of
 personal written petitions and informal contact with senior officials, including ap-
 peals to the Amir, the Prime Minister, and other officials at their regularly sched-
 uled public audiences, called majlses.
 In 1992 the Government established an appointed 30-member Consultative Coun-
 cil, known as the Majls AI-Shura. The Majlis held its third session from October
 1994 to May 1995, and began its fourth session in October. The members of the
 Majls are evenly divided between Sunni and Shi'a and are a ppointed by the Amir.
 They are selected to represent major constituent groups, including representatives
 from the business, labor, professional, and religious communities. There are no
 members of the ruling A-Khalifa family in the Majlis, and religious "extremists" are
 conspicuously absent. The chairman is a prominent Shi'a who formerly was Minister
 of Transport and Communications.
 The Majlis debates issues and may summon Cabinet ministers to answer ques-
 tions. However, it does not have the power to introduce legislation, nor can it re-
 quest to review legislation that the Cabinet has not referred to it. When asked to
 review proposed legislation, the Majlis may recommend changes, but the rec-
 ommendations are not binding.
 In 1995 the Majlis debated a number of contentious social and economic issues,
 including unemployment, labor policy, and education, drafting proposals on these
 and other subjects for government consideration. According to the Speaker of the
 Majlis, the Government responded positively to about "85 percent" of the Majlis's
 recommendations by incorprating them into legislation or by taking other appro-
 priate actions. Although  e Government views the Majlis as solely an advisory
 ody, the overnment in September promised more powers and scope to the fourth
 session.
 A petition, written in 1994, calling on the Amir to reinstate the former National
 Assembly, or to allow elections for a new one, continued to circulate in 1995. The
 petition reportedly has more than 20,000 signatures. Despite opposition charges to
 the contrary, there is no evidence that the Government has arrested anyone for
 signing or circulating the petition.
 
 
 1134
 During the year, one of the original 14 signers, Sa'id Abdulla Asbool, lost his ob
 at the Ministry of Works, Power, and Water, reportedly for circulating the petition
 at the Ministry during work hours. There are reports that other employees have lost
 their government jobs for participating in the petition drive. Ahmed Shamlan, a
 local newspaper columnist, was reportedly suspended from his job for signing the
 petition, and a doctor at Salmaniyah Hospital was stripped of his department chair-
 manship, but retained his job. Other signers, like Munira Fakhro, a member of the
 University of Bahrain faculty, were dismissed from their positions. Abdul Amir Al-
 Jamri, a prominent Shi'a cleric, longime opposition activist, and one of the peti-
 tion's original signers, was placed under house arrest on April 1, where he remained
 until his release on September 25. Al-Jamri is accused of committing a wide variety
 of security-related crimes.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically based investiga-
 tion or public criticism of the Government's human rights policies faces major obsta-
 cles. A number of groups based abroad claim to report on Bahraini human rights
 violations. These include the Damascus-based "Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Bahrain," the London-based "Bahrain Freedom Movement," and "Islamic
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain," and the Copenhagen-based "Bahrain Human
 Rights Organization" (formerly the "Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners
 in Bahrain"). These groups are composed of small numbers of emigres living in self-
 imposed exile, and reportedly receive funding from sources hostile to the A-Khalifa
 regime. They are viewed by many local observers as espousing a political, rather
 than a purely human rights, agenda.
 The Government maintains that it is "not opposed" to visits "in good faith" by
 "bona fide human rights organizations," and has engaged in dialogue with the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Amnesty International (AI). In
 practice, however, international human rights organizations have found it difficult
 to conduct activities in Bahrain. By the end of the year, the Government had not
 agreed to requests by ICRC and A for unconditional visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "liberty, equality, security, tranquility, education, so-
 cial solidarity, and equal opportunities for citizens shall be pillars of society assured
 by the state." It further states that every citizen shall have the right to medical,
 welfare, education, property, capital, and work. In practice, these rights are un-
 evenly upheld, depending on the individual's social status, ethnicity, or sex.
 Women.-Violence against women is known to occur, but knowledge of incidents
 is usually kept within the family. In general, there is little public attention to, or
 discussion of, violence against women. No government policies explicitly address vio-
 lence against women. Women's groups and health care professionals state that
 spouse abuse is relatively common, particularly in poorer communities. There are
 very few known instances of Bahraini women seeking legal redress for violence. An-
 ecdotal evidence suggests that the courts are not receptive to such cases.
 Cases of foreign women working as domestic servants who have been beaten or
 sexually abused-by their employers have been reported to local embassies and the
 police. Most victims are too intimidated to sue their employers. Those who do ap-
 pear to be received sympathetically in the courts.
 Islamic law (Shan'a) governs the legal rights of women. Specific rights vary ac-
 cording to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the indi-
 viduals faith or by the court in which various contracts, including marriage, have
 been made.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Although local religious courts may grant a divorce
 to Shi'a women in "rutine" cases, occasionally Shi'a women seeking divorce under
 unusual circumstances must travel outside of Bahrain. Women of either sect may
 own and inherit property and may represent themselves in all public and legal mat-
 ters. In the absence of a direct male heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property;
 in contrast, Sunni women-in the absence of a direct male heir-inherit only a por-
 tion; the balance is divided among uncles and male cousins of the deceased.
 In the event of divorce, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody
 of daughters under the age of 9 and sons under age 7, although custody usually re-
 verts to the father once the children reach those respective ages. In all cir-
 cumstances except mental incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains
 
 
 1135
 
 the right to make certain legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of
 any property belongig to the child until the child raches legal age. A non-Bahraini
 woman automatically loses custody of her children if she divorces their Bahiraini fa-
 ther. Women may obtain passports and leave the country without the permission
 of the male head of the household. ]ahraini women are free to work outside the
 home, to drive cars without escorts, and to wear the clothing of their choice (a large
 percentage wear western dress outside the home), and have increasingly taken jobs
 previously reserved for men.
 Labor law does not discriminate against women; however, some women's groups
 complain about informal discrimination in the workplace, including inequality of
 wages and denial of opportunity for advancement. Women constitute over 20 percent
 of the work force. The Government has encouraged the hiring of women, enacted
 special laws to promote female entry into the work force, and is a leading employer
 of women. Labor law does not recognize the concept of equal pay for equal work,
 and women are generally paid less than men. Generally, women work outside the
 home during the years between secondary school or university and marriage.
 Women make up the majority of students at Bahrain's universities. There are wom-
 en's organizations which seek to improve the status of women under both civil and
 Islamic law.
 Increasingly some women have expressed the view that, des ite their participa-
 tion in the work force, women are not significantly advancing their rights and that
 much of their lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic religious traditional-
 ists. Other women, however, desire a return to more traditional religious values and
 support calls for a return to Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Children.-The Government has often stated its commitment to the protection of
 children's human rights and welfare within the social and religious framework of
 this traditional society. It honors this commitment through enforcement of its civil
 and criminal laws and an extensive social welfare network.
 The social status of children is shaped by tradition and religion to a greater ex-
 tent than by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the preference
 of the authorities has always been to leave such matters within the purview of the
 family or religious gups. The authorities actively enforce the laws against pros-
 titution, including child prostitution, procuring, and pimping. Violators are dealt
 with harshly and can be imprisoned, or if non-Bahraini, deported. In some cases,
 authorities reportedly will return children arrested for prostitution and other crimes
 to their families rather than prosecute them, especially for first offenses. Juvenile
 cases currently are heard in the regular courts 1 day a week. Some legal experts
 have called on the Government to establish a separate juvenile court.
 Other Bahrainis, however, insist that the protection of children is a religious, not
 a secular, function and oppose greater government involvement. Independent and
 quasigovernmental organizations such as 'The Bahraini Society for the Protection
 of Children" and "The Mother and Child Welfare Society" play an active part in pro-
 tecting children by providing counseling, legal assistance and advice, and, in some
 cases, shelter and financial support to istressed children and families.
 As many as 200 juveniles were detained or arrested during civil disturbances in
 1995. Juveniles received the same treatment as adult prisoners, but were released
 before other detainees. At year's end, there were no reports of any juveniles in de-
 tention for crimes allegedly committed during the unrest.
 People With Disabilties.-Bahraini law protects the rights of people with disabil-
 ities, and a variety of governmental, quasigovernmental, and religious institutions
 are mandated to support and protect disabled persons. The Regional (Arabian Gull)
 Center for the Treatment of the Blind is head    arre in Bahrain, and a similar
 center for the education of deaf children was established in 1994. Bahraini society
 tends to view people with disabilities as special cases in need of protection rather
 than as fully functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the Government is re-
 quired by law to provide vocational training for disabled persons wishing to work
 and maintains a list of certified, trained disabled persons. The Labor Law of 1976
 also requires that any employer employing over 100 people must engage at least 2
 percent of its employees from the Goveent's list of disabled workers. The Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs works actively to place people with disabilities in
 public sector jobs, such as in the public telephone exchanges. The Government's
 housin regulations require that access be provided to disabled persons. Most large
 public buildings are equipped with ramps and other aids which make them acces-
 sible to disabled persons.
 Religious Minorities.-Although there are notable exceptions, the Sunni Muslim
 minority enjoys a favored status in Bahrain. Sunnis generally receive preference for
 employment in sensitive government positions and in the managerial ranks of the
 civil service. Shi'a Bahrainis are not allowed to hold significant posts in the Bahrain
 
 
 1136
 defense and internal security forces. On the other hand, Shi'a Muslim occupy most
 of the senior positions in the major government-owned industries. They are also dis-
 proportionately represented in the educational sphere as secondary school teachers,
 professors, and university administrators. In general, however, employment oppor-
 tunities for Shi'a are more restricted than for Sunnis, and Shi'a tend to be employed
 in lower paid, less skilled jobs.
 Social and municipal services in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particularly in rural
 villages, are inferior to those found in Sunni urban communities. In an effort to
 remedy social discrimination, improve living conditions for the Shi'a, and encourage
 integration, the Government has built numerous subsidized housing complexes open
 to all citizens on the basis of financial need.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A group of approximately 9,000 to 15,000
 mostly Persian-origin Shi'a are stateless. They are commonly known as bidoon and
 enjoy less than full citizenship. Under the Citizenship Act of 1963, many of the
 bidoon are second or third generation residents whose ancestors emigrated from
 Iran. Although they no longer claim Iranian citizenship, they have not been granted
 Bahraini nationality. Without citizenship these individuals are officially unable to
 buy land, start a business, or obtain government loans, although in practice many
 do.
 The law does not address the citizenship rights of persons who were not reg-
 istered with Bahraini authorities prior to 1959, creating a legal problem for such
 persons and their descendants and resulting in economic and other hardships. The
 Government maintains that many of those who claim to be bidoon are actually citi-
 zens of Iran or other Gulf states who have voluntarily chosen not to renew their
 foreign passports. Bidoon and Bahrainis who speak Farsi, rather than Arabic, as
 their first language also face significant social and economic obstacles, including dif-
 ficulty finding employment.
 Section 6. Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The partially suspended 1973 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of workers to organize,but trade unions do not exist in Bahrain, and
 the Government does not encourage their formation. Article 27 of the Constitution
 states: "freedom to form associations and trade unions on national bases and for
 lawful objectives and by peaceful means shall be guaranteed in accordance with the
 conditions and in the manner prescribed by the law. No person shall be compelled
 to join or remain in any association or union."
 In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's and in 1965 and 1974, the Govern-
 ment passed a series of labor regulations which, among other things, allow the for-
 mation of elected workers' committees in larger companies. Worker representation
 today is based on a system of Joint Labor-Management Committees (JLC's) estab-
 lished by ministerial decree. Between 1981 and 1984, 12 JLC's were established in
 the major state-owned industries. In 1994 four new JLC's were established in the
 private sector, including one in a major hotel.
 In 1995 elections were held for representatives to the General Committee of Bah-
 rain Workers (GCBW), which oversees the activities of the JLC's. Workers from all
 walks of life were elected to the body in 1995 including Sunni and Shi'a Muslims,
 expatriates, and, for the first time, a woman. hese elections, which appeared to be
 free and by secret ballot, were carried out during the worst of the demonstrations.
 The Government is considering the further expansion of the JLC system into the
 tourism and banking sectors.
 The JLC's are composed of equal numbers of appointed management representa-
 tives and worker representatives elected from and by company employees. Each
 committee is chaired alternately by the management and worker representative.
 The selection of worker representatives appears to be fair;, under the law the Min-
 istry of Interior may exclude worker candidates with criminal records or those
 deemed a threat to national security. The elected labor representatives of the JLC's
 select the 11 members of the General Committee of Bahraini Workers (GCBW), es-
 tablished in 1983 by law, which oversees and coordinates the work of the JLC's. The
 committee also hears complaints from Bahraini and foreign workers and assists
 them in bringing their complaints to the attention of the Ministry of Labor or the
 courts. Although the Government and company management are not represented on
 the GCBW, the Ministry of Labor closely monitors the body's activities. It approves
 the GCBW's rules and the distribution of GCBW funds.
 The JLC-GCBW system represents nearly 70 percent of the island's indigenous in-
 dustrial workers, although both government and labor representatives readily admit
 that nonindustrial workers and expatriates are clearly underrepresented in the sys-
 tem. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has publicly urged the formation of
 JLC's in all public and private sector companies employing more than 200 workers.
 
 
 1137
 Although 67 percent of the work force is comprised of expatriate workers, expatri-
 ates are underrepresented in the GCBW. Expatriate workers can and do participate
 in JLC elections, and five expatriates currently serve on JLC's. None, however, cur-
 rently sit on the board of the G-CBW. It is a longterm goal of both the Government
 and the GCBW to replace expatriate workers with Bahrainis throughout all sectors
 of the economy and to create new jobs for Bahrainis seeking employment.
 The Labor Law is silent on the right to strike, and there were no strikes in 1995.
 Actions perceived to be detrimental to the "existing relationship" between employers
 and employees or to the economic health of the State are forbidden by the 1974 Se-
 curity Law. There are no recent examples of major strikes, but walkouts and other
 job actions have been known to occur without governmental intervention and with
 positive results for the workers.
 The GCBW represents Bahraini workers at the International Labor Organization
 and in the Arab Labor Organization, but does not belong to any international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, the
 Labor Law neither grants nor denies workers the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively outside the JLC system. While the JLC's described above are empowered
 to discuss labor disputes, organize workers' services, and discuss wages, working
 conditions, and productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized vehicle
 for representing their interests on these or other labor-related issues. JLC's make
 suggestions to management on some working conditions and limited aspects of wage
 issues; but management must agree to a proposal before it can be put in force.
 Minimum wage rates for public sector employees are established by Council of
 Ministers' decree. Private businesses generally follow the Government's lead in es-
 tablshing their wage rates.
 There are two exprt processing zones. Labor law and practice are the same in
 these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forcd or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. The Ministr of abr enforces the labor laws with periodic inspec-
 tions and routinely fines violators. Provisions to the Labor Law passed in 1993 stiff-
 ened the fines and prison terms for certain violations. The press oiftn performs an
 ombudsman function on labor problems, reporting job disputes and the results of
 labor cases brought before the courts.
 Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker, the Labor Ministry opens an in-
 vestigation and often takes remedial action. Although the Ministry takes such cases
 seriously, abuses undoubtedly go unreported, particularly those involving domestic
 workers and others working illegally. In some cases, workers arrive in Bahrain
 under the sponsorship of an employer and then switch jobs, while cont ing to pay
 a "fee" to their original sponsor. The Government has announced its intention to
 abolish this illegal practice, which makes it difficult to monitor and control the em-
 ployment conditions of domestic and other workers. However, no substantive action
 as  et been taken.
 Amendments to the Labor Law passed in November 1993 stiffened the penalties
 for engaging in visa switching to include jail sentences of up to 6 months for the
 sponsor of every illegally sponsored worker. In such cases, the workers involved are
 likelyto be deported as illegal immigrants after the case is concluded. The intense
 fear of deportation almost certainly allows some employer sponsrs to impose abu-
 sive conditions on foreign workers. In such instances, the situation approaches co-
 erced or bonded labor on these employees.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years. Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 may not be employet in haz-
 ardous conditions or at night and may not work more than 6 hours per day or on
 a piecework basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by Ministry of Labor in-
 spectors in the industrial sector, child labor outside that sector is less well mon-
 itored but is not believed to be significant outside faiy-o rated businesses ti.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work. -Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their falies. The current minimum wage for the public sector
 is $236.60 (91 dinars) a month. Wages in the private sector are determined on a
 contract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits such as annual trips
 home and housing and education bonuses part of the salary.
 The Labr Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, mandates
 acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate standards
 regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and ocupational safety and
 health. The Fourth High Court (Labor) has jurisdiction over cases involving aleged
 violations of the Labrlaw.
 
 
 1138
 Complaints brought before the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that cannot
 be settled through arbitration must, by law, be referred to the court within 15 days.
 In practice, moat employers p refer to settle such disputes through arbitration, par-
 ticularly since the ourt and labor law are generaly considereoi to favor the em-
 ployee. Under the Labor Law workers have the right to remve themselves from
 angerous work situations without jeopardy to their ontinued employment.
 In 1993 the Government strengthened the Labor Law by Amiri decree, announc-
 ing that significant fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon private sector
 employers who fail to pay legal wages. This law applies equally to employers of Bah-
 rainis and expatriates and is intended to reduce a uses against foreign workers who
 have sometimes been denied legal salaries. The law provides equal protection to
 Babraini and foreign workers, but all foreign workers still require sponsorship by
 Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institutions and companies. Subject to sanctions for
 wrongful dismissal, sponsors are able to cancel the residence permit of any person
 under their sponsorship and thereby block them from obtaining entry or residence
 visas from another sponsor.
 Foreign workers, particularly those from developing countries, are often unwilling
 to report abuses for fear of losing residence rights and having to return to their na-
 tive countries. Instances of foreign workers being denied full wages, days off, vaca-
 tions, or other guaranteed conditions of employment without compensation are peri-
 odically reported in the local press, as well as the court rulings or Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs actions taken in response. Nonetheless, government attempts to
 address individual abuses in these and other cases are often hampered by the work-
 ers' unwillingness to make a formal complaint.
 In addition the Labor Law specifically favors Bahrainis, followed by Arab expatri-
 ates, over other foreign workers in hiring and firing. Because employers include
 housing and other allowances in their salary scales, expatriate workers can legally
 be paid lower regular wages than their Bahraini counterparts, although they some-
 times receive the same or a greater total compensation package because of home
 leave and holiday pay allowances. Western expatriates and Bahraini workers are
 p aid comparable wages, with total compensation packages often significantly greater
 for the former. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave, nursing pen-
 ods during the day, and up to one year of unpaid maternity leave, however women
 are generally paid less than men.
