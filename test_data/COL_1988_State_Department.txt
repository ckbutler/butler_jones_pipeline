 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy. Two
 parties, the Liberals and the Social Conservatives, have
 dominated national politics since the mid-19th century, but
 smaller parties are usually represented in Congress, state
 assemblies, and among popularly elected mayors. The
 Constitution provides for independent legislative and judicial
 branches of government. In practice, the Congress and the
 courts provide significant checks on the President's ability
 to act unilaterally.
 Internal defense is the responsibility of the Ministry of
 Defense, which includes the police. The Ministry of Defense
 is responsible directly to the President of the Republic and
 operates under full civilian control.
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which private enterprise plays
 the dominant role. The coffee industry, which accounts for
 one-third of the country's legal export earnings, is in
 private hands, as are most entities engaged in manufacturing,
 agriculture, and provision of services. There is a relatively
 large informal economy. State enterprises control domestic
 participation in the oil and coal industries and play a
 deciding role in the electrical and communication utilities.
 Despite Colombia's tradition of democracy, the country has
 suffered from social unrest and violence during most of the
 past 40 years, and it has recently been fighting threats from
 both political extremes as well as from enormously wealthy
 narcotics traffickers. Colombia's human rights problems
 originate in the violence from these three sources. The
 extreme left includes several well-financed Marxist-Leninist
 guerrilla armies which use guerrilla warfare, terrorism,
 political assassination, kidnaping, extortion and robbery to
 achieve their goal of overthrowing Colombia's democratic
 Government. They also frequently work with the narcotics
 traffickers and deal in drugs to finance arms and operations.
 The extreme right is made up of disparate groups, mostly
 civilian, but at times including members of the security
 forces. Less well organized and coordinated than the left,
 these groups also practice assassination, kidnaping, vigilante
 justice, extortion, and robbery, and have also engaged in
 narcotics trafficking. They defend their actions as an anti-
 communist crusade in the face of what they see as a Government
 incapable of recognizing and dealing with a serious subversive
 threat. The traffickers kidnap, threaten, and murder officials
 and judges to intimidate the Government into giving the major
 narcotics dealers de facto immunity from prosecution, leading
 to a public perception of an impotent judiciary. The
 traffickers cooperate with the guerrillas in areas where the
 narcotics are grown and processed but come into violent
 conflict with them in regions where guerrillas try to extort
 money from land-owning traffickers.
 In this environment the Government has resorted to
 extraordinary measures to cope with the problems, including
 state of siege decrees, a presidential peace plan, and
 military and police actions aimed at reasserting government
 control. The constitutionally authorized state of siege
 allows the President to legislate by decree, although the
 decrees are subject to automatic constitutional review by the
 Supreme Court. Constitutionally provided civil liberties
 cannot, therefore, simply be set aside. President Barco used
 his state of siege power in 1988 chiefly to combat terrorism
 
 
 499
 COLOMBIA
 and violence by guerrillas and narcotics traffickers. The
 Supreme Court struck down those parts of the 1988 decrees
 which gave the police and army enhanced search and arrest
 powers but left in place some restrictions on press reporting
 of terrorist acts.
 Over 16,000 victims of homicide were recorded in 1988, one of
 the highest rates in the world. Some 10 percent of these'are
 thought to be politically related, and Colombia's elected
 officials acknowledge the seriousness of human rights
 problems. The President has expressed his commitment to
 ending the impunity with which many violators of the law
 currently act. In that regard, the security forces have been
 brought under greater civilian judicial control and are now
 subjected to scrutiny by official human rights monitors and
 prosecutors with a high degree of independence. Colombian
 military officials claim that the military judicial system is
 currently investigating, prosecuting, and incarcerating over
 500 military personnel for human rights abuses. By the end of
 1988, it was not yet possible to determine how effective these
 steps were likely to be in ameliorating the problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Growing numbers of unsolved killings continued to plague
 Colombia in 1988. Determining motivations for individual
 murders is difficult, due in part to a judicial system which
 lacks the resources to investigate and prosecute most of these
 crimes. However, informed observers believe that
 approximately 1,500 of the more than 16,000 murders committed
 in Colombia in 1988 were politically motivated. This number
 does not include the approximately 450 police and military who
 were murdered, most in leftwing terrorist assassinations.
 These killings result in part from the activities of
 well-financed guerrilla groups conducting campaigns of
 intimidation, extortion, and infiltration of many of the
 country's most productive areas and industries, and in part
 from rightwing activists who have resorted to intimidation and
 assassination of leftwing politicians (some of whom are
 aligned in various degrees with the insurgents) and the
 civilian support networks of the guerrillas. The situation is
 made more volatile by the presence of some of the world's
 wealthiest and most ruthless criminal organizations, the
 cocaine cartels, which intimidate the judicial system, fight
 each other for control of major markets, and conduct their own
 vigilante campaigns against the guerrillas. But despite this
 competition, there is some evidence that common criminals and
 guerrillas collaborate on kidnapings for ransom and share the
 proceeds. The resulting atmosphere of lawlessness has led to
 an increase in violent common crime. While the Government has
 had successes in controlling violence in some areas, there is
 a general perception that impunity reigns; many people simply
 assume the Government is unable to punish wrongdoers in
 serious criminal cases. A major 1987 study found that the
 largest increases in violence have occurred in cities such as
 Medellin and Cali, where the narcotics traffickers are
 strongest, and in rural areas where guerrilla activity is
 significant. One small city in the eastern plains, San Jose
 de Guaviare, where both the guerrillas and narcotics
 traffickers had strong presences, ranked with the major urban
 
 
 500
 COLOSBIA
 ranked with the major urban centers in absolute numbers of
 murders. When the army and police moved into the city in
 force and remained there in early 1988, driving out both the
 traffickers and the guerrillas, the murder rate dropped off
 dramatically.
 Two nongovernmental organizations in Colombia compile
 information about killings which have possible political
 motives: the Executive Staff of the Permanent Committee for
 the Defense of Human Rights, and a Jesuit social research
 organization, CINEP. The Permanent Committee staff compiles
 information from newspaper sources and denunciations and
 publishes a bimonthly bulletin of cases. CINEP compiles its
 information from the 10 leading newspapers in Colombia,
 cross-checks the reports with parish priests and local human
 rights observers, and publishes the results in a quarterly
 bulletin. Both bulletins support an approximate tally of
 1,500 political killings in 1988. However, the facts
 presented are frequently sketchy, often making it difficult to
 determine why a particular killing is labeled political.
 In 1987 the Government published a list of 140 organizations
 thought to be involved in extrajudicial killings and covering
 the entire political and criminal spectrum. A study published
 in the magazine Futuro in September 1988 supported the
 contention that violence touches all the political parties,
 although disproportionately. The study counted the number of
 public and party officeholders who had been killed from the
 time President Barco took office until September 1988, a
 period of 23 months. It found that during that time 235
 members of the Conservative party, 258 members of the Liberal
 party, and 339 members of the much smaller leftist Patriotic
 Union (UP) were murdered.
 Interparty violence is not new to Colombia. However, the
 introduction of the Patriotic Union party into the political
 scene in 1984 changed the focus from conservative vs. liberal
 violence (the more traditional battle which had been largely
 brought under control) to that between extreme rightwing and
 leftwing groups. The UP was formed by the largest guerrilla
 group in Colombia as one result of President Betancur's peace
 initiatives, and some in its leadership retain active ties
 with the guerrillas. Since its inception, the UP has suffered
 from a very high level of assassinations and intimidation.
 There is little doubt that narcotics traffickers and
 individual members of the military and police have been
 involved.
 Labor also suffers a disproportionately higher rate of
 violence. The largest workers' confederation, the Unitary
 Workers Central (CUT), listed 143 of its members as being
 killed in the first 7 months of 1988. Many of the affiliates
 of CUT are Communist controlled, and some, like the banana
 workers unions in Uraba, are controlled by guerrilla groups.
 Many union members have therefore been drawn into events
 surrounding guerrilla activity and the violence associated
 with it. Democratic trade union leaders have been threatened
 and assassinated by guerrillas trying to weaken and intimidate
 moderate unions. As the year was coming to a close four
 workers at a cement plant in Puerto Nare were killed by
 members of the guerrilla group Revolutionary Armed Forces of
 Colombia (FARC); two other workers were tortured but
 survived. Peasants have also been frequent targets.
 Statistics compiled by security forces and released to the
 press in November show that over 450 campesinos were killed by
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 COLOMBIA
 guerrilla groups as of November 19, and 1,647 were killed by
 "other groups."
 There was a dramatic increase in the incidence of massacres in
 1988. In the first 6 months of the year, official sources
 noted 22 massacres (defined as five or more people murdered in
 one incident) leaving 231 victims. According to police
 statistics, over 70 percent of this violence has occurred in
 the Uraba region of Antioquia and nearby Cordoba and has
 stemmed from labor friction, increased guerrilla activity, and
 the recent purchase by narcotics traffickers of large tracts
 of productive land in areas where guerrilla and common
 criminal extortion and kidnaping schemes have forced out
 traditional landowners.
 Amnesty International (AI) declared a "human rights emergency"
 in Colombia and released a special report on the situation in
 April. AI focused almost exclusively on violence caused by
 what it describes as a government campaign, run by the
 military high command, designed to wipe out political
 opposition. This attribution of nearly all political violence
 to the Government was immediately rejected 3s inaccurate and
 misleading by Colombians with a wide variety of political
 views. The difference between AI's report and the more
 complicated picture visible to other observers of human rights
 in Colombia caused many to question AI's methodology and
 conclusions. AI appears to have relied heavily on the reports
 and conclusions of the Permanent Committee for the Defense of
 Human Rights and on members of the guerrilla-affiliated
 Patriotic Union. The presidential Counselor for Human Rights
 denied Government complicity in political killings and
 complained that AI did not give proper weight to violence
 committed by all nongovernmental elements.
 Information contained in the CINEP bulletin points to only a
 few unsolved cases which may have been perpetrated directly by
 the security forces. However, great uncertainty exists about
 the extent to which the security forces are involved in aiding
 and abetting political killings by private vigilante groups.
 In some instances, local military units have supported the
 establishment of village self-defense groups, which in most
 cases consist of persons with only rudimentary training and
 arms. A Department of Administrative Security (DAS--roughly
 equivalent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the
 United States) investigation into the Uraba massacres of March
 and April disclosed that the farms where the massacres
 occurred, and many of the victims, had been subjects of
 military intelligence surveillance. DAS did not accuse the
 military of committing the killings, but a criminal indictment
 was handed down against an intelligence officer and two police
 officials for being involved in planning the crimes.
 In the case of a November 11 nighttime massacre in Segovia,
 Antioquia, which left 42 people dead and over 30 wounded, the
 local army and police commanders were charged with negligence
 for not protecting the town. The random killings in this
 incident did not follow the pattern of previous massacres, and
 the perpetrators are still unknown. The Government
 established a high-level commission to investigate the
 incident, and the new Defense Minister, Manuel Jaime Guerrero
 Paz, promised to work to eliminate all illegal armed groups of
 both the right and the left. Following the Segovia massacre,
 the President.issued new decrees designed to attack terrorism
 from rightwing groups.
 
 
 502
 COLOMBIA
 Until recently the military had jurisdiction over all active
 military members. There is little evidence, however, that it
 has vigorously sought to purge its ranks of those who commit
 human rights abuses. In many cases, abuses have been dealt
 with in a "court of honor," which often led to the discharge
 of officers and men from military service, but not to criminal
 prosecution. The Attorney General and the presidential
 Counselor for Human Rights conducted a campaign in 1988 to
 have active military members, including the police, tried in
 the civilian court system for acts committed outside the scope
 of their duties. In August civilian investigations led to
 indictments against two policemen in the execution murder of
 two UP members, two army officers for planning and financing
 the assassination of a UP mayor, and an officer and policemen,
 along with Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin Cartel,
 for planning the March massacre of active supporters of the
 People's Liberation Army (EPL) guerrilla group in Uraba. A
 decision is still pending as to whether the cases will be
 tried in civilian courts. In a conference on "impunity" on
 September 19, President Barco said, "the military must accept
 that excesses, violations of orders and laws, or criminal acts
 committed outside of service by members of the military, will
 be quickly and exemplarily punished."
 b. Disappearance
 Most disappearances take place in areas of active guerrilla
 insurgency as a result of voluntary or forced recruitment by
 the guerrillas, flight from such recruitment, executions by
 either the guerrillas or vigilante groups, or common
 kidnaping. The army has been accused of abducting local
 residents to act as guides, but the one case which aroused
 international interest ended when the "disappeared" person
 appeared before a local judge to say he was working for the
 army voluntarily.
 Most international concern centers on apparent arrests and
 disappearances attributed to security forces. Stories abound
 of'people in rural areas being led off into the night by
 uniformed men. However, uniforms of security forces and
 guerrillas are often identical, as are the weapons. Narcotics
 trafficker assassination squads also use the same fatigue-type
 uniforms and employ anyone willing and able to carry out their
 illegal activities, regardless of political orientation.
 Ex-soldiers and policemen have been implicated in some
 incidents.
 Kidnapings increased in 1988. A leading newspaper noted 616
 kidnapings as of December 17. As of the end of the year, over
 500 victims remained in the hands of their captors. Three
 U.S. citizens were kidnaped by guerrillas in the last year.
 Two were released by the FARC after 8 months of captivity and
 one is still being held, presumably by the National Liberation
 Army (ELN).
 Guerrilla kidnapings of landowners garner vast sums and often
 force families off the land. According to media accounts,
 this tactic has motivated some landowners to form vigilante
 groups. Narcotics traffickers often purchase land from
 distressed owners and hire their own assassins (one such group
 is known as Death to Kidnapers (MAS)) to go after guerrillas
 or their perceived supporters. The guerrilla group M-19
 kidnaping of conservative leader Alvaro Gomez on May 22
 created a political crisis. Gomez was held for 2 months and
 
 
 503.
 COLOMBIA
 finally released after the M-19 received promises from
 nongovernmental groups for national conciliation talks.
 Narcotics traffickers also use kidnapings to intimidate and
 weaken the Government. In January, in order to pressure the
 Government int9 ending extradition, a group known as the
 extraditables kidnaped both the conservative candidate for the
 mayor of Bogota and the Attorney General. The mayoral
 candidate was rescued on January 25, the same day that the
 Attorney General was killed.
 The Attorney General's human rights office was created by
 President Barco in 1986 specifically to investigate
 allegations of official disappearances. The office has
 received-over 400 complaints, of which 70 are still under
 investigation. In most of the other cases, legal time limits
 for the conduct of investigations had expired before any
 suspects had been identified. The director of the office is
 obligated to ensure that commanders of accused police and
 military units carry out investigations; the office can also
 call on DAS for a more thorough investigation. In one case, a
 sergeant was convicted of kidnaping even though the victim was
 never seen again. In most cases, however, no information is
 developed. Under current legal rules, virtually the only
 useful evidence is eyewitness testimony, and knowledgeable
 officials say that most people are afraid to cooperate for
 fear of retribution.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and is generally not practiced.
 In December the Council of State (an independent court of last
 appeal for administrative affairs, equal in rank to the
 Supreme Court), found the Government culpable in the torture
 and death of a guerrilla in 1986. It ordered the Government
 to pay an indemnity to the family of the victim. Most
 reported incidents of official torture result from initial
 interrogation by the police, even though victims are usually
 released shortly after being arrested because of strict rules
 of habeas corpus. In an effort to resolve such problems, the
 presidential Counselor for Human Rights, Alvaro Tirado, has
 begun a program to establish an official human rights office
 in each municipality. Such offices were established in Bogota
 and Cali in 1988. They are empowered to investigate
 allegations of abuse, order medical exams, and follow cases
 through the disciplinary and criminal systems. If the
 security forces are reluctant to cooperate, the municipal
 office has legal options and may turn to the presidential
 Counselor for help. The President has given his full support
 to this program. The Bogota office, which began operation in
 May, employs 5 lawyers. As of September it was receiving
 about 12 complaints a week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no allegations that the police or armed forces
 use arbitrary arrest or detention as a coercive measure. The
 constitutional right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention is respected. A person may be arrested
 if apprehended in the .act of committing a crime or if an
 appropriate order of capture has been issued by the police or
 a judge. The-police must place a detainee at the disposition
 of a judge within 24 hours, except when a statement is given
 by the suspect, in which case the judge must hold a
 
 
 504
 COLOMBIA
 preliminary hearing within 48 hours. If the judge finds that
 there is enough evidence to pursue the case, he issues an
 order of detention under which bail is possible, or an order
 of preventive detention, under which the pers6n is
 incarcerated until trial. The law stipulates a specific time
 within which a trial must be held or the person released and
 also provides for the granting of parole and probation after
 conviction.
 There are no legal provisions for exile. Many people who have
 fled the country on their own after receiving death threats
 claim to be in exile.
 With regard to forced-or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. The rights of public trial and due
 process are provided for in the Constitution. Accused persons
 have the right to representation by counsel; if they do not
 have an attorney, the court will appoint one. However, due to
 an overburdened judicial system, and a traditional reluctance
 to grant bail, most prisoners incarcerated for common crimes
 never come to trial but are simply released after serving the
 minimum sentence applicable to the crimes alleged. Only 25
 percent of prison inmates have been convicted of crimes. When
 a case does come to trial, the judicial system is sometimes
 unable to conduct it impartially. Magistrates, judges,
 jurors, and attorneys have been threatened or killed because
 they were investigating or prosecuting narcotics traffickers
 or their associates. In September the Attorney General
 suspended the proceedings against the accused assassins of
 former Justice Minister Lara Bonilla just before the jury was
 to announce its verdict. He had information that the lives of
 the jurors had been threatened and stated that a fair verdict
 could not be guaranteed. The accused assassins have been
 linked to the Medellin cocaine cartel. In November the
 Government issued decrees to allow the Justice Minister to
 change the venue for dangerous cases and to eliminate jurors
 in terrorism cases. These modifications are awaiting review
 by the Supreme Court.
 A special Tribunal of Public Order was created in January to
 try crimes involving noncombat violence by the guerrillas and
 the intimidating tactics of the narcotics traffickers. By the
 third quarter of 1988, the Tribunal.had been organized and was
 hearing its first cases. Specialized narcotics judges
 established in 1987 were overwhelmed as a result of having to
 hear every case involving more than a gram of any drug. In
 August the new Justice Minister decreed that the narcotics
 judges would only hear those cases involving more than 2
 kilograms of narcotics.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution requires a court order for authorities to
 enter a private home, except in the case of hot pursuit.
 While Colombian human rights organizations report widespread
 violations in the more remote areas, government forces
 generally respect the sanctity of the home and privacy in most
 parts of the country. Persons from rural areas frequently
 claim that they have been forced to leave their farms by
 
 
 505
 COLOMBIA
 military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla conscription
 and confiscation, and by armed thugs hired by local landowners.
 Telephone taps and mail intercepts are allowed under Colombian
 law, but only under close judicial supervision. An agency
 wishing to employ such measures must apply in writing to the
 Attorney General and provide legal justification for the
 action. There have been no known abuses of this system in the
 past year.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally assured rights are respected, and the
 press often vigorously criticizes the Government and its
 leaders. The privately owned print media are under no
 governmental restraints and publish a wide variety of
 political views, including public calls for the President's
 resignation. Television.channel frequencies are regulated- by
 the State, which leases time to private companies and imposes
 some guidelines to ensure equal time for political
 candidates. Since 1987 all legally registered political
 parties have had access by law to national television.
 Leaders of various political groups are commonly interviewed
 on television.
 The Government has attempted to impose some controls over
 media coverage of terrorist events, on the grounds that many
 of these are designed solely for publicity purposes.
 Journalists successfully fought a proposed law in Congress at
 the end of 1987 which would have required them to reveal their
 sources for stories on terrorism. In January President Barco
 decreed that, since the State owns the airwaves, it could
 regain control of those frequencies assigned to private users
 in times of war or national emergency. These provisions were,
 put into effect during a nationwide general strike on October
 27, when radio.and television stations were prohibited from
 releasing any information about the strike which did not come
 from official sources. Severe penalties were promised for
 violators.  The decree was canceled on October 28. No
 prosecutions were undertaken as a result of the one day the
 decree was in effect. The Supreme Court in December upheld
 the constitutionality of the law permitting the decree.
 Following the May kidnaping of Conservative party leader
 Alvaro Gomez by the M-19 guerrillas and the public scandal
 caused by a subsequent television interview with one of the
 guerrilla leaders, all the major broadcast and print media
 signed a voluntary declaration promising not to publicize
 those terrorist actions designed primarily to gain publicity.
 As of the end of the year, however, many broadcasting
 companies were again airing interviews with guerrilla leaders.
 The most serious threat to freedom of expression comes from
 the narcotics traffickers, who both threaten and kill
 politicians, journalists, and others who publicly support
 extradition or strong antinarcotics measures. Following the
 release of major trafficker Jorge Luis Ochoa on December 30,
 1987, Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos made a series of
 public statements criticizing the Government for not
 extraditing the trafficker; he suggested ways to make
 extradition feasible. On January 25, Hoyos was kidnaped and
 murdered by a trafficker organization.
 
 
 506
 COLOMBIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly is respected. Public meetings
 and demonstrations are normally held without interference.
 Under the state of siege, prior permission is required for
 demonstrations and is usually granted, except when the
 Government believes there is a clear and imminent danger to
 public order. During 1988 no marches or demonstrations by
 major groups or parties were banned in the capital, Bogota,
 although some demonstrations were restricted in outlying towns
 and regions afflicted with guerrilla violence. A series of
 major marches organized by guerrilla groups in May were
 prevented from reaching departmental capitals by security
 forces because of a fear of violence. In one case, an army
 colonel-was attempting to persuade marchers to turn back when
 he was killed by armed guerrillas in their midst. In the
 resulting firefight, 9 civilian marchers were killed.
 Colombians have the constitutional right to form political
 parties, trade associations, unions, clubs, or groups of any
 type which do not advocate violence. Any organization is free
 to associate with international bodies in its field. This
 right is respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. According
 to official statistics, 217 different religious sects are
 registered in Colombia. Although the predominant position of
 the Catholic Church is established by a treaty between the
 Government and the Vatican, and the overwhelming majority of
 Colombians are Catholic, no legal discrimination exists
 against any religious group.
 The Government permits evangelism among Indians as long as the
 Indians welcome the missionaries and are not induced to adapt
 changes that inhibit their survival on traditional lands. The
 Government requires all missionary groups (Catholic and
 non-Catholic) to keep it informed of their activities and
 expects them to respond to guidance. Most of the large number
 of missionaries in Colombia indicate that they have
 encountered no obstacles.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel domestically and to leave and
 return to Colombia. In traveling through areas where
 operations against rural guerrillas are under way, civilians
 require "safe conduct" passes from the military; guerrillas
 reportedly use a similar means to restrict travel in areas
 under their control. There are no restrictions on
 emigration. Colombians who have sought and been granted
 diplomatic asylum in foreign embassies have always been
 allowed to depart the country. Expatriates can, by law,
 repatriate. Colombia uses accepted United Nations standards
 to determine the status of refugee and asylum seekers and does
 not turn away those who qualify.
 
 
 507
 COLOMBIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a democratic system of government, and elections
 are conducted fairly and openly. Persons are enfranchised by
 the Constitution at age 18. Those convicted of certain crimes
 may be disenfranchised. Public employees are forbidden by law
 to participate in political campaigns but, with the exception
 of military personnel, may vote.
 Colombian politics are dominated by two major parties, the
 Liberal and the Social Conservative, and each includes
 elements with widely divergent political views. All parties
 are free to raise funds, to field candidates, to hold public
 meetings, to have access to the media, and to publish their
 own newspapers. The UP, participating for the first time in
 national elections in 1986, and in local elections in 1988,
 had the best showing by a third party in recent history,
 gaining 3.1 percent of the total vote cast in city council
 elections in 1986, and less than 1 percent of the vote in the
 1988 mayorial elections. Legislation which for the first time
 provided for the direct election of mayors beginning in March
 1988 was signed into law by President Betancur on January 1,
 1986. On March 13, Colombia held elections widely accepted as
 fair; 17 different parties fielded candidates in Bogota.
 The law provides women equal political rights, and women
 currently serve as legislators, judges, governors of
 departments (states), political party leaders, government
 officials, and diplomats. Nevertheless, as in most of Latin
 America, Colombian women have a much harder time gaining
 positions of authority than do men. Social attitudes are
 changing slowly, however, and more women are now seen in
 executive and leadership positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Partly to counter the special AI report on Colombia in April,
 the Government actively sought out international human rights
 organizations-in 1988, inviting them to Colombia to
 investigate conditions. Alvaro Tirado traveled to New York
 specifically to request that the U.N. Committee on
 Disappearances visit Colombia. The delegation visited in
 October. The Government cooperated with AI during its
 investigations earlier in the year. The Organization of
 American States (OAS), the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the
 European Parliament have expressed support for the
 Government's efforts to improve the human rights situation.
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active nongovernmental Colombian human rights
 organization. The Committee's statistics have been used
 extensively by international organizations such as AI,
 Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on Latin America.
 The Committee, universities, and other groups regularly
 sponsor conferences to analyze-the violence in Colombia.
 Colombia is an active participant in international and
 regional human rights bodies, and was chosen as a member of
 the U.N. Human Rights Commission team which investigated human
 rights in Cuba in 1988. The office of the presidential
 Counselor for Human Rights sponsored a Human Rights Awareness
 Week in schools throughout the country in May. Students were
 encouraged to report any suspected abuses to either
 
 
 508
 COLOMBIA
 governmental or nongovernmental bodies, international as well
 as national.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law provides women equal civil and property rights. Women
 comprise just over 25 percent of the country's economically
 active population but are concentrated in low-income sectors.
 Their inferior economic situation is especially pronounced in
 rural areas. However, the historically higher unemployment
 rate for women has decreased in recent years. Women are
 legally entitled to remuneration equal to that of their male
 counterparts, a law generally respected more by the Government
 than private industry. As more women graduate from
 universities and participate in the work force, they are
 increasingly active at all levels of society. Women currently
 comprise 40 percent of the university population.
 Colombian Indians legally enjoy all rights and privileges of
 full citizenship. However, Indian rights groups protest that
 they suffer a variety of abuses, and they are seeking to
 promote local improvements through community action, public -
 education, and legal aid. The most common complaint is that
 Indians are forced off contested land by armed thugs hired by
 landowners. When the Indians retaliate, the landowners call
 on local police and military forces for protection. The
 presidential Counselor for Human Rights was active in 1988 to
 find ways to improve the protection of Indian rights. He has
 recently been successful in having legislation passed calling
 on the Government to designate or purchase additional land for
 collective Indian use.
 .Section 6 Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize labor unions and strike is
 recognized specifically in the Constitution, although public
 service unions may not strike. 'Law 26 of 1976 affirms the
 autonomy of labor organizations to produce their own statutes
 and rules, to elect trade union officials, and to administer
 their own activities. Law 26 also prohibits the dissolution
 or suppression of trade unions by administrative fiat and
 allows the almost automatic granting of official status to
 labor organizations with the requisite number of members.
 While the right to strike is guaranteed, the steps required
 before a legal strike may be called include direct
 negotiations, followed by conciliation, and only then may the
 problem advance to the stage of either a strike or arbitration
 by the Labor Ministry. Arbitration is compulsory in the
 public service sector and for official employees who legally
 do not have the right to strike. In the private sector the
 Minister of Labor may intervene in a dispute at the stage of
 conciliation and when it affects the national economy.
 Almost half of the country's 1.2 million unionized workers
 belong to the Unitary Workers Central (CUT), formed in 1986.
 Although the CUT is not officially a member of the
 Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), it
 is heavily influenced by its pro-Moscow Communist component
 and has retained strong links to the international Communist
 labor movement. The remaining union members belong to three
 long-established confederations, two of which are affiliated
 with the International

 COLOMBIA
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the third with
 the Christian Democratic World Confederation of Labor (WCL).
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on
 Freedom of Association in its meeting in November extensively
 reviewed a number of previous cases and reached interim
 conclusions on five current complaints against Colombia
 relating to allegations concerning murder, disappearances,
 arrests and assaults, anti-union discrimination, and the
 Government's processing of requests for legal recognition of
 trade unions. The Committee took note of the ILO's August 31
 to September 7, 1988, mission to Colombia, thanked the
 Government for its full cooperation, and expressed its deep
 concern at the dramatic situation of violence which impedes
 the full exercise of trade union activities. In addition, the
 Committee expressed shock at the very-high number of murders
 and disappearances, noting its serious concern that over 200
 trade union leaders and members, mostly linked to the CUT,
 were among the victims. It urged the Government to adopt
 vigorous measures to dismantle paramilitary groups which the
 report identified as the authors, along with hired assassins,
 of a majority of the murders of trade unionists; and requested
 the Government to strengthen the human and financial resources
 of the judiciary. The representative of the Government of
 Colombia termed the situation in his country as urgent, stated
 that the Government was doing everything possible to counter
 the violence, and expressed appreciation to the Committee for
 its recommendations. (See Section l.a for a discussion of
 violence directed against unions.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize labor unions and to engage in
 collective bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. At
 the present time, unions have been successful in organizing
 only the largest firms and the public services, which include
 about 12 percent of Colombia's economically active population.
 In the private sector, workers have the right to bargain
 collectively; however, because of high unemployment, they have
 limited bargaining power. Use of strikebreakers is prohibited
 by law, and generous severance benefits tend to discourage
 management from firing union militants. However, this
 provision, like other provisions of labor law, are effectively
 ignored by small and medium-size enterprises.
 Colombian labor law is applied uniformly throughout the
 country, including in its small export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited, and the
 prohibition is respected in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly where such employment might
 interfere with schooling. This provision is respected in
 larger enterprises and major cities. However, the extensive
 informal economy is effectively outside government control.
 Approximately 2.5 million children under 15 work in the
 informal sector. for low pay under poor conditions with little
 protection from the labor code.

 COLOMBIA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government annually sets a national minimum wage which
 serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 minimum wage (about $100.00 per month as of December 1988) is
 barely sufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of
 living. However, despite an inflation rate running close to
 24 percent, purchasing power only grew 2.3 percent in 1988.
 One report noted that 60 percent of the work force is paid the
 minimum wage or less.
 The labor code regulates the hours of labor and other work
 conditions. While the 8-hour day is standard in larger
 companies, the workweek-for most Colombians generally exceeds
 40 hours. A standard week of five 8-hour days remains an
 important long-term goal of Colombian trade unions.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively
 regulated, including use of protective clothing and
 ventilation, first aid and fire fighting equipment at the job
 site, sanitary facilities and potable water, and compensation
 for injuries. These regulations apply to the larger
 agricultural enterprises as well as industry and mining.
 However, exemptions for small companies, the frequent use of
 workers as subcontractors rather than employees, and general
 enforcement difficulties leave large numbers of workers
 outside the protection of the law. The Government is
 endeavoring to improve regulatory enforcement and improved
 work conditions are a priority goal of trade unions.
 Violations appear to be more frequent among the newer, smaller
 industries. Between 1982 and 1985, Labor Ministry inspection
 visits to 12,452 companies established that only 8.4 percent
 of them observed all the labor-related legal regulations,
 while 91.2 percent of the companies violated an average of
 four labor regulations each. More than balf of all the
 violators were concentrated in the commerce, restaurant, and
 hotel industries, while almost one fourth were in the
 manufacturing sector. Labor regulations most frequently
 violated by management were mandatory affiliation of workers
 to the Social Security Institute, observance of minimum salary
 levels, timely payment of salaries, and maintenance of
 hygienic and occupational safety conditions.
