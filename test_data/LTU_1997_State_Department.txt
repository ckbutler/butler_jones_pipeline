 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy, having regained its independence in
 1990 after more than 50 years of forced annexation by the Soviet Union. The Con-
 stitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, established a 141-member unicameral leg-
 islature, the Seimas; a directly elected president, who functions as Head of State;
 and a government formed by a prime minister and other ministers, appointed by
 the President and approved by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority
 with the approval of the Seimas and the President. In fair elections in 1992, the
 Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP)-the successor to the Communist Party
 of Lithuania, which in 1989 broke away from the Soviet Communist Party-won a
 majority of parliamentary seats and formed the Government. In 1993 voters elected
 Algirdas Brazauskas, then Chairman of the LDDP, as President. The Conservatives
 prevailed in the October and November parliamentary elections, followed by the
 Christian Democrats. The two parties formed a coalition government (the first in
 Lithuania's history).
 A unified national police force under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry is
 responsible for law enforcement. The State Security Department is responsible for
 internal security and reports to Parliament and the President. The police committed
 a number of human rights abuses.
 Since independence, Lithuania has made steady progress in developing a market
 economy. Over 40 percent of state property, in addition to most housing and small
 businesses, has been privatized. Trade is diversifying, and expanding both to the
 West and the East. The largest number of residents are employed in agriculture
 (21.7 percent), followed by industrial enterprises (20.7 percent, including electricity,
 gas, and water supply) and wholesale and retail trade (16 percent). About 33.3 per-
 cent of those employed work for state enterprises, while 66.7 percent are employed
 by private companies. The agricultural sector's high proportion of the work force re-
 flects a lack of efficient consolidation of small private farms and represents a vocal
 protectionist current in economic policy debate. The banking system remains weak,
 but laws on banking control and supervision are in place and a number of large pri-
 vate banks are undergoing outside audits. The inflation rate for the first half of
 1997 was 4.8 percent, compared with an annual rate of 13.1 percent for 1996. Per
 
 
 1173
 capita gross domestic product for the first half of 1997 was estimated at $1,200
 (4,800 lias) and unemployment at mid-year was 5.3 percent. The balance of trade
 remains negative due to imports of gas and other energy products from Russia.
 Major exports include textile and kmtwear products, tin, her and furniture, elec-
 tronic goods, food, and chemical and petroleum products.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but problems
 remain in some areas. Police on occasion beat detainees and abuse detention laws.
 The Government is making some progress in bringing police corruption under con-
 trol. Prison conditions remain poor.
 The police investigated the desecration of one Jewish site and one Polish site but
 identified no suspects. State media continues to be subject to political interests. Vio-
 lence and discrimination against women and child abuse are serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There is a problem, however, of women who have been forced or willingly sold into
 prostitution by organized crime figures (see Section 5). Their families, unaware of
 the situation, claim that they have disappeared or have been kidnaped.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and there were no reports of its use.
 However, police sometimes beat or otherwise physically mistreated detainees. The
 local press reported that incidents of police brutality are becoming more common.
 In many instances, the victims reportedly are reluctant to bring charges against po-
 lice officers for fear of reprisals. A total of 85 officers were dismissed for illegal or
 fraudulent activities in the first 6 months of 1997 for a variety of offenses, including
 41 persons convicted of committing crimes. The Interior Ministry states that district
 police inspectors are the most negligent in the force. To strengthen the integrity of
 the police, the Ins]ectorate General of the interior ministry was given administra-
 tive autonomy in May.
 Human rights violations committed by noncommissioned military personnel con-
 tinue, despite efforts to quash criminal bullying-a practice inherited from the
 former Soviet armed forces. However, such violations decreased compared with
 1996, when there were 121 incidents and 10 legal cases were brought. In the first
 6 months of 1997, 29 incidents were reported with four cases fied. According to the
 Ministry of National Defense, most trauma inflicted on conscripts is psychological
 rather than physical: there were four cases of assault, one case of a broken cheek-
 bone and one concussion recorded in 1996 and in the first half of 1997 there were
 two cases of assault, two cases of broken bones, and one concussion. The Ministry
 believes that a lack of professionalism among noncommissioned officers-rather
 than ethnic, regional, or social factors-is a primary factor in cases of hazing, and
 it is working actively to improve the skills and judgment of such officers.
 Prison conditions are poor. Due to limited resources, most prisons are over-
 crowded and poorly maintained. Prisoners on death row or serving life sentences are
 required to wear special striped uniforms. Human rights monitors are permitted to
 visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Except in cases that come under provi-
 sions of the Preventive Detention Law (described below), police may detain a person
 for up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. Under a law
 passed in June, a judge must also approve the detention. At the endof that period,
 police must decide whether or not to make a formal arrest, and a magistrate must
 approve an arrest warrant. The authorities have a total of 10 days to present sup-
 porting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may keep the sus-
 pect under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the suspect to court.
 In exceptional cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a further 6 to 9
 months with the written approval of the Prosecutor General. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the right to an attorney from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with the rise in violent organized crime, in 1993 Parliament
 passed the Preventive Detention Law pertaining to persons suspected of being vio-
 lent criminals. The law, which was passed as a temporary measure and lasted until
 1997, allowed police, but not the internal security and armed forces, to detain sus-
 pected violent criminals for up to 2 months rather than only for the standard 72-
 hour period. The effect of the law is to give prosecutors and investigators additional
 time to conduct an investigation and fie formal criminal charges against the de-
 tainee. Those apprehended must be released after 2 months if an investigation does
 
 
 1174
 not lead to formal charges. Local police commissioners must obtain the Prosecutor
 General's approval of each arrest carried out under the provisions of this law. In
 the first 6 months of the year, 303 people were detained pursuant to this law com-
 pared with over 338 for all of 1996. Of the 303, 185 were released after 2 months,
 as their guilt had not been proven.
 The Parliament voted in December 1995 to extend this law for an additional year,
 maintaining provisions carried over from 1995 modifications, including checks on
 prosecutorial abuse. The law requires that a detainee must be informed within 3
 hours following arrest about the length of the preventive detention being considered
 (not to exceed 2 months), and must be brought before a court within 48 hours of
 arrest for a ruling on the legality of the detention. Furthermore, a detainee has the
 legal right to consult with an attorney during the period of detention. The law gives
 law enforcement officials wide latitude in making arrest decisions and may be open
 to abuse. Parliamentarians who voted against the extension stated thatpreventive
 detention was not in keeping with the Constitution and the European Convention
 on Basic Human Rights and-Freedoms. The Prosecutor General, however, reported
 that although a drastic measure, it is effective. In several well-publicized cases, the
 law helped to convict and sentence dangerous criminals to lengthy prison terms. In
 many other instances, however, the suspects were freed without charge after expira-
 tion of the maximum detention period, leading some observers to believe that the
 police are abusing the length of the detention period provided by this law.
 There is no provision for exile, nor is it practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is independent in p ractice.
 Efforts continued in 1996 to reform legal codes imposed during the Soviet era.
 Parliament passed new civil and criminal procedure codes as well as a Court Reform
 Law in 1995. The judicial system presently' consists of a two-tier structure of district
 courts and a Supreme Court, which is an appellate court. There is also a Constitu-
 tional Court. Court decisions are arrived at independently. The Prosecutor General
 exercises an oversight responsibility through a network of district prosecutors who
 work with police investigators-employed by the Ministry of the Interior-in prepar-
 ing the prosecution's evidene for th e us       institution of lay assessors was
 abolished at the end of 1994.
 Under the provisions of the Court Reform Law, two new kinds of courts were cre-
 ated. Local district courts were set up below the present district courts to handle
 cases at the municipal level, while a new appellate court level hears appeals arising
 from distric t  u  decisions, thereby reducing the case load of the overurdened Su-
 preme Court. In addition a commercial court is in operation through the district
 courts.
 An arbitration system is pending. In addition, as a result of accession to the
 Council of Europe, the Ministry of Justice has begun a thorough review of Lithua-
 nia's laws with a view towards bringming theinto accord with the provisions of the
 European Convention on Human Rights.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. In practice the
 right to legal counsel is abridged by the shortage of trained advocates who find it
 difcult to cope with the burgeoning numbers of criminal cases brought before the
 courts. Outside observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender
 system to regularize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons
 charged in criminal cases. By law defense advocates have access to government evi-
 dence and may present evidence and witnesses. The courts and law enforcement
 agencies generally honor routine, written requests for evidence.
 Government rehabilitation of over 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes
 during the Stalin era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been
 involved with crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation had benefited
 from this rehabilitation. A special judicial procedure was established to examine
 each case in which an individual or organization raised an objection that a rehabili-
 tated person may have committed a crime against humanity. In 1994 the Supreme
 Court overturned the rehabilitation of three persons whose cases were pending from
 1993; there have been no such rulings by the Supreme Court since that time, al-
 though preparations to establish a legal procedure for regulating the annulment of
 rehabilitation are under way.
 Formal charges have yet to be brought against Aleksandras Lileikis, an alleged
 war criminal. After being stripped of his U.S. citizenship in May 1996 for concealing
 his World War II activities, that allegedly included acts of genocide when he headed
 the security police of the Vilnius district under Nazi control, Lileikis returned to
 Lithuania. Prosecutor General Kazys Pednycia actively investigated the case after
 his appointment in February, and was prepared to prosecute Lileikis by the end
 of June. However, the law stipulates that the accused cannot be prosecuted f his
 
 
 1175
 
 medical condition is poor. At 90 years of age, Lileikis is not healthy. Given the scope
 of his alleged crimes, however, the Government and Parliament sought mechanisms
 to allow prosecution to proceed. Legislation allowing a case to be presented through
 the defense attorney to the accused unanimously passed the Seimas on December
 23. The prosecution of Aleksandras Lileikis is expected to proceed in January 1998.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The authorities do not engage in in-
 discriminate or widespread monitoring of the correspondence or communications of
 citizens. With the written authorization of a prosecutor or judge, however, police
 and the security service may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on
 grounds of national security. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of dis-
 appearance of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor
 before the may enter private premises.
 It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
 use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
 crime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this police surveillance, but
 there are no known legal challenges to such surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press. The Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Prior restraint over either print or broadcast media and restrictions on disclosure
 are prohibited, unless the Government determines that national security is involved.
 The'Parliament adopted its long-awaited media law in July 1996, after a draft pub-
 lic information law failed to pass in November 1995 because most independent news
 publications and many prominent journalists protested that it was too restrictive.
 e new media law introduced an element of self-regulation but postponed a dif-
 ficult decision on television advertising. Under the new law, the media are to create
 a special ethics commission and ombudsman to check libel cases and other com-
 plaints. The final version of the law allows reporting on the private-lives of officials
 as long as the information affects the welfare of the people.
 The independent print media has flourished since independence, including a wide
 range of economic newspapers and specialty magazines. Officially there are over
 2,000 newspapers and magazines registered, but only a fraction are still published.
 Many investigative journalists covering organized crime were harassed by and re-
 ceived death threats from organized "crime families."
 State radio and five private radio stations broadcast throughout the country. In
 addition to state television which is in the process of being transformed into public
 television, three private television stations also broadcast regular programming na-
 tionwide. Additional radio and television stations, including a Polish-language radio
 station in the Vilnius region, are found throughout the country in population cen-
 ters.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 The Communist Party of Lithuania and other organizations associated with the
 Soviet regime continue to be banned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government generally respects this provision in practice. The Law on Religious
 Communities and Associations was passed in October 1995. It grants religious com-
 munities, associations, and centers property rights to prayer houses, homes, and
 other buildings and permits construction necessary for their activities. Article 5 of
 this law mentions nine religious communities that have been declared "traditional"
 by the law and therefore are eligible for governmental assistance: Latin Rite Catho-
 lics, Greek Rite Catholics, Evangelical Lutherans, Evangelical Reformers, Orthodox,
 Old Believers, Jews, Sunni Muslims, and Karaites. There are no restrictions on the
 activities of other religious communities.
 Relations between the Government and the officially registered Jewish community
 are good. However, the Hasidic Chabad Lubavich community is having difficulties
 registering as a traditional Jewish religion. The Ministry of Justice argues that the
 Chabad Lubavich is not a part of Lithuania's historical, spiritual, or social heritage
 and therefore cannot be registered as traditional (Article 5 of the Law on Religious
 Communities and Associations). The Ministry states that the Chabad Lubavich does
 not have a continuity of traditions and is a separate branch of Judaism than that
 followed by the traditional Lithuanian Jewish religious community. Furthermore,
 they state that the Hasidic movement only began in Lithuania in the 18th century
 and has been suspended twice. The        d Lubavich counter that the suspension
 
 
 1176
 of their activity during the war years and after was imposed by Nazi and Soviet
 occupiers. They also have protested the disassociation of the Hasidic movement from
 Judaism. The Chabad Lubavich continue to press for recognition as a traditional re-
 ligion. They have been allowed to operate a kindergarten.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted free
 movement within the country and the right to return to the country. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel.
 In January Lithuania ratified the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refu-
 gees or its 1967 Protocol. In July, the Law on Refugee Status came into effect, allow-
 ing for the first formal grant of refugee status to qualified applicants.
 A growing number of economic migrants and refugees prompted the government
 to designate appropriate facilities for their use. A registration center for migrants
 and refugees is in the town of pabrade, while a refugee reception center was opened
 during the year in the town of Rukla. The latter, which has approximately 50 resi-
 dents, has facilities for integrating those persons granted refugee status into society.
 The Government seeks to deport those who remain at Pabrade-about 800 economic
 migrants largely from South Asia and China-but has difficulty doing so due to the
 high cost of such deportation and the lack of cooperation from the migrants' home
 countries. The Rukla facility is modern and has adequate facilities; at Pabrade,
 where conditions are very rudimentary and the housing is overcrowded, the mi-
 grants besieged the Lithuanian employees on two occasions during the year in pro-
 test. The Government has received some financial assistance from international ref-
 ugee organizations to subsidize the repatriation of some refugees who returned vol-
 untarily.
 Lithuania continued its efforts to stem the tide of illegal migrants through nego-
 tiating readmission agreements with Russia and Belarus, the two countries used by
 most migrants to reach Lithuania. The Government cooperates with the office of the
 United �ational High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian orgamza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise
 in 1997. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Of 171 seats in the Seimas, 71 are
 elected directly and 70 are elected through proportional representation. Only those
 parties that receive more than 5 percent of the total ballots (or 7 percent for coali-
 tions) are allowed representation in the Parliament. National minority slates had
 been exempt from this law in the past, but despite the 5 percent threshold ethnic
 Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, and Jews were all elected to the seimas in the fall
 1996 parliamentary elections. The Citizenship Law, adopted in 1991 and amended
 in October 1995, is inclusive with regard to the country's ethnic minorities. The law
 provides citizenship to persons who were born within the borders of the Republic;
 who were citizens of Lithuania prior to 1940 and their descendants; or who became
 citizens under previous legal authority. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's ethnic
 Russian, Polish, Belarusian, and Ukrainian inhabitants received citizenship.
 Qualification for naturalization of persons not covered by the above-mentioned
 categories requires a 10-year residency, a permanent job or source of income, knowl-
 edge of the Constitution, renunciation of any other citizenship, and proficiency in
 Lithuanian.
 While there are no legal restrictions on women s participation in politics or gov-
 ernment, they are underrepresented in political leadership positions. There are 24
 female deputies and 2 female ministers in the 17-member Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Most government authorities cooperate with local nongovernmental organizations
 and actively encourage visits by international and nongovernmental human rights
 groups. A key exception is the Ministry of Interior, that has continually refused to
 release information on police brutality and statistics on corruption-related incidents.
 The Association for the Defense of Human Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella orga-
 nization for several small human rights groups, all of which operate without govern-
 ment restriction. In 1994 the Government established the Department of Inter-
 national and Human Rights within the Ministry of Justice, which monitors law and
 
 
 1177
 legal practice to determine whether these are in accord with Lithuania's inter-
 national obligations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or ethnic background. However, discrimination against women persists.
 Women.-Abuse of women at home is reportedly common, especially in connection
 with alcohol abuse by husbands, but institutional mechanisms for coping with this
 problem are only now being formed. A womens shelter funded in part with Nor-
 wegian assistance is now in operation. According to one sociological survey, 20 per-
 cent of women reported experiencing an attempted rape, while another 33 percent
 reported having been beaten at least once in their lives. The number of rapes re-
 ported in the first half of 1997 (88) is proportionally the same as the 168 rapes re.
 ported for all of 1996. Official statistics on the incidence of abuse of women in the
 home are not filed separately from other categories of assault. Unlike in 1996 the
 Ministry of Interior did not provide statistics on the number of women killed due
 to arguments resulting from jealousy or domestic problems, although one of the
 most prominent victims of such a crime was the senior civil servant in the Ministry
 of Public Administration Reform and Municipal Affairs. Persons convicted of rape
 generally receive sentences of from 3 to 5 years in prison.
 A number of women, some underage, have been enticed or forced and sold into
 prostitution abroad by organized crime figures. Some go consciously, hoping to be-
 come wealthy; others are lured by deceptive offers of seemingly innocent jobs as
 household helpers, bar dancers, or waitresses. Women are also tricked into prostitu-
 tion through false marriage advertisements. Their families are often unaware of
 their predicament and believe that they have disappeared or been kidnaped. An offi-
 cial from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that about 99 percent of women
 who have been reported missing are actually working as prostitutes abroad.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for men and women, and official policy
 specifies equal pay for equal work. Generally, men and women receive the same pay
 for comparable work, but women are significantly underrepresented in some profes-
 sions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Significant inequalities in society
 based on gender continue, and there are still very conservative views about the role
 of women. The fact that women's enrollment now exceeds that of men in some uni-
 versity departments has prompted university administrators to introduce pref-
 erential entrance criteria for men to redress what is perceived as an abnormal state
 of affairs. Parliamentary deputies speaking about female deputies in public some-
 times make unflattering comments based on gender stereotypes without eliciting
 any public reaction.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Security and of the Interior- share official re-
 sponsibility for the protection of children's rights and welfare. Starting in 1994, the
 Children's Rights Service of the Ministry of Social Security has taken on many of
 the functions formerly handled by the Interior Ministry and its subordinate police
 officers throughout the country, thereby focusing more attention on the social wel-
 fare needs of-children. There are 56 branches of the Children's Rights Protection
 Council throughout the country. This Council registers and cares for children in
 abusive and dysfunctional families, and had registered 30 000 children this year.
 Child abuse is a problem. The press has been thorou gh in reporting increases in
 cruelty to children, including sexual abuse, intentional starvation, beatings, and
 murder. Authorities reported that 73 children were killed by their parents in 1996.
 No department or organization collects information on child abuse, however. More-
 over, there are no specific criminal codes for child pornography, sexual abuse, or sex
 tourism. There is only one rehabilitation center in the country for children who have
 been sexually abused.
 Social welfare workers believe that child abuse in connection with alcohol abuse
 by parents is a serious problem. Moreover, the prevalence of authoritarian values
 family u bringin has discouraged more active measures against child abuse.
 People W   - - ailities.-Legalprovisions for access to buildings for people with
 disabilities are in place but are not widely enforced; the vast majority of public
 buildings remain inaccessible to such persons.
 More than 350,000 people with disabilities live in Lithuania-10,000 of them chil-
 dren. The 1991 Law on Integrating Disabled People, provides for a broad category
 of rights and public benefits to which disabled people are legaly entitled. The Par-
 liament allotted $10.5 million for persons with disabilities and as spent $3.6 mil-
 lion as of September. A project in Kaunas to build an apartment building for per-
 sons with disabilities has not been completed. A center for deaf children has been
 created, as has a program for children with special orthopedic problems.
 
 
 1178
 Religious Minorities.-Jewish and Polish community leaders expressed their con-
 cern regarding desecration of cemeteries and monuments in each of their commu-
 nities. In both cases, national and local authorities responded promptly. The dese-
 crations were condemned by senior officials and investigated by the police; however,
 no suspects were identified and no charges were brought.
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Minority ethnic groups-including Russians,
 Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Tatars, and Karaites--comprise rougbly 20 percent
 of the country's citizens. There were calls during the year, mostly from the Polish
 community, for the resignation of the Education Minister after he made public re-
 marks that were interpreted to mean that foreign language instruction in schools
 would cease. The Government subsequently confirmed that there was no intention
 of ending current instruction in the languages of ethnic minorities.
 Many nonethnic Lithuanian public sector employees were required to attain a
 functional knowledge of Lithuanian within several years, although the authorities
 have been granting liberal extensions of the time frame in which this is to be
 achieved. During the first 6 months of 1997, 2,484 persons applied for citizenship.
 Citizenship was granted to 952 of them, based in part on their Lithuanian language
 ability. There is no documented evidence of job dismissals based on the language
 law. The authorities have indicated that the intent of the law is to apply moral in-
 centives to learn Lithuanian as the official language of the State; they have asserted
 that no one would be dismissed solely because of an inability to meet the language
 requirements.
 In Vilnius, isolated attacks on foreigners-including French, Japanese and Kazak
 diplomats who in two cases required extensive medical treatment-have occurred
 throughout the year. Authorities have taken steps to curtail such attacks through
 an increased police presence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1991 Law on Trade Unions
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 Law on Trade Unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security
 related work. In 1990 the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Union's All-Union
 Central Council of Trade Unions, including 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself
 the Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CFTU) and began asserting increased inde-
 pendence from its Soviet parent. In 1993 the CFTU joined eight other unions that
 also had been part of the All-Union Central Council to form the Lithuanian Trade
 Union Center (LTUC).
 The Lithuanian Workers' Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to
 the CFTU. Unlike the CFTU/LTUC, the LWU was an early supporter of Lithuanian
 independence from the Soviet Union and actively sought western free trade union
 contacts. The LWU claims a dues-paying membership of 78,000 organized in 35 re-
 gional groupings.
 The Law on Trade Unions and the Constitution provide for the right to strike,
 although public officials providing essential services may not do so. Many workers
 threatened to strike because of low wages, but there were no major strikes in 1997.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Collective Agreements
 Law provides for collective bargaining and the right of unions to organize employ-
 ees, although several provisions reportedly hinder the establishment of new union
 organizations. According to the law, unions, in order to be registered, must have at
 least 30 founding members in large enterprises or have a membership of one-fifth
 of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties commonly arise in state enter-
 prises in which employees are represented by more than one union. LWU officials
 charge that managers in some state enterprises discriminate ag t LWU organiz-
 ers and have on occasion dismissed employees in retribution for their trade union
 activities. The LWU also charges that the judicial system is slow to respond to LWU
 grievances regarding dismissals from work. LWU representatives claim that state
 managers sometimes prefer the CFTU/LTUC over LWU unions as collective bar-
 gaining partners.
 In general trade union spokesmen say that managers often determine wages with-
 out regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-organized
 trade unions. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as guidelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 sions are increasingly being made at the enterrise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some control over this sphere in state-owned enterprises. The
 
 
 1179
 LWU reports that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in gov-
 enent ministries that own enterprises. During the first 6 months of 1996 prices
 increased faster than the growth of wage increases, thereby reversing a process of
 real wage growth that had begun in 1993.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor by all, including children, and this prohibition is observed in
 practice. There are no reports that it occurred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and this prohibi-
 tion is observed in practice.
 The legal minimum age for employment of children without parental consent is
 16 years. The legal minimum age for employment is 16 years; with the written con-
 sent of parents, it is 14 years. Free trade union representatives assert that the
 mechanisms for monitoring minimum age legislation are rudimentary. Complaints
 about infringement of child labor regulations generally are referred to local prosecu-
 tors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop violations. Available
 evidence suggests that child labor is rare.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage was raised in 1997
 from $75 (300 litas) to $100 (400 litas) per month. The minimum wage does not pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The average wage in the
 public sector is $215 (861 litas)per month. The Council of Ministers and the Min-
 istry of Social Security periodically adjust the minimum wage. Every 3 months these
 government bodies must submit their minimum wage proposals to the Seimas,
 which has the right to approve or revise the minimum wage level. Enforcement of
 the minimum wage is almost nonexistent, in part because the Government does not
 want to exacerbate unemployment. The 40-hour workweek is standard, with a prvi-
 sion for at least one 2-hour rest pod. For a majority of the population, living
 standards remain low. The poorest households spend 66 percent of their income on
 food, compared 45 percent in wealthier households
 The Constitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In 1993 a Labor Safety Law went into effect, setting the rights of
 workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State Labor Inspection Serv-
 ice, which the law established, is charged with implementing the Labor Safety Law.
 Regional labor inspection offices, each of which employs only two to three officials,
 are severely understaffed. They closed 40 enterprises or departments of enterprises
 found to be in violation of safety regulations during the first 6 months of this year.
 Unsafe conditions caused by worn, outdated industrial technologies are reportedly
 widespread, and 34 work-related deaths were recorded in the first six months of
 1997 compared with 98 work-related deaths for all of 1996.
