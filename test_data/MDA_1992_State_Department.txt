 MOLDOVA
 The Republic of Moldova declared its independence from the Soviet Union after
 the failure of the August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow. Most of the Republic was
 part of Romania between 1918 and 1940, and the majority of its population is Roma-
 nian-speaking. The President, Mircea Snegur, was elected by the Parliament in July
 1990. A former government official of the Soviet Union, Snegur left the Communist
 Party in 1989. After independence, he sought a stronger mandate. In direct presi-
 dential elections held in December 1991, Snegur won an overwhelming victory de-
 spite opposition calls for a boycott. Independent observers interpreted the results as
 support for Snegur's pragmatic policies on Moldovan independence, negotiations
 with domestic secessionists, and economic reform.
 During 1992 Moldova took steps to consolidate itself as an independent country
 and to effect the transition to democracy and a market economy. This process was
 hampered by an ineffective Parliament, the lack of a new constitution, and above
 all by the military conflict that occurred in the Trans-Dniester area. In this area,
 which includes the eastern (left) bank of the Dniester river, about 60 percent of the
 population is Russian-speaking, and Slavs are a substantial majority in the major
 cities there.
 There were two significant separatist movements within Moldova. In the south,
 the Gagauz (Christian Turkish) minority sought a special status. In the
 Transnistrian region, a separatist movement, led by a group that supported the
 1991 attempted coup detat in Moscow, initially sought independence for the region
 but has on occasion indicated a willingness to accept a federal solution. It won the
 support of some of the Russian-speaking minority in the region, capitalizing on their
 fears of ethnic discrimination and of the possible reunification of Moldova with Ro-
 mania. While there is some question concerning the extent of local Slavic support
 for the current Transnistrian leadership, it is clear that most ethnic Romanians in
 the region do not support the Transnistrian authorities.
 Elements of the Russian 14th Army actively supported and provided arms to the
 separatist militia ("Guardists"), although the Russian Federation stated this was
 done without official authorization. A cease-fire, brokered by Russian President
 Boris Yeltsin, was signed on July 21. Fighting ended as a Russian-Moldovan-
 Transnistrian peacekeeping force moved into place; at year's end, negotiations on
 the political status of the region continued.
 The current government structure is neither presidential nor parliamentary. It is
 in a transitional stage, awaiting real political reform. Parliament was elected in
 1990 for a 5-year term under'the rules of the former Supreme Soviet. There are cur-
 rently approximately 350 deputies, but about 65 representatives from the
 Transnistrian region have boycotted Parliament, most since 1991. Although Par-
 liament worked on a new constitution, approval would require a two-thirds
 majority-   difficult to achieve given the continued absence of deputies from the
 Transnistrian region along with approximately 75 others who rarely fulfill their par-
 liamentary functions. Resolution of the political status of the Trans-Dniester area
 should contribute to further political reform.
 A new Government was selected in July after extensive negotiations among var-
 ious factions. The Prime Minister was a leader of the Agrarians, the largest single
 group in Parliament. Other parliamentary groups include the Christian Democratic
 
 
 848
 Popular Front (CDPF), which favors reunion with Romania, and the Group for Con-
 ciliation, consisting mostly of Russian-speaking deputies. There are also a number
 of independents. Due to the large number of parliamentarians absent, a small group
 can block adoption of laws and government appointments it opposes.
 The Moldovan armed forces are in a formative stage. Current manpower is about
 7,000. Difficulties with training and equipment hamper the development of a mod-
 ern force, although agreements for training of personnel exist with Russia and Ro-
 mania. Claims that Moldova has purchased some military equipment from Romania
 are credible, but the type or quantity cannot be confirmed. Internal law and order
 are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which controls the police. There
 are mechanisms to provide for limited parliamentary oversight of the activities of
 the security organs. Independent observers report that some prisoners taken during
 the fighting in the Transnistrian region suffered mistreatment, including beatings,
 from Moldovan police, armed forces members, or volunteers before they were turned
 over to officials at prison or detention facilities.
 Moldova's largely agricultural economy deteriorated in 1992, and progress on eco-
 nomic reform was limited. Prices rose while output fell, and many goods were in
 short supply. Laws laying the groundwork for a market system were passed, but im-
 plementation of market-oriented economic reforms was delayed by the fighting in
 Transnistria and by Parliament's generally cautious approach to economic reform.
 In September Moldova unified the exchange rate for the ruble at the market rate,
 abolishing various old rates, including an unfavorable rate for foreign investors.
 In general, the human rights situation in Moldova improved in 1992, despite con-
 tinued tensions between ethnic groups and political forces. Questions concerning
 ethnic minorities remain pressing, and the legal framework to ensure protection of
 their rights is not yet established. Allegations of employment discrimination against
 minorities continued. Language policy has been a source of friction as the Govern-
 ment linked government employment to proficiency in Romanian. The inclusion of
 several non-Romanian speakers in the Government and statements supporting re-
 consideration of the language policy in the Transnistrian region were positive steps
 but not sufficient to reassure Russian speakers who fear the loss of their jobs due
 to this policy. The fighting in the Transnistrian region led to deaths and injuries,
 both of combatants and of civilians. Allegations of serious human rights abuses were
 widespread. However, while some abuses occurred, press reports on both sides exag-
 gerated their actual extent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHIS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were a number of accusations
 of politically motivated killings in the Transnistrian region in connection with the
 fighting there during 1992. Each side in the conflict accused the other's forces of
 killings, although there are still no reliable figures to indicate the scale of the
 abuses. Opponents of the separatists have presented detailed accounts of
 extrajudicial killings by the "Guardists" (armed supporters of the separatist move-
 ment), and there is substantial evidence to support at least some of these allega-
 tions. It does not appear that the separatist-controlled prosecutor's office in the re-
 gion has undertaken any investigation of these accusations. The Transnistrian side
 claimed that Moldovan hit squads were active in the area. One separatist leader,
 Nicolse Ostapenko, was killed in the spring. According to Transnistrian authorities,
 a group of ethnic Romanians were responsible for the killing (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government of Moldova does not exert effective control over most of the
 former conflict zone. Moldovan government police and prosecutors have been dis-
 missed or forced to flee the area. Therefore, central authorities cannot take steps
 to apprehend or punish those on either side responsible for human rights violations
 in the region.
 b. Disappearance. -There were a number of cases of disappearances in the conflict
 zone between March and July. Opponents of the separatist regime, regardless of
 ethnic background, were the chief targets. There are no reliable estimates of the
 numbers involved, although in several villages in the conflict zone there were re-
 ports that between 30 and 40 people were missin and resumed dead, whether as
 a consequence of the fighting or due to direct attacksby  uardists is not clear. Even
 after the cease-fire and installation of Russian-Moldovan-Transnistrian peacekeep-
 ing forces, opponents of the separatists maintained, with some credibility, that
 Guardists continued to be active in abduction, especially of young men. The militia
 of the separatist-controlled city of Dubossary was singled out as a perpetrator of oc-
 casional abductions and disappearances.
 
 
 849
 There were no allegations of politically motivated disappearances outside the con-
 flict zone.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations of torture of civil or criminal prisoners by Moldovan au-
 thorities in 1992. An absence of oversight over police activities, however, may have
 led to the use of excessive force in some cases against those detained for investiga-
 tion of alleged criminal acts. During 1992 there were news accounts of several alle-
 gations of such mistreatment; however, it appears that no disciplinar action was
 taken as a result of accusations aginst police. The Government permitted the rep-
 resentatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisons
 and verify that torture and other abuses do not occur.
 Torture and other atrocities were reported in the Transnistrian region, but it re-
 mained very difficult to identify the perpetrators. In one highly publicized case, a
 photograph was circulated of a corpse of young man who ha clearly been tortured.
 Each side claimed that the victim was one of theirs.
 Separatist authorities in the Trananistrian region have permitted the ICRC to ob-
 serve prison conditions and speak to most prisoners. They have not, however, per-
 mittedthe ICRC to meet with the four ethnc Remanians held in Tiraspol on
 charges of terrorism Relatives of these ethnic Romanians arrested in Tiraspol (see
 Section l.d.) made detailed allegations of torture and inhuman treatment, such as
 beatings, threats, and intimidation (including firing shots close to prisoners while
 threatening to kill them). One prisoner, Andri Ivantoc, was interned in a psy-
 chiatric hospital during part of his incarceration.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Arrest warrants are issued by the
 prosecutor's office, not the court. A sec may be held for 72 hours without charge
 and is normally allowed family visits during this period. If charged, a suspect may
 be released pending trial, often with the restriction that he or she not leave town.
 There is no system of bail, but in some cases a friend or relative, in order to arrange
 for his release, may give a written undertaking that the accused will appear for
 trial. Suspects asedof violet or serious crimes are generally not released before
 trial; the prosecutor's office makes this determination without any judicial review.
 The Code permits pretrial detention for up to 18 months.
 In 1992 the Penal Procedure Code was amended to permit suspects earlier access
 to an attorney. Formerly, an attorney could be present during official questioning
 only after an arrest or after theprosecution had completed its investigation and for-
 warded the case to the court. If a suspect were detained and under investigation
 but not formally arrested, he had no right to have an attorney p resent. Under the
 amended provisions, a suspect may have an attorney present during questioning
 from the moment when the prosecutor riles an "affidavit of retention, which re-
 stricts the suspect's movements without putting him under arrest. If a person is un-
 able to afford a lawyer, one is provided at public expense.
 In the Trans-Dniester, several ethnic Remanians from Tiraspol were arrested by
 separatist militia and accused of killing a separatist leader in the spring. The ar-
 rests appear to have been politically motivated. All those arrested were politically
 active in opposing the separatist re   se.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.--Tere are local courts on the city or raion (dis-
 trict) level, with the Supreme Court acting as an appellate ourt to lower ones. The
 Supreme (ourt is divided into two sections, one handling civil cases and one crimi-
 nalcases. A defendant may appeal to have his case reviewed by the entire Supreme
 Court if dissatisfied with the results of the appeal to the appropriate section. In
 criminal cases, the defendant is supposed by statute to enjoy a presumption of inno-
 cence. In practice, the prosecutor's recommendation still carries considerable weight
 and may limit the defendant's right to a presumption of innocence. In civil cases,
 the court's decision is supposed to be based on the preponderance of evidence. Gen-
 erally, trials are public. Defendants have the right to attend proceedings, confront
 witnesses, and present evidence. Defense attorneys are able to review the evidence
 against their clients when p~eparing their cases. The accused enjoys a right of ap-
 peal to the Supreme Court. In a number of cases, decisions of lower courts were
 overturned on appeal.
 Judicial reform thus far has not yet resulted in a truly independent judiciary.
 Many judges and chief prosecutors from the Soviet government were rePlaced dur-
 ing 1990-1991 as a result of a review by a parliamentary commission. Some critics
 charge, however, that the Remanian nationalist CDPF exerted undue influence over
 the choices of replacements, resulting in a judiciary that is too politicized.
 Members of the Russian-speaking minority express concerns that they will not re-
 ceive equal treatment before the courts. To date, it is not possible to discern a pat-
 tern of discrimination in the judicial system. In one well-known case, for example,
 
 
 850
 
 local officials tried to expropriate the flat of an ethnic Russian who served as a dep-
 uty in the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The local offi.
 cial was fred, and the right of the family to retain its apartment was upheld.
 No prisoners are known to be serving sentences based on political charges, nor
 were there reports of convictions based on politically motivated criminal charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to the 1990 law on the police search warrants issued by the prosecutors office
 are required. Under the terms o? the state of emergency declared in March in re-
 sponse to separatist activities, police were granted special authority to search vehi-
 cles throughout the Republic to check for weapons. Tripartite peacekeeping forces
 in the former conflict zone retained the right to check vehicles, but police check-
 points were removed in the rest of the Republic when the state of emergency was
 ifted in August.
 Some critics of the Government claimed that they were followed by security forces
 and harassed. It is widely believed that the security forces continue to use electronic
 monitoring of residences and telephones in some cases, although evidence of such
 activities is not available.
 Foreign radio broadcasts are not jammed, nor are foreign publications banned.
 The radio broadcasts of the Tiraspol separatists, who took over Moldovan broadcast
 facilities in the Transnistrian region, are reportedly jammed, and Transnistrian
 publications are not generally avail able in the rest of Moldova.
 In the Transnistran region, opponents of the separatist forces state that the
 Transnistrian security forces are extremely active in watching and harassing them.
 Professors at the Pedagogical Institute in Tiraspol, which strongly opposed the sepa-
 ratists, reported regular surveillance and harassment of their families as well as
 themselves. Parents in Grigoriopol who opposed the separatists' decision to require
 use of the Cyrillic alphabet in school instruction also report harassment by militia,
 including surveillance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The fighting in the eastern part of Moldova led to hundreds of civilian cas-
 ualties. A number of villages on the eastern bank of the Dniester, which have ethnic
 Romanian majorities, experienced heavy shelling from separatist forces. Separatists,
 in turn, claim that ethnic Russian villages were targeted for shelling by Moldvan
 forces. Separatist forces and Moldovan police often sought shelter in civilian areas,
 and it is difficult to verify how much damage was caused by deliberate targeting
 of civilian objects and how much was due to error. The most extensive destruction
 however, appears to have occurred in the ethnic Moldvan villages around
 Dubosarry, east of the Dniester, which is controlled by the separatist forces.
 In June heavy fighting broke out in the city of Tighina (Bendery) when separatist
 forces attacked a Moldovan police station. Moldovan army and police reinforcements
 were sent to the city, and other Moldovan forces were mobilized to attack the sepa-
 ratist forces. According to eyewitnesses, including foreign journalists, personnel and
 equipment from the Russian 14th Army participated in the fighting against the
 Moldovans. Civilian targets suffered serious damage during this encounter. Separat-
 ists claimed that the Moldovans had deliberately targeted civilians. Moldovan
 sources deny these accusations. Investigation of the damage in the city tends to sup-
 port their denial, since the most serious damage is concentrated in the area around
 the Moldovan police station that suffered the initial attack. The Russian human
 rights group, Memorial, in a report on the fighting in Tighina, criticized both sides
 for accidental civilian casualties.
 Following the cease-fire established in July, both sides exchanged prisoners.
 Moldova held three prisoners taken in connection with the conflict and offered to
 release them when the balance of the prisoners held by the separatists, including
 prisoners held on charges of "terrorism, were released. The separatists did not ac-
 cept the offer, refusing to exchange the prisoners held on charges of treason, pre-
 sumably because they themselves wished to try them. The ICRC was permitted to
 visit captured combatants held by both sides and did not find evidence of unaccept-
 able treatment in prisons. However, a number of prisoners stated that they had
 been beaten and mistreated by their captors before reaching their places of deten-
 tion.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press were widely prac-
 ticed during 1992. Political parties and other groups publish their own newspapers,
 which often take positions critical of the Government. Even "official" newspapers,
 such as the daily of the Parliament, Sfatul Tarii, or the government daily Moldova
 Suverana, publish letters and articles critical of government decisions. In November
 an independent news service, Basa Press, was established. It is not subsidized by
 
 
 the Government and it maintains direct contacts with international news organiza-
 tions.
 Journalists note, however, that the dependence of almost all newspapers on gov-
 ernment subsidies makes it difficult for the press to maintain complete objectivity.
 While there is no longer overt censorship, newspapers too critical of the Government
 may find their newsprint or other supplies delayed without explanation.
 There are no independent broadcast media. Radio broadcasts seem more varied
 than those of television, especially by offering a number of call-in programs in which
 political and cultural figures answer questions from the public.
 In addition to the Moldovan state television station, Moldova receives television
 broadcasts from Romania and from Ostankino, the former Soviet television station
 which broadcasts in Russian. Many Moldovans criticize Ostankino's coverage of
 events in the Transnistrian region, which they say favors the separatists, and they
 have called on the Government to block reception of the broadcasts. The Govern-
 ment resisted these calls, and'Ostankino broadcasts are still received in Moldova.
 Radio broadcasts by the Transnistrian separatists, however, are reportedly jammed,
 and Transnistrian publications are not available.
 In the area controlled by the separatist forces, Moldovan newspapers may some-
 times be purchased, but radio broadcasts from the west bank of the Dniester may
 not be received since the separatists control the radio retransmission facility in
 Grigoriopol.
 Academic freedom remained in flux in 1992. Procedures for choosing rectors and
 other academic leaders and for replacing professors still do not correspond to West-
 ern concepts of academic freedom. In general, academic institutions have focussed
 on revision of the former Soviet curriculum. All academic institutions seek increased
 ties with foreign institutions and enjoy full government support for these efforts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 and association is protected by law. Permits for demonstrations are generally issued
 b ,y the mayor's office, which may consult the national Government if the demonstra-
 tion is likely to be extremely large.
 In March the Government declared a state of emergency in response to the grow-
 ing conflict in the Transnistrian region; among its provisions was a ban on public
 demonstrations. Members of the Christian Democratic Popular Front alleged that
 the state of emergency was imposed in part to prevent a large demonstration
 planned for the following week. It was lifted after the cease-fire was established in
 the Transnistrian region, some 5 months later. While the state of emergency was
 in effect, several small demonstrations were held by the CDPF and other organiza-
 tions and at least one larger one, staged by those critical of the Governments poli-
 cies toward the Transnistrian region, took place without government interference.
 The Government maintained that the state of emergency was necessary to allow the
 police to set up roadblocks and search vehicles to prevent the spread of armaments
 from the conflict zone, and that it was not intended to stifle political expression.
 Several CDPF members, on a hunger strike in a downtown park to protest the
 dismissal of the Defense Minister, claimed that they were beaten by police. An in-
 vestisation was undertaken, but no results were made public by year's end.
 Private organizations, including political parties, are required to register, but
 their applications in 1992 did not appear to have been denied or delayed. They may
 maintain relations with international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The practice of religion is generally free in Moldova. Par-
 liament passed a law on religion in 1992 which codified religious freedoms, although
 it contained restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some religious groups.
 The law guarantees freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to
 profess his religion in any form. It also provides for alternative military service for
 conscientious objectors, protects the secrets of the confessional, allows denomina-
 tions to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may
 not interfere in the religious activities of denominations.
 The law, however, aIso re'quires that religious groups be recognized by govern-
 ment decision in order to function and that denominations obtain specific govern-
 ment approval to hire noncitizens. The law also prohibits proselytism. Government
 officials have explained that proselytism is defined only as the act of deliberately
 trying to persuade a member of one church to leave it for another, especially by
 denigrating his denomination. In practice, street preaching and the holding of reli-
 gious revivals have flourished, apparently without government interference. Some
 Protestant denominations are concerned, however, that the prohibition on pros-
 elytism could inhibit their activities. In addition, Parliament did not issue imple-
 menting regulations that provided a legal definition of the term, leaving open the
 possibility of abuse. There has been no pressure on Parliament to address the sub-
 
 
 852
 ject, and, to date, that provision of the law does not appear to have been invoked,
 despite a substantial amount of evangelizing taking place.
 Although the Orthodox Church was not designated as the official religion of
 Moldova in the religion law, it continued to be the strongest religious force and ex-
 erted significant influence. In one village, for example, the mayor reportedly re-
 quired a Baptist congregation to get permission from the local Orthodox Church be-
 fore it built its own church. In November the Moldovan Orthodox Church received
 "administrative autonomy" from the Russian Orthodox Church, whose patriarch,
 however, still holds jurisdiction over the Moldovan Church. There has been some
 looseningof ties between these churches, including the reinstitution of Romanian
 as the official liturgical language in churches with a Romanian-speaking congrega-
 tion. In December a group of (primarily ethnic Romanian) priests led by the bishop
 of Balti sought and received recognition by the Romanian Orthodox Synod as a
 metropolitanate within the Romanian Orthodox Church. A number of Moldovan con-
 gations have chosen to join this group. By the end of the year, the Government
 not permitted the new group to register.
 A number of specific measures have improved the conditions of smaller denomina-
 tions. Several Protestant churches have received visits from foreign delegations, and
 foreign missionaries have established residence in Moldova. In Chisinau, a Baptist
 congregation which had long been denied permission to build a new church was
 given a parcel of land by the city to build a church and educational facilities. How-
 ever, a group of adherents of the Baha'i faith were refused permission to register
 as a religious denomination in October.
 Contacts increased between Jewish groups in Moldova and their counterparts in
 other countries. Ayeshiva, with children from Moldova and other former Soviet re-
 publics, has opened. Much of the teaching in Orthodox Jewish traditions is provided
 by American volunteers. In keeping with the policy of opening public schools with
 instruction in each of the minorit languages, a school or Jewish students which
 offers instruction in Hebrew and Yiddish was opened. Summer camps for Jewish
 youth were run in several locations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no closed areas or restrictions on travel in Moldova. The new
 draft law on passports specifies that exit visas for travel abroad will be abolished.
 Until it is adopted, the existing Soviet law is in effect; exit visas are routinely issued
 with passports.
 As a result of the conflict in the Transnistrian region, a number of Jewish refu-
 gees from the area decided to emigrate to Israel. Moldovan authorities were coopera-
 tive in expediting the issuance of travel documents to permit the refugees to depart
 quickly.
 Moldova has not passed new emigration legislation, and Soviet legislation is theo-
 retically still in effect. This requires permission from close relatives before an indi-
 vidual may emigrate. There were no known cases in 1992 in which anyone was de-
 nied permission to emigrate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Parliamentary elections in 1990 and Presidential elections in 1991 were Moldova's
 first steps toward permitting a fully functioning democratic system that would allow
 citizens to change their government. Parliamentary elections were freely contested,
 although held under Soviet rules. The CDPF, opponents of incumbent President
 Mircea Snegur, withdrew from the presidential race and urged voters to boycott the
 election, but turnout was high, with a significant majority voting for Snegur.
 The current Government and all the major political parties have made explicit
 commitments to support democratic elections. However, the right of citizens to effect
 the peaceful democratic transition of their government to the opposition is untested.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of women in
 politics or government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is no Moldovan group that focuses primarily on human rights issues, but
 a number of political parties, movements, and other organizations investigate or
 comment on human rights issues without government interferene. The Moldovn
 Government has not imposed any restrictions on the activities of foreign human
 rights organizations. Delegates from Helsinki Watch visited Moldova several times
 and met with government officials and independent groups. The Romanian League
 for the Defense of Human Rights also met with Moldovans in 1992.
 
 
 853
 The Government encouraged the United Nations and the Conference on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe to send representatives to examine human rights issues
 connected with the conflict in the Trananistrian region and requested independent
 human rights groups to provide expert analysis of proposed laws pertaining to
 human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Moldova has a population of about 4.3 million, of which 65 percent are ethnic Ro-
 manians. About 600,000 (14 percent) live in the region of Transnistria, of whom
 about 60 percent are Russian speakers. Within Moldova, Ukrainians (14 percent)
 and Russians (13 percent) are the two largest minority groups. A Christian Turkic
 minority, the Galqauz, lives primarily in the southern regions; the Gagauz are large-
 ly Russian-speaking and represent about 3.5 percent of the population. Bulgarians
 also live in the south and tend also to be Russophone. They represent about 2 per-
 cent of the population.
 Fears of discrimination, especially if Moldova were to reunify with Romania, have
 led the Russian-speaking and Gagauz populations to be skeptical of the Govern-
 ment's commitment to protect their rights. The leadership of the self-proclaimed
 "Transnistrian Moldovan Republic" sought to capitalize on these fears to gain sup-
 port from-the majority russo phone population of the region. In the south, an autono-
 mous Gagauz republic was also proclaimed in 1990. These separatist movements ex-
 acerbated tensions between ethnic groups, as have the activities of Romanian na-
 tionalist groups, such as the CDPF, which advocate reunification with Romania.
 Language policy is an increasing source of friction. Before 1989 Russian was the
 dominant angae in Moldova. rn August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of Moldova
 adopted a law making Romanian the official language of the Republic and replacing
 the C rllic alphabet with the Latin. Although the law contains significant protec-
 tion or the use of Russian and other languages, it is widely criticized by Russian
 speakers who fear that its real intent is to drive Russian speakers from the Repub-
 lic.
 The principle inherent in the language law is that, in dealing with any official
 or commercial entity, the citizen should pick the language to use, and the entity
 should be in a position to accommodate him. Officials and employees are therefore
 obligated to know Romanian and Russian "to the degree necessary to fulfill their
 professional obligations." State enterprises are expected to use Romanian as their
 working language, unless their local authorities obtan approval from the Council
 of Ministers to use Russian or another local language (e.g., Gagauz).
 The law sets a deadline of January 1, 1994, or implementing these requirements.
 (A  parliamentary  commission  proposed  an   extension  until 2000  for the
 Transnistrian region but this has not yet been accepted by Parliament). In 1992
 the Department of National Languages was instructed to develop guidelines to de-
 termine the level of language capability necessary for different types of employment.
 Virtually all Romanian speakers also speak Russian, while many Russian speakers
 speak little or no Romanian. Therefore, the language law represents a substantial
 burden for part of the Russian-speaking population, the severity of which will de-
 pend on how its provisions are actually implemented.
 Many older Russian speakers, especially, fear that they will lose their jobs as a
 result of the language law. Russian speakers say that language has already been
 used as an excuse to dismiss ethnic Russians from desirable jobs. They also state
 that, particularly in 1990, there were a number of ethnically motivated dismissals
 as institutes were reorganized. Government representatives maintain that it was
 not the policy of the Moldovan Government to dismiss people on the basis of their
 ethnicity, but admit that resentment against those who opposed Moldovan inde-
 pendence may have played a role in dismissals in individual cases. They also note
 that many institutes had a disproportionate number of Russophones when compared
 to the population, and that Russophones were therefore disproportionately affected
 when financial conditions forced dismissals of personnel.
 Tensions over the use of linguage remain high. Some Romanian-language news
 media urged Romanian speakers to refuse to reply in Russian if addressed in that
 language. Russian speakers have criticized the Government for not providing suffi-
 cient support to Russophones who want to learn Romanian. (Due to financial and
 logistical reasons, there is a shortage of teachers and textbooks.) Generally, there
 was a decline in the use of Russian in the political, cultural, and commercial sphere
 as the use of Romanian and other languages increased. However, Russian remains
 the language most commonly spoken in Chisinau, the capital, and in most Moldovan
 cities. Russian-language theaters continue to operate, and most movie theaters show
 films dubbed into Russian. Russian-language newspapers and books are widely
 available.
 
 
 In 1992 more schools offering instruction in Ukrainian and other minority lan-
 guages were opened. A Jewish public school was opened in Chisinau which provides
 instruction in Hebrew and Yiddish; a privately operated yeshiva also operates with
 international support. Although leaders of the Jewish community report that there
 has been some anti-Semitic graffiti at their community headquarters, there were no
 other reported incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism or other actions in 1992, and
 anti-Semitism was not a significant problem.
 In 1992 the Gagauz community rescinded its declaration of an independent repub-
 lic and now seeks local autonomy within a federal framework. Gagauz demands in-
 clude their own constitution (which would not, they state, contradict the Moldovan
 Constitution), preeminence of their own laws in certain areas that affect them close-
 ly (largely language and cultural issues) and greater control of their financial re-
 sources. They also wish to be able to hold Gagauz citizenship in addition to
 Moldovan citizenship, and they want to use Russian, not Romanian, in their com-
 munications with central government authorities. During 1992 the Gagauz commu-
 nity expanded its ties with Turkey, exchanging a number of teachers and students
 and meeting with Turkish political leaders andbusinessmen.
 Moldova's citizenship law, adopted in 1990, offered an equal opportunity to all
 persons resident in Moldova at the time of independence to adopt Moldovan citizen-
 ship. It does not permit dual citizenship except on the basis of bilateral agreement.
 No such bilateral agreements were in effect in 1992.
 Women enjoy equal rights under the law in Moldova. Women are generally, how-
 ever, underrepresented in government and leadership positions. Statistics also indi-
 cate that women have been disproportionately affected by growing unemployment.
 Women who suffer physical abuse by their husbands have the right to press
 charges; prison sentences can be given to husbands convicted of physical abuse (up
 to 6 months is not uncommon). Public awareness of the problem of violence in fami-
 lies is not generally very high, and no special government programs exist to combat
 spouse abuse.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions, which was en-
 dorsed by Moldova's then Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 pendent trade unions. Moldovan parliamentary decisions in 1989 and 1991, which
 give citizens the right to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal
 basis for the formation of independent unions. However, there have been no known
 attempts to form alternative trade union structures independent of the successor to
 the previously existing official organizations which were part of the Soviet trade
 union system.
 The successor organization, which at the republic level is called the Federation
 of Independent Trade Unions of Moldova (FITU), stopped paying affiliation dues to
 the Moscow-based General Confederation of Trade Unions in 1992. The FITU's con-
 tinuing role in managing the state insurance system and retention of previously ex-
 isting official union headquarters and tourist facilities provide an inherent advan-
 tage over any newcomers who might wish to form a union outside its structure.
 However, its industrial, or branch, unions enjoy considerably more independence
 than they did in the past. Various industrial unions maintain that their member-
 ship in the FITU is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time. Several of
 them, for example, threatened to pull out of the FITU if former Communist Party
 First Secretary Eremei was elected to its presidency, After a 4-month stalemate,
 Eremei withdrew his candidacy in late December in response to this pressure.
 The FITU has sought to influence government policy in labor issues and has been
 critical of a number of government decisions, especially economic policies connected
 to the steep increase in prices. As inflation increased, the FITU, by its own account,
 threatened a general strike if the Government did not take measures to compensate
 workers. Union representatives now sit on a joint commission with government rep-
 resentatives to examine wage issues.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 their members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There were brief strikes by trans-
 port workers and by teachers in the autumn, demanding higher salaries in response
 to rising prices. The teachers chose a strike committee which negotiated and
 reached a settlement with the Government. The Government also agreed to consider
 restructuring overall wage scales at the beginning of 1993 in order to address the
 problems caused by inflation.
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations.

 unions, but have not established formal affiliations. Moldova was admitted to the
 International Labor Organization in June.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Moldovan labor law, which
 is still based on former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights
 but collective bargaining is just beginning in practice. Besides the examples cited
 above, the union in a tractor factory negotiated a reduction in the workweek and
 an increase in paid vacation days. Doctors also negotiated a salary increase in 1992.
 According to trade union sources, the Government proposed new legislation which
 would have limited the oihts of unions to participate n collective bargaining, but
 the unions, opposing this, insist that it will not become law.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for their union ac-
 tivities. The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions provides that union leaders may not
 be fired from their jobs while in leadership positions for a specific period of years
 after they leave those positions. Unionists state that this law is taken seriously in
 Moldova, but it has not been tested.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 specifically prohibited, and there were no such cases reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under unrestricted conditions is 18. Employment of those aged 16 to 18 is permitted
 under special conditions, including shorter workdays, no night shifts, and onger va-
 cations. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is primarily responsible or en-
 forcing these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a role. While enforce-
 ment capacity is questionable, child labor is not considered a problem in the cities.
 In the countryside, parents use children to work, e.g., tending livestock and helping
 with farming.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, supposedly linked to the
 inflation rate, did not keep pace with inflation in 1992 and does not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The Labor Code sets a standard work-
 week of 41 hours, including at least 1 day off weekly.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the workplace. The
 unions associated with the FITU also have inspection personnel who have a right
 to stop work in the factory or fine the enterprise if safety standards are not met.
 In practice, however, the declining economic situation has led enterprises to econo-
 mize on safety equipment and generally to show less concern for worker safety is-
 sues.
