 DJIBOUTI
 Despite 1992 constitutional changes that permitted the creation of four political
 parties, President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for Progress
 rRPP), in power since independence in 1977, continued to rule the country.
 Djibouti's two main ethnic groups are the politically predominant Issa (the tribe of
 the President which is of Somali origin) and the Afar (who are also numerous in
 Ethiopia and Eritrea). The Mar comprise the largest single tribe in Djibouti but are
 outnumbered by the Issa and other Somali clans (Issak and Gadabursi) taken to-
 gether.
 On December 26, 1994, the Government signed an agreement that recognized the
 Afar-led Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) as a legitimate
 political party. The Government is expected to name a number of FRUD members
 to key posts during 1995. The FRU had been engaged in insurgency actions
 against the Government since 1991. Neither of the two officially recognized opposi-
 tion parties, the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) or the National Democratic
 Party (PND), hold parliamentary seats. The PND boycotted the December 1992 leg-
 islative elections, and the FRUD persuaded most Afars not to participate. As a re-
 sult, the RPP won all 65 parliamentary seats and, with the managed reelection of
 President Gouled in May 1993, now holds all significant government posts as well.
 The next legislative elections are scheduled for 1997.
 Under the Ministry of Defense, the Djiboutian National Armed Forces (composed
 of the army, the national security forces, and the gendarmerie) are responsibe for
 internal and external security. There is a small uniformed police force.
 Since the FRUD insurgency began in the Afar-dominated north, the armed forces
 have tripled in size, placing an enormous burden on the economy. Even though the
 i nsurency diminished greatly during the year--consisting largely of scattered
 FR     a  cks on government troops-the Government moved slowly on demobiliza-
 tion, in part because adult male unemployment in the capital was already around
 60 percent. In March the Government began negotiations with the main faction of
 the FRUD and signed a peace agreement at the end of the year. Both sides were
 responsible for the death of noncombatants before the fighting ended.
 Djibouti has no industry- services and commerce provide most of the national in-
 come based on the large foreign expatriate community of 12,000 including 3 800
 French soldiers, and the state-controlled maritime and commercial activities of the
 Port of Djibouti, the airport, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad. Only a few min-
 eral deposits exist in the country, and the arid soil is unproductive--only 10 percent
 is pasture and 1 percent is forested. People are free to pursue private business inter-
 ests and to hold personal and real property.
 Human rights remained restricted despite the introduction of a new Constitution
 in 1992 and a limited multiparty political system. The judiciary is still not inde-
 
 
 66
 pendent of the executive. While reports of military abuses of civilians in the north
 ended in March, there were several new reports of security force brutality against
 Afar civilians, including extrajudicial killings, both in the north and in putting down
 demonstrations in Djiboutiville. The Government prosecuted, but subsequently re-
 leased, four political opponents who had signed a FRUD declaration calling for con-
 tinued armed struggle. At the same time, the Government permitted somewhat in-
 creased freedoms of speech and the press and eased restrictions on freedom of move-
 ment in the north. The Government permitted the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC), U.N. representatives, and diplomatic missions resident in
 Djibouti access to prisoners and insurgent areas. The traditional practice of female
 genital mutilation continued to be a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-here were no known instances of
 politically motivated extrajudicial killings. However, there were credible reports that
 security forces might have killed civilians in skirmishes with FRUD insurgents and
 used excessive force in quelling Afar-led demonstrations. The most important inci-
 dents included, in January, the alleged killing by government forces of 7 FRUD sup-
 porters in retaliation for an earlier ambush on government forces. In March there
 were uncnfirmed reports that government forces killed 36 FRUI) supporters, in-
 cluding civilians during fighting. It was impossible to verify the number of casual-
 ties or to determine whether the reported victims were civilians or antigovernment
 insurgents.
 In June police used excessive force in a violent clash with Afar demonstrators,
 killing as many as 7 persons and wounding 15 others, after the authorities moved
 to destroy makeshift homes and a community run school in an Afar squatter neigh-
 borhood (see Section 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances. An investigation
 launched by the authorities in 1991 to determine culpability in an old disappearance
 case yielded no concrete results.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other inhu-
 man, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments. Under the new Penal Code
 adopted in October, torture is punishable by 15 years in prison. Senior government
 officials pressed for and generally succeeded in bringing about an improvement from
 the situation in 1993, particularly after peace discussions began with the FRUD in
 the spring. Nevertheless, especially during the first 3 months of 1994, credible re-
 ports indicated that security forces abused detainees, articularly Afars in the
 northern region and persons suspected of links with the FRUD. There were credible
 reports of the involvement of government forces in the rape of at least one dozen
 Afar women and girls in the Mabla and Oueima regions in March.
 Prison conditions are harsh. There were no reports of abuses leading to the deaths
 of prisoners or rape of female prisoners. The Government permitted representatives
 of the ICRC regular access to all prisoners, whether civilian or military.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1994 Penal Code stipulates that the
 State may not detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's
 formal charge. Another 48-hour detention can be accorded to the police assuming
 the prior approval of Djibouti's public prosecutor. Persons charged with political or
 national security offenses can be detained as long as an investigation is underway.
 Nevertheless, the police often disregarded these procedures, normally arresting per-
 sons without warrants and sometimes detaining persons for lengthy periods (see
 Section i.e.).
 As far as known, the Government held no political or security detainees at the
 end of the year. The security forces captured about 30 FRUD combatants during the
 previous 2 years. Most of these persons gained release during an ICRC-arrangd ex-
 change at the end of 1993 or early in 1994. The agreement signed with theFRUD
 in December grants amnesty to all FRUD militants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system comprises legislation and execu-
 tive decrees, French codified law adopted at independence, Shari'a (Islamic) law,
 and traditions of the native nomadic peoples. Crimes committed in urban centers
 are dealt with in accordance with French-inspired law and judicial practice in the
 regular courts. Civil actions may be brought in these courts or in the traditional
 courts. Shari'a law is restricted to civil and family matters.
 A special State Security Court hears cases of espionage, treason, and acts threat-
 ening the public order or "the interest of the Republic. This Court tries people ac-
 cused of political crimes and persons judged to be a danger to national security. The
 
 
 Court normally meets in closed session but not always; any decision may be ap-
 pealed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, has the
 right to legal counsel, and the right to be examined by a doctor if imprisoned. Legal
 counsel is available to the indigent in criminal and civil matters. Court cases are
 heard in public before a presiding judge and two accompanying judges. The latter
 receive assistance from two persons--- assessors'--who are not members of the
 bench, but who possess enough sophistication to comprehend legal proceedings.
 While the Government selects the assessors from the public at large human rights
 groups have claimed that political and ethnic affiliations played a role in determin-
 ing who was selected. The constitutional provisions for a fair trial are generally re-
 spected in regular nonpolitical criminal cases. Theoretically, imprisonment can le-
 gally occur only if an arrest warrant is confirmed by a judicial magistrate. However,
 in practice, security forces arrest people without warrants.
 The judiciary is not independent of the executive. The State Security Court tries
 people accused of political crimes and persons judged by the President to be a dan-
 ger to national security. In recent years, a number of legal proceedings commanded
 public attention as not meeting international standards of fair trial. Some members
 of the State Security Court as well as investigating magistrates do not have a legal
 education. Although State Security Court decisions may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court, lower court sentences are usually sustained.
 There were no known political prisoners. The trial of the four political opponents,
 who in January had signed a document which called for continued armed struggle
 against the Government, took place in early May. The defendants were represented
 by counsel and released after the trial at Djibouti's Palais de Justice, while support-
 ers of the four demonstrated outside. Human rights activist Mohamed Houmed
 Souleh, a male nurse and former parliamentarian, was detained in September 1993
 for alleging official involvement in a politically motivated killing. After being sen-
 tenced to 3 months' imprisonment and a fine in October, the Appeals Court ordered
 a reduction in the sentence in January 1994 to 1 month's imprisonment. The Su-
 preme Court affirmed this ruling, and Souleh was permitted to regain his freedom.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and
 communications. However, the Government monitors the communications of regime
 opponents, including opposition party and Afar leaders. Warrants are required for
 the authorities to conduct searches on private property.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The conflict between the armed forces and the Afar-led insurgents resulted
 in the excessive use of force and violations of humanitarian law concerning treat-
 ment of civilians. Most of these abuses occurred early in the year and ended by
 April after the start of negotiations between the Government and the FRUD. After
 denying the ICRC and foreign embassies access to the north during the second half
 of 1993, the Government allowed controlled access to most areas in the spring. Com-
 plete access became available after the signing of the peace accord in December.
 Low-level fighting took place between the security forces and insurgents during
 the first months of the year. Following a period of calm, the Government and the
 FRtD   signed a peace agreement in December. The French continued to provide hu-
 manitarian assistance to Djibouti. French troops delivered relief supplies or were
 present in limited numbers in towns like Tadjourah.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government owns the electronic media, the
 most important medium for reaching the public, as well as the principal weekly
 newspaper. The official media do not criticize the President or the Government.
 However, there are several opposition-run weeklies which circulate freely with open
 criticism of the Government. The Government permitted television coverage of the
 annual congress of one of the two legal opposition parties, during which the party
 leader sharply criticized the authorities.
 In contrast to 1993, when the authorities interrogated, arrested, detained, or tried
 persons who publicly criticized the Government or the President, the Government
 did not commit such abuses in 1994. The improvement appears to reflect the ending
 of the insurgency and outside pressure.
 The Government also did not interfere with foreign broadcasts or prevent the dis-
 tribution of foreign publications.
 There are no specific laws or other criminal sanctions that threaten academic free-
 dom. In general, teachers may speak and conduct research without restriction as
 long as they do not violate the laws on sedition. There were several student dem-
 onstrations in 1994. The chief cause was the late payment of government subsidies.
 
 
 68
 However, the demonstrations were largely a manifestation of despair about the par-
 lous state of the economy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to free assembly is
 provided for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this right.
 The Ministry of Interior requires permits for peaceful assembly, and the Govern-
 ment sometimes used the absence of a permit as the legal basis for action against
 demonstrators. In 1994 the authorities denied a permit to Aden Roblem Awaleh's
 National Democratic Party (PND) on grounds that it would lead to violence. Some
 opposition leaders effectively practiced e           Rather than provoke a gov-
 ernment crackdown, they refrained from organizing popular demonstrations. Secu-
 rity forces used excessive force in putting own spontaneous demonstrations, such
 as in an incident in the Afar squatter community (see Section 2.d.).
 The Constitution sanctions four political parties, but the ruling party, the RPP,
 reserves the right to determine the criteria and the circumstances under which the
 other parties may be recognized as legal entities. The Government recognized the
 PND and the PRD througout the year, and formally recognized the FRUD in De-
 cember. Nonpolitical associations must register with the Ministry of the Interior in
 accordance with a law enacted at the turn of the century.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim. The Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ig-
 nore Islamic teachings on such matters as diet, alcoholic consumption, and religious
 fasting.
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant, Greek Or-
 thodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox Churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may
 perform charitable works but proselytizing, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The civil war seriously restricted movement between north and south
 until spring, when the insurgency declined, except in one or two enclaves.
 Djiboutians may travel or emigrate to foreign countries without restriction or inter-
 ference. In October the Government lifted passport restrictions for travel to Israel.
 On at least two occasion during the year, the Government razed squatter settle-
 ments built on public land by Afars displaced by the civil conflict and others, includ-
 ing illegal immigrants from Somalia and Ethiopia. In one "clean up" early in the
 year, the Government moved some of the displaced Mar to an alternative site 12
 kilometers from Djibouti and rounded up non-Djiboutians and sent them to refugee
 camps. In June the Government, in attempting to raze an Afar neighborhood, de-
 stroyed makeshift homes and a community run school. Security forces used massive
 force against the subsequent, spontaneous protest, killing 7 persons and wounding
 15. The authorities claimed that they responded to attacks on police by residents
 with stones, clubs, and knives.
 Since 1991 about 9,000 civilians, largely Afar, have fled the civil conflict, mainly
 to Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite the much improved security situation in 1994, very
 few Mar returned in 1994.
 Djibouti hosts almost 120,000 refugees, according to government sources, approxi-
 mately a fifth of the total population. The UnitedNations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) acknowledges only the presence of some 45,000 refugees, largely
 from Somalia and Ethiopia resident in four main refugee camps. There are several
 thousand others living and working illegally in Djiboutiville. The UNHCR figures
 are based entirely on the number of people living in recognized camps and not on
 the larger population pool counted as refugees by the authorities. Late in 1994 the
 Government began in cooperation with UNHCR to move illegal residents to refugee
 camps for repatriation to Ethiopia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1992 Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their
 government in theory, in practice citizens have not yet been allowed to exercise this
 right. The RPP has carefully controlled the implementation of the new four-party
 system, and with the opposition largely refusing to participate, easily ensured total
 RPP control of the lecilature in 1992 and President Gouled's reelection to a fourth
 term in 1993. Many fars, particularly supporters of the FRUD, claim that the Con-
 stitution was crafted to ensure the  r   ent' domination of virtually all aspects
 of the Government, including the legislature and judiciary.
 The Government signed a peace agreement with the FRI) in December 1994.
 The agreement set the stage or the inclusion of FRUD members in senior govern-
 ment posts, although this anticipated development had not taken place by the end
 of the year. As negotiations took place during the year, the seurity situation im-
 proved markedly.

 Although legally entitled to participate in the political process, women are largely
 excluded from senior positions in government and in the political parties. There are
 no women in the Cabinet or in Parliament. The highest ranking woman in the coun-
 try is Mrs. Khadija Abebe, President of the Court of Appeals. At least three other
 women serve as judges, while several are school administrators. The director of mul-
 tilateral organizations in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has been hostile to the formation of local human rights groups.
 In the case of the Association for the Respect for Human Rights and Liberties
 (ADDHL) in 1993 the Government imprisoned its Association leader, Mohamed
 Houmed oulleh, after he criticized military abuses in the civil conflict, and in 1994
 continued to deny the ADDHL recognition (see Section I.e.). The ADDHL continued
 to function during 1994, however, with Soulleh as its head. No other known human
 rights groups exist. No international human rights group visited the country in
 1994.
 The Government cooperated with some international human rights organizations,
 including the ICRC which in 1993 played a large role in the exchange of prisoners
 in the civil conflict.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of language, race, sex, or
 religion, but discrimination against women and ethnic minorities is widespread.
 Women.-Women legally possess full civil rights, but in practice, due to traditional
 societal discrimination in education and other areas, play a secondary role in public
 life and do not have the same employment opportunities as men. With only a few
 women in the professions, women are largely confined to wage employment in small
 trade as well as in the clerical and secretarial fields. Customary law discriminates
 against women in such areas as inheritance, divorce, property ownership, and trav-
 el The French Legal Code does not, prompting many educated women to seek to
 defend their interests through the Western legal framework.
 Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem. When violence
 against women does occur, it normally is dealt with within the family or clan struc-
 ture rather than in the courts. The police rarely interfere in domestic violence cases,
 and the media cover only the most extreme cases, such as murder. The Government
 has been increasingly concerned about the growing problem of rape, and included
 in the new 1994 Penal Code stiff sentences for rape ranging up to 20 years in pris-
 on. No cases were tried under the new Code before the end of the year.
 Children.-Although there are a few charitable organizations working with chil-
 dren, the Government devotes virtually no public resources to the advancement of
 children's rights and welfare.
 According to an independent expert, as many as 98 percent of Djiboutian females
 have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), which international health ex-
 perts widely condemn as physically and psychologically damaging. lnDjibouti FGM
 is generally performed on girls between the ages of 7 and 10. In 1988 the Djiboutian
 National Women's Union began an educational campaign against FGM, particularly
 infibulation, the most extensive and dangerous form of sexual mutilation. The cam-
 paign has had only marginal impact on this pervasive custom. Judicial reforms en-
 acted in 1991 stipulate that anyone found guilty of genital mutilation of young girls
 can face a heavy fine and 5 years in prison. However, the Government has not con-
 victed anyone under this statute.
 The Government has not specifically addressed other forms of child abuse, which
 are often lightly punished. For example, when a child is raped or otherwise abused,
 the perpetrator is usually fined an amount sufficient to cover medical care given to
 the injured child. The Government has not as yet used provisions of the new Penal
 Code to deal more stiffly with domestic violence and child abuse.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government continued to discriminate
 against citizens on the basis of ethnicity in terms of employment and advancement.
 Te Issa (the dominant Somali clan in Djibouti) control the ruling party, the civil
 and security services, and the military. The President's subelan, the Mamassan, is
 particularly strong and wields disproportionate power in the affairs of state.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Although disabled per-
 sons have access to education and public health facilities, there is no specific legisla-
 tion that addresses their needs and there are no laws or regulations which prevent
 job discrimination against disabled people, who find it difficult to find employment
 1
 
 
 in an economy where approximately 60 percent of the able-bodied male adult popu-
 lation is underemployed or jobless.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided they comply with legally prescribed requirements. In
 the small wage economy, about 70 percent of workers are union members, con-
 centrated in individual private or state-owned enterprises. Previously, the Govern-
 ment exerted control over individual unions by making membership mandatory in
 the state-organized labor confederation, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers
 (UGTD). Since 1992 unions are free to join or form other confederations. While the
 UGTD is now nominally independent of the Government, it still has close ties to
 the RPP. However, the Democratic Labor Union (UDT) has gained increasing union
 support.
 The prescribed legal requirement for initiating a strike calls for the representa-
 tives of employees who plan to do so to contact the Interior Ministry 48 hours in
 advance. Most of the strikes in 1994 were legal. In May elementary school teachers
 struck over nonpayment of salaries. The Education Minister attempted to declare
 the strike illegal and dissolve the union. When secondary school teachers struck in
 support of their colleagues, the Minister backed down. The Labor Law prohibits em-
 ployer retribution against strikers and is generally enforced.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations in
 other countries. The UGTD is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. The UDT applied for affiliation with the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions in early 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Relations
 between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wages are generally
 established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor guidelines.
 When disputes about wages or health and safety issues arise, the Ministry of Labor
 encourages direct, ad hoc resolution by labor representatives and employers. Work-
 ers or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Ministry of
 Labor's inspection service. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination against em-
 ployees, and employers guilty of such discrimination are legally required to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. The Ministry generally enforces the law.
 An export processing zones was established in December.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and while this is generally observed, security forces sometimes compel
 illegal immigrants to work for them in lieu of deportation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for the
 employment of children is 14 years, and the law is generally respected. However,
 the shortage of labor inspectors makes it unlikely that investigations are ever car-
 ried out, according to union sources. Children are generally not employed under haz-
 ardous conditions. Children may and do work in family-owned businesses, such as
 restaurants and small shops, at all hours. Many street beggars are young children
 whose parents have forced them to beg to help support the family.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Only a small minority of the population is en-
 gaged in wage employment. The Government sets administratively minimum wage
 rates according to occupational categories, and the Ministry of Labor is charged with
 enforcement. Last raised in 1982, the minimum monthly wage rate is approximately
 $200 (35,900 Djiboutian francs) for a 12-hour day of unskilled labor. Many workers
 also receive housing and transportation allowances. Even with these fringe benefits,
 however, the minimum wage does not provide adequate compensation for a worker
 and family to maintain a decent standard of living.
 By law, the workweek is 40 hours, often spread over 6 days. Workers are guaran-
 teed daily and weekly rest periods and paid annual vacations. The Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for enforcing occupational health and safety standards, wages, and
 work hours. Because enforcement is ineffective, workers sometimes face hazardous
 working conditions, particularly at the port. Workers rarely protest as they fear re-
 placement by others willing to accept the risks. There are no laws or regulations
 permitting workers to refuse to carry out dangerous work assignments without jeop-
 ardy to continued employment.
