 BELARUS
 On July 10, Belarus elected its first President, Aleksandr Lukashenko, who con-
 vincingy defeated incumbent Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich in what inter-
 nation  observers generally considered to be a free and fair election. Popular frus-
 tration with economic conditions contributed to the heavy vote for Lukashenko, who
 ran on a populist, anticorruption platform.
 Under the new Constitution, adopted by the Supreme Soviet (parliament) in
 March, the President exercises executive power and appoints the Cabinet of Min-
 isters and all executive heads of Belarus' six provinces. Presidential decrees have
 the force of law, except in those cases restricted by the Constitution and Parliament.
 A Constitutional Court was created and has begun to adjudicate serious constitu-
 tional issues.
 The Committee for State Security (KDB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVS),
 both organs answerable to the President, remained the chief law enforcement and
 police organs. Although the security services reportedly still monitored closely the
 population's activities, they reduced overt interference in the private lives of citi-
 zens. However, special formations of MVS troops intimidated some opposition gath-
 erings, and police reportedly used excessive force on detainees. The armed forces,
 which are not involved in law enforcement, continue the practice of hazing as it was
 practiced in the former Soviet Union.
 Belarus' economy is still largely state controlled; however, the Lukashenko admin-
 istration freed prices of most goods and cut subsidies to many state industries. Lit-
 tle privatization has occurred thus far, and foreign trade is still oriented towards
 other parts of the former Soviet Union. Industry and construction employ 40 percent
 of the labor force, and agriculture 20 percent. Major exports include machinery,
 transport equipment, and chemicals.
 Belarus' transition from Soviet-era authoritarian institutions toward fully demo-
 cratic ones remains uneven, and human rights abuses continue. The presidential
 
 
 745
 election, as noted, was free and fair, but the jdiciary is not independent and is un-
 able to act as a check on the executive branch and its agents. Police and prison offi-
 cials regularly beat detainees and inmates without fear of punishment, and prison
 facilities are substandard and dangerous to inmates' health. The Government con-
 tinued to restrict freedom of speech and press, peaceful assembly, religion, and
 movement to varying degrees, and to impede the formation of independent trade
 unions. Discrimination and violence toward women remained significant problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance-On January 15, members of the Lithuanian security services,
 who reportedly acted in collusion with the Belarusian MVS, abducted in Minsk the
 capital of Belarus, where they had been visiting, two Lithuanians wanted by Lithua-
 nian authorities for their alleged involvement mn the January 1991 coup attempt in
 Vilnius, Lithuania. The pair were transported to Lithuania, reportedly without per-
 mission from the Belarusian Procurator General's office and in apparent violation
 of the bilateral extradition treaty between Lithuania and Belarus.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The new Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person, and specifically
 prohibits torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment. Law enforce-
 ment and prison officials may use physical force against detainees and prisoners if
 the latter are violent, have refused to obey the instructions of the prison administra-
 tion, or have "maliciously violated the terms of their sentences." Beatings by police
 and prison guards reportedly were regular occurrences in detention centers and
 prisons. Although such behavior is against the law, the Government seldom, if ever,
 punishes people who commit such abuses.
 In the armed forces, the practice of hazing new recruits continues unchanged.
 Hazing, or dedovshchina, is the practice of severe harassment and abuse of new
 draftees by senior soldiers to maintain strict discipline. Officers do not interfere
 with the practice, since it precludes them from having to become involved in dis-
 ciplining troops.
 Conditions in prison hospitals near Brest and Orsha were substandard. Prisoners
 with tuberculosis were crowded into closed cells with little ventilation. Extreme
 overcrowding in the tuberculosis hospital near Brest prevented prisoners from
 avoiding the disease. A women's prison near Orsha suffered an outbreak of dys-
 entery, which spread throughout the camp.
 d. ArbitraryArrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-Belarus has only slightly amended its So-
 viet-era law on detentions. The Criminal Procedure Code provides that police au-
 thorities may detain a person suspected of a crime for 3 days without a warrant.
 This period may be extended for up to 10 days, pending further investigation of a
 crime. On the basis of a local prosecutor's authority, detainees may be kept in pre-
 trial detention for up to 3 months. Regional and republic-level prosecutors may re-
 quest extensions up to a maximum of 18 months. The law permits citizens to appeal
 the legality of an arrest either to the court or to the prosecutor. According to judicial
 sources, nearly 60 percent of arrests are contested.
 By law, a judge must initiate a trial within 3 weeks from the time charges are
 filed. However, the overloaded court system often does not meet this requirement,
 and months may pass before a defendant is finally brought to court.
 Detainees maybe allowed unlimited access to their legal counsel, and, according
 to the new Constitution, if they cannot afford counsel, a lawyer will be appointed
 free of charge. However, prisoners and lawyers alike report restrictions on consulta-
 tions, and investigators may prohibit consultations between a lawyer and a client.
 The Government has failed to budget sufficient funds for defense attorneys rep-
 resenting the indigent. Defense attorneys' fees also are prohibitively expensive for
 many defendants. Since there are no legal provisions for bail and because there is
 no effective judicial oversight of prosecutors actions, pretrial detention has in some
 instances lasted longer than 2 years.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The criminal justice system, following the former
 Soviet model, has three tiers: district courts regional courts, and the Supreme
 Court. Several modifications have been made, brought about by passage of the new
 Constitution, including direct presidential appointment of all local-level and military
 judges.
 Parliament selects judges for republic-level courts on the basis of recommenda-
 tions from the Ministry of Justice, based in part on examination results. However,
 
 
 746
 many current judges and prosecutors were appointed in Soviet times when political
 influence pervaded the criminal justice system. Judges are dependent on the Mi-
 isty of Justice for sustainig the court ifrastructure, and on local officials for pro-
 vidmg their personal housing. Organized crime has had a significant impact on
 court decisions. There have been reports of judges granting lenient sentences to
 "connected" defendants. Without further major structural reforms, the independence
 of the judiciary from outside pressure cannot be realized.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district regional, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to, and serve at the pleasure of, the
 Procurator General, who is appointed by Parliament. Prosecutors as a rule are very
 influential because they supervise all criminal investigations and because court pro-
 ceedings are not conducted in an adversarial manner. Moreover, courts are still ex-
 tremely deferential to prosecutors' actions, petitions, and conclusions.
 Trials are generally public, although they may be closed on grounds of national
 security. Defendants have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence on their own behlf The court appoints an attorney for defendants
 who do not have one.
 While the Constitution establishes a presumption of innocence, conviction rates
 have not changed from the Soviet era. Neary 99 pernt of corpleted cases result
 in convictions. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions back to
 the prosecutor for additional investigation," and prosecutors also withdraw cases
 not likely to result in conviction.
 Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. On appeals, neither de-
 fendants nor witnesses appear before the court; the court merely reviews the proto-
 col and other documents from the lower court's trial. Less than 4 percent of cases
 in one province were overturned.
 There were no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family. Home, or Conespondence.-Elec-
 tronic monitoring of residences and telephones reportedly continued. The KDB, the
 MVS, and ertain border guard detachments have the right to request permission
 to install wiretaps but must legally obtain a prosecutor's permission before install-
 ing it. Except in cases of pursuit, a prosecutorial search warrant is needed in order
 to enter a private home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 but it is not observed in practice. The executive branch of government continued to
 use laws on slander to suppress freedom of speech, particularly criticism of its poli-
 cies and of government officials. The defamation law makes no distinction between
 private and public persons for the purposes of lawsuits on defamation of character.
 A public figure who has been criticized for poor performance in office may ask a
 public prosecutor to sue the newspaper that printed the criticism. The newspper
 Femida was sued for printing the text of deputy Evgeniy Novikov's speech in dar-
 liament. Although Nvikv was a deputy speaking fo    the Parliament's podium,
 the procurator said that Novkov was expressing a personal opinion at the time and
 that the newspaper was liable for printing slander.
 Galina Naumchik was sued for printing an interview with Novikov in the news-
 paper Dobryj Vecher. Novikov was also sued for his remarks. Prime Minister
 Kebich's security advisor, Gennadly Danilov suceessfully sued publications that had
 printed accounts critical of his activities and was awarded abeut $500 (5 million ru-
 Despite the passage of a press law in 1994 prohibiting the existence of a press
 monopoly, the Government maintained a virtual economic monopoly over the press
 oit owns narly all printing and broadcasting facilities and manas  the dis-
 tribution of all print media through official outets. There are, however, some pri-
 vate newspapers printed in B.larusian and Russian.
 The Government's direction of the issuance of radio frequencies and cable tele-
 vision licenses and the registration of radio stations, as well as its ownership of the
 countdy's only broadcast television station, amount essentially to completes control
 over the media. All mass media must register with the Government, which can use
 the registration requirementsu  as n instrument of censorship since it can revoke
 registration at any time. This absence of independence encourages editors to prac-
 tice self-censorship.
 In March the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied accreditation for Aleksandr
 Starinkevich, Belarusian  correspondent fur the Russian   newspaper Izvestia.
 Izvestia, widely read by elite Belarusians, was carrying critical reports concerning
 a proposed monetary union with Russia. In May, 17 journalists protesting the Min-
 istry's decision signed an appeal which was published in the parliamentary news-
 
 
 747
 gager Nardaya Gazeta. The incoming Lukashenko Government later approved
 t           accreditation.
 President Lukashenko said he supports a free press as long as it is resonsible
 and helps his presidency. During the first round of presidentill elections, the gov-
 ernment of Prime Minister Kebicoh tried to stop the printing and distribution of the
 opposition newspaper Svabada, which printed articles critical of the incumbent
 Prme Minister, and closed two radio stations which criticized him. The free trade
 union newspaper Svobodnyj Profsoyuz also had difficulty in getting its editions
 printed on a regular basis.
 On November 25, Belarus declared two Turkish diplomats persona non grata, ac-
 cusing them of activities not in accordance with their diplomatic duties. In connec-
 tion with this activity, two Belarusian journalists were detained at KDB head-
 quarters and questioned, one for 4 hours, and the other for 5 hours. Although they
 were released without being charged, they were warned that providing "sensitive"
 information to foreign diplomats for a fee could carry criminal penalties.
 Belarnsian newspapers were prevented from publsi    the text of a sensational-
 ist report delivered on December 20 in open session of Parliament by deputy Sergei
 Antonchik, who accused members of the Lukashenko Government of corruption. The
 text of the report was excised from the newspaper during typesetting, and the pa-
 pers were published with blank columns where the Antonchik report was to have
 been printed. Subsequently, the Government canceled the printing contracts of eight
 major independent newspapers, causing them to cease publcation for the remainder
 of the year. The Lukashenko Government asserted that since these newspapers re-
 ceived state subsidies, they were not part of the free press and were subject to state
 control Igr Ossinsky, the editor of Sovietskaya Belorussia, which first attempted
 to print the report, was removed from his position by Presidential decree on Decem-
 ber 23.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Soviet law on demonstra-
 tions, which is still valid, requires an application at least 10 days in advance to local
 officials. They must respond either positively or negatively not later than 5 days
 prior to the scheduled event. Public demonstrations occurred frequently. A march
 by strikers in February proceeded without incident despite very heavy police pres-
 ence in the streets of Minsk. During Victory Day celebrations in July, formations
 of special "Omon" police forces physically prevented members of the opposition
 Belarusian National- Front (BNF) from laying wreaths at the Minsk victory monu-
 ment. The Supreme Soviet Chairman requested an investigation into the action, but
 no results have been made public.
 On September 8 the BNF held a public demonstration in Minsk to commemorate
 the annversary of the 1514 battle of Orsha. Although it had applied for a permit
 a month in advance, officials denied permission for the rally after all preparations
 had been made. Since the city council did not inform the BNF of the prohibition
 5 days before the event as required by law, the BNF went ahead with its plans for
 the rally. Although the police presence was heavy and intimidating, the demonstra-
 tion took place with minimal conflict between police and demonstrators.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association. By the end of 1994, the Min-
 istry of Justice had registered 26 political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 which is generally respected in Belarus, including the freedom to proselytize. Citi-
 zens practice the two mainstream religions in 1elarus-Eastern Orthodoxy and
 Roman Catholicism-without any interference from the Government.
 However, religions which the Government considers to be outside the mainstream
 have had to overcome bureaucratic roadblocks as well as explicit prohibition. The
 Salvation Army had a representative in Minsk from January until July 1994, who
 departed from Minsk claiming that the Government, citing Soviet-era laws that pre-
 vent social service organizations from engaging in religious activities as well as the
 converse, had refused to register the Salvation Army as a religious group. One mis-
 sionary group reportedly circumvented this law by claiming that it was a beok-study
 group, even though only one book was studied. Hare Krishna members were accused
 of being a cult, not a religion. A member of President Lukashenko's staff accused
 them of subverting the youth of Belarus, but opposition to their registration was
 later dropped.
 Some difficulties still exist in transferring church property from state control back
 to the former owners. Iinsk's Jewish community received a more suitable building
 for its synagogue, although it failed to reacquire the former main synagogue of the
 city which remains the home of the Russian Drama Theater.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-According to the Constitution, citizens are free to travel within the
 country and live and work where they wish. All adults are still issued internal pass-
 
 
 ports, which serve as primary identity documents and are required for travel, per-
 manent housing, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although guaranteed by law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by the Soviet government in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "propiska" (pass) system survives in Belarus. All Belarusians are re-
 quired to register their places of residence and may not change them without official
 permission. The authorities limit the number of residence permits in Mink and the
 five regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mogilev, Vitebsk, and Gomel. However, ac-
 cording to government officials and other sources officials based their decisions pri-
 marily on the availability of housing, with fewer denials than previously.
 The MVS' law on entry and exit, which took effect on January 1, 1994, authorized
 the issuance to all Belarusians of "global" exit visas, good for from 1 to 5 years and
 valid for travel to all countries. Shortly after the new law took effect, the authorities
 received so many applications for exit visas that an enormous clerical backlog en-
 sued. On March 14, the Government temporarily suspended the requirement for exit
 visas, so all citizens who had passports could travel freely. This suspension of exit
 visa requirements was scheduled to end on December 31, 1994.
 According to data for the first 9 months of the year, no citizen was denied permis-
 sion to emigrate. Legislation restricting emigration by those with access to "state
 secrets" remained in effect, and any citizen involved in a criminal investigation was
 also ineligible to emigrate. Emigrants who have been refused the right to emigrate
 may appeal to the courts.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens began to have the right to change their government when in July they
 elected Aleksandr Lukashenko as the first President of Belarus for a term of 5 years
 in generally free and fair elections. Power was transferred peacefully from the in-
 cumbent Prime Minister to the new President. Parliamentary elections are sched-
 uled for March 1995. Suffrage is universal for all citizens over the age of 18, but
 participation is not mandatory. Since the Constitution requires that a presidential
 candidate obtain at least 50 percent of the votes cast, two rounds were necessary
 for President Lukashenko to win. Turnout was over 70 percent for beth rounds.
 The new Constitution outlines the structure of a presidential type of government.
 The Supreme Soviet (parliament), unchanged since 1990, passed three laws in Octo-
 ber, granting the President authority to reshape the Cabinet of Ministers, to redi-
 rect the sluggish economy, and to appoint provincial governors who, in turn, appoint
 subordinate officials. Previously, governors were directly elected by the voters.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics and govern-
 ment. However, social barriers to women in politics are strong, and men hold vir-
 tually all leadership positions. Out of the 360 members of Parliament, 9 are women.
 There are two female ministers in the Lukashenko Government, the Minister of
 Health and the Minister of Social Welfare.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights monitors reported that the Government presented obstacles when
 they tried to investigate alleged human rights violations. The Belarusian League of
 Human Rights, founded in 1992, reported that the courts continued, on the retext
 of procedural grounds to refuse to review its appeals to investigate alleged human
 rights violations. The League has close contacts with a variety of international orga-
 nizations involved in human rights, but its president reported having difficulty in
 obtaining permission to travel outside of Belarus to attend international symposia
 on human rights.
 International organizations were not hindered in making visits to Belarus.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law on citizenship, passed by the Supreme Soviet, grants citizenship to any
 person living permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October 19, 1991. Those
 vho arrived in Belarus after that date and wish to become citizens are required to
 submit an application for citizenship, know the Belarusian language ("enough for
 communication"), take an oath to support the Constitution, have a legal source of
 income, and have lived in the country for 7 years. Parliament debated new laws on
 immigration and migration which would provide numerical limits on new citizens.
 Women.-Although statistics are not available, domestic violence against women
 continues to be a significant problem. Knowledgeable sources indicate that police
 generally are not hesitant to enforce laws against violence and that the courts are
 
 
 749
 not reluctant to impose sentences. The problem, according to women's groups, is a
 general reluctance among women to report incidents of domestic violence.
 The law requires equal wages for equal work, and in practice women are paid the
 same as men. However, they have significantly less opportunity for advancement to
 the upper ranks of management and government.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare and health, par-
 ticularly as related to the consequences of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and,
 with the help of foreign donors, gives them special attention. Families with children
 receive government benefits.
 People With Disabilities.-A law mandating accessibility to transport, residences,
 businesses, and offices for the disabled came into force in 1992. However, facilities,
 including transport and office buildings, often are not accessible to the disabled. The
 Government, facing a deteriorating economic situation, failed to budget sufficient
 funds to implement these laws.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution upholds the right of workers, ex-
 cept state security and military personnel, to form and join independent unions on
 a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense of workers' rights, including
 the right to strike. However, the independent trade union movement in still in its
 infancy. Although several independent trade unions exist, the Belarusian branch of
 the former USS.R's All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions-currently the Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB--is by far the largest trade union orga-
 nization. This trade union of 5 million members is not considered independent in
 practice since it often follows government orders.
 In practice, workers are often automatically inducted into the FTUB, and their
 union dues are deducted from their wages. Independent labor leaders believe that
 the official trade unions' control over social functions usually performed by the State
 (such as pension funds) is an obstacle to the growth of true, independent trade
 unions.
 The two major independent trade unions are the Free Trade Union of Belarus
 (SPB), and the Belarusian Independent Trade Union (BNP). The BNP (formerly the
 Independent Miners Union of Belarus) and the SPB formed the Congress of Free
 Trade Unions of Belarus, which coordinates the activities of the two largest unions'
 nearly 16,000 members.
 No major strikes occurred in 1994. According to the Chairman of the BNP, a num-
 ber of small-scale strikes did occur, but they were not planned. Government regula-
 tions requiring notice of at least 100 days in advance of a strike has prevented the
 Congress of Free Trade Unions from acting on a larger scale.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet era provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the econ-
 omy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek redress at the
 political level.
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was reportedly violated when NA.
 Grinchik, the full-time union chairman at the Minsk Transistor factory, was denied
 regular access to the union offices at the plant. Police and the plant's management
 reportedly harassed the free trade union leadership, as when local free trade union
 chairman Ramaev was detained for over a month while they investigated the al-
 leged embezzlement of 10,000 rubles (about $1). When workers at the firm Fondok
 (formerly the Bobruiskdrev Wood Products Plant) chose to change allegiance from
 the official trade union to the free trade union, the management continued to deduct
 union dues from workers' wages for the official trade union. Workers and independ-
 ent unions have recourse to the court system.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1994 Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Current labor law establishes 16
 years of age as the statutory minimum age for employment of children. With the
 written consent of one parent (or legal guardian), a child of 14 years may conclude
 a labor contract. Reportedly, the Procurator General's office enforces this law effec-
 tively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Supreme Soviet sets a minimum wage, pe-
 riodically raised in response to inflation, which is effectively enforced. At year' end,
 the monthly minimum wage was $3 (30,000 Belarusian rubles). The minimum wage
 is too low to provide a decent standard of living.
 The Labor Code sets a limit of 40 hours of work per week and provides for at
 least one 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the difficult economic situation,
 an increasing number of workers find themselves working considerably less than 40
 
 
 750
 hours per week. Often, factories require workers to take unpaid furloughs due to
 shortages of raw materials and energy and lack of demand for factory output.
 The law establishes minimum conditions for workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards are often ignored. A State Labor Inspectorate exists but
 does not have the authority to enforce compliance, and violations are often ignored.
