 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia, or the Mongolian People's Republic, is a rigidly
 controlled Communist state. The Mongolian Communist party,
 the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), is the only
 political party permitted to function. The leadership of the
 country is vested in a 10-person Politburo of the MPRP Central
 Committee headed by Jambyn Batmonh. Nominally, the People's
 Great Hural, or National Assembly, enacts the basic laws of
 the country. It meets for 3 days once each year. Between
 sessions, the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), issues current
 legislation.
 The Soviet Union dominates Mongolia politically and
 economically. The Mongolian State is modeled on the Soviet
 system, and MPRP Leaders travel often to Moscow for
 consultations. The Soviets station approximately five combat
 divisions on Mongolian soil. As in the political arena,
 Mongolian economic life is shaped by the Soviet bloc:
 approximately 95 percent of Mongolia's foreign trade is
 conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet
 involvement in the Mongolian economy is largely exploitative,
 particularly in the area of mining and mineral exporting. The
 Mongolian economy remains heavily agricultural with an emphasis
 on animal husbandry and animal products.
 Little information is available concerning government control
 or treatment of Mongolian citizens. There are no known
 domestic opposition groups, and emigres are few. Much of what
 information is available comes from the Mongolian regime. The
 few resident diplomats and occasional visitors to Mongolia are
 mainly limited to the capital city (Ulaanbaatar). Travel to
 other parts of the country is restricted.
 It is known, however, that Mongolian life and society are
 highly regimented. Few Mongolians are authorized to travel
 outside the Soviet bloc countries. Political opposition to
 the MPRP is not permitted. Freedoms guaranteed to the
 individual under the Mongolian Constitution, including speech,
 demonstration, and assembly, can be exercised only to
 "strengthen the Socialist state system." In effect,
 individual civil and political liberties do not exist and
 there is nothing to indicate that this situation is likely to
 change in the foreseeable future.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no information available concerning political
 killings in Mongolia.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearance in Mongolia. High government officials
 occasionally are removed from office and drop from public
 view, and no information is released concerning their return
 to private life.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No information is available concerning this subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No information is available on these subjects or on the
 subject of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the State. The civil
 code places a heavy emphasis'on this category of crimes and
 the MPRP controls all legal systems.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The-right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 guaranteed in the Constitution, but there is no information
 available concerning the application of these rights by
 Mongolian authorities. Travel, as well as job and residence
 changes, are decided in accordance with economic needs as
 determined by the State.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, but specifies
 that the exercise of individual rights must be to "strengthen
 the Socialist state system." Actions deemed by the MPRP to
 fall outside this guideline would likely result in arrest and
 detention. Criticism of the Government is not tolerated.
 Control is exercised through various government organizations,
 notably the People's Control Organization, extending down to
 the neighborhood committee level. The press serves primarily
 as a propaganda tool. Representatives of non-Communist
 foreign media are able to travel to Mongolia, but find it
 necessary to arrange their trips well in advance. Academic
 and artistic life also is tightly controlled in accordance
 with government policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, but in practice only government-authorized
 organizations may assemble and the only demonstrations allowed
 are carefully orchestrated by government authorities.
 The Constitution gives workers the right to organize
 professional and trade unions, but all are controlled and
 directed by the Government to promote its policies. While the
 Labor Law does not mention collective bargaining specifically,
 it does provide for the settlement of labor grievances by
 "Commissions for Labor Disputes" formed by local trade union
 councils and people's courts, and composed of equal numbers of
 trade union council representatives and enterprise managers.
 There is no information on how this has worked in practice.

 C. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but the current regime
 strictly controls religious activity through an Office of
 Religious Affairs attached to the Council of Ministers.
 Religion no longer plays any significant part in the lives of
 most Mongolians. Lamaism, which was a central force in
 Mongolian life prior to the establishment of the Communist
 Government, has been reduced to a few showcase monasteries and
 a handful of monks, the former serving primarily as showpieces
 for tourists and the latter as propagandists. Religious
 figures do not hold high positions in government.
 Nonetheless, the Asian Buddhists Conference for Peace
 maintains its headquarters in Ulaanbaatar.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, few Mongolians traveled abroad, even to
 the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has been permitted
 only for official purposes, but government-sponsored.education
 abroad has become increasingly common. In recent years, as
 many as 40,000 Mongolian youths have gone to the Soviet Union
 yearly for short training programs. Almost all travel abroad
 remains restricted to Soviet bloc countries. There is no
 known routine emigration from Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over age 16 must have internal passports and
 must obtain permission from the Security Bureau in order to
 travel within the country. Attempts to change jobs or
 residences must be approved both by the Security Bureau and
 the People's Control Organization.
 Although the 1978 Constitution guarantees the right "to reside
 in the territory of the MPR" to foreign citizens, Mongolian
 authorities in May 1983 began a systematic expulsion of ethnic
 Chinese, most of whom reside in and around Ulaanbaatar. Many
 of the 6,000 to 7,000 ethnic Chinese in Mongolia evidently
 were offered a choice between resettlement in the barren
 northern part of the country or expulsion to China. The
 Mongolian authorities claimed the expellees had no formal
 occupation and/or did not abide by Mongolian law, despite the
 fact that many of them had been living and working in Mongolia
 since the 1950's.
 By late September 1983, over 2,000 Chinese had returned by
 train to the People's Republic of China. The expulsions
 continued in 1984, though apparently at a reduced rate. Some
 estimates place the number of Chinese who left Mongolia in
 1984 at approximately 1,000. There is no accurate count of
 the number of ethnic Chinese remaining in Mongolia.
 In line with the limited improvement of Sino-Mongolian
 relations in recent years, Mongolia reportedly ceased
 arbitrary expulsion of ethnic Chinese in 1985. A bilateral
 consular treaty regarding treatment of their nationals was
 signed by Mongolia and China in July 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party does not tolerate
 political groups outside of its control. It is established on
 the Soviet model with a narrow pyramid of power topped by
 Party General Secretary Batmonh. Lower-ranking members of the
 
 
 780
 MONGOLIA
 MPRP have no real ability to influence the decisions of their
 superiors. Elections are held at regular intervals, but only
 one candidate is listed for each office, so the choice is to
 vote for him or cross his name out. The 1986 election to the
 Great Hural brought into office a large group of younger
 officials in their 40's. Many elections purportedly result in
 a 99.9 percent turnout and the sole candidate regularly
 receives the entire vote. While there is no officially
 espoused policy of minority disenfranchisement, there is no
 evidence of religious persons occupying elite party or
 government positions, and only a few members of minorities do
 so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 .of Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights in 1976. However, the Mongolian regime has
 consistently followed the Soviet human rights policy and
 practice, whether or not it is consistent with the Covenant.
 There-have been no known opportunities for outside
 investigators to examine human rights practices. It is highly
 unlikely that Mongolian officials would permit such an
 investigation by any outside authority or organization. There
 is no known organization dedicated to the protection of human
 rights in Mongolia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 Universal franchise'and equal rights for women are official
 policy. According to government statistics, the percentage of
 women in the workforce rose from 30 to 46 percent between 1960
 and 1980. From 1951 to 1986, the number of women deputies
 elected to the Great Hural, which has approximately 370
 deputies, increased from 51 to 92. Women constitute 30.3
 percent of the MPRP membership. Few women occupy positions of
 responsibility in the Government or in party structures. One
 woman is a member of the 10-person Presidium, the acting
 legislative body between sessions of the Great Hural. It is
 reported in Mongolian media that women hold high professional
 positions in institutions such as hospitals. The Mongolian
 Women's Committee is the only known organization devoted to
 women's interests. It is controlled by the MPRP, and its aims
 are unknown.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Mongolian Labor Law sets a minimum work age and maximum
 work hours for all workers, and exhorts state enterprises to
 observe work safety requirements. Children under age 16 are
 not permitted to work, although those age 15 may work if
 allowed to by the local trade union committee. Those under 18
 are prohibited from doing arduous work or from working in
 dangerous areas such as mining. The workday for adults is 8
 hours, for those age 16-18 it is 7 hours, and for those age 15
 it is 6 hours.
