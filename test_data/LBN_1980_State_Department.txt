 LEBANON
 Lebanon traditionally has shown a high regard for human
 rights, but its ability to enforce respect for these rights
 has been seriously eroded in recent years by internecine
 warfare and the use of its territory by guerrilla and external
 military forces. This has reduced greatly the area of the
 country under effective government control. Substantial parts
 of the country are controlled by the Syrian army, which has
 been in Lebanon since 1976 as an Arab League peacekeeping
 force, by Palestinian guerrilla groups, and by Lebanese
 militia forces of various religious persuasions. Fighting
 among these forces has led to heavy civilian casualties,
 especially since 1975. Lebanese civilians also have lost
 lives and property as the result of Israeli military raids
 against Palestinian guerrilla forces located in southern
 Lebanon. There have been many abuses of human rights;
 intimidation, kidnappings, and summary executions are common.
 The number of people killed in. Lebanon has declined from an
 estimated high of 60,000 in 1976 to a reported 1,500 in the
 first nine months of 1980. The incidence of non-political
 crime also has risen in the past few years. Some of the
 current violence can be attributed to the settling of per-
 sonal scores or other criminal acts pursued under the cover
 of political action, against a-background of general
 lawlessness.
 Lebanon's objective is to expand the areas under its
 authority and to establish the army as the ultimate guarantor
 of security. But government-controlled areas still constitute
 only a small part of the country. Although the regular court
 system and some police units have resumed operation in parts
 of the country not controlled by the central government, the
 de facto political and military authorities in place--whether
 Syrian, Palestinian, or Lebanese militia--have the last word
 in the administration of justice.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Government authorities do not sanction torture, although
 charges of torture have been brought by at least one Lebanese
 religious group against the government's-own security forces.
 The private militias and armed forces which operate outside
 the control of the central government have tortured captured
 opponents in the past. The mutilated corpses of two well-
 known public figures were discovered in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The treatment of prisoners varies according to the identity
 of the detaining authority. Arrests by the various non-
 governmental military authorities have involved rough
 
 
 1033
 treatment, and have resulted in summary executions on occasion.
 Interrogation by Lebanese police occasionally involves
 physical force, but not as an officially condoned practice.
 During the civil conflict of 1975-76, many of the govern-
 ment's prisons were destroyed or severely damaged. As a
 result, prisons re-established since the war are seriously
 overcrowded. Many of the armed elements and forces maintain
 prisons of their own, and there is overcrowding in these
 prisons as well. In the government prisons, prisoners are
 allowed visits by relatives and attorneys. The diet is
 stark, but they can acquire supplemental food from relatives
 or through purchase.
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearances following abduction, particularly of young
 people, are common occurrences in present-day Lebanon;
 responsibility generally is attributed to the various
 militia groups and non-Lebanese-government armed forces.
 Multiple graves occasionally are found containing the
 unidentified victims of internecine fighting or group
 executions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Hundreds of arbitrary arrests have been carried out over the
 years by private armed elements. There reportedly are still
 several prisoners illegally held in various unofficial
 prisons. The government itself does not hold any political
 prisoners. Under the Lebanese legal system, a judicial hear-
 ing is usually held shortly after an arrest. Because the
 government is unable to provide physical protection to judges
 and prosecuting attorneys, it sometimes has found it difficult
 to enforce its decisions on arrests and imprisonment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Law, past practice, and custom afford the right to a fair
 trial by an independent judiciary. Judges can now order
 closed sessions in cases which they believe might disturb
 public order or offend public morals. Defendants are made
 aware of the charges against them and have the right to
 counsel after initial interrogation by police; this right
 is not always respected. Because of the collapse of the
 public security system, judges occasionally are unwilling
 to pass judgment or sentence for fear of personal reprisa.
 This, as well as shortage of judges, can delay trials.
 The prisoner always is credited for time served, and no
 trial is delayed so long that the sentence would be less
 than time served.
 Despite many vacant judgeships, the court system has
 gradually resumed operations in several parts of the
 country, including some areas under militia, Palestinian,
 or Syrian control. The number of criminal and civil trials
 held has correspondingly increased over the past few years.
 The number of trials held in Beirut for murders committed
 throughout the country increased from four in 1976 to 71
 
 
 1034
 in the first nine months of 1980. Misdemeanor cases handled
 by the Beirut Court of Appeals rose from 64 in 1979 to 350
 in 1980. Cases with political aspects usually are dealt with
 directly by the de facto political and military authorities
 in place.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 14 of the Lebanese constitution provides that *the
 domicile is inviolable. None can enter it except in cases
 provided by the law and according to the form it prescribes."
 In theory, this means that Lebanese authorities must
 acquire the equivalent of a warrant to enter homes. Until
 the effectiveness of the Lebanese internal security forces
 is restored, however, Lebanese homes will not be completely
 safe from intrusion. Various armed groups in de facto
 control have not always respected the inviolability of the
 home. In Beirut and other parts of Lebanon, empty homes
 have been taken over by squatters; Palestinian refugees and
 armed groups also forcibly have evicted legitimate owners
 and occupants.
 2.   Government   Policies Relating To the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Lebanese traditionally have operated one of the freest
 economies in the world, even relying on the private sector to
 provide many of the social :services which most governments
 ordinarily supply. The government is now increasing its
 programs in this area, providing relief and reconstruction
 assistance and low-cost loans. The main problems are the
 absence of a political consensus and the internal security
 situation. People are reluctant to invest in long-term
 projects.
 Income is relatively high for the region but is unevenly
 distributed. Disparities are wide between urban wealth and
 rural poverty. There is a large, stable, and highly active
 middle class based on commerce and services. The tax
 system, such as remains, is progressive, but collection of
 direct taxes is difficult under present circumstances and
 accounts for only a small fraction of government revenues.
 Per capita income was estimated at $1,000 in 1974. It
 declined during the 1975-76 war, but has since climbed back
 to an estimated $1,500. Lack of statistics and the havoc
 wreaked by five years of warfare prevent an accurate analy-
 sis of welfare levels.
 Employment and educational opportunities for women,
 as well as their right to own property or operate busi-
 nesses, are limited in some regions by religion and custom.
 In Beirut, many women hold responsible jobs in the private
 sector. There are no elected women officials at the national
 level and very few women serving as senior government
 officials.
 
 
 1035
 
 Property is privately owned and the right to property is pro-
 tected in normal circumstances. However, the Syrian army and
 private militia groups have seized property frequently since
 1975.
 Shelter is a problem for refugees, both Palestinian and
 Lebanese, as a result of sporadic warfare in south Lebanon
 and, less frequently, in Beirut. To try to ameliorate the
 housing shortage, the government has established a program
 designed to assist low-income families to build and obtain
 housing, with particular emphasis on south Lebanon. The govern-
 ment has sought funds from international donors to assist in
 the program, and has committed funds pledged by Arab states to
 the housing sector.
 Adequate health care is available in urban areas from a well-
 developed but privately-funded health sector. The government
 recognizes the need to improve existing government-run
 facilities. Public facilities damaged during the war are not
 adequate in many areas, but the government is replacing them.
 American University Hospital in Beirut accepts a small number
 of patients'who are unable to pay for medical attention. Some
 international organizations are working with the Ministry of
 Health to improve administrative/management capabilities.
 Educational facilities are abundant, but the main burden is
 carried by private schools. If they can afford it, Lebanese
 educate their children in private schools at all levels.
 Over 50 percent of pre-university-level students attend
 private schools. Many private elementary schools enjoy
 substantial government subsidies. Public education exists
 through the university level. The literacy rate in Lebanon
 varies from 90-96 percent among Christians and Palestinians
 to as low as 30 percent among Shia Muslims and non-
 Palestinian refugee groups. In addition, the government
 supports vocational education in such areas as mechanics,
 television repair, aircraft maintenance, and other technical
 fields.
 Lack of an adequate administrative base hinders the fulfill-
 ment of many programs which would broaden shelter, educational,
 and health facilities and improve the general economic infra-
 structure. The government is stepping up the pace of
 reconstruction, particularly in the south, with the assistance
 of external financial contributions. The Council for Develop-
 ment and Reconstruction, established in 1977 from the former
 Ministry of Planning, has responsibility for drawing up and
 implementing Lebanon's program of economic and social recovery.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Preedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Present legislation empowers the government to censor the
 press, but it is not being implemented. There are no
 government-owned newspapers, and the press freely criticizes
 
 
 1036
 
 the government. Censorship recently has been lifted from
 the 50-percent-government-owned Beirut television station.
 Publications seldom print material objectionable to the
 political group in control in the area where their employees
 live. Also, they limit criticism of any political group
 other than the government for fear of violent retribution;
 two prominent journalists were killed this year, and their
 murderers remain unidentified. Most publications are distri-
 buted freely and are available even in areas hostile to their
 editorial viewpoints. Several clandestine radio stations
 operated by individual militia groups broadcast without
 interference.
 In general, Lebanese can practice their religions freely;
 prior to the 1975-76 fighting, accommodation among Lebanon's
 fourteen recognized faiths was a cornerstone of the unwritten
 covenant establishing the Lebanese state. The recent civil
 conflict exacerbated underlying religious and political
 tensions. These tensions and sense of individual insecurity
 to some degree inhibit the public practice of Islam in some
 heavily Christian areas. Freedom of association is subject
 to the same type of practical limitations; in Lebanon, a per-
 son's religious affiliation often assigns him to a particular
 political grouping in the eyes of others, whether warranted or
 not.
 Religious distinctions historically have been sharply drawn.
 They are embodied in arrangements which allocate governmental
 and military positions and parliamentary seats on the basis of
 religious affiliation. Religious courts have jurisdiction over
 matters of personal status: marriage, divorce, inheritance,
 and guardianship. The customary law they apply often discrimi-
 nates against women.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within the country traditionally has been free,
 subject only to the practical consideration that large areas
 controlled by private militias or Palestinians could be unsafe
 for "outsiders." Foreign travel is not limited. There is no
 impediment to voluntary repatriation.
 Lebanon throughout its history has been a land of asylum.
 220,000 refugees, nearly all Palestinians, are registered
 with the United Nations Relief and Works Association (UNRWA).
 Additionally, 2,900 non-Palestinian refugees (1,000 Assyrians,
 1,100 Ethiopians, 300 Armenians, and 500 Syrian Orthodox)
 are the concern of the local office of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Many more Palestin-
 ians, as well as other foreigners, are in the country
 without official refugee status. Many Lebanese voluntarily
 have gone abroad in recent years or have moved their places
 of residence within Lebanon because of the fighting. The
 government is reluctant, and in many cases powerless, to
 prevent the entry of refugees, and deportation is rare.
 
 
 1037
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The character of the political system is multi-party. No
 party is outlawed. Some militant opposition parties can
 function freely only in areas which their adherents control
 militarily, or in "neutral areas" controlled by the government
 forces. Most major political parties either have their own
 press or can get their views fully set forth in sympathetic
 newspapers. However, the military groups operating in the
 country, both Lebanese and foreign, have employed strong
 efforts--including intimidation--to influence the political
 process. No general elections have been held since 1972.
 The mandate of the present legislature was extended in
 1976, 1978, and 1980 by its-own vote.
 Women have the same legal rights as men regarding political
 participation. Owihg to cultural traditions, many women
 refrain from participating in the political process. There
 is one significant legal limitation on women's rights which
 applies throughout the country: married women cannot engage
 in business if their husbands take legal steps to prevent
 them. In addition, women formerly were unable to acquire
 a passport without the written authorization of their husband.
 This requirement was abolished in 1974, but husbands still can
 take legal action to have their wives and children prevented
 from going abroad, by means of official notices sent to ports
 of exit.
 There is an active trade union movement. Laws grant the right
 to organize, strike, and bargain collectively. Lebanese labor
 law also provides for collective contracts, mediation and
 arbitration.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no formal, outside investigations of human
 rights violations in Lebanon in 1979 and 1980. There exists
 a small Beirut-based Committee for the Preservation of the
 Constitution and Liberties which concerns itself with the
 observance of human rights in Lebanon and throughout the
 Middle East. It is recognized by the United Nations Commis-
 sion on Human Rights. There are also several individuals
 who take a personal interest in human rights.  From time to
 time they deplore the lack of government authority, denounce
 violations perpetrated by private groups, or intervene on
 behalf of selected individual victims.
 Former Prime Minister Charles Malek played a leading role
 in drafting of the United Nations Human Rights Charter.
 The Lebanese government has adhered to the following conven-
 tions on human rights: International Treaty on Economic,
 Social and Cultural Rights, International Treaty on Civil
 and Political Rights, Convention on the Prevention and Re-
 pression of the Crime of Genocide, International Convention
 on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination,
 and the Convention on the Political Rights of Women.
