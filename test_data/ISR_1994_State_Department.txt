 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and free elections.
 There is no constitution; a series of "basic laws" provide for fundamental rights. The
 legislature, or Knesset, has the power to dissolve the Government and limit the au-
 *The human rights situation in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem is discussed in
 the annex appended to this report.

 thority of the executive branch. The judiciary is independent. Public debate is open
 and lively, and a free press scrutinizes all aspects of society and politics.
 Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been in a state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors. It concluded a peace treaty with Egpt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
 As a result of the 1967 war Israel occupied the areas of the West Bank, the Gaza
 Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Throughout its exist-
 ence, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist attacks. It relies heavily on its mili-
 tary and security services and retains many security-related regulations from the
 period of the British Mandate.
 On September 13, 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
 signed an historic Declaration of Principles. This p~rcess of reconciliation led to sig-
 iicant developments in 1994, first and foremostbeing the May agreement leading
 to the establishment of a Palestinian Authority (PA) in the Gaza Strip and Jericho
 area, and the August agreement on "early empowerment" (the Agreement on Pre-
 paratory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities) (see the annex to this report).
 Internal security is the responsility of the General Security Service (Shin Bet),
 which is under the authority of the Prime Minister's office. The police are under the
 authority of a different minister. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is under the au-
 thority of a civilian Minister of Defense. It includes a significant portion of the adult
 population on active duty or reserve status and plays a role in maintaining internal
 security. The Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset reviews the ac-
 tivities of the IDF and Shin Bet.
 Israel has a market economy and enjoys a relatively high standard of living. The
 economy has grown by an average of 5 percent a year in the past several years. Un-
 employment is 7.5 percent, the lowest since 1988. Inflation is 14.5 percent. Since
 implementation of an economic stabilization plan in 1985, the Government has
 moved steadily in the direction of reducing state intervention in the economy. Much
 prores has be en made in liberalizing capital markets, but privatization and labor
 market reform have progressed more slowly. Despite the continued dominant role
 of the Government in the economy, individuals are largely free to invest in private
 interests and own proporty.
 Positive human rights developments, in addition to the implementation of Israel-
 PLO agreements, included the release of thousands of Palestinians detainees and
 prisoners from military and civil facilities. Israeli citizens enjoy a wide range of civil
 and other rights. Israel's main human rights problems arise from its po cies and
 practices in the occupied territories. In addition, while the Governments stated in-
 tention is to close the social and economic gap between Arab and Jewish citizens
 Arab citizens still do not share fully in the rights granted to, and the levies imposed
 on, Jewish citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Exdrajudicial Killing.-Political killings in Israel are nei-
 ther practiced nor condoned by Israeli authorities. In the context of extreme political
 tension between Israel and the Palestinians, intercommunal killings are often as-
 sumed to have a political motivation. In 1994 the number of such killings of Israelis
 committed in Israel rose to 52, as extremists on both sides sought to disrupt the
 peace process.
 On April 6, a Palestinian car bomber in a suicide attack killed 7 and injured at
 least 50 at a bus stop in the Israeli city of Afula, and on April 13 a bomb in the
 central bus station in Hadera killed 5 persons and wounded as many as 20. On Oc-
 tober 19, a suicide bomber aboard a Tel Aviv bus killed some 22 people and injured
 more than 40. Another suicide bomber killed himself and injured 12 at a Jerusalem
 bus stop on December 25.
 In other violence, a Jewish settler armed with an automatic rifle attacked a morn-
 ing prayer service at the Ibrahim Mosgue,also known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs,
 in the West Bank city of Hebron on February 25, killing at least 29 Arab worship-
 ers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit such practices, there
 are credible reports that security officers abuse Palestinian detainees (See annex for
 a discussion of mistreatment of prisoners from the occupied territories incarcerated
 in detention facilities located in Israel).
 Incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories are administered by
 either the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the national police, or the Israel Defense
 Forces (IDF). Although conditions vary, all facilities are monitored by various
 
 
 1097
 branches of the Government, by members of the Knesset, the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and many human rights organizations, which have ac-
 cess to the prisons, police jails, and IDF camps.
 Generally, inmates are not subject to hysical abuse by guards, food is adequate,
 andprisoners receive basic necessities. However, security prisoners are subject to
 a different regime, even in IPS facilities, and as a class they are often denied certain
 privileges given to prisoners convicted on criminal charges. Overcrowding is the
 most severe problem in all facilities.
 IPS prisons conform to general international standards which permit inmates to
 receive mail, have televisions in their cells, and receive regular visits. Prisoners re-
 ceive wages for prison work and benefits for good behavior. Many EPS prisons have
 religious and drug-free wards and educational-and recreational program.
 Police detention facilities are intended for pretrial detentions but are often used
 as de facto jails, holding detainees for several months because of court backlogs. In-
 mates are often not accorded the same rights and living conditions as prisoners in
 the IPS facilities. Some police detention facilities can fall below generally accepted
 minimum international standards.
 Detention camps administered by the IDF are limited to male Palestinian security
 prisoners and are guarded by armed soldiers. The number of security prisoners
 dropped sharply in 1994, after the Government released over 5,400 Palestinian de-
 tainees. Conditions in the camps do not meet minimum international standards and
 threaten the health of the inmates. Many camps continue to house inmates in
 unheated tents, even in severe weather conditions. Family visits are restricted in
 the camps and recreational facilities are minimal. A petition to close the Ketziot de-
 tention camp, filed by a human rights organization before the High Court of Justice
 in 1993, was withdrawn in 1994. The number of detainees in the camp had de-
 creased to about 820 by the end of the year, down from 4,900 in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Israeli law and practice prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural and sub-
 stantive safeguards are available. Defendants are considered innocent until proven
 guilty. However, a 1979 law permits administrative detention without charge or
 trial. The Minister of Defense may issue a detention order for a maximum of 6
 months. Within 48 hours of issuance, detainees must appear before a district judge
 who may confirm, shorten, or overturn the order. If the order is confirmed, an auto-
 matic review takes place after 3 months. Administrative detention orders are renew-
 able. Detainees may be represented by counsel and appeal detention orders to the
 Supreme Court. At detention hearings, the Government may withhold evidence from
 defense lawyers on security grounds.
 In felony cases a district court judge may postpone for 48 hours the notification
 of arrest to the detainee's attorney. The postponement may be extended to 7 days
 by the Minister of Defense on national security grounds or by the police Inspector
 General to conduct an investigation. Moreover, a judge may postpone notification up
 to 15 days in national security cases.
 After the Hebron massacre in February, the authorities placed under administra-
 tive detention several activists of the Jewish ultra-nationalist Kach and Kahane
 Chai Organizations. In September the authorities placed in administrative detention
 a number of Israelis, because the Government was concerned that they might com-
 mit terrorist acts. One of those arrested is a member of the IDF who is being tried
 by a military court.
 The Governmemt continues to hold nearly half of the Palestinian detainees from
 the occupied territories in detention centers in Israel. The transfer of prisoners from
 the occupled territories to Israel contravenes article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Con-
 vention (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 The Government acknowledges that it detains 11 Lebanese citizens and has pro-
 vided information on the whereabouts of all but two of them. The disposition of their
 cases appears linked to government efforts to obtain information on-lsraeli military
 personnel believed to be prisoners of war or missing in Lebanon. Another 12 Leba-
 nese prisoners, who had been detained after serving their sentences, are no longer
 in detention.
 The Government does not exile Israeli citizens (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is composed of civil, military,
 religious, labor relations, and administrative courts. The judiciary is independent.
 The law provides for the right to a hearing with representation by counsel. The
 right is observed in practice. All nonsecurity trials are public except those in which
 the interests of parties are deemed best served by priva
 Security cases may be tried in either military or civi'courts, and may be partly
 or wholly closed to the public. The Attorney General determines the venue in such
 cases. The prosecution must justify closing the proceedings to the public. Defendants
 
 
 1098
 have the right to be represented by counsel even in closed proceedings but may be
 denied access to some evidence on security grounds. Convictions may not be based
 on any evidence denied to the defense.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Priv  , Family, Home, or Correspondence.-AJ-
 though privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law, au-
 thorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations. In
 criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order, in security cases, the
 order must be issued by the Minr of Defense. Under emergency regulations, au-
 thorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds.
 g. Use of ExCessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-See Section 1.g. of the annex.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Individuals organizations, the press, and the
 electronic media freely debate public issues and criticize government officials and
 policies. The law authorizes the Government to censor any material reported from
 Israel or the occupied territories regarded as sensitive on national security grounds.
 However news printed or broadcast abroad may be reported in Israel without cen-
 sorship. In response to objections from the press, the Government has shown greater
 flexibilit regarding material which may or may not be made public.
 The Government censors Arabic publications more strictly than Hebrew publica-
 tions. In August the Ministry of the Interior closed the East Jerusalem weekly
 newspaper, AI-Bayan, because of the paper's alleged connections with the terrorist
 up   amas. Authorities also prohibited the distribution of the PLO-affiliated Al-
 wdah publication for several months.
 Emergency regulations prohibit anyone from expressing support for illegal organi-
 zations. The Government occasionally prosecutes persons for speaking or writing on
 behalf of terrorist groups. Such actions are almost always directed against Israeli
 ArabE; no such cases were filed agnst Jews in 1994, but the Kach and Kahane
 Chai extremist organizations were banned under provisions of a 1948 antiterrorism
 act (see Section 2.b.)
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaper licenses are valid
 only for Israel; separate licenses are required to distribute publications in the occu-
 piedterritories. Directed by a Government appointee, the quasi-independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority (IRA) controls television channel 1 and 'KOL Israel" radio,
 bth major sources of news and information. Six cable companies operate under
 franchises granted by councils appointed by the Government. Three companies were
 awarded franchises  1993 to start a commercial television channel, Israels first.
 Privately owned, commercial local radio is also gearing up. Tenders for the estab-
 lishment of the first 6 of 17 planned local radio stations have already been made.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The law and court rulings pro-
 tect the rights of assembly and association. The Government may prohibit indivd-
 uals from belonig to terrorist groups. After the Hebron massacre in February, the
 Cabinet invoked the 1948 Ordinance for the Prevention of Terror to ban the
 ultranationalist Kach and Kahane Chai organizations. The decision stipulated im-
 prisonment for anyone belonging to, or expressing support for, either organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-This right is strongly protected by law. Apprximately 81
 percent of Israeli citizens are Jewish. Muslims, Christians, Druze, and membrs of
 other minority religions make up the remaining 19 percent. Eaci recognized reli-
 gious community has legal authority over its members in matters of marriage and
 divorce. Secular courts have primacy over questions of inheritance, but parties, by
 mutual agreement, may bring the case to religious courts.
 In the Jewish community, Orthodox religious authorities have exclusive control
 over marriage, divorce, andburial, whether the subjects are Orthodox Jews or not.
 Some Conservative, Reform, and secular Jews have objected to such authority. Is-
 raeli authorities are not empowered to perform civil marriages.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. According to the Ministry of Justice,
 the Government has not applied a 1977 anti-proselytizing law for several years,
 which would prohibit anyone from offering or receiving material benefitss an in-
 ducement to conversion.
 The Government permits citizens to visit religious sites or perform religious obli-
 gations in Israel and abroad. However, it has prevented Muslim and Christian Pal-
 estinians from the occupied tertri es from worshipping at holy places in East Jeru-
 salem (see Section 2.c. in the annex). In 1994 the Government permitted Muslim
 citizens over 30 years of age to perform the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but it
 denied permission to Muslim citizens under 30 years of years of age on security
 grounds. The Government asserts that travel to Saudi Arabia, which is still in a
 state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not a right.
 
 
 1099
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the freedom of movement except in military or security
 zones or in instances where they may be confined by administrative order to their
 neighborhoods or villages. In 1994 the Government issued at least 40 orders limiting
 the movements of some Jewish settlers in the occupied territories.
 Citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no out-
 standing military obligations or are not restrictedby administrative order.
 The Government welcomes Jewish immigrants, their families and Jewish refu-
 gees, to whom it confers automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law
 of Return. This law does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith.
 Under the principle of family reunification, successive Governments have allowed
 the return of some Arab refugees who fled Israel in 1948-1949. The Government
 claims that 100,000 Arabs were allowed to return to Israel after the 1949 armistice
 agreement, but it has denied the great majority of other requests.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government peacefully. Israel
 is a parliamentary democracy, with an active multipar  stem representing a wide
 range of political views. Relatively small parties, including those whose primary
 support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the Knesset, or Parliament.
 Suffrage is universal for adult citizens. Elections are by secret ballot. There are no
 legal impediments to the participation of women and minorities in government, but
 they are under represented. Eleven women, and 6 Arab and 2 Druze citizens serve
 in the 120-seat Knesset. Two women are in the Cabinet, and 2 Israeli Arabs are
 deputy ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups publicize human rights issues and litigate cases. The Government
 is generly responsive to international human rights groups and receives visits by
 a wide range of private and international organizations concerned with human
 rights such as Amnesty International, Middle Rast Watch, the Lawyers Committee
 for Human Rights, the International Labor Organization and others. It hosts and
 works with a degation of the International Committee for the Red Cross.
 Human rights offices at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Justice re-
 spend to inquiries from human rights groups and other governments.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Equal Opportunity Employment Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex, marital status, or sexual orientation. The Labor Exchange Law prohibits dis-
 crimination on the basis of race, religion, political beliefs, and age. A general law
 prohibits government bodies from practicing discrimination on any of these grounds.
 Women.-The Equal Opportunity Law requires employers to pay male and female
 workers equal wages for equal work. However, women's advocacy groups report that
 women routinely receive lower wages, are promoted less often, and have fewer ca-
 reer opportunities than their male counterparts.
 The adjudication of personal status law by the religious courts means that women
 are subject to restrictive interpretations of their rights regarding marriage and di-
 vorce (see Section 2.c0). Women are subject to the military draft but may not serve
 in combat positions.
 There was heightened concern in 1994 over violence against women. Women's ad-
 vocacy groups estimate that 13 women were killed by their spouses during the year,
 and that as many as 40 Druze or Bedouin women may be killed each year by male
 relatives for "family honor" offenses. A survey conducted by one women a group indi-
 cated that some 200,000 women suffer from domestic violence each year, and that
 7 per cent of these are battered on a regular basis.
 A special session of the Knesset was held on Auguat 31 to discuss violence against
 women. The Government condemns such violence and has helped to open 6 shelters
 for battered women and has plans to open several others.
 According to a 1991 law, a district or magistrate court may prohibit access by vio-
 lent family members to their property. Women's groups cooperate with legal and so-
 cial service institutions to provide women's rights education. There are 7 rape crisis
 centers. In 1993, they received reports of 2,266 cases of rape.
 Children.-The Government has a strong commitment to the rights and welfare
 of children. While there is no pattern of societal abuse against children, the Govern-
 ment has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of children
 
 
 1100
 and has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements to ensure close attention
 to the issue. Child prostitution has been reported in isolated cases and has been
 promptly dealt with by appropiate authorities. The police, educational, and social
 welfare officials are responsible for monitoring cases of abuse and administer victim
 treatment programs.
 Civil rights groups have expressed concern that female genital mutilation contin-
 ues to be practiced among the Bedouin in the Negev region. It is not known if the
 practice is common.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government does not provide Israeli
 Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of the population, with the same quality of edu-
 cation, housing, employment, and social services as Jews. Relative to their numbers,
 Israeli Arabs are under represented in the student bodies and faculties of moat uni-
 versities and in higher level professional and business ranks. A small number of Is-
 raeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the civil service, generally in the
 Arab departments of government ministries.
 The Government has tried to redress inequities in the allocation of resources to
 Arab communities, but it acknowledges that gaps remain in education, health, infra-
 structure development, and public sector employment. A 5-week strike by the heads
 of Arab councils ended in August with agreement by the Ministries of Interior and
 Finance to reduce the fiscal deficits of the Arab local authorities and investigate dis-
 crimination ingovernment funding for Arab localities.
 In practice, Israeli Arabs are not allowed to work in companies with defense con-
 tracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities,
 at their initiative, are subject to the military draft, and some Bedouin and other
 Arab citizens serve voluntarily. Apart from Druze and Circassians, Israeli Arabs are
 not subject to the draft. Consequently, they have less access than other Israelis to
 those social and economic benefits for which military service is a prerequisite or an
 advantage, such as housing, new-household subsidies, and government or security-
 related industrial employment. Under a government policy whose implementation
 began in January, the social security child allowance for parents who have not
 served in the military will be increased over a 3-year period to equal the allowance
 of those who have served in the military.
 The problem of the legal status of unrecognized Arab villages remained unre-
 solved in 1994. Residents of the village of Ramyah (see the 1991 and 1992 country
 reports) continued to negotiate the future of their village. A bill which would allow
 the pre-1948 residents of the villages of Bir Am and ]krit, or their descendants, to
 rebuild their houses remains before a Knesset legislative committee.
 Religious Minorities.-in general the Government respects freedom of worship
 and protects the rights of citizens of all creeds to worship freely. In civic areas
 where religion is a determinant criterion, such as the religious courts and centers
 of education, non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less state support than their
 Jewish counterparts. Immigration is significantly easier for Jews than non-Jews.
 The Government generally respects and protects non-Jewish religious sites.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support for disabled per-
 sons, who are about 10 percent of the population. While the law provides for equal
 treatment for the disabled, advocacy groups report continued difficulties with en-
 forcement in employment and housing. A law requiring access by the disabled to
 public buildings is not widely enforced. There is no law providing people with dis-
 abilities with access to public transportation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join and establish labor organizations
 freely. Israeli Arabs may establish their own unions but have not done so. Most
 unions belong to the General Federation of Labor in Israel, or Histadrut, or to a
 much smaller rival federation. These organizations are inde ndent of the Govern-
 ment. About 70 percent of the work force are members of Hstadrut trade unions;
 still more are covered byHistadrut's social and insurance programs and collective
 bargaining agreements. Histadrt members democratically elect national and local
 officers and officials of its affiliated women's organization, Na'amat, from political
 party lists. Plant or enterprise committee members are elected individually.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. Unions must provide 15-days' notice
 prior to a strie unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 However, unauthorized strikes occur. Strike leaders--even those organizing illegal
 strikes--are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the Govern-
 ment may appeal to labr courts for back-to-work orders while the parties continue
 negotiations.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1101
 Strikes in 1994 were concentrated in the public sector, and included a 12-week
 strike by the Academics' Union that forced the closure of 3 universities, and 4 days
 of work stoppages by employees protesting privatization of the national telephone
 company. Signiicant work stoppages also tookplace in the defense industry.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations. Following the signing
 of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement in May, representatives from Histadrut and Pal-
 estinian trade unions formalized their ongoing dialog. Palestinians from the West
 Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel may not join Israeli trade unions or orga-
 nize their own unions in Israel.
 Palestinian trade unions in the occupied territories are not permitted to conduct
 activities in Israel (see Section 6.a. of the annex). However, nonresident workers in
 the organized sector are entitled to the protection of Histadrut work contracts and
 grievance procedures. They may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers'
 committees if their numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum thresh-
 old. Palestinian participation in such committees is minimal.
 Labor laws apply to-Palestinians in East Jerusalem and to the Syrian Druze liv-
 ing on the Golan Heights.
 f. *he Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israeli workers fully exercise
 their legal rights to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the basic law against discrimination
 could be cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion
 discrimination has been reported.
 Nonresident workers may not organize their own unions or engage in collective
 bargaining, but they are entitled to be represented by the bargaining agent and pro-
 tected by collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay union membership fees
 but pay a 1-percent agency fee which entitles them to union protection by
 Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements (see Section 6.b. in the annex). The
 Ministry of Labor may extend collective bargaining agreements to nonunionized
 workplaces in the same industrial sector. The Ministry of Labor also oversees per-
 sonal contracts in the nonorganized sectors of the economy.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. Neither Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel
 are subject to this practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-A child who has attained the age
 of 15 years and who is liable to compulsory education under the Compulsory Edu-
 cation Law, may not be employed unless he works as an apprentice under the Ap-
 prenticeship Law. Notwithstanding these provisions, a child who has completed his
 14th year may be employed during a period of official school holidays. Employment
 of those aged 16 to 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest and education.
 The labor exchanges do not process work applications for West Bank or Gaza Pal-
 estinians under age 17, and higher age requirements are often imposed for security
 reasons. Ministry of Labor inspectors enforce these laws, but advocates of children s
 rights claim that enforcement is inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, cadculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 of living increases. As of October 1994, the monthly minimum wage was $540 (1,624
 new shekels). The minimum wage is often supplemented by special allowances and
 is generally sufficient to provide workers and their families an acceptable standard
 of living. Union officials have expressed concern over enforcement of minimum wage
 regulations, particularly with respect to employers of illegal nonresident workers,
 who sometimes pay less than the minimum wage.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours a week, 8 hours per
 day, and 7 hours on the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36 con-
 secutive hours and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements the pri-
 vate sector established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988. The public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 42  hour workweek in 1989.
 Employers must receive a government permit to hire nonresident workers from
 the occupied territories, certifying that no Israeli citizen is available for the job. All
 Palestinians from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless
 they are employed on shiftwork, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel. Pal-
 estinians without valid work permits are subject to arrest.
 Nonresident workers are paid through the employment service of the Ministry of
 Labor which disburses wages and benefits collected from employers. The Ministry
 deducts a 1 percent union fee and the workers' contributions to the National Insur-
 ance Institute, the agency that administers the Israeli social security system. De-
 spite these deductions, Palestinian workers do not have access to unemployment in-
 surance, general disability payments, low-income supplements, child allotments or
 
 
 1102
 maternity leave. By contrast Israeli settlers in the occupied territories who work in
 Israel have the same benefits as other Israeli workers. The International Labor Or-
 ganization has long criticized this inequality in entitlements.
 Along with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights of safety delegates
 elected or appointed by the workers. In cooperation with management, these dele-
 gates are responsible for the safety and health of the workplace. Workers do not
 have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment. However, collective bargaining agreements pro-
 vide some workers with recourse through the work site labor committee. Any worker
 may challenge unsafe work practices through appropriate government oversight and
 legal agencies.
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUB-
 JECT TO JURISDICTION OF THE PALESTINIAN AU-
 THORITY)
 This report differs from past reports because it reflects the fundamental changes
 that have occurred in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a consequence of the imple-
 mentation of the Declaration of Principles (DOP) signed by the Government of Israel
 and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on September 13, 1993.
 In May Israel transferred most responsibilities in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area
 to an interim Palestinian self-governing authority, the "Palestinian Authority (PA),"
 pursuant to agreements between Israel and the PLO. Additional responsibilities
 were transferred to the PA in the West Bank between August and December. The
 PA exercises authority over a large Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip and
 Jericho area, and more limited authority in the rest of the West Bank. Accordingly
 this report discusses the policies and practices of both the Israeli Government and
 the Palestinian Authority in the respective areas where they exercise jurisdiction
 and control.
 The DOP fundamentally altered the relationship between Palestinians and Israe-
 lis. This historic agreement put into motion a process designed to end their conflict
 and to guide negotiations over the future of the territories. The DOP provides for
 a 5-year transitional period in which specified responsibilities are to be transferred
 to the PA to permit the Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to gov-
 ern themselves.
 Implementation of this process began in May, when Israel and the PLO agreed
 (the Gaza-Jericho Agreement) on the initial transfer of powers and responsibilities
 relating to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in the West Bank. In August the
 Government of Israel and- the PLO agreed (the Agreement on Preparatory Transfer
 of Powers and Responsibilities) on the further transfer of five areas of responsibility
 (education and culture, health, tourism, taxation, and social welfare) in the rest of
 the West Bank, excluding Israeli settlements. The transfer to the PA of responsibil-
 ity for these areas was completed in December. Israel continues to be responsible
 for external security, internal security and public order in Israeli settlements, for-
 eign relations, and certain other areas until an agreement on permanent status is
 achieved. At year's end, Israel and the PLO were continuing discussions on the mo-
 dalities for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the related redeploy-
 ment of Israeli security forces awny from populated areas of the West Bank, pursu-
 ant to the DOP. In accordance with the DOP this election will establish a Palestin-
 ian Council to replace the PA.
 The situation in the occupied territories remains complex and subject to change.
 Israel occupied the lands known as the "occupied territories" (the West Bank, Gaza
 Strip, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem) as a result of the 1967 war. The inter-
 national community does not recognize Israel's sovereignty over any part of the oc-
 cupied territories. Israel has, however, asserted sovereignty over, and annexed, East
 Jerusalem. The Israeli Government has also extended its law and administration to
 the Golan Heights. Under Israel-PLO agreements, the permanent status of the West
 Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as the issue of Jerusalem, are to be addressed in sub-
 sequent negotiations.
 The West Bank and Gaza legal regimes derive from Ottoman, Jordanian, Egyp-
 tian, and British law, Israeli military orders, Ismel-PLO agreements, and decisions
 by the PA. The United States considers Israel's authority in the occupied territories
 to be subject to the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Con-
 vention relative to the protection of civilians in time of war. The Israeli Government
 
 
 1103
 considers the Hague Regulations applicable, but not those of the Geneva Conven-
 tion, although it states that it observes the Geneva Convention's humanitarian pro-
 visions.
 Israel has governed the territories through the Israeli Civil Administration
 (CIVAD) a body overseen by the Minister of -Defense. Most West Bank towns are
 governed by mayors appointed by the Israeli Government, although there are excep-
 tions, such as Hebron, Nablus, and Bethlehem. With elections for a Palestinian
 Council still under negotiation, the majority of Palestinians have not yet had the
 opportunity to participate in a broad-based electoral process. An exception is in East
 Jerusalem, where Palestinian residents are eligible to vote in Israeli municipal elec-
 tions. However, most Palestinians eligible to vote boycott such elections on the
 grounds that Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem is illegal. Israeli settlers in the
 territories (about 12 percent of the population there) are subject to Israeli law and
 are better treated than Palestinians who are subject to military occupation law. The
 Government's economic policies in the occupied territories favor Israeli settlers and
 Israeli interests in general. Under Israel-PIO agreements, Israel retains jurisdiction
 over settlements and settlers during the transitional period. The final status of the
 settlements will be addressed in future negotiations.
 Israeli security forces in the West Bank consist of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF);
 the Shin Bet, or General Security Services (GSS); the police; and the paramilitary
 border police. Military courts try Palestinians accused of security crimes as defined
 by the Government of Israel. The Palestinian Police Force (PPF) was established in
 May. It is responsible for security and law enforcement in Gaza and in the Jericho
 for Palestinians and other non-Israelis.
 The economies of the West Bank and Gaza are small, poorly developed, and highly
 dependent on Israel. Both areas rely on agriculture, services and to a lesser extent
 light manufacturing. Many West Bank and Gazan workers are employed at day jobs
 in Israel. The West Bank and Gazan economies have been adversely affected by the
 occupation, the Palestinian uprising known as the intifada, the Gulf War and the
 resulting cutoff of Arab funding, and tensions caused by continued terrorist inci-
 dents.
 There were clear improvements in the human rights situation in the occupied ter-
 ritories in 1994. With progress on implementation of the DOP, Palestinians are ac-
 iring more opportunities to participate in political and economic decisions that af-
 e   them. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho has reduced the
 frequency of large-scale confrontations and unrest. The nighttime curfew that had
 been imposed on the Gaza Strip since 1987 is no longer in effect. In addition Israel
 released several thousand Palestinian prisoners, for much of the year held fewer
 Palestinians in administrative detention, eased restrictions on freedom of expres-
 sion, relaxed enforcement of restrictions on public gatherings, and made some im-
 provements to prison conditions. There were no deportations for the second straight
 year and a substantial decrease in the number of house sealings. Moreover, Israel
 and the PLO have for the first time established channels and procedures for dealing
 with a variety of their differences over political, economic, and security matters.
 At the same time, there were credible reports that during 1994 Israel mistreated,
 and in some cases tortured, Palestinians during arrest and interrogation. Accordin
 to these reports, Israel also utilized undercover units in possible extrajudicia
 killings. Military courts imposed harsh sentences on Palestinians. Discriminatory
 policies on land and resources use and trade, and limits on freedom of movement
 remained in place. There were also restrictions imposed on the ability of Palestin-
 ians in the territories to travel to Israel. During the period covered in this report,
 Israeli civilians and military personnel were the targets of repeated lethal terrorist
 attacks. Israel also imposed periodic and often sustained closures, which were de-
 signed to meet Israel's security needs, but which did have a severe impact on the
 Palestinian economy in the territories.
 The PA assumed authority in Gaza and Jericho only in May. It is difficult to as-
 sess fully the PA's human rights record for the period under review (May to Decem-
 ber). Because of its recent establishment, the process of institution-building, espe-
 cially of the judiciary, has been slow. There have been credible reports that the Pal-
 estinian Police Force (PPF) has mistreated detainees. The PA stated that it would
 investigate incidents of mistreatment. Members of the PPF reportedly committed at
 least one extrajudicial killing, that of a detainee in custody. Although individuals
 were charged with misconduct in this case, none has been brought to trial. The PPF
 has also used excessive force on occasion, such as in November, when at least 16
 persons were killed and hundreds wounded in an effort to quell an armed dem-
 onstration at Gaza's Filistin Mosque. There were also limitations on press freedom.
 In July the PA banned the distribution in Gaza and Jericho of An-Nahar, an East
 Jerusalem daily, purportedly because the paper took a pro-Jordanian line. In No-
 
 
 1104
 vember the PA temporarily stopped distribution in Gaza of four newspapers that
 provided accounts of demonstrations against the PA to which the Gaza police chief,
 speaking on behalf of the PA, objected.
 Both Palestinian and Israeli opponents of the DOP have resorted to violence as
 a means to derail the agreement. A number of extremist groups specifically the Is-
 lamic Resistance (Hamas) and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), made a concerted
 effort to undermine Israeli-PLO negotiations by killing Israelis and discrediting the
 authority and effectiveness of the PA. A terrorist bombing in Tel Aviv in October,
 for example killed 22 Israelis. There were also acts of violence committed by Israeli
 settlers, including killings and the destruction of property. In several instances, se-
 curity forces took little or no action to halt settler attacks. In February a settler ex-
 tremist killed at least 29 Palestinians worshipping at the Ibrahimi Mosque in He-
 bron. Following this attack, the Israeli Government began to implement in March
 strict measures to control extremist settler violence against Palestinians. Israel re-
 mained obligated under international occupation law to ensure, as far as possible,
 public order and the safety of the civilian population in the occupied territories. Vio-
 lence in the territories also included killings of Palestinians by other Palestinians
 because of alleged collaboration with Israel.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Credible sources report that Israeli
 undercover units, disguised as Palestinians killed at least 13 Palestinians. This is
 a decrease from the 27 Palestinians reported killed by undercover units in 1993. The
 Government does not publish its guidelines on the conduct of undercover operations
 in the occupied territories.
 The mission of these undercover units appears to be to arrest activists suspected
 of committing serious crimes. Human rights organizations charge that undercover
 units deliberately kill suspects under circumstances in which the suspects might
 have been apprehended alive. Authorities acknowledge that the undercover units
 conduct operations among Palestinian activists, but claim that such units observe
 the same rules of engagement as other IDF units. They further claim that the IDF
 investigates all killings and allegations of misbehavior. However, human rights
 groups state that the investigations are not conducted efficiently and rarely result
 in the imposition of serious punishment. The IDF does not announce the findings
 of its investigations.
 A Palestiman free-lance journalist recorded on videotape an apparent incident of
 extrajudicial killing in September. The tape depicts an Israeli soldier firig a bullet
 into the head of a Palestinian, Nidal Tamimi, who reportedly tried to stab a soldier
 in Hebron. Tamimi was lying on the ground with a gunshot wound in the chest.
 In March an Israeli undercover unit reportedly opened fire without warning on
 six masked members of the Fatah Hawks Organizaton four of whom were armed,
 at the Jabalya Refugee Cam in Gaza, as they reportedly stopped cars and handed
 out political pamphlets. In May credible sources reported that an Israeli undercover
 unit shot two Palestinians, one a Hamas fugitive, without warning, after they had
 disembarked from a bus in Al-Ram near Jerusalem. Human rights groups de-
 manded an independent investigation into the Jabalya incident and what they
 termed the shoot-to-kill policies of the undercover forces and the IDF. According to
 the Judge Advocate General's office, at year's end the incident was still under inves-
 tigation.
 According to the Government, Palestinians killed 23 Israelis in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip, and 52 within Israel; the 1993 figures were 49 and 14, respectively.
 The worst incidents were an October bus bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 22, and
 bombings in Afula and Hadera in April that killed 12.
 Israeli settlers killed 37 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza in 1994, com-
 pared to 14 in 1993. Most of these resulted from a single incident in February when
 an Israeli settler extremist killed at least 29 Palestinian worshipers at the Tbrahimi
 Mosque in Hebron, also known as the Tomb of the Patriarchs. In the other in-
 stances, the IDF reportedly took little or no action to halt attacks. After the Hebron
 massacre Palestinians and many human rights groups questioned whether the IDF
 aduatey potects Palestinians in the occupied territories. In the wake of the inci-
 dent the Israeli Army shot and killed over 20 Palestini   an d wounded many more
 during unrest associated with the massacre. The Government later appointed an
 independent commission of inquiry which found that there was a near total absence
 of law enforcement against settler violence in the territories. The commission called
 for more stringent on-site security measures and a clarification of the rules govern-
 ing the use of deadly force against Jewish settlers in extreme circumstances.
 
 
 1105
 During the inquiry, Army officers testified to confusion about the rules on firing
 at Israeli ci ie  urig confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis. They
 stated that most soldiers would not fire on settlers, even if they attacked Palestin-
 ians. The inquiry revealed what human rights groups termed a double standard re-
 garding the treatment of Israeli and Paestinan residents of the occupied terri-
 tories.
 In a report on settler violence published in March, the Israeli human rights group
 Btselem stated that, since the beginning of the intifada in 1987 only one Israeli
 settler had been convicted of murdring a Palestinian, even though 62 Palestinians
 have been killed by Israeli civilians. The report concluded that the settlers appeared
 to be in mortal danger in only four cases. Later in the year, another settler was
 convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
 Human rights groups note that Palestinians often fail to report cases of settler
 violence because they fear being labeled as collaborators with Israeli authorities and
 retribution by settlers. These groups claim that police investigations of settler vio-
 lence are often superficial, delayed; and rarely lead to arrests or sentencing. In Oc-
 tober the Israeli press reported that West Bank military commander Major General
 an Biran asked the policane        Attorney General's office to speed up 88 crimi-
 nal cases pending against settlers. Biran charged that the police and the courts inef-
 ficiently process army complaints against settlers. For this reason, the IDF main-
 tains it must restrict the movements of violent settlers by issuing administrative or-
 ders to confie them to their neighborhoods or    a  or to deny them entry to spe-
 cific sites, such as the Ibrahhni Mosqueffomnb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. Approxi-
 mately 35 Israeli settlers fall into this category.
 Figures compiled from a number of sources indicate that Palestinians killed 65
 Paestinians in 1994, most often because of alleged collaboration with Israeli seng-
 rity services, but also in disputes between political factions, or street gangs, or in
 personal feuds. The PLO leadership pledged in 1994 that it would try to halt the
 killings of "collaborators." The number of such killings has declined in the past few
 years: there were 79 killings in 1993 and 149 in 1992. However, there were reports
 that the PA sought to persuade Israeli Arabs to refuse to allow families of collabo-
 raters to resettle in Israel.
 The PA police also reportedly committed at least one extrajudicial killings. Farid
 Jaroou', a taxi driver, was arrested by the PA police as a suspected collaboratr
 with the Israeli security services, and detained at the Gaza Central Prison where
 he was reportedly beaten during interrogation. Jarbou' died in detention on July 5,
 reportedly from injuries sustained during interrogation. After an investigation by
 the PA Department of Justice, four Palestinian police officials were arrested in con-
 nection with Jarbu's death. They have been released pending trial.
 Fin Au st membedrs of the Paestinian preventive scurity force (PSF)shot and
 killed1 Nrudal AI-Khnuli, a security Ofilcer, in a confrontation with members of another
 Palestinian security service in the West Bank town of Tulkarem. In September PSF
 officers killed another PSF officer during a confrontation with members of Hamas
 in Gaza. The PA police arrested the security officers responsible for the killings; at
 year's end, they were awaiting trial.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of any disappearances attrib-
 utedto either Israeli or Palestinian security services in 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 International, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights groups and diplomats continue
 to provide credible reports indicating that Israeli security forces are responsible for
 widespread abuse, and in some cases torture, of Palestinian detainees, including
 those who possess USq. citizenship. According to the reports, such abuse takes place
 immediatelry after arrest and during interrogation. Common practies reportedly in-
 cluded hoo ding;, forced standing, tying the detainee in contorted positions; prolonged
 exposure to extreme temperatures; blows and beatings with fists, sticks, and other
 instruments; confinement in a small and often filthy space; sleep and food depriva-
 tion; threats against the dtainee's family; and threats of death. The apparent in-
 tent of these practices is to disorient and intimidateprisoners, and to obtain confes-
 sions or information. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared
 in 1992 that such practices violate the Geneva Convention.
 Several Israeli settlers, arrested in 1994 for suspected membership in a new un-
 derground terrorist organization, claimed they were tortured after arrest. An inves-
 tigator from the Attorney General's office was unable to substantiate their assertion
 that security guards hooded, and "otherwise tortured" them in "rat-infested cells."
 Israel's Criminal Code prohibits torture. Authorities maintain that torture is not
 condoned in the occupied territories, but acknowledge that abuses sometimes occur
 and are investigated. However, the Government does not generally makepublic the
 results of such invesatieons. In June Human Rights Watch publisheda report
 
 
 1106
 based on courtroom testimonies and on interviews with 36 Palestinians interrogated
 since June 1992, their defense attorneys, Israeli soldiers, and GSS agents. The re-
 port concluded that torture and mistreatment perpetrated by Israeli security serv-
 ices are "not isolated excesses" but "a pattern that could persist only with the acqui-
 escence of the Government of Israel."
 After 40 Israelis were killed in several terrorist attacks by the extremist group
 Hamas, the GSS decided in November to allow interrogators 'greater flexibility" in
 applying the guidelines established by the 1987 Landau Judicial Commission, which
 condemned torture but allowed for "moderate physical and psychological pressure"
 to secure confessions and obtain information. The Government has not defined the
 meaning of 'greater flexibility." The decision will be in effect for 3 months, after
 which it will be reviewed.
 Most convictions in security cases before Israeli courts are based on confessions.
 An attorney is not allowed to meet with a client until after interrogation, a process
 that may take days or in some cases, weeks. The Government does not allow rep-
 resentatives from the ICRC to have access to detainees until the 14th day after ar-
 rest. Human rights groups point to this prolonged incommunicado detention as con-
 tributing to the likelihood of abuse. Detainees often claim in court that their confes-
 sions were coerced, but judges rarely exclude such confessions. Human rights grups
 assert that Palestinian detainees often fail to lodge complaints either from fear of
 retribution or because they assume their complaints will be ignored.
 In January the Knesset (Parliament) ruled that the Ministry of Justice, instead
 of the GSS, would investigate complaints against GSS interrogators. Complaints
 against Israeli soldiers are investigated by the IDF. According to the Israeli Govern-
 ment, in the period between January and September, 14 soldiers were indicted on
 allegations of improper behavior, 4 of which were counts of negligent manslaughter.
 In those cases, eight convictions have so far been obtained. The remainder of cases
 are awaiting trial. Of the aforementioned onvictions, penalties handed down have
 ranged from demotions in rank to imprisonment.
 The Israeli Central Prisons Authority closed the Nitsan Isolation Section of Al-
 Ramleh Prison in 1994 because of its poor conditions and moved the prisoners to
 other prisons. The prisoner population at Ketziot Miitary Detention Camp, the ob-
 ject of a 1993 lega petition due to its poor conditions, has fallen to about 820 in
 1994 from 4,900 in 1993. Some problems concerning prison conditions, however, re-
 main unresolved from 1993. The Israeli Supreme Court has yet to rule on a petition
 Biled in 1993 by prisoners of Hebron Prison protesting the lack of water for toilet
 and bathing facilities.
 In May Israeli security forces relinquished the administration of detention facili-
 ties in Gaza and Jericho to the PA. The physical conditions at these facilities do
 not meet minimum international standards. Food and clothing for prisoners are in-
 adequate and must be supplemented by donations from families and humanitarian
 groups. The PA has not allocated its Ministry of Justice adequate funds to make
 improvements. Credible sources have reported that Palestinian security officials
 have abused prisoners at the Gaza Central Prison. PA officials acknowledge such
 abuse.
 In July the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizen's Rights (PICCR) rec-
 ommended that PA prison administrators implement the basic international stand-
 ards for the treatment of prisoners, including ensuring that prisoners have the
 rights to legal counsel and humane treatment. In August the PICCR observed that
 prison authorities had implemented most of the recommendations for changes in
 procedures and that the treatment of prisoners had improved (see Section L.a. on
 the death of Farid Jarbou'. Other Palestinian human rights grups have reported
 that abuse of Palestinian detainees continues in Jericho and Gaza prisons and that
 several irregularities have been reported in courtroom proceedings there.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Any Israeli soldier may arrest without
 warrant a person who has committed, or is suspected of having committed, a crimi-
 nal or security offense in the territories, except for the Gaza Strip and Jericho area.
 The vast majority of arrests are for alleged security offenses. Persons arrested for
 common crimes are usually provided with a statement of charges and access to an
 attorney, and they may apply for bail. However, these procedures are sometimes de-
 layed. Authorities reportedly issue special summonses for security offenses. Israeli
 military order 1369 stipulates a 7-year prison term for any person who does not re-
 spond to a special summons delivered by a family member or posted in the civil ad-
 ministration office nearest his home addss. Bail is rarely available to those ar-
 rested for security offenses. The courts treat persons over age 12 as adults.
 Persons may be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours and then released
 unless a warrant is issued. Military orders were amended in 1994 to shorten the
 period of prarraignment detention to 11 days for Palestinians arrested in the occu-
 
 
 1107
 
 pied territories. The previous maximum prearraignment detention was 18 days. A
 ruling in 1992 shortened this period for minors and those accused of less serious
 offenses, such as stone throwing, to 8 days. Authorities must obtain a court order
 for longer detentions-up to 6 months from the date of arrest. Detainees are entitled
 to be represented by counsel at their detention hearings. They must be released at
 the end of the court-ordered detention if they are not indicted. If there is an indict-
 ment, a judge may order indefinite detention until the end of the trial. Detainees
 have the right to appeal continued detention.
 Although a detainee generally has the right to consult with a lawyer as soon as
 possible, authorities may delay access to counsel for up to 15 days in security cases.
 Higher ranking officials or judges may extend this period an additional 75 cays for
 the same reasons. Authorities must inform detainees of their right to an attorney
 and whether there are any orders prohibiting such contact. Human rights groups
 charge that authorities sometimes schedule appointments between attorneys and
 their detained clients, only to move the clients to another prison prior to the meet-
 ing. Authorities reportedly use such tactics to delay lawyer-client meetings for as
 long as 90 days. Israeli regulations also permit detainees to be held in isolation from
 family and other detainees during interrogation.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to pst notification of arrest within 48
 hours. However, Palestinian suspects ame sometimes kept incommunicado for sev-
 eral days after their arrest by Israei authorities who do not inform the family of
 the detainees' whereabouts. Palestinians assert that they generally locate the de-
 tainee through their own efforts. Notification to the US. Embassy or Consulate
 General of detained American citizens of Palestinian origin has almost always been
 by the detainee's family. The ICRC attempts to help by telephoning families with
 information received from prison officials. A senior officer may delay for up to 12
 days notification of arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and consular of-
 ficials. A military commander may appeal to a judge to extend this period in secu-
 rity cases for an unlimited time.
 Israeli district military commanders may order administrative detention without
 formal charges. The use of administrative detention continued in 1994, but at a
 lower level than in previous years. An estimated 220 Palestinians were in adminis-
 trative detention at year's end, compared to 277 at the end of 1993. Detention peri-
 ods range up to 6 months and are renewable. Israeli officials state that administra-
 tive detention is used only when IDF legal advisors determine that there is suffi-
 cient evidence to detain a person and that the evidence has been corroborated by
 two sources.
 Evidence used at hearings for administrative detention is secret and unavailable
 to the detainee or his attorney. Authorities maintain that they are unable to present
 evidence in open court because to do so would compromise the method of acquiring
 the evidence, which is often provided by informers whose lives would be jeopardized
 if their identities were known. However, human rights monitors contend that ad-
 ministrative detention is often used when evidence against a suspect would not
 stand up in court.
 Detainees may appeal detention orders, or the renewal of a detention order, before
 a military judge. At the hearing, defense attorneys may question security service
 witnesses concerning the general nature of the evidence. The Supreme Court may
 review rulings by military judges and examine secret evidence.
 There were no deportations in 1994.
 Since the signing of the DOP in September 1993, the Government has released
 5,477 Palestinian prisoners, according to statistics from the Mandela Institute for
 Prisoners. Of these, 4,500 were released over a period of several months after Israel
 and the PLO signed the Gaza-Jericho Agreement in May.
 At the end of 1994, an estimated 6,050 Palestinian prisoners were incarcerated
 in Israeli administered prisons, military detention centers, and holding centers, a
 significant drop from the 1993 figure of 9,573. Of these, 2,450 were in military de-
 tention centers and the others were in facilities administered by the Israeli Central
 Prisons Authority. Since the beginning of the intifada in 1987, the Government has
 routinely transferred Palestinian detainees from the occupied territories to facilities
 in Israel, especially to the Ketziot detention camp in the Negev Desert and Megiddo
 Prison near Afula, notwithstanding Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. As
 of September 1, nearly half (2,912)of the Palestinian prisoners were being detained
 in Israel.
 The Palestinian police in Gaza conducted several mass arrests in response to acts
 or threats of violence against Palestinians and Israelis. These arrests were con-
 ducted without warrants against groups whose members have engaged in violence.
 In most cases, Palestinian authorities released detainees without charge within the
 48-hour limit stipulated by Gaza law, although some suspects remained in custody
 
 
 1108
 longer. The PA's Ministry of Justice requires that all detainees held beyond the 48-
 hour limit must be formally charged, but acknowledges that some detainees are held
 longer without change. Gazan law allows the Attorney General to extend the deten-
 tion period to a maximum of 90 days during investigations. According to the PA's
 Ministry of Justice, 20 opposition members were in detention as of September 1. Au-
 thorities generally permit prisoners to receive visits from family members and attor-
 neys, except for prisoners held in the Gaza Central Prison security wing. In prin-
 ciple, detainees may notify their families of their arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused of non-security offenses are
 tried publicly in local courts by Palestinian udges appointed by Israeli officials, ex-
 cept where jurisdiction has been transferred by military order. At the beginning of
 the intifada in December 1987, the intifada leadership ordered Palestinian police
 and judges to resign. This weakened the ability of the courts to enforce decisions.
 Since then, Palestinian courts in the West Bank have functioned sporadically.
 Palestinians accused by israel of security offenses are tried in Israeli military
 courts. Security offenses are broadly defined and may include charges of political ac-
 tivity, such as suspected membership in outlawed organizations. Charges are
 brought by military prosecutors. Serious charges are triedbefore three-judge panels;
 lesser offenses are tried before one judge. Defendants have the right to counsel and
 to appeal verdicts to the Court of Military Appeals, which may accept appeals based
 on the law applied in the case, the sentence, or both. The right of appeal does not
 apply in all cases and sometimes requires court permission. Israeli military courts
 rarely acquit Palestinians of security offenses, but sentences are sometimes reduced
 on appeal.
 Trials are delayed for several reasons: witnesses, including Israeli military or po-
 lice officers, do not appear;, the defendant is not brought to court; files are lost; or
 attorneys fail to a ppear, in some cases reportedly because they have not been in-
 formed of the trialdate. These delays add pressure on defendants to plead guilty
 to avoid serving a period of pretrial detention that could exceed the sentence. In
 cases involving minor offenses, an "expedited" trial may be held, in which a charge
 sheet is drawn up within 48 hours and a court hearing scheduled within days.
 By law, most Israeli military trials are public, although access is limited. Con-
 sular officers are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citi-
 zens, but there have been delays in gaining admission.
 Most convictions in military courts are based on confessions. There is practically
 no testimony provided by Palestinian witnesses because, Israeli authorities main-
 tain, Palestinians refuse to cooperate with the authorities. Physical and psycho-
 logical pressures and reduced sentences for those who confess contribute to the like-
 lihood that security detainees will sign confessions. Confessions are usually spoken
 in Arabic, but recorded in Hebrew because, authorities maintain, while many Israeli
 court personnel speak Arabic, few are able to write it.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder legal defense efforts. Palestinian attorneys report that appointments to
 see clients are difficult to arrange, and that prison authorities often fail to produce
 clients for scheduled appointments.
 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused of security and ordinary
 criminal offenses are tried under Israeli law in the nearest Israeli district court. Ci-
 vilian judges preside and the standards of due process and admissibility of evidence
 are not governed by military occupation law. Settlers convicted in Israeli courts of
 crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter punishment than Palestinians
 convicted of crimes against either Israelis or other Palestinians.
 The PA inherited a court system based on structures and legal codes predating
 the 1967 Israeli occupation. The Gaza Legal Code derives from British mandate,
 Egyptian, and some locally generated law. Jordanian law applies in Jericho. How-
 ever, this body of law has been substantially modified by Israeli military orders. Ac-
 cording to the DOP and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Israeli military decrees issued
 during the occupation theoretically remain valid in both areas and are subject to
 review pursuant to a specific procedure. The PA is undertaking efforts to umfy the
 Gaza and West Bank Legal Codes. Until that is completed, the PA will keep in place
 existing civilian court structures in Gaza and Jericho. There is also a military court
 with about 600 cases pending from Israeli arrests and prosecutions.
 The PA's Ministry of Justice supervises the eight judges in the Shari'a religious
 courts in Gaza. They adjudicate divorce cases almost exclusively. Jericho's court sys-
 tem was separated from the Ramallah District in September. Appeals from the Jeri-
 cho courts are referred to the Gaza Court of Appeals. At the end of 1994, no con-
 troversial cases-including those of opposition members detained during roundups--
 had been brought to trial.
 
 
 1109
 The PA Ministry of Justice appoints all judges for 10-year terms. The Attorney
 General, an appointed official, reports to the Minister of Justice and supervises judi-
 cial operations in both Gaza and Jericho. The Chief Justice dismissed a woman
 judge m Gaza shortly after assuming office, reportedly on the grounds that such po-
 sitions were not appropriate for women. She was subsequently reinstated.
 In Jericho, in addition to the civilian court system governed by pre-1967 Jor-
 danian law, the PA maintains a security court which is constituted under the PLO's
 1979 revolutionary conduct code. Jericho's security court is presided over by a senior
 officer of the Palestinian police. The prosecutor also a Palestinian police officer, in-
 vestigates disciplinary complaints involving all branches of the Palestinian Police
 Forces in Jericho. He has also conducted investigations of security-related incidents
 in Jericho, although the suspects implicated in those incidents were civilians. Nor-
 mal limits on the amount of time individuals may be detained before being brought
 before a court do not appear to apply to suspects held by the security prosecutor.
 In the case of three youths accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail at a tourist bus,
 the security prosecutor reportedly held the suspects in detention for approximately
 2 months while the incident was investigated by the local Palestinian intelligence
 branch. The suspects, who had confessed to the charges at the time they were first
 detained, were ultimately turned over to the civilian court for sentencing.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Israeli
 military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinian homes and in-
 stitutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized by an officer of
 the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the IDF has used forced en-
 tries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed property. Undercover
 units have also engaged in destructive and violent behavior during searches, as well
 as harassment of families of wanted Palestinians. Israeli authorities claim that
 forced entry may lawfully occur only when incident to an arrest and when entry is
 resisted. They maintain that beatings and arbitrary destruction of property during
 searches are punishable violations of military regulations, and that compensation is
 due to victims in such cases. The Government does not provide information regard-
 ing such compensation.
 Authorities sealed 5 houses in 1994 for security reasons, a sharp decline from 27
 houses sealed in 1993. Security forces may demoish or seal the home of a suspect,
 whether he is the owner or tenant, without any trial. The decision to seal or demol-
 ish a house is made by several high-level Israeli officials, including the coordinator
 of the Civil Administration and the Defense Minister. Owners of houses ordered de-
 molished have 48 hours to appeal to the area commander;, a final appeal may be
 made to the High Court. A successful appeal generally results in the conversion of
 a demolition order to sealing. After a house is demolished, military authorities con-
 fiscate the land and prohibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble.
 In November part of a house was demolished by military order for security rea-
 sons after an appeal to the Israeli High Court was rejected. This was the first house
 demolition, albeit partial, since 1992. The home was the residence of the Palestinian
 responsible for the October bus bombing in Tel Aviv and belonged to his parents.
 Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing or demolishing of homes is
 a form of collective punishment because such acts target families and children.
 Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or
 unseal their homes. In 1994 the Government processed 94 requests to open sealed
 rooms and houses; 61 applications were approved. In June the Palestiman Center
 for the Study of Nonviolence began a campaign to reopen many homes sealed during
 the occupation. At the Center's urging, activists and family members opened 130 of
 more than 350 sealed houses before they were arrested. Authorities resealed several
 of the homes. In December the Israeli Government decided to allow the opening or
 rebuilding of homes sealed or demolished as a result of security offenses committed
 by a family member who had been released from prison. Each former prisoner must
 apply for a rebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Government will approve
 or reject the application.
 Israeli security services sometimes monitor mail and telephone conversations. The
 authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service and electricity to specific areas.
 In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issue war-
 rants for entry and searches of private property. These requirements were ignored
 in October, when the Palestinian police conducted a sweep of several districts in the
 Gaza Strip to search for a kidnaped Israeli soldier. Homes were searched without
 the consent of their owners; in some cases, the police forcibly entered premises, de-
 stroying doors and windows. Palestinian human rights  ;ups and political leaders
 protested the police's conduct, but the PA did not officially respond.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Section L.a. provides information on Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and
 
 
 1110
 settlers, and Israelis killed by Palestinians. Many of these victims were deliberately
 targeted; however, others were killed, or injured, by the bxcessive use of force. Ex-
 tremists associated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad were responsible for most of the
 lethal attacks on Israelis.
 Estimates vary on the number of casualties caused by use of excessive force in
 the occupied territories. Figures compiled from a number of sources indicate that
 108 Palestinians were killed by Israeli security forces, a decrease from the 184
 killings in 1993. Killings continued at rates in the West Bank similar to the fre-
 quency in the previous year. Estimates of the number of Palestinians wounded also
 vary; IDF fiures report that 925 Palestinians were wounded in 1994, as of Decem-
 ber 26, as compared to the IDF estimate of 890 wounded between January and Sep-
 tember 1993. Human rights groups estimated that 2,487 Palestinians were wounded
 by Israeli security forces in 1994, a decrease from the 1993 estimate of 4,120. Pal-
 estinians killed 23 Israeli soldiers and civilians in the occupied territories, a de-
 crease from the 49 killed in those areas in 1993. The number of deaths within Is-
 rael, however, increased from 14 in 1993 to 52 in 1994. Estimates of Israeli wound-
 ed were about 427. Extremists associated with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
 Jihad were responsible for most of the lethal attacks on Israelis.
 Israeli security forces killed 15 Palestinians under the age of 16 in 1994. Informa-
 tion on the results of the investigations of these incidents was not available. Human
 rights groups report that the IDF killed 19 people-including at least one Israeli-
 at military checkpoints since the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in March
 1993. These individuals were killed for fleeing, or failing to halt, at the checkpoints.
 Human rights groups maintain that incidents could have been avoided and called
 for an investigation into military practices at the checkpoints. After the killing of
 a Palestinian at a checkpoint in September, the IDF said it would revise the open
 fire orders at checkpoints.
 IDF regulations permit the use of live ammunition only when soldiers' lives are
 in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, to disperse a violent demonstration,
 or to fire on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." According to policy, sol-
 diers should direct fire at the legs only and may fire at a fleeing suspect only if they
 believe a serious felony has occurred and they have exhausted other means to ap-
 prehend the suspect. It is forbidden to open fire in the direction of children and
 women, even in cases of severe public disorder, unless there is an immediate and
 obvious danger to a soldier's life.
 In practice, soldiers, police, and undercover units used live ammunition in situa-
 tions other than when their lives were in danger (see Section L.a.) and often shot
 suspects in the upper body and head. Soldiers, police, and undercover units also in-
 jured many bystanders, including children, by live fire, rubber bullets, or beating
 while pursuing suspects.
 In 1994 a reserve soldier testified to B'tselem, an Israeli human rights organiza-
 tion, that as part of his military training, he was taught to shoot at a hypothetical
 suspect, in this case someone who had thrown a Molotov cocktail, without giving
 any warning, and to fire additional shots in the suspect's head as he lay on the
 ground.
 The IDF continued using heavy weapons to destroy houses believed to be the hid-
 ing place of security suspects. An estimated 12 houses were destroyed by antitank
 missiles during such operations. There are no statistics on the number of damaged
 homes. The IDF apologized and offered compensation to an UNRWA senior staff
 member whose house was demolished by antitank missiles in April 1994.
 In July an IDF unit raided the Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem, appar-
 ently searching for a group of armed men distributing Islamic Jihad leaflets on the
 hospital premises. The IDF unit reportedly interpted medical procedures, intimi-
 dated staff, patients, and visitors, reportdy beating some of them and damaged
 property. The Government of Israel expressed regret for any damage or harm raised
 by the search. The incident remains under investigation. Human rights groups
 claimed that on two instances in 1994, Israeli soldiers used children as shields to
 protect themselves from stonethrowers.
 The Palestinian Police Force used excessive force to quell a demonstration at
 Gaza's Filistin Mosque on November 18. According to Gaza-based human rights or-
 gnzations, the demonstration's sponsors did not request a permit. The confronta-
 tion resulted in the deaths of at least 16 persons and left hundreds wounded. The
 PPF arrested hundreds of demonstrators in the wake of rioting that followed the
 clash. Most were released without charges within a few weeks. The PA established
 a commission, which at year's end, was still investigating the incident.
 
 
 1111
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli Government generally respects free-
 dom of speech in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, but prohibits public expres-
 sions of support for Islamic extremist groups, such as Hamas, and other groups
 avowedly dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel. The Government eased
 other restrictions during the year. It did not enforce the prohibition on the display
 of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags, national colors, and graffiti, acts
 which are punishable by fines or imprisonment.
 Overall, censorship of specific press pieces decreased during the year. However,
 citing security reasons, Israeli authorities continue to restrict the Arabic press. Mili-
 tary censors review all Arabic publications in East Jerusalem for material related
 to the public order and security of Israel and the occupied territories. Israeli au-
 thorities prohibited the distribution of the PLO-affiliated AI-Awdah publication for
 several months in 1994. In August the Ministry of the Interior ordered the closure
 of the Hamas-affiliated East Jerusalem weekly AI-Bayan. In addition, an Arab press
 in Hebron was closed in November by the Israeli authorities for 1 year on charges
 of printing inflammatory material against the peace process. Reports by foreign
 journalists are also subject to review by Israeli military censors for security reasons,
 and the satellite feed used by many foreign journalists is monitored. Some journal-
 ists have reported that their stories arrived at their filed destination with a blank
 segment in the text.
 zme areas continue to be closed to journalists, usually in conjunction with a cur-
 few or security incident. After the Hebron massacre in February the IDF tempo-
 rarily denied entry permits to Palestinian journalists, preventing them from attend-
 ing their places of work in East Jerusalem.
 The IDF requires a permit for publications imported into the occupied territories.
 Imported materials may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli con-
 tent. According to the IDF, publications supporting Palestinian nationalism are not
 censored or banned unless they advocate violence. Possession of banned materials
 is punishable by a fine and imprisonment. Most Palestinians punished by this order
 in 1994 were members of lamas. Security forces closed several mosques after
 Hamas pamphlets were found inside.
 Citing security problems, authorities continued to close individual secondary and
 elementary schools for short periods. The frequency of such closures greatly declined
 from previous years. Palestinian universities generally operated normally, also in
 sharp contrast to previous years.
 Palestinians living in areas under the jurisdiction of the PA generally enjoy free-
 dom of speech and criticize PA performance and policies and the peace process. The
 PA has granted licenses to publish to a variety of periodicals, including some oper-
 ated by groups opposed to the peace process and critical of the PA. Two new papers,
 AI-Watan and Al-Istiqlal, affiliated with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, respectively, ap-
 peared late in the year. Both take a critical line against the PA and PLO Chairman
 Yasir Arafat.
 However, PA officials and those acting in the name of the PA, im sed restrictions
 on the press in several instances. In July the PA prohibited the distbution of the
 East Jerusalem daily An-Nahar in Gaza and Jericho, purportedly because the news-
 paper expressed a pro-Jordanian line. There were also warnings not to distribute
 in the West Bank, and as a result, the newspaper stopped publishing. After a series
 of protests, the PA allowed An-Nahar to resume distfibution in Gaza and Jericho.
 After it resumed publication, the paper adopted a more pro-PA editorial line.
 Palestinian police authorities also blocked the distribution of several Arabic and
 one Israeli newspaper for several hours November 28 in reaction to press coverage
 on a Hamas/Islamic Jihad demonstration that reported the crowd size to be much
 larger than the "official" estimate. Over the next two days, newspaper distribution
 was blocked, including the pro-PLO daily AI-Quds, apparently in reaction to the
 newspaper's strong editorial against the PA's distribution blockage. There were also
 credible reports that senior PA leaders have intimidated editors into practicing self-
 censorship, and that they have been pressured not to publish certain writers who
 are out of favor with the PA or Fatah officials. These actions have had a chilling
 effect on the willingness of reporters to criticize PA officials.
 Prior to 1994, no broadcast media originated from the occupied territories. How-
 ever, after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, the PA established the Pal-
 estine Broadcasting Company (PBC) with a television station in Gaza and a radio
 station in Jericho. The P BC a broadcast news almost exclusively reflects the PA's
 views on issues.
 Under the August Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibil-
 ities (the "early empowerment agreement") reached with the Government of Israel,
 
 
 1112
 the PA assumed responsibility for all levels of education in the West Bank, in addi-
 tion to its jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho.
 There were no reports of interference with academic freedoms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although Israeli military or-
 ders ban public gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit, authorities re-
 laxed enforcement after the signing of the Declartion of Principles (DOP) in Sep-
 tember 1993. In 1994 Israeli authorities permitted large-scale rallies in several
 towns in support of, and in opposition to, the peace agreement. Private organiza-
 tions are required to register with the authorities, though some operate without li-
 censes. Authorities permit Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-
 help organizations to operate unless their activities are viewed as overtly political
 or opposed to the DOP.
 PA officials maintain that there are no restraints on freedom of assembly, al-
 though they require permits for rallies and demonstrations. These have been denied
 on occasion. In September Gaza Police Commander Ghazi Jabali issued an order
 prohibiting specifically "political" meetings at Al-Axhar University, the Rashad
 Shawwa Cultural Center, the YMCA, and the Gala Cinema without police approval.
 Later that month, Jabali issued a second order prohibiting buses from transporting
 passengers to attend political meetings without written permission from the Gaza
 police commander. The November confrontation at the Filistin Mosque in Gaza oc-
 curred after Islamists tried to demonstrate without a permit. In Jericho, the PA re-
 quires permits for outdoor rallies and demonstrations. Other restrictions prohibit
 calls for violene, a display of arms, and racist slogans. After the October signing
 of the Jordanian-Israeli Peace Treaty, authorities prohibited a planned anti-Jor-
 danian rally in Jericho.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Israeli Government respects freedom of religion and
 does not ban any group or sect on strictly religious grounds. The Government per-
 mits all faiths to operate schools and institutions. Religious publications are subject
 to the publications laws described in Section 2.a.
 The PA also does not restrict the freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-Israeli authorities continued to issue some Palestinians
 green identity cards which signify that the bearer is a security risk and prohibit the
 bearer's travel in or through Jerusalem and abroad. As of October 1, the Govern-
 ment had issued 1,823 such cards which are generally valid for 6 months and re-
 newable indefinitely. Issuance of the cards is a form of punishment without formal
 charge or trial. According to Arabic press reports, Palestinians with blue identity
 cards, signifying they are residents of the Jerusalem area, must obtain permits from
 Israeli authorities to enter the Palestinian Authority areas.
 Closure of the West Bank and Gaza, originally instituted in March 1993 as a
 means of reducing the number of attacks on Israelis, continued at intervals in 1994.
 Most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip encountered difficulty in obtain-
 ing permits to visit, work, study, or attend religious services outside their areas of
 residence. Durin  the periodic closures of the occupied territories, Christians and
 Muslims in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have encountered difficulties in obtain-
 ing permits to visit the holy sites in East Jerusalem. As a security precaution, au-
 thorities also banned West Bankers and Gazans from entering Jerusalem during
 major Jewish holidays.
 Serious security incidents generally prompt the Government to tighten or close
 entry from the territories and the Palestinian Authority areas for extended periods.
 Israeli officials acknowledged that no Palestinian holder of a legal work permit has
 committed an act of terrorism in Israel: terrorists have been either legal residents
 of East Jerusalem or entered Israeli territory clandestinely.
 Curfews were more frequently imposed in villages and refugee camps than in
 urban areas. A serious exception was the repeated and prolonged curfews on the He-
 bron area following the February massacre. The curfew was imposed to ensure the
 safety of 450 settlers in the heart of Hebron. Like all curfews, it inhibited Palestin-
 ian residents from going to work, shopping,receiving visits or assistance from family
 members, pursuing their education, and observing religious holidays.
 Following the Hebron massacre, the Government briefly restricted the travel of
 local Israeli settlers, but they were not subject to the curfew. Even after the curfew
 was lifted in the surrounding area, it remained in effect for shops and offices in the
 Hebron business district. Authorities required residents to obtain permits to gain ac-
 cess to their shops and homes in the business area. A vegetable market adjacent
 to a small Israeli settlement remains closed and several roads to Palestinian neigh-
 borhoods that branch off of a main road were closed in order to create a safer pas-
 sage for Israeli settlers in the Hebron area.
 
 
 1113
 The Government requires all Palestinians to obtain permits for foreign travel and
 has restricted the travel of some political activists. However, thousands of Palestin-
 ians in the occupied territories travel abroad each year.
 Bride-crossing permits to Jordan may be obtained at post offices without a
 screening process. Palestinian males between the ages of 16 and 25 who cross the
 bridge into Jordan must remain outside the territories for 9 months. Expedited
 entry for Palestinian travelers crossing into Gaza at Rafah, and into the West Bank
 from the Allenby Bridge, went into effect in November. Travel documents and iden-
 tification cards for the residents of Gaza and Jericho are issued by the Palestinian
 Authority, residents in the rest of the West Bank continue to be issued documents
 by Israeli authorities.
 Obstacles to emigration include the inability to obtain a travel permit and the
 fear of losing one's residency. Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and
 familyreunification apply only to Palestinian residents of the occupied tertories.
 Israelsometimes refuses to renew the laissez-passers of Palestinians from the occu-
 pied territories who live or work abroad, on the grounds that they have abandoned
 their residences.
 The Government ordinarily does not permit Palestinians who obtain foreign citi-
 zenship to resume residence in the occupied territories; nor does it permit those who
 acquire legal residency abroad, or who remain outside the occupied territories for
 over 3 years, to resume their residency. Suchpersons are permitted to return only
 as tourists and are sometimes denied entry entirely.
 Israeli authorities also place restrictions on family reunification. Most Palestin-
 ians who were abroad before or during the 1967 war (estimated at one-fourth of the
 Palestinian population at that time) or who have lost their residence permits for
 other reasons, are not permitted to reside permanently with their families in the
 occupied territories.
 The CIVAD usually denies permanent residency in the occupied territories to the
 foreign-born spouses and children of Palestinian residents, and to nonresident moth-
 ers. The Government usually issues temporary residency permits to persons in these
 categories.
 The CIVAD liberalized its family reunification policy in 1994, allowing relatives
 who entered the territories prior to September 1993 to remain pending approval of
 their applications for permanent residence. The CIVAD also increased the number
 of approvals for family reunification cases. The PA has also presented the Israeli
 Government with 2,000 new cases, which the Government currently have under re-
 view. In June the Minister of Interior permitted female Palestinian residents of Je-
 rusalem to apply for family reunification for their nonresident husbands.
 The PA does not restrict the travel of Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. However,
 travel between Gaza and Jericho is subject to a future agreement with the Govern-
 ment of Israel as travelers must transit Israeli territory. By year's end, these ar-
 rangements were not yet concluded.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and Jericho have not yet been afforded an
 opportunity to exercise this right. The DOP provides for an election for a Palestinian
 Council. The Government of-Israel and the PA are negotiating an agreement for
 such elections. The PA is now responsible for a wide range of governmental func-
 tions in Gaza and Jericho. In the West Bank, the functions in five areas (health
 education, culture and social welfare, tourism, and taxation) have been transferred
 to the PA.
 Most Palestinians in East Jerusalem do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Jeru-
 salem municipality; less than 7 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population voted
 in the November 1993 municipal elections. No Palestinian resident of East Jerusa-
 lem sits on the city council.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local groups-Israeli, Palestinian, and mixed-monitor the Government's
 human rights practices. The Israeli Government generally cooperates with human
 rights organizations; officials normally agree to meet with human rights monitors.
 The Government permits them to publish and hold press conferences. However,
 some groups maintain that the Government does not adequately respond to their
 in iries and sometimes does not respond at all.
 S   rity forces arrested a fieldworker from the human rights organization AI-Haq
 in March and again in June during apparent roundups of suspects associated with
 the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Al-Haq claimed that the
 
 
 1114
 fieldworker was arrested and placed under administrative detention because of his
 human rights work. The Israeli Government claimed that the fieldworker was con-
 nected with violent activities undertaken by the PFLP.
 Following the Hebron massacre Israel and the PLO agreed to accept the presence
 of 121 international monitors in hebron. The monitors arrived in May and left on
 schedule in August.
 In the areas under the PA's jurisdiction, the Palestinian Independent Commission
 for Citizens' Rights (PICCR) was established in 1993. PICCR is independently fund-
 ed and its board of directors is drawn from Palestinians without official connections
 to the PA. PICCR reportedly has access to PA officials and records. It was one of
 the few Palestinian organizations to protest the PA's ban of An-Nahar newspaper.
 In areas outside the PA's jurisdiction, other Palestinian groups, including the
 Mandela Institute, the Palestine Human Rights Information Center, and Al-Haq,
 cover human rights issues.
 The PA has a cooperative relationship with the ICRC and the ILO.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Palestinian women living under military occupation face human rights
 problems similar to those of men. In addition, women endure various forms of social
 prejudice and repression within their own society. While there is an active women's
 movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, attention has only recently shifted
 from nationalist aspirations to women's issues like domestic violence, employment,
 and marriage and inheritance laws.
 There are no laws providing for women's rights in the workplace. Many Palestin-
 ian women work outside the home and some are prominent in such professions as
 medicine, law, and teaching. Personal status law for Palestinians is based on reli-
 gious law. For Muslim Palestinians, personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Is-
 lamic) law. Women have certain rights regarding marriage and divorce, inheritance,
 property ownership, and custody of children. However, women's rights advocates be-
 ieve that many Palestinian women are not aware of their legal rights.
 Although the issues of rape, domestic violence, and violence, as related to "family
 honor" have gained greater prominence, public discussion is generally taboo. Victims
 are often encouraged by relatives to remain quiet and are themselves punished or
 blamed for the "shame which has been brought upon them and their family. While
 women's groups seek to educate women on these issues, women's rights advocates
 claim that few resources are available to shelter the victims of violence. They also
 maintain that society has not been receptive to attempts to provide counseling or
 outreach services to victims.
 Children.-There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, either among Israelis
 or Palestinians.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Israeli settlers are treated more favorably
 under Israeli law and practices than Palestinians under the complex mixture of the
 laws and regulations that apply to the occupied territories, Gaza and the Jericho
 area. This includes the right to due process, residency rights, freedom of movement,
 sales of crops and goods, land and water use, and access to health and social serv-
 ices. Travel restrictions are not applied equally (see Section 2.c.). Similarly, the Gov-
 ernment treats Israeli settlers involved in security violations more leniently than
 Palestinians guilty of similar offenses (see Section L.a.).
 The Government traditionally had subjected Palestinians to higher rates of in-
 come tax than Israeli settlers. While these rates are not appreciably higher than
 those for Israeli citizens, Palestinian tax assessments are generally more arbitrary.
 The PA has assumed tax authority over Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip and is in the process of establishing full responsibility for this function follow-
 ingthe conclusion of appropriate arrangements with the Government of Israel.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no mandated accessibility to public facilities in
 the occupied territories under either Israeli or Palestinian authority. There are some
 Palestinian institutions that care for and train disabled persons; these efforts, how-
 ever, are chronically underfunded.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor affairs in the West Bank are governed by Jor-
 danian Law 21 of 1965, as amended by Israeli military orders an, more recently,
 for Jericho, decisions by the PA. The law permits workers to establish and join
 unions without government authorization. However, Israeli authorities in the West
 Bank require all proposed new unions to apply for a permit. One new union was
 established in 1994, and two others applied or registration. Israeli authorities have
 licensed 31 of the approximately 125 union branches. There are approximately 15
 
 
 1115
 trade unions in the West Bank registered with the Israeli Government and 6 trade
 unions in the Gaza Strip.
 PA officials are drafting a new labor law which reportedly provides for the right
 to establish unions, the right to collective bargaiig, the right to strike, a minimum
 wage, minimum working hours, minimum age employment restrictions, and health
 and safety regulations.
 Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labor law. They
 are free to establish their own unions. Although the Government prohibits East Je-
 rusalem unions from joining the West Bank trade union federation, this restriction
 has not been enforced. Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem may simultaneously
 belong to unions affiliated with a West Bank federation and the Israeli Histadrut
 Labor Federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Histadrut federation. West Bank
 and Gaza labor leaders met formally with Histadrut officials for the first time in
 1994. The Government prohibits Palestinian workers who are not resident in Israel
 or East Jerusalem from being full members of Histadrut. Nevertheless, Palestinian
 workers in Israel are required to contribute 1 percent of their wages to Histadrut.
 Negotiations between Histadrut and West Bank union officials to return part of this
 fee began in 1994 but are not yet complete.
 Palestinians who work in Israel are also required to contribute to the National
 Insurance Institute (N11) which provides unemployment insurance and other bene-
 fits. Palestinian workers are eligible for some, but not all, NIH benefits. Israeli au-
 thorities maintain that the Civil Administration (CIVAD) provides Palestinian work-
 ers with tax allowances and other benefits that amount to adequate compensation.
 According to the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Palestinians working in Israel will con-
 tinue to be insured for injuries occurring in Israel, the bankruptcy of a worker's em-
 ployer, and allowances for maternity leave.
 The Government has agreed to transfer the NII fees collected from Palestinian
 workers to the PA which will assume responsibility for the pensions and social bene-
 fits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of this change will be made
 by a joint Israeli-Palestinian economic committee.
 The great majority of West Bank unions belong to the General Federation of
 Trade Unions in the West Bank (GFTU) or the General Federation of Trade Unions
 in the West Bank-Workers' Unity Bloc (WUB). In the fall, the GFTU, the WUB, and
 the Gaza unions merged informally to create a single union, the Palestinian General
 Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU). Pending elections, scheduled for spring 1995,
 the PGFTU is acting as an informal coalition in negotiations with Histadrut. When
 completed, the reorganization of unions under the PGFTU should enable the West
 Bank unions, now joined with Gaza unions, to better represent the interests of
 union members.
 Union membership has declined continuously since the intifada, in part because
 the periodic closures of the occupied territories has restricted the number of work
 permits issued to Palestinians. An estimated 85,000 workers are members of the
 GFTU, the largest union bloc. There are approximately 25,000 union members in
 Gaza. The GFTU participates in meetings of the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions (ICATU), although it is not affiliated. Both the GFTU and the
 WUB have applied for membership in the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 Union organizations in the West Bank are associated with various Palestinian p-
 litical factions. Israeli authorities tended to view Palestinian unions as political or-
 ganizations and occasionally inhibited their activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) and the ICFTU have observed that fear
 of intimidation and arrest for labor activities inhibited the development of unions
 in the territories in the past.
 Palestinian labor organizations are subject to disciplinary measures for engaging
 in political activities. The CIVAD must approve all meetings of 10 or more non-Is-
 raeli citizens in the territories. The ILO reported that the CIVAD permitted it to
 hold a conference in Nablus, although Israeli authorities did not grant travel per-
 mits for union organizers to meet in Jerusalem.
 According to the CIVAD, Islamists were permitted to establish one union in 1994,
 with two branches, in contrast to none in 1993. The union represents workers in
 several Islamic enterprises.
 West Bank unions held no elections in 1994. Israeli military order 825 of 1980
 requires Palestinian unions to provide the CIVAD with the names of candidates for
 union office 30 days before union elections. The order authorizes the CIVAD to re-
 move from the lists any candidate convicted of a. felony, including those sentenced
 for security offenses.
 
 
 1116
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or legislative action.
 Under prevailing labor law, unions have the right to strike only after submitting
 a complaint to the CIVAD for mandatory arbitration. Approximately 10 strikes oc-
 curred in the West Bank in 1994. Israeli authorities did not interfere with them.
 There are no laws in the territories that specifically protect the rights of striking
 workers, and, in practice, such workers have little or no protection from employer
 retribution.
 The Gaza-Jericho Agreement provides that Palestinians employed in Israel will
 have the right to bring labor disputes before the Israeli labor courts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 40 percent of employment in the territories consists of wagejobs,
 most in services provided by the CAD, the United Nations Relief and Works
 Agency (UNWRA), or municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. The CIVAD
 does not record collective agreements because it doesot t recognize some unions and
 union leaders. Nonetheless, Israeli authorities honor such agreements and do not
 interfere in them. About 60 labor agreements are in force in the West Bank.
 Labor disputes are reportedly adjudicated by committees of 3 to 5 members in
 businesses employing more than 20 workers. The Center for Trade Union Rights,
 headquartered in Bethlehem, and European and U.. unions have recently con-
 ducted seminars on a spectrum of labor issues, including labor dispute resolution.
 Existing laws and regulations do not offer real protection against anti-union dis-
 crimination. There are no export processing zones in the occupied territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in the occupied territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age in the
 West Bank, Jericho and Gaza area is 14. This order is not effectively enforced, and
 underage workers are employed in agriculture and in some West Bank and Gaza
 factories. Work hours for young workers are not limited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the West Bank,
 Jericho or Gaza area. In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows for a maximum work-
 week of 48 hours with a required 24-hour rest period, except for certain hotel, food
 service, and cinema employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza, Israeli au-
 thorities amended this law to provide for a 45-hour workweek for day laborers and
 a 40-hour workweek for salaried employees. There is no effective enforcement of
 maximum workweek laws.
 The Israeli Ministry of Labor's Office of Inspection Services is responsible for en-
 forcing health and safety standards in the West Bank and Gaza. It maintains that
