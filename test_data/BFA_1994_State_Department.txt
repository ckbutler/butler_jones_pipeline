 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Government of the Fourth
 Republic, assisted by members of his party, the Organization for Popular Democ-
 racy/Labor Movement (ODP/MT). In spite of the existence of more than 60 political
 parties, there is little viable opposition to the President and his Government, which
 includes representatives from three small self-described opposition parties. The
 ODP/MT controls the National Assembly with 79 of the 107 seats. Several opposi-
 tion parties, meanwhile, have modest representation. Although the National Assem-
 bly approved in 1993 the Government's prposals for a onstitutionally mandated
 (though purely consultative) second chamer, such a body has still not yet been ap-
 pointed.
 Burkina Paso's security apparatus consists of the armed forces, the paramilitary
 gendarmerie, controlled by the Ministry of Defense, and the police, controlled by the
 
 
 18
 Ministry of Territorial Administration. In 1994 the Government initiated a military
 reorganization that is ultimately intended to remove the gendarmerie from the mili.
 tary chain of command. Security forces continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Over 80 percent of the population of 9.5 million engage in subsistence agriculture,
 which is highly vulnerable to rainfall variation. Frequent drought, limited commu-
 nication and transportation infrastructures, and a low literacy rate are lon stan ding
 problems. Per capita income is about $300 per year. The January devaluation of the
 CFA franc by 50 percent added to the existing economic hardship, in conjunction
 with a structural adjustment program directed by the International Monetary Fund
 under way since 1991. That program seeks to limit government spending, especially
 on salaries and transfers and open the econom y to market forces, including privat-
 ization and reduction in the size of many inefficient state companies.
 On balance, 1994 reflected some progress in the movement towards greater de-
 mocratization and decentralization, with preparations for the February 1995 munici-
 pal elections, the first since independence in 1960. However, serious human rights
 abuses persisted, including abuse and extrajudicial killings by police and penal au-
 thorities in a climate of impunity fostered by failure to prosecute abusers. The inde-
 pendent press continued to gain strength following amendment of the prejudicial
 provisions on libel in the Information Code. Violence against women also persisted,
 although several positive measures were taken in the campaign against female geni-
 tal mutilation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and   Other Extra judicial Killing.-Security  forces continued
 extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals and convicts. During December 1993
 and anuary 1994, security forces launched "Operation Punch," a campaign against
 resurgent urban and rural banditry. They shot and killed scores in the capital and
 in several other towns. Newspapers carried photos of many of the dead, often lying
 beside the weapons they were allegedly carrying while resisting arrest. Some popu-
 lar support was expressed in certain city districts for such ruthless policing action.
 In August, however, the main Burkinabe human rights organization, the Burkinabe
 Movement for Human Rights and Peoples (MBD-P), issued a condemnation of these
 and several other extrajudicial killings.
 In July guards savagely beat two young arrivals at Maco Prison in Ouagadougou
 and subjected them to degrading treatment. One of the two died the same day of
 internal hemorrhaging. A police investigation of the incident has come to a close
 without calling for the punishment of those responsible.
 Also in July, the press reported that an influential businessman implicated in a
 corruption scandal, YoussoufSawadogo, allegedly shot himself when the police ar-
 rived to question him. Several days later, a suspect in the case, Cisse Ousseni, died
 in police custody, allegedly of a heart attack. An internal investigation cleared the
 police of any wrongdoing. The Attorney General is reportedly conducing a separate
 investigation, the results of which had not been re    a year's end. Human
 rights monitors claim the autopsy performed on Ousseni provides evidence he died
 from abuse.
 Although international and local human rights groups pressured the official com-
 mission investigating the 1991 assassination of Clement Ouedraogo, a prominent op-
 position leader, to submit a report of preliminary findings to the Prime Minister,
 the report has not yet been made public. The case remains open, as do the 1989
 "disappearance" of Professor Guillaume Sessouma, detained for allegedly articipat-
 ing in a coup plot, and of medical student Dabo Boukary in 1990, detaine following
 student demonstrations. Credible reports indicated that security forces tortured and
 killed both. The Government continued to make no real effort to investigate the fate
 of a Ghanaian detainee, reportedly killed in 1993 while in police custody.
 Another disturbing trend was the increase in reported cases of viiante killings
 by the public. There were numerous documented incidents of summary mob justice
 meted out to thieves caught by the citizenry, mostly in urban centers. To date, the
 authorities have provided no explanation of the death of Doin Redan, who was found
 dead the day after being detained by police.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading 2reatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees, often to extract con-
 fessions, have been documented for a number of years. There are credible reports
 that officials at Maco Prison continue to employ torture and degrading treatment,
 including beatings, cold showers, exposure to hot sun, and forcing persons to eat
 their own feces, as occurred in the case of the two internees cited m Section L.a.
 
 
 19
 The Government is not known to have taken any disciplinary action against those
 responsible.
 Prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and can be life-threatening. The federal
 government prison in Bobo-Dioulasso, built in 1947, housed about 1,000 prisoners,
 although designed to hold less than half that number. The prison diet is poor, and
 inmates must often rely on supplemental food from relatives.
 In July Police Trainee Commissioner Roger Zango, in an address at the Police
 Academy, strongly criticized abuse of detainees. However, the climate of impunity
 created by government failure to prosecute abusers remains the largest obstacle to
 ending torture and other abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution provides for
 the right to expeditious arraignment and access to legal counsel, and the law limits
 detention for investigative purposes without charge to a maximum of 72 hours, re-
 newable for a single 48-hour period, in practice, police rarely observe these provi-
 sions. The normal average time of detention without charge is 1 week. There were
 no known political detainees or prisoners at year's end.
 Although some intellectuals, military officers, and former government officials re-
 main in self-imposed exile abroad, increasing numbers repatriated themselves.
 e. Denial of Pair Public TriaL--The Constitution provides for the right to public
 trial, access to counsel, and has provisions for bail and appeal. While these rights
 are generally respected, the ability of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains cir-
 cumscribed y ignorance of the law (70 percent of the population is illiterate) and
 by a serious shortage of magistrates.
 The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the
 country. Beneath it are two courts of appeal and ten provincial courts ("de grande
 instance"). The Constitution also provides for a High Court of Justice, with jurisdic-
 tion to try the President and senior government officials for treason and other seri-
 ous crimes, but it has not yet been established.
 According to the Constitution, the judiciary is independent of the executive. The
 President has extensive appointment and other judicial powers. The National As-
 sembly passed legislation reforming the military court system, which had been sus-
 ceptible to considerable executive manipulation. At year's end, this court system had
 not yet been staffed.
 In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or traditional courts, presided over
 by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood and village-level problems, such as di-
 vorce and inheritance disputes. These decisions are generally respected by the popu-
 lation, but citizens may also take the case to a formal court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities generally do
 not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In national security cases, how-
 ever, a special law permits surveillance, searches and monitoring of telephones and
 private correspondence without a warrant. By law and under normal circumstances,
 homes may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister
 of Justice. Except in certain cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling
 dens, such warrants must be executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6
 a.m. and 9 p.m.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1990 Information Code provides for free-
 dom of speech and press. In practice, these freedoms still remain circumscribed by
 a certain degree of self-censorship. The President and his Government remain sen-
 sitive to criticism. However, provisions in the Code granting the Government strong
 legal powers to intimidate the press through a broad interpretation of defamation
 were removed in December 1993. Journalists now charged with libel may defend
 themselves in court by presenting evidence in support of their allegations. Perhaps
 as a result, the independent press exercised greater freedom of expression.
 The independent press now includes four dailies, a dozen weekly newspapers, and
 a weekly newsmagazine. Although the official media, including the daily newspaper
 Sidwaya and the national radio, display progovernment bias, the presence of inde-
 pendent competition led it to give more coverage to the political opposition.
 Academic freedom is recognized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Permits must, however be obtained from mu-
 nicipal authorities for political marches. Applicants must indicate date, time, dura-
 tion, and itinerary of the march or rally, and authorities may alter or deny requests
 on grounds of public safety. However, denials or modifications may be appealed be-
 fore the courts.
 
 
 20
 Labor unions and others held several large and peaceful marches. Since early
 1990, political parties have been permitted to organize and hold meetings and ral-
 lies without seeking government permission. The authorities sent security forces to
 control disorders at Ouagadougou University on February 8 during a demonstration
 by some students protesting nonreceipt of their stipends. They arrested several stu-
 dents for pelting passing city buses on the highway near campus. Police later re-
 leased them and did not press charges.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Burkina Faso is a secular state. Islam, Christianity, and
 traditional religions operate freely without government interference. Neither social
 mobility nor access to modern sector jobs are linked to, or restricted by, religious
 affiliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation
 Gendarmes routinely stopped travelers within the country for identity and cus-
 toms checks and the levying of road taxes at police and military checkpoints. There
 is no restriction on foreign travel for business or tourism. Refugees are accepted
 freely in Burkina Faso. Due to civil unrest in neighboring countries, there are near-
 ly 50,000 refugees and displaced persons, mostly Tuaregs from Mali and Niger.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Burkinabe citizens have the constitutional right to change their government
 through multiparty elections. In practice, however, they have een unable to exer-
 cise that right. Power remained in the hands of President Compaore and the ODP/
 MT, most of whose members also played prominent roles in the ruling National Rev-
 olutionary Council (1983-87) and Popular Front (1987-91). The Government in-
 cludes a strong Presidency, a Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers presided over
 by the President, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The
 Compaore Government faces new legislative elections in 1997 and presidential elec-
 tions in 1998. The first round of municipal elections is scheduled for February 1995.
 The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that an elected deputy in the National Assem-
 bly is not bound to the political party under which that person was elected and may
 change party affiiations as a representative in the legislature. This practice has
 been labelled "political nomadism" and is responsible for much of the factionalism
 in o ppsitio i parties.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 nority group members in politics. However, there are few women in positions of re-
 sponsibility; 3 of the 25 ministers and 6 of the 107 National Assembly deputies are
 women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude toward local human rights gups has been mixed. It
 continued to tolerate the activities of the MBDHP, an independent group with rep-
 resentation in all 30 provinces.
 The Government is responsive to investigations by international nongovernmental
 organizations. At year's end, there were no known outstanding investigations by
 outside organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin. Minority ethnic groups, like the Majority Mossi, are represented in the inner
 circles of the Government, and government decisions do not favor one group over
 another.
 Women.-There are no constitutional or other legal protections for women, who
 face extensive discrimination. In general, women continue to occupy a subordinate
 position and experience discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, property,
 and family rights. In the modern sector, however, women make up one-fourth of the
 government work force, although usually in lower paying positions. Women still do
 much of the subsistence farming work.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs fairly often. Cases of wife
 beating are usually handled through customary law and practice. A 'popular concil-
 iation tribunal" composed of community representatives usually mediates such
 cases. The Government is attempting, using education through the media, to change
 attitudes toward women.
 Children.-The Constitution nominally protects children's rights. The Government
 announced its commitment to improving the condition of children by adopting a na-
 
 
 21
 tional policy to revitalize primary health care and improve access to primary edu-
 cation.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary, secondary, and higher educational systems--although the percentage de-
 creases dramatically beyond the primary level. Schools in rural areas have dis-
 proportionately fewer female students than schools in urban areas.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been condemned by health experts
 as damaging to physical and psychological health, is still widely practiced, especially
 in many rural areas, and is usually performed at an early age. According to an inde-
 pendent expert in the field, the percentage of Burkinabe females who have under-
 gone this procedure may be as high as 70 percent. The Government has made a
 strong commitment to eradicate FGM through educational efforts, and a newly
 formed national committee launched a campaign against the practice with United
 States Government assistance. Nevertheless, FGM is still widely practiced. At year's
 end, it was evident that the Government had taken an important first step via its
 sensitization campaign regarding the deleterious effects of this practice. Another
 form of mutilation, scarification of the faces of both boys and girls of certain ethnic
 groups, is gradually disappearing.
 People With Disabilities.-While there is a modest program of government sub-
 sidies for workshops for the disabled, there is no government mandate or legislation
 concerning accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A new labor code is currently before the National
 Assembly for review. Notwithstanding this pending legislation, workers, including
 civil servants traditionally have enjoyed a legal rigt to association which is recog-
 nized under the Constitution. There are 6 major labor confederations and 12 autono-
 mous trade unions linked together by a National Confederal Committee. They rep-
 resent a wide ideolo *cal spectrum, of which the largest and most vocal member es-
 pouses a Socialist dcTtrine. Essential workers-police, fire, and health workers-
 may not join unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers use strike actions
 to achieve labor goals. The union movement made a call for a national strike on
 April 6-8 to protest further austerity measures in the wake of devaluation of the
 CFA franc. Strikers demanded a 50 percent increase in wages and price freezes.
 About half the union movement responded.
 Labor unions freely affiliate with international trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 labor or management also may refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals.
 Appeals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern
 wage sector but encompasses only a small percentage of workers.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. The Labor Ministry handles
 complaints about such discrimination, which the plaintiff may appeal to a labor tri-
 bunal. If the tribunal sustains the appeal, the employer must reinstate the worker.
 Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor and
 it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code now in effect sets
 the minimum age for employment at 14, the average age for completion of basic sec-
 ondary school. However, the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Security,
 which oversees labor standards, lacks the means to enforce this provision ade-
 quately, even in the small wage sector. Most children actually begin work at an ear-
 lier age on small, family subsistence farms, in the traditional apprenticeship system,
 and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period, and
 establishes safety and health provisions. The current minimum monthly wage in the
 formal sector, about $48 (25,000 CFA), does not apply to subsistence agriculture,
 employing about 85 percent of the population. The Government last set the mini-
 mum wage in April. It is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family.
 
 
 22
 Wage earners usually supplement their income through reliance on the extended
 family and subsistence agriculture.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Labor and the Labor
 Tribunals is responsible for overseeing health and safety standards in the small in-
 dustrial and commercial sectors, but these standards do not aply in the subsistence
 agricultural sector. In December 1993, the Center for Worker Education in
 Ouagadougou reported that since 1991 there were 2,399 recorded workplace acci-
 dents (1,476 in the manufacturing sector, 215 in construction, and 192 in transport
 and communications sectors). Every company is required to have a work safety com-
 mittee. If a workplace has been declared unsafe by the government labor inspection
 office for any reason, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work without jeopardy to continued employment. In practice there are indications
 that this right is respected, but such declarations are relatively rare.
