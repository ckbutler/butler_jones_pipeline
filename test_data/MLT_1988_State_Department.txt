 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. Executive power is
 vested in the President who appoints as Prime Minister the
 leader of the party which gains a plurality of seats in the
 quinquennial election for the unicameral legislature. The
 most recent election, on May 9, 1987, brought the Nationalist
 Party to power with a one-seat majority in Parliament
 fo-lowing 16 years of Labor Party rule; the transition of
 government generally was orderly.
 Law enforcement and internal security are the responsibility
 of the Malta police. Since April 4, 1988, a civilian
 commissioner again commands the police, succeeding the armed
 forces commander who was assigned as acting commissioner in
 the wake of the June 1987 riot and unsettled conditions within
 the police after the May 1987 election. The Deputy Prime
 Minister, who is also Minister of Justice, has jurisdiction
 over the police.
 The Maltese economy is a mix of state-controlled and private
 firms. Malta is heavily dependent on its ability to export
 and on tourism. Foreign private investment in export-
 oriented, light manufacturing industries is being actively-
 promoted, and the Government is also developing Malta as a
 center for offshore business activities.
 In the human rights area, the Constitutional Court on
 September 26, acting on appeal, annulled a law passed by
 Parliament--a precedent-setting decision establishing judicial
 review. The law was overturned on human rights grounds,
 namely, the right of a defendant to the counsel of his choice,
 including counsels who are also members of Parliament. A
 parliamentary select committee released a preliminary report
 on constitutional reform, including measures to safeguard the
 independence of the judiciary; that report continues to be
 studied.
 In the area of law enforcement, a police academy was opened on
 July 12, the purpose of which is to provide professional
 training, including a course on human rights and law
 enforcement. Following release of a report by a board of
 inquiry (appointed by the previous Labor Party government in
 1986) concerning the degrading treatment of prisoners, the
 prison director in June was dismissed, and steps were
 instituted to reform prison procedures. On March 7, Malta
 ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of
 Torture and the eighth protocol to the European Convention on
 Human Rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No known incidents of political killing occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred.

 MALTA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In response to an opposition member's allegations in
 Parliament that prisoners were maltreated, the then Labor
 Party Prime Minister on March 25, 1986 appointed a board of
 inquiry. The board, headed by a distinguished jurist,
 concluded that beatings had occurred, that 15 prisoners had
 been kept in solitary confinement for periods ranging from
 2 to 4 weeks, and that prisoners had been deprived of
 clothing, sanitary facilities, and personal articles
 overnight. On June 7, 1988, the Deputy Prime Minister and
 Minister of Justice recommended to the Public Service
 Commission that the Director of Prisons and the Chief Prison
 Officer be relieved of their positions. The two were
 dismissed, and steps were instituted to review prison
 procedures and to ensure that the Constitution's prohibition
 against inhuman or degrading punishment is respected.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. Police
 officers above the rank of inspector may issue arrest warrants
 without court order. The police may, on suspicion, arrest a
 person for questioning. Persons so detained are not entitled
 to legal counsel. Within 48 hours, persons so arrested must
 be brought before the court and charged or released. Persons
 incarcerated pending trial have access to counsel, and
 periodic hearings are mandatory.
 There are no known cases of incommunicado detention or
 political exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. In 1988 the bipartisan parliamentary Select
 Committee on Constitutional Reform, chaired by the Deputy
 Prime Minister, presented its recommendations, including steps
 to strengthen both the independence and peer review of the
 judiciary. Those recommendations are being reviewed by
 political parties and the public before further parliamentary
 consideration.
 Trials in Malta are public. Defendants have the right to
 counsel of their choice, at public expense if necessary. They
 enjoy a presumption of innocence, may confront witnesses and
 present evidence, and have the right of appeal. The courts'
 jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals
 (e.g., the Industrial Tribunal, the Commissioners for Justice,
 and the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive
 authority over certain judicial functions, although their
 independence is not legally guaranteed. Defendants in cases
 before the Industrial Tribunal or the Public Service
 Commission may not be represented by lawyers.
 On September 26, the Constitutional Court, acting on appeal,
 ruled unconstitutional a law enacted in 1977 which prohibited
 Members of Parliament who are attorneys from acting as counsel
 in judicial cases against the Government. This ruling ensures
 the defendant's right to counsel of his choice as provided by
 the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Malta is a
 party. The ruling also established the precedent in Malta of
 
 
 1131
 MALTA
 judicial review; it was the first time the Constitutional
 Court had annulled a law passed by Parliament. This is doubly
 significant because the court decided the case on human rights
 grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is ensured in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. There have
 been a few- unsubstantiated charges of telephone tapping by the
 Government. These charges have been denied.
 Political party membership and participation is voluntary.
 However, because Malta is a small, insular society with deeply
 polarized politics, there is subtle societal (family,
 employment) pressure for affiliation with particular parties.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression (speech and press) is protected by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The only
 exception is the 1987 constitutional amendment which bans
 foreign participation in local politics (e.g., guest foreign
 speakers sponsored by a political party) during the period
 prior to an election.
 The broadcast media (television and radio) are state owned.
 During 1988 oppcsition viewpoints received prominent,
 frequently extensive coverage on a par with coverage provided
 to the Government, irrespective of news value, although both
 majority and opposition political parties complained of bias
 in news coverage. A constitutionally mandated broadcasting
 authority exists to ensure impartiality in broadcasting. The
 parliamentary select committee's report addressed ways to
 strengthen the broadcasting authority.
 The Maltese press is very lively; several newspapers are
 associated with political parties. The editor of the
 newspaper associated with the majority party was disciplined
 for publishing the parliamentary Select -Committee on
 Constitutional Reform's report without official permission.
 Academic freedom generally is respected. A new education law,
 enacted in August, accorded professional status to teachers
 and provided greater autonomy to the university.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is ensured in the Constitution.
 In 1988 police permits were routinely issued for political
 meetings and other public activities of political parties or
 groups of citizens. The right of peaceful assembly was
 exercised in practice during the June 25-29, 1988, visit of
 101S Ark Royal. The opposition Labor Party staged massive
 demonstrations against the visit. Although occasionally
 sorely tested, the police reacted professionally and permitted
 the protests to proceed.
 On August 16, a Maltese court ruled that in a case involving
 the right of peaceful assembly, justice delayed is justice
 denied. The case concerned the denial in 1978 of a police
 permit to a student organization which petitioned to hold a
 
 
 1132
 MALTA
 silent protest march against the Government. The case had
 been continued repeatedly since 1978 with no decision. The
 student organization claimed inordinate delay and on July 22
 applied for constitutional redress. The court ruled in favor
 of the students--unreasonable delay in deciding the case
 constituted a violation of the students' human rights as
 provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights and
 Malta's Constitution.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is
 protected constitutionally and is respected. The
 overwhelmingly dominant religion is Roman Catholicism,
 although there are small numbers of people who practice other
 religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or immigration. Maltese who acquire the
 citizenship of another country may, under certain
 circumstances, lose their Maltese nationality. Maltese
 emigrants who return to Malta are not automatically entitled
 to regain their Maltese citizenship but must apply to the
 office of the Prime Minister; in most cases such applications
 are acted upon favorably. They must, however, renounce their
 other nationality.
 As of August 9, returning Maltese emigrants have the same
 rights as Maltese resident citizens to register for work (a
 right which in May 1987 had been rescinded for returning
 emigrants). In September the Government announced its
 intention to seek a constitutional amendment recognizing dual
 citizenship for Maltese emigrants.
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta
 generally are not permitted to remain in Malta. The December
 1987 agreement naming the Emigrants' Commission as the local
 representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees has worked well in providing assistance and
 counseling for intending refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malta is a parliamentary democracy in which two political
 parties, the Nationalist Party (in power) and the Malta Labor
 Party (in opposition), dominate Maltese public life.
 Political activity is often intense, and partisan feelings can
 be very pronounced, heated, and polarized. Elections with
 universal suffrage, in which all parties participate freely,
 are held every 5 years. During the most recent election on
 May 9, 1987, 96.11 percent of those registered actually voted.
 The bipartisan parliamentary Select Committee's preliminary
 report containing proposals to strengthen the democratic
 system in Malta, including~strengthening the role of the
 president, was provided to the two parties' parliamentary
 groups in camera in early 1988 for comment, and became public
 by late spring. The Nationalist Party developed its
 
 
 1133
 MALTA
 own set of proposals. No further work or debate took place
 regarding the Select Committee's report in 1988.
 While the leadership of Maltese political parties is dominated
 by men, women do participate in party affairs, primarily
 through women's movements. Two Members of Parliament are
 women (one Nationalist and one Labor). The General Secretary
 of the opposition Labor Party is a woman, as is a former
 president of the Republic. There are no women among current
 government ministers and parliamentary secretaries.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government places no restrictions on investigations by
 international human rights groups. On March 7, Malta became
 the second country to ratify the Council of Europe Convention
 on the Prevention of Torture. The Convention, which will
 enter into force with seven ratifications, provides for the
 establishment of an international committee empowered to visit
 all places where persons are deprived of liberty by a public
 authority.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Maltese citizens have a de jure right to housing, employment,
 and education on a nondiscriminatory basis. However, for many
 years political party affiliation and extended family ties
 have constituted strong societal pressure in employment, the
 provision of public services, and granting of import
 licenses. A commission to investigate allegations of
 injustices, discrimination, or unfair treatment exists.
 For reasons derived from tradition and culture, Maltese
 society does not generally associate women's rights with human
 rights., There are laws on equal opportunity and equal pay for
 equal work, but discrimination occurs. Job advertisements- may
 specify whether the positions are for men or women. Women in
 the professions tend to earn less than their male
 counterparts, and women in the manufacturing sector are
 heavily concentrated in the garment industry. While women
 constitute slightly more than half of Malta's population
 (174,138 females and 169,196 males in July 1988), they are
 less than one-quarter of Malta's labor force.
 Married women are subject to legal discrimination in that they
 lose entitlements and seniority personally acquired
 (retirement, health benefits, social security) upon marriage.
 Legally, the husband is head of the family unit with dominant
 responsibility for economic and financial questions, as well
 as all major decisions concerning children. Married women can
 own businesses, checking accounts, etc. only with the consent
 of their husbands. They must be represented by their husbands
 in business or financial litigations.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right, respected in practice, to associate
 freely and to strike. As of June 30, 1987, there were 21
 trade unions registered in Malta. In 1988 the General Workers
 Union (Malta's largest union) had 34,791 active worker
 
 
 1134
 MALTA
 members. The next largest union, the Union Haddiema
 Maghqudin, had 20,173 members. The General Workers Union
 (GWU), which celebrated its 45th anniversary in 1988, has
 since 1978 been statutorily merged with the Malta Labor Party
 in the "workers' movement." The other labor unions are
 independent of political parties. The current Government
 encourages the development of free trade unions without party
 affiliation. Maltese unions belong to a variety of
 international trade union groupings and their representatives
 actively participate in the work of the International Labor
 Organization.
 In 1988 few strikes occurred in Malta. The major union action,
 an attempt to blockade Grand Harbor during the visit of the
 British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, was politically
 motivated. The leadership of the GWU and the Labor Party
 claimed responsibility. Similarly, GWU members from the
 dockyards had a confrontation with police at a local bank,
 where some clerical workers were briefly on strike, and
 destroyed some private property.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free, in law and in practice, to organize and
 bargain collectively. Voluntary worker-employer negotiations
 and collective bargaining have been encouraged by the current
 Government since the lifting of the wage and price freeze in
 1987. Labor legislation and practice is uniform throughout
 Malta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Malta; it is constitutionally
 prohibited.
 c. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children younger than 16 years may not legally be employed.
 This injunction is generally'respected and enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage in Malta in 1988 was $86.65 per week.
 The minimum wage is generally enforced. Given government
 subsidies in housing, health care, and free education, the
 minimum wage provides a basic standard of living.
 Maximum hours of work are regulated by wage council orders for
 various trades. For most sectors, the maximum is 40 hours per
 week, but in some trades the maximum allowable is 43 or 45
 hours per week.
 In 1988 occupational safety standards and health regulations,
 especially in the dockyards and construction sectors, were
 considered to be in need of review, updating, and
 enforcement. In October the Government expressed its
 intention, following consultation with the World Health
 Organization, to establish an occupational health authority.
