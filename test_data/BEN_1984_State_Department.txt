 BENIN
 Benin obtained its independence from France in 1960 and
 experienced numerous changes in government until 1972 when the
 Beninese army intervened in a coup which brought President
 Mathieu Kerekou to power. Subsequently, the new leaders
 initiated a Marxist-Leninist government with a single
 political party, the People's Revolutionary Party, and
 introduced a new Constitution (1977). The party is directed
 by a small leadership group, in which the influence of the
 military remains important.
 Continuing political tensions during the mid-1970's had a
 chilling effect on the exercise of both political and personal
 liberties. The Government arrested a number of persons for
 opposing government policies of social and political
 transformation. In January 1977, an unsuccessful attempt to
 overthrow the Kerekou Government initiated a period of intense
 suspiciousness toward both foreigners and domestic critics.
 In recent years, however, as the Government has consolidated
 its authority, tolerance toward divergent political views has
 increased.
 Consistent with this trend, the Government on August 1, 1984,
 declared an amnesty for all political prisoners except those
 implicated in the January 1977 coup attempt. Eighty-five
 prisoners, some of whom had been held since 1973, were released
 under the amnesty. According to government sources, only three
 persons, all charged with involvement in the 1977 coup attempt,
 remain in detention.
 With an annual average per capita income of $326, Benin ranks
 statistically among the world's poorest countries. The
 majority of its population depends upon subsistence agriculture
 and small trade for its livelihood. At the same time, despite
 steady population growth, Benin remains a net exporter of
 agricultural produce. Government policy has given priority
 to expanding agricultural production. Owing to the mixed
 experience in recent years with large, state-owned
 corporations, the Government has also given new emphasis to
 the encouragement of small private enterprises. Benin's
 active private commercial sector has traditionally played a
 strong role in the economy and has been little affected by the
 change of political orientation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported cases of political killing by the
 Government in Benin in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or secret arrests in
 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports in 1984 alleging torture or cruel and
 unusual punishment of prisoners or detainees. Prison
 
 
 21
 BENIN
 facilities and conditions in Benin are poor, and overcrowding
 and poor sanitation are common complaints. Friends and
 relatives are expected to provide food for prisoners.
 Allegations of torture in previous years have been made to
 Amnesty International and other human rights organizations,
 primarily on the basis of reports received from Beninese
 living abroad. Instances of physical and psychological abuse
 undoubtedly occur; and there is one report that some political
 prisoners released in the August 1, 1984 amnesty had suffered
 injury or illness during incarceration. There have been no
 reports of discrimination against prisoners because of sex,
 religion, or national origin.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Beninese Constitution states that no citizen can be
 arrested without a decision from an established judicial body.
 In practice, persons have been detained indefinitely at the
 discretion of the Government, without recourse to legal
 assistance or a judicial hearing. In the past, many arrests
 occurred during periods of high political tension. Although
 arrests are not publicized, no special attempt is made to keep
 them secret. According to official sources, 6 persons were
 detained for alleged political offenses in 1984; 26 in 1983.
 In the general amnesty of August 1, 1984, the Government
 released a number of students arrested in 1979 and 1980 for
 demonstrating against the Government. These students had been
 the subject of appeals by various governments and international
 human rights agencies.
 According to official reports, only three persons remained in
 detention on political charges after the August 1 amnesty; all
 are charged with involvement in the 1977 coup attempt. There
 are reports that four other persons were Ire-arrested' after
 the amnesty, but these are individuals who had either fled the
 country prior to sentencing, or had escaped from prison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's judicial system, largely inherited from the French,
 is allowed to function independently in all but sensitive
 political cases. In such instances, defendants may or may not
 be permitted legal counsel or granted a public hearing. In
 recent years, the Government has relied principally upon the
 established civilian court system, known as the 'People's
 Courts," which are presently organized at the provincial and
 national levels. The highest court of appeal is the Central
 People's Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution affirms the inviolability of the home and
 requires that a warrant be obtained from a magistrate before
 the police may enter a private residence. For the most part,
 this constitutional right to privacy is respected. However,
 unauthorized or forced entries are occasionally alleged,
 especially in cases considered politically sensitive or
 threatening by the Government. Petty corruption by
 functionaries also poses a potential threat to certain personal
 rights, such as protection against illegal search and seizure.
 Allegations that police and security officials monitor
 telephone and mail service to suspected persons remain
 
 
 22
 BENIN
 unconfirmed but cannot be dismissed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Virtually all of the media in Benin are owned and operated by
 the Government. This includes the one daily newspaper, as
 well as the sole radio and television stations. The media
 carry only those stories and views that are approved by or
 serve the interests of the party and the Government. While
 the Government has been prepared to tolerate criticisms of
 specific actions, public opposition to the Government itself,
 or its basic policy orientations, is not permitted. Apart
 from the government-owned media, two private journals are
 published in Benin: one by the Catholic Church dealing
 primarily with religious and social news; the second a monthly
 magazine of African news and opinion aimed primarily at a
 regional audience. The latter deals regularly with political
 topics. Both presumably exercise prudence in treating
 sensitive issues or views. Neither has been the object of
 direct government censorship or interference. There have been
 no reported efforts to censor or prohibit the receipt of
 publications from abroad. No attempt is made to interfere
 with the reception of foreign radio broadcasts, which are
 widely listened to. Discussion and debate at Benin's National
 University is wide-ranginï¿½ and uninhibited. In recent years
 contacts and partnerships with foreign academic institutions
 have been encouraged.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are allowed, but all meetings of a political
 nature must be sponsored by the single party. A number of
 social, service, and professional organizations (including
 Lions and Rotary) exist and maintain active international
 affiliations. In the immediate post-independence period,
 labor unions, which still represent less than five percent of
 the labor force, exercised important political and economic
 influence. Under the present Constitution, labor unions are
 organs of the party and Government, and are unified under a
 national organizational umbrella confederation, the National
 Confederation of Workers' Unions (NCWU). Local unions do have
 the right to bargain and negotiate with individual employers,
 obliging the Government to act as arbiter as necessary. The
 right to strike is not guaranteed under the 1977 Constitution,
 and strikes are not condoned by the Government. Such labor
 actions as do occasionally occur usually take the form of work
 stoppages to protest specific grievances, e.g. late salary or
 scholarship payments. The NCWU is a member of the
 continent-wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity,
 based in Accra, and of the World Federation of Trade Unions
 based in Prague.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Benin is a religiously diverse society embracing some 40
 different faiths, including Islam, Christianity, and
 traditional religions. Adherence to a particular faith does
 not confer any special privilege or status. With the
 exception of one group, Celestial Christianity, which has been
 declared illegal by the Government, no restrictions are placed
 on religious ceremonies or teachings. Religious conversion is
 freely permitted. A number of international religious
 
 
 BENIN
 missions have operated for many years in Benin with the
 authorization of the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. Passport and exit
 permission are required for travel to countries beyond the
 West African region, but obtaining these does not present
 unusual problems. Economic rather than governmental
 constraints constitute the principal obstacle to travel
 outside the region. Emigration is a way of life, and many
 Beninese have gone to neighboring countries in search of
 employment. The Government encourages Beninese abroad to
 return home to contribute to the country's development.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Leadership is exercised by President Kerekou and a small group
 of senior officials, many of whom also hold positions in
 government. The electoral process allows for citizen
 participation in the nomination of candidates for the National
 Revolutionary Assembly, in theory the principal decision-making
 body of the Government. Party membership is not a requisite
 for participation in this process or for high office or civil
 service employment. The final selection of candidates for
 the single national slate, however, is made by the party
 leadership. No opposition parties or slates are permitted.
 The Assembly itself rarely takes issue with policies formulated
 by the political leadership. According to government figures,
 93 percent of all eligible voters participated in, and voted
 for the national slate in the last assembly elections on June
 11, 1984.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has traditionally regarded attempts to
 investigate human rights practices as interferences in its
 internal affairs. It has not responded officially to
 complaints previously brought by Amnesty International before
 the U.N. Commission on Human Rights regarding political
 prisoners and detainees. At the same time, government
 sensitivity toward both domestic and international criticism
 was probably a factor in the August 1984 decision to amnesty
 political prisoners, including a number of students. The 1984
 Amnesty International Report noted the long detention of
 students and teachers. Also during the past year, regional
 representatives of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross have made several visits to Benin. Freedom House terms
 Benin 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Benin had an estimated annual per capita income of $307 in
 1982. It is estimated that more than 80 percent of Benin's
 3,894,000 people (1984) live in rural areas, where they are
 primarily engaged in subsistence agriculture; in 1979, it was
 estimated that 65 percent of the rural population fell below
 what was considered the absolute poverty line. The annual
 population growth rate is estimated at 3.1 percent, the infant
 mortality rate at 142.7 for every 1000 live births, and life
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 3
 
 
 24
 BENIN
 expectancy at birth at 49.47 years (all 1984 estimates). Only
 21 percent of the population had access to safe drinking water
 in 1979, comprising 52 percent of those living in urban areas,
 as opposed to only 16 percent of those in rural areas.
 These statistics notwithstanding, Benin enjoys a relatively
 favorable climate and in most years has been able to produce
 more food than its population consumes. According to a 1977
 estimate, calorie supply was 97.65 percent of requirements.
 The statistics also understate to some extent the country's
 actual income, much of which derives from informal trade with
 neighboring countries and is not reflected in official figures.
 The Government has committed itself to a development strategy
 based on agricultural self-sufficiency and a more equitable
 distribution of income and social benefits. Over the last
 several years, 23 percent of the annual operating budget has
 been allocated for education, and 6 percent for health and
 other social services. This emphasis has been reflected in
 substantial improvements in both adult literacy and primary
 school enrollment figures. In 1980, the adult literacy rate
 was estimated at 27.9 percent: 39.8 percent for males, and
 16.6 percent for females. In 1981, primary school enrollment
 was estimated at 67.36 percent of primary school-aged
 population: 93.8 percent of males, and 42.33 percent of
 females.
 The Government's efforts to spur development through
 investments in large-scale state-owned agricultural and
 industrial projects have had disappointing results, in part
 due to external economic factors. As a consequence, renewed
 emphasis is being placed on the development of small-scale
 private enterprises in both farming and industry. A
 potentially serious constraint on the achievement of
 development plans is the incidence of corruption, a problem
 which the Government has acknowledged.
 Benin's population comprises over 40 different ethnic groups.
 Exploitation of these differences in the past was cause of
 frequent political unrest and instability. The Government has
 made a commitment to eliminate discrimination on the basis of
 race, religion, or ethnicity. Historically women have played
 a major role in both agriculture and commerce. Constitutional
 guarantees of equal status for women have been supported by
 government policies. While there are currently no women in
 ministerial positions, a number of women hold executive level
 responsibilities in the Government, the National Assembly, and
 the party.
