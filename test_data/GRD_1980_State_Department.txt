 GRENADA
 The island state of Grenada (population about 105,000)
 received its independence from the United Kingdom
 in 1974, inheriting a Westminister system of parlia-
 mentary democracy. The first Prime Minister, Eric
 Gairy, was a labor leader who was accused by his opponents
 of personal corruption, rigging the 1976 elections,
 and physical intimidation of the political opposition
 through the use of violence by a force of "police
 auxiliaries* personally loyal and accountable to him.
 In March 1979, the leaders of a revolutionary opposition
 group, the New JEWEL Movement staged a nearly bloodless
 coup. Notwithstanding the extra-constitutional nature
 of the coup, the new Peoples Revolutionary Government
 was greeted by widespread acceptance. Despite early
 promises to uphold the parliamentary system and protect
 human rights, the People's Revolutionary Government
 has systematically undermined both. While many observers
 expected the human rights environment in Grenada to
 improve under the new government, virtually all now
 agree that the situation has deteriorated markedly
 over the past eighteen months.
 During its first several months in power, the govern-
 ment suspended the 1974 constitution and detained
 a number of former government officials, policemen,
 opposition political leaders, and private citizens
 without bringing charges and without prospect of trial.
 The government has also closed the sole privately-
 owned newspaper. Opposition rallies and public criticism
 have been discouraged and effectively curtailed by
 government intimidation.
 The government has promised elections, but has not
 set a date and indicated that they are not likely
 to be held soon. It has announced that a new consti-
 tution is in preparation and will be placed before
 the voters for approval by a national referendum,
 but there has been no apparent progress on its drafting
 during the past year. In the course of a December
 1980 hearing of an application for a writ of habeas
 corpus brought on behalf of a political detainee,
 Grenada's Attorney General stated that Grefiadians
 now have no fundamental rights and freedoms. The
 level of official corruption appears to have been
 sharply reduced, and the government has taken steps
 to meet the basic human needs of its citizens within
 the constraints of a limited economy.
 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The suspended 1974 constitution guaranteed protection
 from inhumane treatment and expressly prohibited torture.
 While opponents claim that the government either condones
 or employs torture, there is insufficient evidence
 to confirm this.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 
 436
 There is some evidence for crediting reports that
 third degree measures have been used on detainees
 held in People's Revolutionary Army locations and
 that some political prisoners have been physically
 abused during detention. The prison system in Grenada
 provides adequate health, dietary and sanitary condi-
 tions. Visits by family members are usually allowed.
 In some cases, political prisoners are held in separate
 facilities controlled by the People's Revolutionary
 Army. Family visits to political detainees reportedly
 have been barred during much of 1980, especially in
 the wake of alleged escape attempts and domestic violence.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no credible reports of disappearance.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution has been suspended since the 1979
 coup. A new People's Law provides for a preventive
 detention tribunal, thereby institutionalizing deten-
 tion without trial. The People's Law provides that
 persons whose actions are likely to endanger "public
 safety or public order or to subvert or otherwise
 sabotage the People's Revolutionary Government" are
 subject to detention without formal charges. The
 government has conducted roundups of persons suspected
 of counter-revolutionary activity. Only a few of
 the other 90 persons being held under the People's
 Law dealing with national security have been charged.
 The government justifies the detention of most persons
 confined under the new law by claiming that they are
 believed capable of organizing and executing a "coun-
 ter-coup." Many of those detained are opposition
 political leaders.
 The law provides for the review of detainees' cases
 by a three-member tribunal at as frequently as two-
 month intervals. The tribunal meets in private and
 none of its members has legal background. Detain-
 ees are said to have the right to sunmon witnesses,
 although it is unclear if this prerogative has ever
 been exercised. Detainees are not allowed the right
 to have legal counsel present at tribunal hearings.
 The tribunal's non-binding recomendations are secret
 and submitted only to the Minister of National Security
 (at present the Prime Minister) for final review.
 The tribunal announced that it would review cases
 at six-month intervals, but has not kept its schedule.
 It appears to meet at irregular and infrequent inter-
 vals. The government has, by undisclosed means, eval-
 uated cases of some detainees since then and freed
 several individuals.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The preventive detention tribunal to deal with national
 security cases has the effect of delaying indefinitely
 a citizen's access to fair public trial. The tradi-
 tional legal system, based on British common law,
 continues to operate for non-security related offenses.
 The accused in these cases has the right to counsel,
 and normal legal remedies are available. The indepen-
 dence of the judiciary has been maintained in civil
 
 
 437
 and criminal cases. The government has also appointed
 an appeals court composed of three leading West Indian
 (but non-Grenadian) jurists. Despite indications
 to the contrary, the government has not acted to replace
 the existing judiciary system'with "People's Courts."
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 In the absence of a constitution, the government gives
 powers of'arrest and search to members of its People's
 Revolutionary Army, as well as to the regular police.
 Searches done under the umbrella of "national security"
 require no warrant and have probably been used to
 harass and stifle political opposition. Warrantless
 searches are usually conducted in conjunction with
 arrests of presumed political opponents of the government.
 Searches unrelated to political or security issues
 are normally conducted only with a warrant.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the ulfillient
 of Such vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Agriculture, the basis of the economy, is unable to
 provide employment for more than 60 to 68 percent of the
 work force. Cocoa,. bananas and nutmeg are the main
 cash crops. The government has plans for the development
 of agro-industries, fishing and tourism. While control
 over certain imported commodities has increased, the
 private industrial, cornercial and banking sectors
 generally have been undisturbed. The single significant
 exception was the 1979 takeover by the government
 of a bottling plant after a management-worker dispute
 lasting nearly 40 days.
 The housing situation in Grenada appears to have deterio-
 rated steadily during the 1970's. The government
 has given priority to the construction of the new
 low-cost housing.
 The literacy rate is over 85%, equivalent to the percen-
 tage of the population completing three or more years
 of schooling. Elementary education is free. Secondary
 education is subsidized by the government, but is
 not completely free. Classroom space appears adequate,
 although there is a serious shortage of trained teachers.
 It is difficult at this stage to assess the new govern-
 ment's success in satisfying basic economic needs
 of the people. There are no credible reports of corrup-
 tion within the leadership of the government. This
 is in marked contrast to the situation existing under
 the previous government.
 The government has acted to increase controls over
 government expenditures and to apply its limited resources
 to the different economic problems that it inherited.
 Its efforts to improve the basic human needs situation
 have won it considerable popular support. Two principal
 factors have contributed to economic strain: the world-
 wide economic downturn and the decline of the tourist
 industry caused largely by concern stemming from the
 revolution. The government's  attempts to deal with
 these difficulties have met with mixed success.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 
 
 438
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The freedoms guaranteed in the suspended 1974 consti-
 tution have been restricted during 1980. Following
 the closing of the privately owned independent 'Torch-
 light" newspaper, the government suppressed a Church-
 sponsored paper after one issue and attacked the Catholic
 church as an instrument of "destabilization." Opposition
 leaders have been intimidated by detentions and overly
 zealous government supporters. Consequently no opposi-
 tion political rallies were held in 1980. Several
 prominent opposition figures, not linked to the former
 regime, have been arrested for alleged coup attempts
 and held in preventive detention.
 The independence of labor unions has been jeopardized
 since the 1979 coup. A senior government official
 combines his official functions with those of trade
 union leader, leading to charges that he used his
 position to the benefit of New Jewel Movement (NJM) officials
 within the unions. The ability of some union leaders
 to act in an independent manner has been lessened
 by intensive propaganda attacks from NJM sources.
 The leader of one major union was forced to leave
 the country by the extremely hostile public attacks
 against him. Although unions retain the legal right
 to operate in the traditional areas of collective
 bargaining and grievance procedures as well as the
 right to strike, no strikes have been reported during
 the past year.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is no restriction on freedom to travel within
 the country, except for entry into zones restricted
 on national security grounds. Apart from the long-
 standing requirement to give evidence that national
 taxes are paid before departing the country, foreign
 travel and emigration also are freely permitted.
 Recent enactment of a new provision that all passports
 are the property of the Grenada government, subject
 to withdrawal or limitation at any time by the Minister
 of National Security, has not yet led to any limitation
 of travel or human rights violations.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 While acknowledging that the revolutionary government
 is "committed to elections," the Prime Minister has
 said that "elections are not the key question" and
 has not set a date for them. A registration of voters,
 promised within a few weeks of the coup, still has
 not taken place.
 
 
 439
 Men and women have equal legal and political rights.
 Women hold a number of positions at high government
 levels, although they remain under-represented in
 both the public and private sectors. The government
 has encouraged the participation of women's groups
 in political and development efforts. Several women
 hold prominent sub-cabinet level positions. There
 is no racial discrimination.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Soon after the March 1979 coup, a delegation from
 the Caribbean Conferenc of Churches visited the main
 prison in Grenada at the government's invitation.
 There was no report by the group of human rights abuses.
 There have been no subsequent visits by similar groups.
 The previous government ratified the American Convention
 on Human Rights. A group of distinguished Caribbean
 journalists recently petitioned the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission to investigate violations
 of human rights, including suppression of the press
 and seizure of private property. The government has
 neither approved nor denied a request for such an
 investigation.
