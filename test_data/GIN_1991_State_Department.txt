 GUINEA
 Under President Lansana Conte, Guinea has been governed by the
 Military Committee for National Recovery (CMRN) and a joint
 military and civilian cabinet since 1984. While in 1991
 authority remained with the President and his Cabinet, who
 continued to govern by decree, in February President Conte
 replaced the CMRN with the Transitional Committee for National
 Recovery <CTRN). The CTRN has been assigned lawmaking (i.e.,
 legislative) tasks, but the new Constitution only specifies
 that the CTRN replaces the CMRN until the Constitution becomes
 effective. In 1991 the CTRN concentrated largely on drafting
 the "organic" laws necessary to implement the Constitution,
 which,' passed by referendum in December 1990, provides for a
 maximum interim 5-year period of mixed military and civilian
 administration leading to at least a two party system of
 government. The Cabinet includes representation from all
 ethnic groups, but it appeared divided on the need and pace of
 political reform. Ethnic violence surfaced again in 1991,
 especially after local elections in June, resulting in hundreds
 of deaths.
 The pace of reform was very much controlled by President Conte
 and his team. National Assembly elections are to take place by
 the end of 1992, and the new Assembly will then set a date for
 presidential elections. Political parties were not permitted,
 and in May all meetings and demonstrations were banned,
 effectively neutralizing the nascent-opposition. By late in
 the .year, 30 parties and-political organizations had formed,
 but the Government mandated that they restrict their activities
 to meetings in private homes until promulgation of the
 political party-law.
 Military and paramilitary forces number.around 17,000 persons.
 Responsibility for internal security is shared by the
 gendarmerie, the national police,.and a well-armed Presidential
 Guard. Both the military and the police committed human rights
 abuses in 1991. Lawyers were still not allowed in police
 stations to help prevent such abuses.
 Over 80 percent of Guinea's 7-million people live by
 subsistence agriculture and per capita gross-domestic product
 is around $430. Guinea's major exports are bauxite, gold, and
 diamonds. In 1991 the World Bank and the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to oversee Guinea's major
 economic restructuring program, which involves, inter alia, a
 sharp reduction in the size of the public service., This
 austerity program was viewed by critics as a major cause of
 political turbulence in 1991.
 Human rights in Guinea remained tightly circumscribed in 1991,
 although public discussion of political reform and the-new
 Constitution stimulated expectations for change. Major
 problems included the'inability.of the Government to curb
 ethnic violence and serious abuses by poorly disciplined
 security farces, the use of arbitrary arrest and detention to
 harass alleged opponents, and restrictions on speech, the
 press, assembly, and association.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killings
 There were no reports of political killings. However, there
 were a number of extrajudicial killings in 1991, mainly
 associated with ethnic violence. In June, following local
 elections outside Conakry, there were ethnic riots in several
 prefectures, notably in N'Zerekore. There, several hundred
 people died in clashes between Malinkes and Guerzes touched off
 by intertribal taunting after the announcement of election
 results.
 In January gendarmes in Dalaba beat a suspected thief to death
 and then tried to disguise it as a suicide. A march was
 organized on the gendarmerie which resulted in the woundinq of
 two people and the burning of the gendarmerie post.
 Subsequently, the resident minister denounced the human rights
 abuses on Guinean radio as being inconsistent with the new
 Constitution. The gendarmes were not brought to trial. In
 April, in Kissidougou, a man was shot and killed by police
 after an argument.
 The authorities' treatment of Alpha Conde, an opposition
 leader, led to one death. He returned to Guinea from abroad in
 Kay, and the authorities immediately accused him of secretly
 bringing weapons into the country. The charges were believed
 to have been trumped up (see Section 1.d.). Police used
 excessive force to break up a planned rally organized by
 Conde's Rally of the Guinean People (RPG), injuring-several
 persons. A few weeks later, police killed a demonstrator
 protesting a police summons for Conde to report to police
 headquarters.
 In the first half of 1991, there were reports from the
 Guinea-Liberian border of soldiers detaining and killing
 supporters of the Liberian rebel leader, Charles Taylor.
 Taylor and his National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL)
 forces had reportedly killed a number of Guineans living in
 Liberia. Given fears of a Taylor insurgency in Guinea, Guinean
 security forces were more likely to detain refugees suspected
 of being Taylor supporters, including those bearing scorpion
 tattoos (the symbol of Charles Taylor's forces). Guinean
 security forces also took measures to protect refugees with
 scorpion tattoos from other Liberians when it was determined
 that they had been forcibly tattooed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1965 Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and
 cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. However, the Guinean
 police are often guilty of biutality against suspects, as the
 Dalaba incident indicated. Prison conditions, including those
 in the women's prison, are primitive and unhealthy. Deaths due
 to malnutrition and disease are frequent. An article in the
 February 10, 1991, issue of Horoya, the official newspaper,
 highlighted this point.

 GUINEA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ineffective administrative controls and limited legal resources
 make arbitrary arrest a persistent-threat to Guineans. There
 were cases .of. arbitrary arrest and detention in 1991. The most
 important involved actions taken following the May return of
 the opposition leader Alpha Conde. -In a June 20 police raid on
 Conde's home, the police apparently exceeded the terms of their
 warrant, seizing not only Conde's papers (as instructed) but
 stealing large quantities of personal items and cash as well.
 While Conde was not at home at the time of the'raid, police
 arrested 60 of his followers (including his brother), 12 of
 whom were subsequently brought to trial on charges of
 possession of illegal weapons and harboring delinquents. At'
 one poiint, Conde's lawyer was briefly held by the police.
 Conde himself took refuge in the residence of the Senegalese
 Ambassador and later was allowed to leave the country at the
 request of the Senegalese Government.
 Many members of the public viewed the case, as a frame-up by
 elements within the Government (the "arms" shown on television
 to a skeptical public turned out to be knives and chemical mace
 freely available in the 'local markets). The case also received
 international attention and criticism. Ultimately, Conde's
 brother received a nominal fine for possession of illegal
 munitions, and charges against the other defendants were
 dismissed. The judge ordered.the police to return Conde's'
 property. No disciplinary action was. taken against the police.
 In December 1990, lawyer and civil rights activist Christian
 Sow was summoned and escorted first to the police station,, and
 then, at gun point, to the Police Academy, 50 kilometers out of
 the city. During the night, he received a head injury under
 circumstances never clarified, although the police claimed it
 was self-inflicted. When his colleagues first inquired about
 him at the police station, the police said that they had not
 segn him. However, the next morning, the police chief released
 him without explanation. One credible report indicated the
 incident was the product of a dispute within the CMRN, the
 military leadership directly preceding the CTRN, over the
 powers of the police. Again, no action was taken to discipline
 the responsible police officials.
 Roger Millimono, an official in the Ministry of Tourism,
 Information,.and Culture, was summarily held for 2 months in
 prison without specific charge or trial, with the Government
 explaining only that it was an "affair of state." Guinean
 lawyers complained about improper procedures until Millimono
 was released. Mr. Millimono subsequently resumed his duties at
 the Ministry.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guinean law provides guarantees of due process. The Guinean
 Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused
 persons, the independence of judges, the equality of citizens
 before the law, the right of the accused to counsel, and the
 right to appeal a judicial decision.
 At present, the judiciary is susceptible to influence by the
 executive,, although the new Constitution affirms the
 judiciary's independence. In trials drawing international
 attention, such as the cases involving Conde's supporters, the
 legal procedures are more likely to be observed.
 
 
 162
 GUINEA
 The judiciary includes the courts of first instance (or justice
 of the peace at the local level) and two courts of appeal (one
 in Kankan, one in Conakry). The Court of Annulment is the
 Guinean last court of appeal. Guinean law provides for a court
 of state security under certain circumstances, but one has not
 met since the trial of those allegedly involved in the coup
 attempt of 1985. A military tribunal prepares and adjudicates
 charges against accused military personnel. However, since
 1988 all judgments regarding violations under the Penal Code
 have been rendered by civilian courts. There is a traditional
 system of justice at the village or urban neighborhood level
 where litigants present their civil cases before a village
 chief, neighborhood chief, or council of wise men for
 judgment. Trials are public. Those accused of major crimes
 have the right to an attorney at public expense if they cannot
 afford counsel.
 The dividing line between the formal and informal justice
 system is vague, and a case may be referred from the formal to
 the traditional system to ensure compliance by all parties with
 the judicial ruling. Conversely, if a case cannot be resolved
 to the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system,
 it may be referred to the formal system for adjudication.
 In late 1990 and early 1991, officials in the Ministry of
 Finance and the Economy were prosecuted for corruption. In a
 trial at the Court of Assizes in Conakry, they were found
 guilty and given light sentences.
 Suspected criminals caught in urban areas are sometimes beaten
 to death by victims and their neighbors with the tacit approval
 of police authorities. While public officials have openly
 condemned such summary justice, no one has ever been tried or
 punished for it.
 The administration of justice is plagued by numerous problems:
 the shortage of magistrates (who are generally poorly trained)
 and lawyers (35 in all), an outdated and overrestrictive legal
 code, and corruption. There are also allegations of nepotism
 in the administration of justice, with relatives of influential
 members of the Government being virtually immune to the law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government stresses traditional family values and the
 inviolability of the home. However, the possibility of
 interference in citizens' lives continues primarily through
 police harassment. It is widely believed that security
 officials monitor mail and telephone calls. Judicial search
 warrants are required by law, but these procedures are
 frequently ignored or, as in the Conde affair (see Section
 l.d.), not strictly followed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Government publicly states that it supports free
 speech and a free press, and the new Constitution provides for
 an unspecified degree of freedom of expression, these freedoms
 are restricted in practice. A new press law, while proclaiming
 freedom of press and communications, prohibits communications
 which offend the Guinean President- incite to violence,
 discrimination or hatred, or disturb the public peace.
 
 
 163
 GUINEA
 Seditious cries or chants uttered in public are also
 prohibited. The law permits the preventive arrest of
 publishers, authors, printers, and vendors in all of the above
 cases.
 The Government owns and operates most of the news media.
 Reporters, who are government employees, practice
 self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. The Ministry
 of Information, Culture, and Tourism continues to act as
 overseer of the media, but censorship appears to have
 diminished in 1991. A somewhat bolder spirit of criticism in
 the Government-owned media surfaced, providing franker and more
 open coverage of events. For example, there was open
 discusqion in the media of the bloody ethnic rioting in
 N'Zerekore in June.
 Beginning in June, several independent journals sprang up, some
 of which were very outspoken in their criticism of the
 Government. However, these tended to be published irregularly
 and were generally short-lived, due to technical and financial
 difficulties rather than government restriction.
 Several political tracts, both signed and unsigned, that
 included specific criticisms of the President and other
 officials were distributed widely in Conakry and other
 regions. In February, two Guineans issuing leaflets hostile to
 Conte's regime were arrested; the text of the leaflets had a
 racist edge. However, foreign publications, some of which
 include criticism of the Government, circulated freely in
 Guinea. There was no attempt to interfere with foreign radio
 broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public gatherings may take place only with the approval of the
 Government. The Penal Code bans any meeting that has an ethnic
 or racial character or any gathering "whose nature threatens
 national unity." Political parties are still not officially
 sanctioned, although more than 30 embryonic groups had begun to
 organize by year's end. The President stated at midyear that
 party organization (but not party-stimulated public unrest) was
 permissible and counseled politicians to be patient until the
 laws permitting open political activity entered into.force.
 Open party competition was scheduled to begin on April 3, 1992,
 after the Government promulgates its law on parties.
 When Alpha Conde attempted to hold a rally on May 19, security
 forces intervened with tear gas, injuring three people. The
 Government justified the action on the grounds that Conde did
 not have a permit (see Section l.a.). In October and November,
 three demonstrations by students and former civil servants
 protesting unemployment took place without incident.
 The Government encourages the formation of nonpolitical
 professional organizations, whose numbers continue to increase.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Large religious groups enjoy religious freedom and tolerance.
 An estimated 85 percent of the population is Muslim. There is
 no official state religion, and the preamble of the new
 Constitution declares Guinea to be a secular state. The
 Government observes major Christian and Muslim ,holidays.
 Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, operate
 freely in Guinea. The state-owned radio and television
 
 
 164
 GUINEA
 stations provide regular air time for both Christian and Muslim
 broadcasts. In the only known case of violence possibly
 related to religion, churches and mosques were damaged during
 the June rioting in N'Zerekore (see Section l.a.).
 The Government and the quasi-governmental National Islamic
 League (LIN) have spoken out against the proliferation of
 "pseudo-sects (within Guinean Islam) generating confusion and
 deviation" but have not restricted these groups. The new
 Constitution guarantees religious communities the freedom to
 administer themselves without state interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Guineans are free to travel within the country and to change
 their place of residence and work, although in practice they
 face harassment by police and military roadblocks, particularly
 at night. It is common for citizens to pay bribes to avoid
 police harassment. Foreign travel is permitted, although the
 Government retains the ability to limit it for political
 reasons.
 About 450,000 Liberians and Sierra Leoneans have sought refuge
 in Guinea, mostly in the forest region. The Government
 continues to work closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and many other international
 and nongovernmental organizations to provide food and shelter
 for the refugees. Some were accused of involvement in the
 N'Zerekore violence leading to fears of expulsion. No action
 was taken against them, and the UNHCR participated in an
 investigation that showed the refugees were no more involved
 than their numbers and degree of integration into society would
 have predicted. With the aid of the donors, the majority of
 refugees have been well treated by the Government. However,
 there were unconfirmed reports in early 1991 of soldiers
 killing refugees suspected of being Charles Taylor supporters.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinean citizens were not able to change their government
 through democratic procedures in 1991. The President and his
 Cabinet wielded full powers of government. The Constitution
 (basic law) provides for a transition to democracy not to
 exceed 5 years. On October 2, President Conte announced that
 the CTRN would have finalized versions of all of the "organic
 laws" by December 23; that full party activity would be
 authorized when the law on political parties came into effect
 on April 3, 1992; that legislative elections would be held by
 the end of 1992; and that the legislature would fix the date of
 presidential elections at its first session.
 The role of the military in the Government continues to be a
 key issue in political reform. Retiring or sending officers
 back to the barracks remains a delicate process. A number of
 senior officers were retired in 1991 without incident. The
 future political role of the President and certain military
 members of the Council of Ministers remains uncertain. The
 Alpha Conde affair, as well as that of Christian Sow (Section
 l.d.), demonstrated the existence of elements within the
 Cabinet, particularly within the security forces, hostile to
 democratic principles.
 
 
 GUINEA
 The Constitution provides for basic human rights and for
 democratic structures, including an elected president with
 broad powers, an elected national assembly, an economic and
 social council, and a supreme court. The Constitution and
 relevant organic laws also provide for a multiparty system, as
 long as parties are not ethnic or regional. The political
 parties law allows the Interior Minister to suspend or disband
 political parties, subject to judicial review, when they are
 involved in such crimes as inciting violence.
 Local elections were held in 1991. Councils were freely
 elected-with multiple candidates and secret ballots-in the
 five communes of Conakry on March 10, and Conakry district
 elections were held on June 3. Communal elections outside
 Conakry were held on June 9. There were no legal restrictions
 on women or minorities in voting. However, in several
 prefectures, the elections involved ethnic rioting, most
 notably in N'Zerekore where hundreds died (see Section l.a.).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are two local nongovernmental organizations in Guinea
 that are primarily interested in human rights issues: the
 Guinean Organization for Human Rights (OGDH) and the Children
 of the Victims of-Camp Boiro. The OGDH is composed largely of
 members of the professions and is interested in legal and civil
 rights as well as such social and economic rights as education
 and employment. In one instance in 1991, it called for a
 general strike in. response to the arrest-of Alpha Conde's
 attorney. As with OGDH's other activities, the Government did
 not interfere. The-Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro
 (Sekou Toure's main detention center for political prisoners)-
 became an officially recognized civic organization in 1991. In
 addition to seeking restitution of losses for the families of
 those who died at Camp'Boiro,'this organization began planning
 a center to collect and disseminate, information about human
 rights violations committed-in Guinea, with a view to
 preventing future violations. Partly as-a result of this
 organization's �efforts, the Government announcedplans to
 create a museum at Camp Boiro. There was no evidence of
 government restrictions on human rightd activities by OGDH or
 by other nongovernmental organizations. There were no calls
 for international investigations of human rights violations in
 Guinea in 1991.   -
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the
 Constitution and the Penal Code, ethnic identification is
 strong in Guinea and mutual suspicion affects relations across
 ethnic lines, in and out of government. Official government
 policy is to include representatives of all majorethnic groups
 in the Government, but the Soussou ethnic group of President
 Conte tends to predominate at the most important levels. A
 disproportionate number of police are Malinke, former President
 Toure's ethnic group.
 Women face discrimination in Guinea, although the Constitution
 provides for the equality of sexes.' In particular, "in rural
 Guinea opportunities for women are limited by custom and the
 demands of subsistence farming. The Government has affirmed
 the principle of equal pay for equal work, but in practice
 
 
 166
 GUINEA
 women receive less pay than men in most jobs. In education,
 according to a U.N. Development Program report for 1991,
 females receive only 20 percent of the schooling of males.
 Violence against women, mainly wife beating, is a criminal
 offense and constitutes grounds for divorce under civil law.
 However, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes, and
 prosecution of husbands for wife beating is infrequent. Health
 workers in Guinea say that wife beating occurs, but differ as
 to the extent of the problem. The issue received some exposure
 in locally produced television dramas but is not mentioned in
 the press or given governmental attention. Female genital
 mutilation (circumcision) is widespread and practiced among all
 religious groups in Guinea: Muslims, Christians, and animists,
 although the current generation of young parents is less
 supportive of this custom. Grandmothers frequently insist on
 the circumcision of a granddaughter even when the parents are
 opposed. The most dangerous form of circumcision,
 infibulation, is not practiced.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Guinea's Labor Code, drafted with the assistance of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and promulgated in
 January 1988, states that all workers (except military and
 police) have the right to create and participate in
 organizations that defend and develop their individual and
 collective rights as workers. At least one independent union,
 the General Workers Union of Guinea (UGTGY, has emerged since
 the new Labor Code ended the previously existing trade union
 monopoly system.. The Labor Code requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 salaried
 workers. In practice, most workers still belong to the
 National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) which is
 funded by the State. The union leadership began work in 1991
 to develop a check-off system of dues collection, designed to
 increase the Confederation's autonomy vis-a-vis the
 Government. The CNTG played a prominent role in negotiations
 with the Government in May which eventually led to a decision
 to double government worker salaries. After reelecting its
 leadership in early July, the CNTG rewrote its internal
 constitution in light of the new national Constitution.
 With the exception of those engaged in "essential services,"
 the Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector
 civilian workers, the right to strike 10 days after their
 representative union makes known their intention to strike.
 Mid-1991 saw a series of strikes and threatened strikes of
 which the most important was a general strike, including
 government workers, in early May. The strike was marred by
 pro- and antigovernment violence. A strike at the Friguia
 alumina plant was motivated at least in part by a desire to
 embarrass the national mineworkers union and may presage a
 period of local unions redefining their relationships with the
 national unions. Notably, the police presence during the
 strike was kept out of sight and violence was averted.
 Unions may freely associate with international labor groups,
 but the only notable affiliations are those the CNTG maintains
 in African regional trade union organizations.
 
 
 167
 GUINE
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the Labor Code, representative workers' unions or union
 groups may organize the workplace -and negotiate with employers
 or employer organizations. Collective bargaining for wages and
 salaries is protected by law. Work rules and work hours
 established by the employer are to be developed in consultation
 with union delegates. Union delegates are to represent
 individual and collective claims and grievances before the
 employer. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or
 other sanctions have the right to a hearing before the employer
 with a union representative present. Antiunion discrimination
 is prohibited by law. In July the CNTG added to all labor �
 contracts language prohibiting such discrimination. There are
 no exp6rt processing zones in Guinea.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Code specifically forbids forced or compulsory
 labor. There is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment in the new Code is 16 years of
 age. However, apprentices may start at 14. Workers and
 apprentices below 18 are not permitted to work at night; nor
 for more than 12 consecutive hours, nor on Sundays. The Labor
 Code states that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs must
 maintain a list of occupations in which women and youth under
 18 may not be employed. Enforcement, however, by inspectors
 from this Ministry is limited to large firms in the modern
 sector of the economy; children of all ages work on family
 farms and in small trades.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government has not yet enacted minimum wage legislation,
 but the Labor Code provides for the eventual establishment by
 decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also
 provisions for overtime and night wages which are fixed
 percentages of the regular wage.
 According to the Labor Code, regular work is not to exceed
 10-hour days or 48-hour weeks, with a 40-hour workweek being
 the norm. The minimum weekly day of rest must be 24
 consecutive hours, usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker
 has the right to an annual paid holiday accumulated at the rate
 of at least 2.5 workdays per month of service.
 Several articles of the Code provide for safe working
 conditions and the continued good health of workers, and labor
 inspectors are empowered to suspend work immediately in
 dangerous situations. These were as yet goals rather than
 practice and were not enforced in 1991. The Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs is supposed to enforce labor standards.-
 Labor inspectors acknowledge that they cannot even cover
 Conakry, much less the entire country, with their small staffs
 and meager budgets.
