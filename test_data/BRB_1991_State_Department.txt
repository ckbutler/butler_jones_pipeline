 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a
 constitutional democracy with a multiparty, parliamentary form
 of government based on the Westminster model. Its House of
 Assembly is the third oldest elected body in the Western
 Hemisphere. Barbadians recognize the Queen of England as Head
 of State; she is represented locally by an appointed Governor
 General. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government and
 governs with an appointed Cabinet. National elections, which
 were held in January 1991, were contested by two major
 political parties, one offshoot of the government party, and
 several independent candidates. Prime Minister Sandiford of
 the Democratic Labor Party was elected by an eight-member
 majority to a maximum 5-year term.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining
 public order; it respects constitutional and legal guarantees
 of human rights. The traditionally high public respect for the
 Force dropped in 1991 due to a growing crime wave and the
 emergence of youth gangs. Police morale suffered
 correspondingly as police were called upon to work long shifts.
 for no additional pay. The small volunteer Barbados Defense
 Force is responsible for national security but is used to
 maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other
 specific need.
 The country's economy, based on agriculture, tourism, light
 manufacturing, and services, is highly susceptibleto external
 economic developments. After years of positive growth, the
 economy in 1990 took a serious downturn which reached crisis
 proportions in 1991, leading to negotiatibns with the
 International Monetery Fund (IMF). In an attempt to stave off
 a devaluation, the Prime Minister instigated layoffs of public
 sector employees, an 8-percent-wage cut, stabilization and
 consumption tax increases, an employment levy,, and other.taxes.-
 to increase revenue and ease serious balance of payments
 difficulties. The full impact of these measures was expected
 to be felt in late 1991.
 Barbados has a long record of generally respecting human
 rights, and there was no significant change in that record
 during 199.1.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and other ExtrajuTicial KilLing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. A 1990 case of
 a male prisoner who died in police custody as a result of
 severe mistreatment by police officers became known during
 1991. A commission of inquiry completed its study of the
 
 
 BARBADOS
 incident, but its findings had not been made public by year's
 end. In addition, it is reported that a very high percentage
 of convictions are based on confessions in Barbados. There
 have been credible reports of thb abusive treatment of
 detainees by some law enforcement officers in order to elicit
 confessions.
 A decision by a.judge in late 1990 to reintroduce floggingby
 cat-o'-nine-tails as punishment for heinous crimes caused
 considerable public debate. Some groups described it as a
 retrograde step, constituting cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 punishment. Because the flogging law is still on the books,
 judges have the power to use it in their sentencing decisions.
 During 1991 one judge invoked it in 7 different cases, but none
 of the sentences had been carried out by year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are respected in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and
 attorneys have ready access to their clients. Indigent
 defendants are provided court-appointed counsel for indictable
 offenses which are defined as serious crimes that are tried
 before a judge and jury as opposed to a magistrate. Exile is
 not used as a punishment or means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government provides
 free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property may be entered and
 searched. There are credible reports that, in response to
 increased drug-related crime, the police have resorted to
 arbitrary searches of homes in certain neighborhoods in
 Barbados. The Government neither censors mail nor restricts
 the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio
 stations, two of which are owned by the Government. Caribbean
 Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television service (the only
 television source, excluding di'rect satellite reception) is
 government owned. Though CBC is a state enterprise, views
 opposing government policies are regularly reported.
 Opposition political figures occasionally claim their positions
 are given little attention, and during economic debates in 1991
 
 
 497
 BARBADOS
 appearances by opposition leaders were televised only on rare
 occasions. There are two independent daily newspapers, both of
 which present opposition political views. The Government
 regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on'daily
 call-in radio programs.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The Government observes the constitutional"guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association: Permits required
 for public demonstrations continue to be routinely granted.
 Political parties, trade associations, and private
 organizations function and hold meetings and rallies without
 government hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of'religion. The Anglican and Methodist
 faiths have traditionally predominated, but there are numerous
 other active religious denominations and organizations
 throughout the country, including Rastafarians. Foreign
 missionaries of various faiths proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados, and
 leave and enter the country without restriction.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens'have this right in law and exercise it in practice.
 Political parties freely compete in fair elections by secret
 ballot at least every'5 years. There are no impediments to
 participation in the political process, and all Barbadians over
 age 18 may vote. The present Democratic Labor Party (DLP)
 Government, in power since 1986, won. the January 1991 election
 with a reduced majority of 18 out of the 28 seats. The main
 opposition party, the Barbados Labor Party (BLP), won 10
 seats. A Cabinet of Ministers appointed by the Prime Minister
 exercises executive power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local- groups involved with human rights matters operate freely,
 without government hindrance. There were no official reports
 of human rights violations in Barbados during 1991, and neither
 international nor local human rights groups have requested any
 human rights investigations. A Caribbean-widb human rights
 organization called Caribbean Rights has its headquarters and a
 small staff in Barbados, and investigates and reports on
 allegations of human rights violations throughout the region
 when warranted.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law
 regardless of race, religion, sex, or national origin. These
 
 
 498
 BARBADOS
 provisions are respected in practice. Women actively
 participate in all aspects of national life and are well
 represented in-all except the uppermost levels of both the
 public and private sectors. Women form a large percentage of
 heads of household in Barbados and are not discriminated
 against in public housing or other social welfare programs.
 Although neither the Government nor women's rights groups have
 singled out violence against women as a particular or acute
 social problem, a domestic violence bill was put forward by the
 Government shortly after its election in January 1991. The
 bill, which specifies the appropriate police response to
 domestic violence, aims to protect all members of the family,
 including men and children, and applies to common-law
 relationships as well as marriage. Hotly debated in March
 1991, the bill was referred to a select committee of both
 houses of Parliament for review. The bill had not been
 reported out of committee by year's end. Criminal penalties
 for violent crimes are the same, regardless of sex of offender
 or victim. In cases of domestic violence, courts typically
 issue restraining orders if requested by the victim, the breach
 of which is punishable by a jail sentence. In 1991 local
 courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against
 women involving assault or wounding, although women's rights
 groups point out that there is still some reluctance on the
 part of victims to report such incidents.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Barbados have the right to form and belong to trade
 unions and to strike, and freely exercise these rights. There
 are two major unions in Barbados and several smaller ones,
 representing various sectors of labor. The largest union, the
 Barbados Workers' Union (BWU), is historically closely
 associated with the governing DLP (BWU officers hold elected
 parliamentary seats, a Senate seat and the appointed post of
 President of the Senate), but the BWU is not controlled by the
 party or the Government. In September 1991, the three
 non-cabinet unionists in Parliament made an unprecedented move
 when one voted against, and then later the other two abstained
 in the vote on the minibudget measure which included a wage cut
 for public servants. One more vote against the measure might
 have brought the Government down.
 Trade unionists' personal and property rights are given full
 protection under law. Strikes are prohibited only in the water
 and electric utilities and in the security forces; all other
 private and public sector employees are permitted to strike.
 There was perhaps more worker unrest in 1991 than in any other
 postindependence year. On October 24, a large march and
 widespread work absences occurred in protest of the
 Government's austerity measures and public sector wage cuts and
 layoffs.- In November there was a 2-day general strike, with
 most public and private offices closed and transport, school,
 port authority, hotel, and telecommunications services
 affected. The strike was called by the newly formed coalition
 of trade unions to show displeasure with the Government's
 management of the economy, its austerity measures, and the
 projected program with the IMF. During the economic crisis, an
 informal coalition of trade unions and associations was formed
 to bargain collectively with the Government on issues affecting
 them all. Barbadian trade unions are free to form federations
 
 
 499
 BARBADOS
 and are in fact affiliated with a variety of regional and
 international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The rights to organize and to bargain collectively are provided
 by law and respected in practice. Over 25 percent of the
 working population is Qrganized, and wages and working
 conditions are negotiated through the collective bargaining
 process. Employers have no legal obligation to recognize
 unions under the Trade Union Act of 1964, but most do when a
 majority of their employees signify a desire to be-represented
 by a registered union. While there is no specific law
 prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the regular courts
 provide a method of redress for employees alleging unfair
 dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but'
 rarely order reemployment. There are no manufacturing or
 special areas where collective bargaining rights are legally or
 administratively impaired. Barbados has no specially
 designated export processing zones. The Government is studying
 findings by the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in
 November 199G that the Government's refusal to implement a
 collective bargaining agreement reached by a state-subsidized
 agency was not in full conformity with the principles of
 freedom of association.
 c.' Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age of 16 is generally'observed.
 Minimum age limitations are reinforced by compulsory primary
 and secondary education policies. The Labor Department has a
 small cadre of labor inspectors who conduct spot'investigations
 of enterprises, check records to verify compliance with the
 law, and can take legal action against an employer who is found
 to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages for specified categories of workers are
 administratively established and enforced by law. The minimum
 wage for shop assistants (entry level commercial workers) is
 marginally sufficient to meet minimum living standards; most
 employees earn more.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law
 requires overtime payment for hours worked in excess of that
 number. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual
 leave. All workers are covered by unemployment benefits
 legislation and by national insurance (social security). A
 comprehensive government-sponsored health program offers
 subsidized treatment and medication.
 Under the Factories Act, there is effective enforcement for
 safety and health violations and followup to ensure that
 problems cited are corrected by management.
