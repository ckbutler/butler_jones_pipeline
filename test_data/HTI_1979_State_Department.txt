 HAITI
 Haiti has a long history of authoritarian rule with many
 periods of political instability and the most serious
 types of human rights abuses. The country is the poorest
 in the Western Hemisphere. It faces severe economic
 and social problems, including overpopulation, inadequate
 arable land subdivided into small plots, serious erosion,
 a lack of mineral wealth, high illiteracy (80 percent),
 an impoverished rural majority, a tradition of corruption,
 and a schism between the urban and rural sectors.
 Violations of human rights were particularly widespread
 during the regime of Francois Duvalier, President from
 1957 to 1971. There has been some improvement in respect
 for the rights of the individual during the administration
 of his son, "President for Life" Jean-Claude Duvalier,
 but the system of authoritarian government continues.
 Power is concentrated in the executive, and the legislative
 elections held in February 1979 were closely controlled.
 For the first time in recent history, independent political
 parties appeared in Haiti in 1979. This positive develop-
 ment was marred, however, by the arrest of one opposition
 party leader, who in December, 1979 was still in jail
 without formal charges. The Haitian Government took
 or encouraged other actions in 1979 tending to intimidate
 the media and the political opposition. The influence
 of the relatively undisciplined militia increased, and
 the Government enacted a restrictive new press law.
 The Government during 1979 took steps designed to foster
 economic development, including some fiscal and adminis-
 trative reforms. There were no institutional changes
 favoring political liberalization, however, and if anything
 the ability of Haitian citizens to express dissenting
 political views declined in 1979.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Reports of torture in Haitian prisons were frequent in
 past years, particularly during the 1960's, and usually
 referred to severe beatings administered to bound pris-
 oners. There were a few allegations of torture in 1979,
 including some plausible reports of severe beatings and
 torture by electric shock administered to opposition
 political activists. There are no indications of Govern-
 mental investigation or disciplining of those responsible.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings have traditionally been used in Haiti to punish
 people for minor criminal infractions, to extract confes-
 sions, and to impose discipline in prison. There is
 reason to believe that harsh treatment by the police
 of detained suspects remains a common substitute for
 legal prosecution. New police recruits receive little
 or no formal police training. To improve this situation,
 the Government in 1979 embarked on a program to upgrade
 police training and procedures and to supply legal guidance
 to the police. It is too early to assess the effectiveness
 of this program.
 Physical facilities, medical care and diet at major prisons
 reportedly improved in 1979, but they are still seriously
 deficient. Lesser offenders may be visited by family
 members, who may also bring them food, but persons consid-
 ered dangerous by the Government are held in isolation
 in many cases.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment were practiced exten-
 sively during the 1960's. This practice was progressively
 curbed during the 1970's, and by the end of 1977 all
 remaining political prisoners known to be incarcerated
 at that time were released. Over 100 others remained
 unaccounted for and are assumed to have died in prison,
 although Amnesty International has received isolated
 and unconfirmed reports that some are still alive in
 secret detention centers. There was no evidence of sig-
 nificant violations of this category of rights in 1978.
 In 19.79, a few persons were expelled from Haiti for alleged
 anti-government activities and others were arrested,
 including two members of the Haitian League for Human
 Rights and several media figures. Most of these were
 released either the same day or after a short detention.
 Still in jail as of late December is independent political
 activist Sylvio Claude, who was arrested on August 30
 after he and his supporters reportedly resisted by force
 an attempt to bring Claude in for questioning regarding
 suspected illegal activities. No formal charges have
 been filed.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Haiti's judicial system is widely agreed to be in a period
 of "convalescence" from its "severe illness" during the
 1960's. Sessions of the criminal court open to the public
 resumed in 1975 and have since been held regularly, but
 the case backlog is large and the system's resources
 insufficient to cope with all cases. For this reason,
 many cases never make their way through the entire legal
 process, and detainees are released after a period without
 having been brought to trial. The number of cases which
 are never tried is thought to be large.
 
 
 343
 In certain cases of alleged crimes with political over-
 tones, the Government has apparently chosen to detain
 individuals indefinitely, avoiding public trial. At
 least four people arrested near St. Marc in February
 1979 for involvement in an alleged plot against the Gov-
 ernment remain in detention and have not been charged
 or tried. Reports of other such political prisoners
 have been received, but have not been confirmed.
 For the most serious offenses, tried before the criminal
 court, public hearings are mandatory and defendants are
 entitled to counsel. In felony cases, legal counsel
 must be provided by the State if the defendant cannot
 afford a lawyer. This is not true for lesser offenses,
 and poor defendants are often without qualified counsel
 in trials before lower courts. To help alleviate this
 problem, an agreement for a U.S.-financed legal assistance
 program was signed in 1979 following an initiative of
 the Port-au-Prince Bar Association.
 The Haitian Constitution stipulates that arrests, except
 those made immediately after the occurrence of a crime,
 must be made with a proper warrant and the accused brought
 before a judge within 48 hours. Rarely observed in the
 past, the Government in 1979 publicly emphasized the
 importance of these provisions, but they still are imple-
 mented only sporadically.
 Until recently, members of the security forces, including
 the militia, were almost immune from prosecution. In
 1978, however, two militiamen who had beaten an outspoken
 publisher, and an army lieutenant who had killed a civil-
 ian, were tried and convicted. The sentences were rela-
 tively light. In 1979, a prominent militiaman who fatally
 shot a civilian was convicted of murder and sentenced
 to life imprisonment. Other militiamen who were involved
 in a boisterous shooting rampage apparently were not
 disciplined, however.
 The State Security Tribunal, established in 1977 with
 the stated purpose of ensuring trials for all security
 offenders, has not convened.
 The press law enacted in 1979 contains several prohibitions
 against reports or comments by the media on trials in
 progress as well as a penalty for "defaming" judges.
 The impact of this legislation on media coverage of the
 judicial process cannot yet be assessed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Violation of privacy was a common practice during the
 1960's. Information on such violations, particularly
 in rural areas, is limited, but the practice is not be-
 lieved to be widespread.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education:
 
 
 344
 Haiti has an open economy, although the Government occa-
 sionally exercises its authority to control resource
 allocation, prices, and investment. Serious obstacles
 lie in the way of economic development: overpopulation,
 corruption, decreasing arable land, a lack of natural
 resources, and limited skilled manpower. The already
 stark difference between the living standards of the
 rural peasantry and the urban elite has widened in recent
 years as the rural economy stagnated or declined and
 resources in the capital city increased. Even in urban
 areas, the disparity baween the relatively few who are
 wealthy and the poor majority is dramatic. There is
 evidence of a nascent middle class in the larger cities.
 The Government's goals for economic development are set
 out in multi-year development plans, largely financed
 by foreign grants and loans which have increased rapidly
 since 1974. The primary focus has been on agriculture,
 with the emphasis on increased production by and income
 for small farmers. Health projects have emphasized child
 nutrition, family planning and development of a compre-
 hensive rural system of preventive medicine and basic
 health care. Government efforts in the health care field
 are limited by budgetary constraints but are supplemented
 by private charitable and missionary facilities. To
 strengthen infrastructure, the Government has built rural
 highways and secondary roads, expanded the electric power
 network, and extended the telephone system. Rural schools
 are being built and the curriculum revised. Creole,
 the majority language, was officially introduced in 1979
 as the language of instruction at the elementary level.
 There is a limited public education system in Haiti.
 Implementation of programs and policies has been difficult,
 and serious health and nutrition problems persist. There
 is no tradition of government service to citizens. Basic
 changes of attitude seem required for meaningful progress
 toward economic development. Corruption is traditional
 at all levels of society, and significant amounts of
 domestic revenues usable for development continue to
 be diverted to personal enrichment.
 The Government has continued its efforts to implement
 modern fiscal and budgetary systems. It presented in
 1979 an annual budget which, for the first time, consol-
 idated almost all government revenues. Although the
 new system needs to be extended further, it should provide
 more effective control over resources allocated for de-
 velopment. The International Monetary Fund is working
 with the Government on related fiscal reforms to prevent
 continued diversion of domestic revenues away from devel-
 opment.
 The Anti-Slavery Society alleged in 1979 that Haitian
 migrant workers (cane-cutters) in the Dominican Republic
 regularly work in near-slavery conditions under contracts
 negotiated with the Haitian government. Both governments
 strongly denied the charges. The intergovernmental agree-
 ment negotiated in 1979 provides for closer monitoring
 of working conditions in the cane fields.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression had been increasing in Haiti in
 recent years but government action in 1979 restricted
 this trend. In May, the Government issued a decree re-
 quiring prior approval of plays and films, a step which
 provoked strong protest from the Haitian cultural commu-
 nity. Since the protest, the decree has not been vigor-
 ously enforced. In October, the Government enacted a
 broad and restrictive new press law, which provides for
 an elaborate mechanism to monitor and control the press
 and creates broad, vague categories of offenses that
 leave wide scope for judicial interpretation. The leg-
 islation provides for prior review of publications by
 the Government, and it legalizes censorship, which had
 long been self-imposed. In addition, it makes all jour-
 nalists dependent on an annual press card, to be issued
 by a National Association of Journalists, apparently
 a government controlled body. The mechanisms called
 for by the law have not been established and there have
 been no prosecutions, but the law has had a chilling
 effect on the media. The Inter-American Press Association
 adopted a resolution in October declaring that the new
 law makes freedom of the press impossible in Haiti.
 In apparent response to strong internal and external
 criticism, the Government in December, 1979 appointed
 an independent eleven-member commission, including strong
 critics of the legislation, to re-examine the press law
 and suggest changes.
 Roman Catholicism is the established religion, but practi-
 tioners of most faiths can be found in Haiti, including
 the major Protestant denominations. Voodoo, the folk
 religion, is practiced widely. A decree issued by the
 Government in November 1978, giving the Department of
 Foreign Affairs and Worship authority to exercise control
 over the many hundreds of evangelical missionary groups
 that have proliferated in Haiti, does not appear to have
 been designed to restrict freedom of religion, and has
 not had that effect.
 Freedom of association is restricted. Organizations
 not officially recognized by the Government are limited
 to a membership of 20. Some groups have exceeded this
 limitation. "In-practi-ce, freedom of assembly is denied
 to any group whose activities can be considered anti-
 government. In November 1979, a speech by the President
 of the Human Rights League was violently disrupted by
 thugs who, according to reports, were government agents.
 A number of people were injured.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Haiti is not restricted except
 near border areas. Haitians must have exit and re-entry
 visas for foreign travel. In practice, only a small
 number of persons are denied these visas. Passport fees
 
 
 346
 are not a deterrent to foreign travel, although some
 Haitians are victimized by middlemen who charge high
 prices for services in obtaining passports and visas.
 Many Haitians depart illegally for other countries, includ-
 ing the United States. Evidence indicates that most
 of these emigrate because of Haiti's extreme poverty
 and high unemployment. Haitians have traditionally been
 the migrant workers of the Caribbean basin. _Sme who
 enter the U.S. have applied for political asylum, asserting
 that they would suffer political persecution if repatri-
 ated, and a small percentage of asylum applications have
 been approved. Others claim that they would be prosecuted
 for having left Haiti illegally. Only organizers, however,
 are regularly punished in connection with the illegal
 departures, usually by a few months' imprisonment following
 repatriation to Haiti. Such persons are not punished
 under the illegal departure statutes but for victimizing
 the persons whose departure they have facilitated.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is severely re-
 stricted. Haiti is an authoritarian state and the presi-
 dent is chosen for life. Elections to the unicameral
 legislature, held in February, were closely controlled
 by the government, and only one non-Duvalierist candidate
 was elected. The legislature plays no independent role
 in formulating national policy.
 Fledgling independent political parties appeared in 1979
 for the first time in 22 years, but the leadership of
 one was arrested in late August and activities of the
 others are closely monitored.
 In general, women enjoy equal wages and have access to
 most jobs including government appointments, although
 there are few women in high government posts.
 Organized labor accounts for less than one percent of
 the work force and the few unions have been permitted
 little freedom of action. The Labor Code gives consid-
 erable authority to the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs in mediating disputes. Union-sanctioned strikes,
 but not wildcat strikes, are permitted. Since late 1977,
 there have been sporadic strikes and increased labor
 organizing activity.                       --
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Haitian Government invited the Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission for an inspection visit in August 1978
 and cooperated with the commission during the visit.
 The Commission's report has not yet been released.
