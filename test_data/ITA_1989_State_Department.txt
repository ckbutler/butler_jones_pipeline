 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic multiparty republic with a parliamentary
 system of government. Parliament is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive
 authority is concentrated in the Council of Ministers, which
 is currently led by Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti from the
 Christian Democratic Party. The judiciary is independent of
 the executive. The Chief of State, the President, is elected
 by Parliament and representatives of Italy's 20 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has remained at
 low levels in recent years, due to the effective work of
 police and magistrates and its overwhelming rejection by the
 people as a whole. Although terrorism has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed
 increased law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which remains a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top 10 in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, comprising
 especially small and medium-sized companies.
 In 1989 Italian citizens began to face directly the need to
 confront the problem of racism. The issues of violence
 against women and child abuse also were raised. The human
 rights situation in general was good, and the trend toward
 more openness in dealing with sensitive human relations
 problems may require new legislation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage in'these kinds of killing, and there were none in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically motivated disappearance or
 kidnaping.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law,
 and cases of violations have been rare. There were no
 allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners during 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures are carefully controlled by law and judicial
 oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced. Anyone
 detained by the authorities must be charged within 48 hours.
 In normal criminal cases, the permitted duration of pretrial
 detention varies according to the gravity of the crime. Under
 reforms passed in 1984, the maximum time that any person may
 be held in pretrial detention, even for the most serious
 crimes, is 5 1/2 years and no more than 2 years at each step
 of the trial and during the long appeals process.

 ITALY
 In September the Government issued a decree permitting the
 detention of persons konvicted of Mafia-type organized crimes
 and crimes involving drug trafficking for an additional 6
 months. This extension applies only to appeals, not to trials
 of first instance. The step was taken to avoid the release
 from prison of many convicts whose appeals were still pending
 after 2 years. In Italy, an appeal results in a new trial
 which must be completed within 2 years after the appeal is
 filed.
 Lengthy pretrial detention remains a problem in Italy. As a
 safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribunals" are empowered to
 review evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to
 decide whether continued detention is warranted.,
 Exile as a foim of punishment is unknbwn. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Derial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair trial is assured by law and observed in practice in
 almost All cases. Counsel is provided for the accused, free
 of charge if necessary. Trial procedures are often
 cumbersome, with the result that trials frequently last af
 inordinately long time.' An *adwersarial"-type trial system is
 to be implemented bef6re the end of 1989. It is'hoped that
 this system, similar to that in use in the United States, will
 result in speedier trials.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive, and there are
 no political or security courts. All Cases may be appealed to
 the highest Appel ate. court,.the Court of Cassation. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept f the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 moitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully d4efined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows expression of a wide
 spectrum of political views. Although there is no censorship,
 publications may be seized for violation of obscenity laws or
 for defamation of state institutions. These powers are seldom
 invoked.'-Government-run radio and television are politicized
 at the administrative level but are open to widely differing
 views. A large number of private radio and television
 stations hdbeen broadcasting since the early 1980's and
 providingc'6ompetit'ion for the state-owned broadcasting
 system. Public and private stations air vigorous debate on
 political and social issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens are unhampered in exercising their right of
 free assembly, which is limited only in cases where national
 security or public safety is endangered. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations
 
 
 1166
 ITALY
 must notify the police in advance. Professional and employee
 associations organize and Tepresent their constituencies
 freely. For a discussion of freedom of association as it
 applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 People are free to profess and practice any religious faith.
 All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 limits imposed by the laws governing public order. The
 Government has reached agreements with some religious groups
 to define their rights and status.
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The agreement, which
 replaced the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and
 place of Catholicism but no longer accords it the status of a
 state religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues
 informally to enjoy special standing in Italy because of the
 presence of the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority
 of Italians are, at least nominally, Roman Catholic. Starting
 in 1990, the clergy will be supported entirely by voluntary
 contributions instead of by a subsidy provided by the State.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public
 schools as an optional subject.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Although it
 does not normally offer permanent resettlement to political
 refugees, Italy has provided temporary haven for many persons
 fleeing persecution who are eventually resettled in third
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy has a democratic, multiparty parliamentary system.
 Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a wide
 range of organized and active political parties exists from
 the far left to the far right of the political spectrum.
 Election campaigns are free and open, and voting is by-secret
 ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and regional,
 provincial, and municipal councils are elected at regular
 intervals. Opposition groups are active and are frequently
 able to alter or reject government policies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International-and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate
 conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 The Government actively promotes human rights around the world
 and participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations, including the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission.

 ITALY
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 In 1989 there was an increase in race-related incidents
 involving persons of African origin residing, often illegally,
 in Italy. In one such incident, a black refugee from South
 Africa working as a migrant farm worker near Caserta, was
 murdered in the course of a robbery by.a band of Italian
 youths. The case focused Italian Government and media
 attention on the problem of Third World immigrants living in
 Italy whose numbers have been growing rapidly over the past
 decade: The Government is contemplating immigration
 legislation which will limit entry of non-European Community
 residents into Italy.
 Intolerance by northern Italians toward their fellow citizens
 from the south has also become more apparent during the past
 year, with the murder of a.southerner vacationing in the north
 evidently motivated by such feelings. Discrimination based on
 race is deplored by the Government and by the great majority
 of Italians. In both incidents, the perpetrators were
 apprehended and prosecuted.
 The condition-of women in Italy has improved greatly over the
 past 20 years. Women participate freely in political and
 social life: Since 1963 it has been illegal to dismiss'a
 female employee-within 1 year of her marriage date except "for
 cause."
 Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage. In the event
 of divorce, a woman is entitled to a share of the survivor's
 pension and any inheritance in the event of the death of her
 ex-husband. The property of a married couple is considered
 community-property unless husband and wife agree to keep their
 property divided.- All.,assets acquired pior to marriage are
 exempt from the community property provision.
 Violence against women and children.became a major topic of �
 governmental and-media attention during 1989. Demands were
 made by women's groups for stiffer penalties against rapists;
 the Parliament is considering this possibility. Media
 attention was also focused-on the subject of wife beating and
 child abuse. There are no reliable statistics available on
 the subject, howeverr since iost incidents of this nature are
 not reported-to the police. A telephone "hot line" service
 established in 1988.reported receiving 8,000 telephone calls
 during its first year from abused women throughout-Italy.
 German speakers in the Alto Adige region bordering on Austria
 have claimed for many-years that they were discriminated
 against on the:basis of language--particularly in legal
 proceedings and in the schools--and a recently enacted package
 of reforms is aimed at providing further protection for them.
 Italian speakers have :complained that the new concessions to
 the German-speaking minority have in fact resulted in reverse
 discrimination. Italian speakers, who are a minority in many
 parts of the region, have claimed that they are discriminated
 against in obtaining housing and employment.

 ITALY
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right to
 establish a trade union, to join a union, and to carry out
 union activities in the workplace. Trade unions are not
 government controlled, and the Constitution fully protects
 their right to strike, which is frequently exercised. In
 practice, the three major labor confederations have strong
 ideological ties to the three major political parties and
 perform certain services for the Government, (e.g.,
 administering certain social welfare benefits), which
 compensates them accordingly. Moreover, the Workers' Statute
 favors the three confederations to the extent that it is
 difficult for small unions, including the so-called "base
 committees" (COBAS) to obtain recognition. This was a major
 issue in the numerous strikes called by the COBAS in 1989.
 Overall, there was some increase in the number of hours lost
 to strikes during the year. However, the major cause was a
 4-hour general strike in May called by the three
 confederations to protest government plans to increase health
 benefit contributions. Italian unions engage freely and
 actively in international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by the Constitution and is freely practiced
 throughout the country. Labor-management relations are
 governed by legislation, custom, collective bargaining
 agreements, and labor contracts. A key element of
 labor-management-government cooperation affecting the
 industrial relations climate has been the 1986 agreement on
 indexing wages (scala mobile) to the cost of living every 6
 months. National collective bargaining agreements de facto
 apply to all workers regardless of union membership.
 Collective bargaining at the national level (involving the
 three confederations, the public and private employers'
 organizations and, where appropriate, the Government), occurs
 irregularly and deals with issues of universal concern,
 particularly the system of wage indexation.
 Sectoral negotiations, involving national-level industry
 unions and employers' organizations, typically occur three
 times a year and set agreements covering all aspects of labor
 relations which apply to all workers, whether unionized or
 not. Voluntary, nonbinding mediation is provided by the
 Ministry of Labor and is often effective in bringing labor and
 management together. There are no areas of the country, such
 as export processing zones, where union organizations and
 collective bargaining are impeded or discouraged. The law
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.
 Forced or compulsory labor, which is prohibited by law, does
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 
 
 1169
 XIALY
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may, as
 an exception, authorize the employment on specific jobs of
 children over 12 years of age. The minimum age is 15 for men
 employed in dangerous, fatiguing,.and unsanitary work, and 16
 for men employed underground; in quarries, mines, and tunnels
 without mechanical vehicles; in weight lifting and carrying;
 in loading and unloading sulphur ovens in Sicily; and in
 occupations harmful to the workers' morale. No worker under
 18 years may be employed in driving and pulling trucks and
 carriages, or in jobs for the manufacture, handling, and
 salvaging of explosives. Minimum age and compulsory education
 laws are effectively enforced.
 No women, regardless of age, are permitted to be employed
 underground, in quarries, mines, or tunnels. Only women over
 21 are allowed to work in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary
 jobs, on the cleaning and servicing of engines, or on moving
 machinery.
 a. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48
 hours--no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day-may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective labor agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages
 and salaries are set forth in collective labor agreements.'
 National collective labor agreements contain minimum standard4
 to which individual employment agreements must'conform. In
 the absence of agreement between the parties, the courts may
 step in to determine fair wages on the basis of practice in
 related activities or related collective agreements.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases, these
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Enforcement of health and safety regulations is entrusted to
 labor inspectors, an autonomous group within the Labor
 Ministry who have the same status as judicial police
 officers. Inspectors make periodic visits to companies to
 ensure observance of safety regulations. Violators may be
 fined or even imprisoned. Trade unions also play an important
 role in reporting safety violations to inspectorS.
 Despite these enforcement provisions, according to government
 statistics, the number of deaths from on-the-job accidents has
 risen from 1,704 recorded in 1985 to 1,905 in 1988. Part of
 the problem is an inadequate number of inspectors. There-is
 also pressure on Workers in southern Italy, due to high
 unemployment, to accept unsafe conditions as a necessary evil
 if they are to have a job. There are many substandard
 workplaces in Italy, especially in the south.
