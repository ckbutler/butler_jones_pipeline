 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is a former Spanish colony in Central West
 Africa, composed of a continental province, Rio Muni, and the
 island provinces of Bioko and Annobon. Under the Constitution
 of 1982, the President, Teodoro Obiang Mbasogo, has extensive
 powers, including naming and dismissing cabinet ministers and
 making decree laws. Since the overthrow in 1979 of the brutal
 11-year Macias regime, civil order has been restored and the
 terror that characterized the former dictatorship has ended.
 Despite these important changes, the National Assembly, while
 theoretically the lawmaking branch of government, is in fact
 powerless to take any action not sanctioned by the President or
 his Council of Ministers. No political parties have yet been
 allowed to form. The present leadership is constrained by the
 necessity of operating within a consensus of top government and
 tribal leaders.
 The previous Macias regime drove the once prosperous economy,
 based on cocoa, coffee, and wood, close to bankruptcy. The
 present Government has since been burdened with high deficits,
 persistent inflation, heavy debt service, and falling world
 prices for its products. Under these circumstances, the
 Government has focused on economic reform, and in 1985 it took
 two important steps. It entered the West African Franc Zone
 (CFA) on January 1, 1985; this move immediately ensured
 convertibility to the French franc and imposed much-needed
 financial discipline on the Government, including reduced
 opportunities for embezzlement. In July, the Government was
 able to reschedule its major foreign debts and enter into a
 standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 after extensive negotiations.
 The human rights situation in 1985 did not improve. While
 there were no reports of the kinds of crimes committed by the
 former regime (notably government-sanctioned kidnaping,
 torture, and murder), allegations continue of government
 officials abusing their authority for personal gain. Ordinary
 citizens are still harassed by the police and subjected to
 arbitrary arrest, and discrimination continues against minority
 groups and migrant workers. An important confrontation with
 Nigeria developed in 1985 over the issue of forced labor.
 Reportedly 500 Nigerian farm workers in Equatorial Guinea were
 stripped of their passports and forced to work on the country's
 cocoa plantations. The Nigerian Government sent four ships,
 including two gun boats, to repatriate the Nigerian workers.
 Approximately 48 Nigerians did return to Nigeria by boat but
 others remained, and it is still unclear if the Nigerians had
 in fact been forcibly detained.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to the Government, one political prisoner, sentenced
 to death in 1983 after being tried and found guilty for
 plotting to assassinate the President, officially remains in
 jail, but it is believed that he has died in prison.
 Confirmation of his status has not been possible. No
 information is available on the fate of 26 others tried on
 lesser charges in the 1983 coup attempt.

 b. Disappearance
 There was one unconfirmed report of the arrest and possible
 disappearance of a military officer as a result of a
 disturbance in summer 1985 during a Presidential visit. With
 this exception, there were no reports of unexplained
 disappearance or abduction during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police methods are harsh and often include beatings of
 prisoners, either to extract information or to punish offenders
 for insolence or disrespect. Reports abound of police
 harassment of people on trumped-up charges and the beating of
 those who refuse to pay bribes. These abuses are commonly
 believed to be officially ignored to give an underpaid and
 occasionally unpaid police force a means to supplement its
 income. Arbitrary beatings by police of politically powerless
 people, such as expatriate Nigerian and Cameroonian workers and
 certain indigenous groups like the Bubis, are believed to be
 common. Mistreatment of prisoners is officially condemned, but
 there seems little political will to end these abuses.
 Conditions in prisons are reported to be extremely poor.
 In one incident, a Spanish citizen died while in custody prior
 to extradition to Spain. The Government claimed that he died
 of injuries after jumping from a moving vehicle enroute to the
 Malabo Airport. It was also alleged that this person was
 denied access to adequate medical treatment by the local
 authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite a habeas corpus provision in the Constitution, there
 are no effective legal protections dealing with the right of a
 person in detention to be charged or released within a certain
 period of time, to be informed of charges, to have access to a
 lawyer, or to be freed on bail. The executive branch has been
 able to act without any fear of judicial interference.
 Reports of incidents of arbitrary arrest are widespread,
 including reports from various expatriate groups in France,
 Spain, Cameroon, and Gabon. When arrested, the ordinary
 Guinean frequently finds that his options are to stay in jail
 or to pay the police to win his freedom. There are no known
 instances of any person being exiled in 1985.
 As noted above, the issue of forced labor escalated to an
 international incident in 1985. While the situation is much
 improved since 1979, the Government still periodically rounds
 up "vagrants" and illegal aliens and puts them to work, often
 on plantations. The purpose of the law is allegedly to require
 citizens to choose between this forced work or returning to
 their villages and finding useful employment there. In the
 case of illegal aliens, the choice is between working in a
 particular work project or leaving the country. These roundups
 appear to be a means of obtaining free labor and are often
 linked to preparation for important national days or to the
 arrival of visiting dignitaries.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The exact number of political prisoners is unknown but is
 believed to be small. The Government does not admit to holding
 
 
 98
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 any political prisoners. Amnesty International expressed
 concern in its 1984 report that the 26 persons tried for
 plotting to kill the President did not receive fair trials.
 The Government claims that all of these cases have been tried,
 with the majority of the accused having received sentences
 varying from 5 to 10 years.
 It is not possible to know how frequently people are denied
 trials since the system forces many detainees to deal directly
 with the arresting authorities and to resort to bribes to gain
 their freedom. The current court system, which often uses
 local customary law, is a combination of traditional, civil,
 and military justice and operates in an ad hoc manner for lack
 of established procedures and experienced judicial personnel.
 Equatorial Guinea's few lawyers work for the Government and
 consequently are unable to challenge government and judicial
 actions effectively. Most trials are brief. In cases of petty
 theft or civil dispute, all parties are brought before a judge
 for trial. In civil and criminal cases, the judge often sets a
 fine instead of imprisonment. In political cases involving
 senior officials, exclusion from public office and exile to
 traditional villages are common means of punishment.
 The Ministry of Justice has made little progress in
 establishing a legal system. There were no major court cases
 during 1985 which could serve to test the independence of the
 judicial system. There is a Supreme Court, but its role is
 unclear. At the higher levels, the courts appear to be
 competent, professional, and honest, but courts at this level
 frequently do not get the opportunity to act because they are
 preempted by action of the executive branch.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are reports of arbitrary interference with privacy and
 the home. Many people believe that telephone conversations,
 but not correspondence, are routinely monitored. Search
 warrants are not often used, even though prescribed in the
 Constitution. The politically powerless often appear to be at
 the mercy of arbitrary police practices.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Citizens dare not utter public dissent on political or economic
 matters, but criticism is frequently heard in private
 conversations. What few media exist in Equatorial Guinea are
 government-owned and -operated and do not criticize the
 Government. Equatorial Guinea's single newspaper did not
 publish in 1985. The radio and television stations transmit
 official government notices, imported entertainment, sports,
 and religious programs. There is no prohibition on receiving
 foreign publications or periodicals but, primarily for economic
 reasons, there are no such publications for sale anywhere in
 the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While theoretically protected by the Constitution, public
 political opposition or assembly is not tolerated in practice.
 Membership in any type of opposition organization would, at a
 minimum, result in the loss of official employment and
 
 
 99.
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 exclusion from the ruling circles from which many benefits and
 privileges are derived. Nonpolitical groups, such as
 professional organizations and sports groups, do exist but must
 receive government permission to operate. Some such groups
 receive government backing.
 There have been no attempts to form any type of labor union,
 not even a civil service union. There is no formal industrial
 sector in Equatorial Guinea. Many employers are required to
 select their work force from government agencies on terms and
 contracts acceptable to the Government, thereby depriving
 workers of the possibility of bargaining for themselves, either
 individually or collectively.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion in Equatorial Guinea. No religion
 is favored, but 90 percent of the population is Catholic.
 Religious publishing ispermitted. Missionaries of several
 faiths are active and have government permission for their
 activities. Proselytization is permitted, and there does not
 appear to be any discrimination against persons on the basis of
 their faith. However, at the beginning of 1986 there were
 reports that the Government had acted to close down the meeting
 houses of Jehovah's Witnesses.
 It was reported in 1985 that the Ministry of Agriculture
 appropriated property belonging to a seminary, without recourse
 to legal process or notice to the property owner.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no explicit restrictions on Equatorial Guineans with
 respect to travel within the country. However, unemployed
 persons face forced labor on plantations or civic projects and
 then forced return to their place of origin. Travel abroad is
 limited by economic considerations. Also, there are often
 delays in the issuance of exit visas, but those delays do not
 seem to be politically motivated. There were no known Guinean
 political refugees departing the country in 1985, but a large
 number of refugees and displaced persons from the former regime
 continue to reside in Spain, France, Cameroon, and Gabon. Many
 of them criticize the current Government as being tribally
 based and undemocratic, but the poor state of the economy is
 probably another reason that they remain abroad. The
 Government has repeatedly indicated that all Guineans are
 welcome to return without fear of persecution but has made it
 clear that returnees may not engage in political activities
 outside the sanctioned system.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through democratic means. President Obiang took power in the
 military coup of 1979 which toppled the Macias regime. He
 became President in 1982 following a plebiscite which ratified
 a new Constitution. While the plebiscite involved only
 approval or disapproval of the Constitution, which established
 a 7-year term of office for the President, Obiang declared the
 referendum was a mandate to rule and declared himself President.
 
 
 100
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Under the Constitution, a partially elected, partially
 appointed National Assembly was chosen. While the Assembly
 includes members of minority groups, it is powerless to take
 any action not sanctioned by the President or his Council of
 Ministers, members of which can be appointed or dismissed by
 the President. Under the Constitution, the President also has
 the power to suspend virtually any and all rights if he decides
 a threat to national security or other emergency exists.
 The Government is concerned with internal security--there have
 been two coup attempts in recent years--and maintains tight
 control over political activity and the military. The
 government leaders are considering the introduction of a
 one-party state as a step in expanding and guiding political
 participation.
 There are two political structures, governmental and tribal.
 While high government officials frequently carry a similar
 tribal status, there is significant tribal influence outside
 government as well. The Fang ethnic group, which comprises
 more than 70 percent of the population, and in particular the
 Esangui branch, dominates the Government and the military. The
 Bubi tribe comprises a small percentage of the population, but
 historically it has been the majority on the island of Bioko
 where the capital is located. Bubis do not enjoy full equality
 or equal protection under law and lack effective
 representation, including jobs, in government. While the Prime
 Minister is a Bubi, his function is mainly ceremonial, and the
 National Assembly has little effective power.
 Women play only a minor role in political life. The two
 highest positions held by women are the mayorship of the
 mainland town of Akurenam and the Vice Minister of Labor.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has succeeded in distancing itself from the
 savagery of the previous regime. The authorities are
 forthcoming in discussing human rights issues with
 international organizations but would be unlikely to permit a
 close investigation of the human rights scene in Equatorial
 Guinea. There are no local human rights groups in the
 country. Amnesty International did not include an entry on
 Equatorial Guinea in its 1985 Report due to the lack of
 information. Freedom House rated Equatorial Guinea as "not
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION:
 According to 1985 World Bank data, the population of Equatorial
 Guinea is 350,000 and is growing at the rate of 2.6 percent
 annually. Per capita gross national product is variously
 estimated at between $100-200 annually, one of the lowest in
 the world. The average Guinean lives at the subsistence level,
 although members of the government bureaucracy in the larger
 towns have a higher standard of living. The Government is the
 largest employer in the country.
 The economy improved modestly in 1985, in part due to the
 Government's decision to join the CFA franc zone. Cocoa
 production, the mainstay of the economy, also seems to be
 increasing, although precise data are not available, and many
 
 
</pre>

 101
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 production obstacles remain, e.g., the lack of labor incentives
 and the uneven application of laws affecting property rights.
 Foreign aid flows into the country are substantial, averaging
 over $30 million annually.
 Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 44 years and the
 country's infant mortality rate is 132 per 1,000 live births.
 Official World Bank estimates put the country's literacy rate
 at 37 percent. The primary school attendance ratio of eligible
 children is 79 percent (male 88 percent, female 71 percent).
 The school system is generally poor, and teachers are largely
 unqualified and poorly educated. Many of the best schools are
 run by Spanish missionaries. There are only two high schools
 in the country (Bata and Malabo) and no institution of higher
 education.
 Most salaried employment is with the Government. Government
 workers do not exceed a 48 hour week. Salaries are frequently
 not paid or are only partially paid, and government workers
 must supplement their incomes through second jobs. The minimum
 age for employment is 16, but there is no enforcement of this
 law in rural areas and children of various ages work, as
 necessary, to help support their families. There are no
 vigorously enforced minimum work standards.
 The law states that both sexes and all tribal groups are equal
 and entitled to the same rights and privileges. For a variety
 of reasons, some historical and cultural, and others economic,
 women are accorded a lower status than men and have a
 correspondingly lower influence in the society and government.
 Men often take several wives. Social tradition, and the fact
 that women produce most of the basic staple food items, keeps
 most women engaged in agricultural or domestic work.
