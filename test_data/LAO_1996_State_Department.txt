 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is an authoritarian one-party state
 ruled by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP).
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) remains the main instrument of state control. MOI
 police maintain order and monitor Lao society and foreign nationals, including for-
 eign officials and diplomats. The degree of surveillance varies by locality, but overall
 has diminished considerably in recent years.
 Laos is an extremely poor country. After the LPRP came to power in 1975, at
 least 350,000 people fled the country to escape the Government's harsh political and
 economic policies. Since 1986 the Government has largely abandoned its Socialist
 economic agenda. Economic reforms have moved the country from a moribund, cen-
 trally planned system to a growing, market-oriented economy open to foreign invest-
 ment.
 There has been a general trend away from the harsh conditions that existed after
 the LPRP assumed power in 1975, but serious problems remain. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. Even with ongoing economib liberaliza-
 tion, the adoption of a Constitution in 1991, and National Assembly elections in
 1993, the Government has only slowly eased restrictions on basic freedoms and
 begun codification of implementing legislation for rights stipulated in the Constitu-
 tion. Many of the rights provided or in the Constitution have not been codified with
 implementing legislation. In practice, the Government restricts the freedoms of
 speech, assembly, and, to a lesser extent, religion, even though they are provided
 for in the Constitution. Citizens do not have the right to privacy and do not enjoy
 a free press, although most citizens have ready access to a variety of foreign meda.
 Prison conditions remain harsh, and some societal discrimination against women
 and minorities persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Inuding Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial illing-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 While the   continueto be occasional killings by armed bands, who ambushed
 and robbed persons in vehicles north of Vientiane, it remains unclear whether these
 killings were politically motivated. There were three such incidents reported in Sop-
 tember. Similar attacks occurred in this area prior to the formation of the current
 Government. However, since passengers are assaulted as well as robbed, this may
 indicate that a vestige of the low level insurgency of the 1980's remains.
 The Government does not ordinarily publicize lethal incidents. In Soptember,
 however, following an attack on passengers in a tour agency's minivan which re-
 suited in the dats of a well-known expatriate businessman and four others, the
 media not only reported the incident but included a warning that the area in which
 the attack occurred is not considered safe.
 b. Disappearanee.-There were no reports of oliticall  motivated disappearances.
 In Soptember 1993, Vue Mai, a Hmong leaaer who      November 1992 returned
 voluntarily to Laos from a refugee camp in Thailand, disa ppeared in Vientiane. No
 new information relevant to the case came to light during the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or De-grading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the Government
 generally observed these principles in practice.
 Prison conditions are harsh but not life threatening. Prison authorities deny some
 prisoners regular family visits, and medical care ranges from inadequate to non-
 existent. Inmates sometimes resort to bribing guards to obtain food and medicines.
 Prison conditions for women are similar to those for men. The extent of sexual ha-
 
 
 assment in prison is unknown, but it is not believed to be a serious problem. There
 is no independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrar Arrest, Detention or Exile.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 some protection, including a statute of limitations for those accused of crimes, but
 the Government does not fully respect these provisions. Those accused of hostility
 toward the regime are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods. There
 have been no reports of this type of arrest in the past 4 years.
 There continued to be allegations that the Government has detained three Hmong
 males since 1992 because of their association with the United States Government
 prior to 1975. The Lao Government has thus far not responded directly to repeated
 inquiries about these allegations.
 While citizens have the protection of due process, authorities have reportedly ar-
 rested some persons based on unsupported accusations and without informing them
 of the charges, the accusers' identities, or their legal rights. Due process rights are
 unevenly upheld across the country.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of judges and prosecutors and protects their decisions from outside scrutiny. In prac-
 tice, however, the courts, which are understaffed and poorly trained, appear to ac-
 cept recommendations of other government agencies, especially the Ministry of Inte-
 rior, m making their decisions.
 The judiciary is composed of district courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court.
 Although regulations provide for public trial, widespread ignorance of constitu-
 tional rights among both citizens and law enforcement authorities often results in
 trials that are little more than public announcements of predetermined verdicts. Po-
 litically sensitive trials have not been open to the public, although trials of civil
 crimes appeared to be open; these are increasingly publicized in the media.
 There is provision for appeal to the provincial courts and the Supreme Court. Sen-
 ior government and party officials reportedly may also review politically sensitive
 cases.
 The Constitution provides that all accused persons have the right to defend them-
 selves in court. A board of legal advisors formed in 1991 was suspended in 1992,
 pending enactment of a legally clarified body of governing regulations. The Govern-
 ment strengthened the legal profession andindividual rights to counsel in August
 by establishing a formal bar association. According to the Criminal Code, defendants
 in criminal cases are entitled, at their own expense, to representation by a "rights
 protector" who may be a practicing attorney. However, becase citizens are largely
 unaware of their rights and legal authorities are not required by law to enlighten
 them, few defendants seek or have legal representation.
 Arrests, trials and convictions are usually unannounced, thereby complicating ef-
 forts to estimate accurately the number of political prisoners. Three former govern-
 ment officials are serving 14-year sentences handed down in 1992 for advocating a
 multiparty system and criticizing restrictions on political liberties. Also in 1992,
 three men detained since 1975 were sentenced to life terms for crimes allegedly
 committed during their tenure as officials of the previous regime. The Government
 claims that three other officials of the former government released in 1992 have cho-
 sen to remain in the same remote province where they and the six prisoners men-
 tioned above were held. There have been no reports of other political prisoners in
 the last few years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-At the
 same time that it sought to liberalize the economy, the Government relaxed some
 elements of state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and
 business activities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the
 Constitution prohibits arrests or searches in homes without a warrant or authoriza-
 tion, the security bureaus may authorize search and seizure by themselves rather
 than by judicial authority. The Government and the Party continue to monitor citi-
 zens sporadically through a system of neighborhood and workplace committees. The
 neighborhood committees also have responsibility for maintaining public order and
 reporting "bad elements" to the police. These committees usually concern themselves
 more with street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political activ-
 ism. The degree of surveillance and control varies from province to province, but
 overall has diminished considerably in recent years.
 The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
 the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves. The
 Government continued to monitor international mail and telephone calls, probably
 including some faxes, although the increasing number of such calls limited the scope
 of such surveillance.

 The Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land. Private
 "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates, which can be bought, sold, and
 transferred to heirs. Many citizens who fled the country after 1975 have regained
 confiscated land and property after demonstrating their intent to repatriate.
 Contact between ordinary citizens and foreigners has increased in recent years as
 restrictions such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most
 foreigners' homes are no longer enforced.The Government has eased the prohibition
 against foreigners staying with Lao families in urban areas, and allows citizens to
 marry foreigners but only with prior government approval. Marriages without gov-
 ernment approval may be annulled, with both partners subject to fine and arrest.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Despite the constitutional provisions for free-
 dom of speech and the press, the Government exerts broad control over the exercise
 of these freedoms and has reacted harshly to expressions of political dissent. Three
 persons arrested in 1990 after persisting in public criticism of party policies and
 calling for fundamental political and economic change, each received 14-year sen-
 tences in 1992 (see Section i.e.). The Penal Code forbids slandering the State, dis-
 torting party or state policies, and spreading false rumors conducive to disorder. It
 also prohibits disseminating books and other materials that authorities deem inde-
 cent or that would assail the national culture.
 All domestically produced newspapers and radio and television are controlled by
 the Government. Local news in all media reflect government policy; however, foreign
 news reports, including those from Western sources, are usually translated without
 bias. In recent years, the Government has relaxed its control of the flow of informa-
 tion from abroad, and Thai and Western newspapers and magazines have been sold
 in the towns where there is demand for them. The Government makes no effort to
 discourage reception of Thai radio or television broadcasts. These are widely re-
 ceived in the Mekong River valley, where the majority of the population lives.
 The Government requires registration of satellite television receiving dishes and
 payment of a one-time licensing fee for their installation, but otherwise makes no
 effort to restrict their use. In 1996 the number of such dishes continued to increase,
 both in major urban areas and in remote provincial and district towns. The Cable
 News Network (CNN), the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and several sta-
 tions in Thailand are among the many channels available to satellite dish owners.
 The Government prohibits pornographic or politically inflammatory video-
 cassettes. In late 1994 the Vientiane Municipality imposed restrictions governing
 the content of music played in night clubs any outlawed karaoke in order to
 strengthen Lao culture against its prceived erosion by foreign influenes. Enforce-
 ment of these restrictionshas been eaxc
 The Government restricts academic freedom. The Government has at times in the
 past denied permission to Lao academicians to travel abroad for conferences or
 training. Invitations to visit and collaborate with foreign colleagues must be ap-
 provedby the Lao employer and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of
 Education must approve grants, including those for research and study abroad. The
 Government also monitors and may restrict the activities of Western scholars doing
 research in Laos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Penal Code prohibits dem-
 onstmrations or protest marches aimed at causing turmoil and social instability, pre-
 scribing penalties of from 1 to 5 years' imprisonment. Although the Constitution
 provides citizens with the right to organize and join associations, all associations are
 party-controlled, and their products reflect official policy. Foreigners are not allowed
 to engage in political activity.
 c.Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution contains provisions for religious free-
 dom. In practice, the Government continues to restrict freedom of religion, especially
 for some Christian denominations.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. Although the Government permits foreign nongovernmental or-
 ganizations with religious affiliations to work in the country, it prohibits foreigners
 from proselytizing. The Government also restricts the import of foreign religious
 publications and artifacts.
 The enforcement of these regulations varies by province. For example, the Catho-
 lic Church is unable to operate in the highlands and much of the north, but Catho-
 lics can openly attend churches and chapels in central and southern Laos. Several
 Protestant denominations operate more than 100 churches throughout the country.
 There continued to be credible reports that local authorities detained some clergy
 for allegedly criticizing other religions and harassed, arrested, and jailed other reli-
 giously active clergy. The persistence of such reports underscores the continuing
 
 
 710
 suspicion on the part of authorities toward some parts of the Lao Christian commu-
 nity. There were also unconfirmed reports that Lao Christians were sometimes
 barred from the Party or from government employment and that some rural Lao
 were not allowed to convert to the Baha'i faith.
 By comparison, the Government openly encourages Buddhism and supports Bud-
 dhist organizations. High-ranking government officials routinely attend religious
 functions, and Buddhist clergy are prominently featured at important state and
 party functions. The Government permits Buddhist festivals without hindrance.
 Two mosques and a Baha'i center operate openly in Vientiane.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no domestic travel restrictions for citizens and private foreign
 visitors except in areas considered unsafe. Most citizens can easily obtain passports
 and exit permits from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for personal travel abroad.
 Border crossing permits to visit Thailand are routinely available from local village
 committees for a modest issuance fee, and the Government does not appear to inter-
 fere with persons desiring to emigrate. Except for around 30 persons convicted in
 absentia in 1975 for antigovernment activities, citizens have the right of return.
 The stated government policy since 1977 is to welcome back the approximately
 10 percent of the population that fled after the change of government in 1975. In
 recent years, an increasing number of ethnic Lao living abroad returned to visit;
 several remained to operate businesses.
 Laos, Thailand, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are co-
 operating on the return of the Lao asylum seekers in camps in Thailand who volun-
 teer to return to Laos. This program includes provisions for monitoring returnees
 to ensure that they are given the same rights and treatment as resident Lao. Ac-
 cording to the UNHCR and voluntary agencies, returnees are not subject to dis-
 crimination or persecution, and returnees are allowed to return with all the belong-
 ings they accumulated while outside the country. There were no forcible repatri-
 ations to Laos in 1996; however, nine Lao were voluntarily repatriated to Laos by
 the UNHCR during the year. No new Lao asylum seekers arrived in Thailand.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the'abiity to change their government, despite constitutional
 provisions for the public election of National Assembly members. While the Con-
 stitution does not explicitly exclude formation of multiple political parties, it assigns
 to the ruling LPRP the leading role in the political system. All candidates needed
 the approval of the LPRP before they could stand for the December 1992 National
 Assembly elections; no other parties were allowed, and voting was mandatory. How-
 ever, not all candidates were LPRP members, and a few nonparty candidates won
 seats.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. Of the 85 members of
 the National Assembly 8 are women. While three members of the 49-member LPRP
 Central Committee are women, there are no women in the Politburo or the Council
 of Ministers.
 Men of lowland Lao origin dominate the upper echelons of the party and the Gov-
 ernment. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister
 of Interior and 23 members of the National Assembly are believed to be members
 of ethnic minority groups. Members of these minorities often adopt lowland Lao
 names as they are increasingly assimilated into mainstream society, thus making
 it difficult to ascertain accurately the number of ethnic minority members in any
 organization.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies would face seri-
 ous obstacles if it were permitted to operate at all. The Government generally does
 not cooperate with international human rights organizations. It has, however, per-
 mitted U.N. human rights observers to monitor the treatment of returning refugees
 without interference and responded to inquiries about specific human rights prob-
 lems.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law for all citizens with-
 out regard to sex, social status, education, faith, or ethnicity. Although the Govern-
 ment took action when cases of discrimination came to the attention of high-level
 officials, the legal mechanism whereby a citizen may bring charges of discrimination
 
 
 711
 against an individual or organization is neither widely developed nor widely under-
 stood among the general population.
 Women.-There are reports that domestic violence against women occurs, al-
 though it is not widespread. Sexual harassment and rape are reportedly rare. In
 cases of rape that are tried in court, defendants are generally convicted. The Gov-
 ernment relies on the Women's Union, a party-sanctioned organization, and youth
 organizations to educate girls and young women about the schemes of recruiters for
 brothels and sweatshops in Thailand and elsewhere. In the past, the Government
 has prosecuted some persons for involvement in such recruiting activities. During
 the year, law enforcement agencies conducted several raids of entertainment estab-
 lishments accused of fostering prostitution.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for women, and the Lao Women's
 Union operates nationally to promote the position of women in Lao society. How-
 ever, traditional culturally based discrimination persists, especially among lowland
 Lao and some hill tribes. Many women occupy responsible positions in the civil serv-
 ice and private business, and in urban areas their incomes are often higher than
 those of men. The Family Code prohibits legal discrimination in marriage and inher-
 itance.
 Children.-Government resources are inadequate to provide fully for children's
 basic health and educational needs. Education is compulsory through the fifth
 grade, but children from rural areas and poor urban families rarely comply with this
 requirement. Violence against children is prohibited by law. Reports of the physical
 abuse of children are rare.
 People With Disabilities.-With donor assistance, the Government is implement-
 ing limited programs for the disabled, especially amputees. The law does not man-
 date accessibility to buildings or government services for disabled persons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides for equal rights
 for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them. However, soci-
 etal discrimination persists.
 Approximately half the population is ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao." Most
 of the remainder is a mosaic of diverse upland hill tribes whose members, if born
 in Laos, are Lao citizens. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese minorities,
 particularly in the towns. There is a small community of South Asian origin. The
 implementation in 1994 of the 1990 Law on Nationality provided a means for these
 Vietnamese and Chinese minorities to regularize their Lao citizenship. While the
 Government encourages the preservation of minority cultures and traditions, minor-
 ity tribes have little voice in government decisions affecting their lands and the allo-
 cation of natural resources. Hill tribe interaction with the Government is limited by
 poor transportation and communication links and a shortage of government re-
 sources.
 The Hmong are one of the largest and most prominent highland minority groups.
 They split along clan lines during the US. war with Vietnam; many were stron_gly
 anti-Communist while others sided with the Lao and Vietnamese Communists. The
 Government repressed many who had fought against it, especially those still per-
 ceive to be resisting its authority. In recent years, the Government has initiated
 projects designed to integrate the Hmong into the general society, and an increasing
 number of those who fled the country after 1975 have repatriated to Laos without
 suffering persecution. Two U.N. observers who monitored repatriation efforts re-
 ported no incidents of abuse or discrimination during the year.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to organize and join associations, the party controls all associations, and all
 conform to official party policy (see Section 2.b.).
 Subsistence farmers comprise an estimated 85 percent of the work force. The
 State employs the majority of salaried workers, although this situation is changing
 as the Government reduces the number of its employees and privatizes state enter-
 rsesand as foreign investors open new factories and businesses. Under the 1990
 abore, labor unions can be formed in private enterprises as long as they oper-
 ate within the framework of the officially sanctioned Federation of Lao Trade
 Unions (FLTU), which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. Most of the FLTUs 80,000
 members work in the ublic sector, overwhelmingly as public servants.
 Strikes are not proibited under the law, but the Government's ban on "desta-
 bilizing subversive activities" makes a strike unlikely, and none was reported this
 year (see Section 2.a.).
 With advice from the International Labor Organization CILO), including a foreign
 expert provided by the ILO to work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,
 
 
 the Government has revised the Labor Code in an effort to clarify rights and obliga-
 tions of workers and employers.
 The extent to which the FLTU is free to engage in contacts and affiliate with for-
 eign labor organizations is unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives of the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority residing in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Labor disputes are infrequent. The Govern-
 ment sets wages and salaries for government employees, while management sets
 wages and salaries for private business employees.
 The Labor Code stipulates that employers may not fire employees for conducting
 trade union activities, for lodging complaints against employers about labor law im-
 plementation, or for cooperating with officials on labor law implementation and
 labor disputes. Workplace committees are one mechanism used for resolving com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Labor Code, children
 under the age of 15 may not be recruited for employment. However, many children
 help their families on farms or in shops. The Labor Code accordingly provides that
 children may work for their families, provided that such children are not engaged
 in dangerous or difficult work. Such employment of children is common in urban
 shops, but rare in industrial enterprises. The Ministries of Interior and Justice are
 responsible for enforcing these provisions, but enforcement is ineffective due to a
 lack of inspectors and other resources. Education is compulsory through the fifth
 grade, but this requirement is rarely observed in the rural areas or among the
 urban poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for a broad range of
 worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in dangerous ac-
 tivities), safe working conditions, and higher compensation for dangerous work. The
 code also provides for at least 1 day of rest per week. Employers are responsible
 for all expenses for a worker injured or killed on the *ob, a requirement generally
 fulfilled by employers in the formal economic sector. 4he daily minimum wage is
 $1.09 (1,000 kip), which is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. Most civil servants receive inadequate pay. However, few fami-
 lies in the wage economy depend on only one breadwinner. Some piecework employ-
 ees, especially on construction sites, earn less than the minimum wage. Many are
 illegal immigrants, particularly from Vietnam, and are more vulnerable to exploi-
 tation by employers. Although workplace inspections have reportedly increased, the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare lacks the personnel and budgetary resources
 to enforce the Labor Code effectively. The Labor Code has no specific prvision al-
 lowing workers to remove themselves from a dangerous situation without jeopardiz-
 ing their employment.
