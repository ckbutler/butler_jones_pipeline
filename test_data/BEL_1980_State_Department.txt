 BELGIUM
 Belgium has shared in the major philosophical, political
 and social trends of Western European history over the
 last several centuries and is a stable democratic society
 committed to human rights and political freedoms. It is a
 parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch;
 the Council of Ministers (cabinet) in practice is
 responsible for governmental decisions. The council, led
 by the prime minister holds office as long as it retains
 the confidence of the parliament. Direct popular
 elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 76 of the 182
 senate seats apportioned by other means) are held at least
 every four years under a system of universal suffrage,
 obligatory voting and a form of proportional
 representation. Belguim is a party to the 1950 European
 Convention of the Protection of Human Rights and
 Fundamental Freedoms. Political freedoms and guarantees
 of individual rights are embodied in the constitution and
 laws and observed in practice. Educational levels are
 high, as is public involvement in the governmental
 process. The government is committed to continue a policy
 of social benefits and of equitable distribution of
 economic gains in this materially prosperous country.
 Belgium is scrupulous in observing internationally
 recognized human rights and has a legal and cultural
 tradition of respect and concern for those rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Torture is not specifically addressed in the
 Belgian constitution, which provides that "no person may
 be prosecuted except in cases laid down by the law and in
 the form it prescribes (Article 7) and *no penalty may be
 decreed nor applied save in accordance with the law"
 (Article 9). The various provisions of the Belgian Penal
 Code which declare unlawful and subject to penalty the
 deliberate mistreatment or injury of another are
 applicable to the actions of officials as well as those of
 private individuals.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is
 guaranteed by law and is respected in practice. There are
 no differences in the conditions of confinement based on
 race, sex, religion or social class. Persons convicted of
 non-violent crimes are, however, often assigned to minimum
 security facilities.
 c. Disappearances
 Abductions, secret arrests or clandestine detentions by
 official or quasi-official security forces, or other
 officially-condoned elements, contravene Belgian law and
 are unknown in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisionment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Arrested
 persons must be brought before a judge within 24 hours or
 released. Belgian law provides for pre-trial confinement
 only under special circumstances: when a person is
 apprehended in the commission of a criminal act; when
 there is a risk that the suspect will prove a danger to
 
 
 736
 the community; when there is a risk that he will flee the
 jurisdiction; and in cases involving a number of serious
 offenses specified by law. The justification for such
 confinement is subject to periodic review by a panel of
 judges.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 guaranteed by law and honored in practice. A suspect is
 charged, if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary
 judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are
 clearly and formally stated. A civilian may not be tried
 within Belgium by military courts; however, civilian
 dependents accompanying Belgian forces stationed outside
 the country are subject to the code of military justice
 and can be tried by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. The inviolability of the home is
 specifically guaranteed by Article 10 of the Belgian
 constitution, except in cases laid down and regulated by
 law. The law forbids searches of private homes at night
 except in special circumstances; warrants issued by a
 judge are required unless the inhabitants of the domicile
 agree to the search. The penal code provides penalties
 for all violations of the home by officials as well as by
 private persons.
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Belgium is an affluent country. Its per capita GNP is
 $10,413. The government is committed to policies ensuring
 that these benefits are distributed equitably throughout
 the economy. The adverse effects of a general downturn in
 the world economy combined with structural problems in the
 national economy, have led to a high unemployment rate,
 which is being confronted by government remedial policies
 and by an extensive system of unemployment compensation
 and other social benefits which, in most cases, prevents
 serious individual hardship.
 A common public educational system serves all economic
 levels. Belgium's tax system redounds to the advantage of
 the relatively poorer classes. Women in Belgium hold many
 positions of distinction, power and importance in areas
 such as politics, business, science, medicine, and the
 arts. As a rule, however, women occupy lower-paying
 positions. Foreign workers, both male and female, who
 usually perform menial functions, usually earn the lowest
 wages and fill the socially less desirable jobs. Belgium
 has provided the basic legal guarantees and the benefits
 of its extensive social security system to many foreign
 workers.
 To confront the longstanding problem of linguistic
 division between the Flemish-speaking north and the
 French-speaking south, detailed provisions have been made
 in law and government structure to assure equitable
 participation in the national life for both major
 linguistic groups. A long-term solution to the linguistic
 community problems remains the priority goal of the
 government, and new legislation to this end was enacted in
 1980.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Varying political, religious, philosophical and
 artistic views are permitted free public expression, and
 there is no political censorship of the media. There are,
 however, prohibitions on publications and productions held
 to undermine "public order" (e.g. pornography and
 incitation of violence). There are laws against libel and
 provisions for a citizens's right of reply to media
 criticism and restrictions on criticism of government
 policies by civil servants. Belgium has a state-owned
 radio and television network, but there is no direct
 government control of program content. Programs are
 supervised by boards of directors which represent the main
 currents of opinion. The government has a representative
 on the boards but no veto power.
 Subject to regulations of public order, political, civic,
 religious, artistic, social and special interest groups
 are permitted free public assembly. Labor unions and
 professional groups are free from harassment and
 persecution. The Chrisitian, Jewish and Moslem religions
 are accorded a "recognized" status in law which entails a
 government subsidy. Minority "non-recognized" religions
 enjoy full freedom to practice and are not-subject to
 harassment or persecution.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within
 the country and internationally, including the right of
 voluntary repatriation. Within a system of immigration
 and labor regulations, Belgium previously admitted a large
 number of foreign immigrants. The granting of resident
 status to non-European Community nationals has become more
 restrictive in recent years due to domestic unemployment.
 As a general practice, Belgium grants the right of
 political asylum to those foreign nationals applying in
 Belgium who are recommended by the local office of the UN
 High Commissioner for Refugees as eligible for asylum,
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all
 citizens. Suffrage is universal for all adults (21 or
 over), secret and compulsory. Unweighted voting (one
 person/one vote) has been in effect since 1919 and women's
 suffrage since 1948. Women are legally equal to men and
 participate freely in political, as well as social and
 economic life, and the number active in these areas is
 growing. In the current parliament 16 out of 212 house
 seats and 21 out of 182 Senate seats are held by women, as
 are 2 of 27 ministerial positions and 2 of 9 state
 secretary (subministerial) portfolios. There are 12
 parties currently represented in the Belgian parliament.
 Opposition parties are free under law and in practice to
 operate without constraints or repression.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Belgian Government's willingness and past record
 regarding independent investigation of alleged human
 rights violations is exemplary. Specifically, the Belgian
 ministry of Foreign Affairs in January 1979 circulated in
 the United Nations a proposal that countries should waive
 
 
 738
 voluntarily the right, conferred on them by Article 6(B)
 of Resolution 1503 , not to consent to the carrying out of
 an investigation concerning human rights. No requests
 have been made for outside investigation of the human
 rights situation in Belgium.
