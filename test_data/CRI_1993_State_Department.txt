 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a well-established, stable democracy with separate executive, legisla-
 tive, and judicial branches. A Supreme Electoral Tribunal is considered a fourth
 branch of government. Elections for president, two vice presidents, and 57 deputies
 to a unicameral Legislative Assembly are held every 4 years; they have been free
 and fair. Rafael Angel Calderon won the February 1990 presidential election, in
 which approximately 80 percent of eligible voters participated. The President is con-
 stitutionally barred from reelection. Members of the Legislative Assembly may be
 reelected but only after at least one term out of office. The next presidential and
 legislative elections will be held in February 1994.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's army. Several government min-
 istries share responsibilities for law enforcement and national security: The Min-
 istry of Public Security includes the Civil Guard, the Crime Prevention Unit, and
 the Antidrug Police; the Ministry of Government includes the Rural Guard and the
 Directorate of Narcotics and Intelligence; and the Ministry of the Presidency has the
 Directorate of Intelligence and Security. The Judicial Police, under the Supreme
 Court, is an investigative force, while the San Jose Metropolitan Police and the
 Transit Police within the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation also have
 limited police functions. Public security forces generally observe procedural safe-
 uards established by law and the Constitution, but there have been occasional inci-
 ents of the use of excessive force by the police.
 Export-oriented businesses, both in agriculture and light industry, lead the Costa
 Rican economy. Economic growth accelerated in 1992 to about 7.3 percent but
 slowed in 1993 to about 6 percent. The right to own private property is protected
 by the Constitution; however, foreign and Costa Rican property owners who have
 had land expropriated for national parks, Indian reserves, or squatters have had
 significant difficulties receiving adequate compensation in a timely manner.
 Costa Ricans enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. Complaints
 of human rights abuse, when they arise, tend to cite delays in the judicial process
 (many prisoners are subjected to lengthy periods of pretrial custody) or discrimina-
 tion against blacks, Indians, and women. The police, particularly the Rural Guard,
 have sometimes used excessive force. There were credible charges that in September
 seven Judicial Police officers tortured and killed a suspected gang member.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Government does not practice,
 abet, or condone political killing, and none was reported.
 Serious charges arose in September, when a suspected member of a gang of
 thieves died while in the custody of the Judicial Police. A subsequent autopsy re-
 vealed that he had been beaten to death. Seven members of the Judicial Police were
 arrested, and an investigation of the incident continued at year's end. All seven
 have been discharged from the police force, and three are under indictment.
 In February 1992 residents of the Talamanca region testified that members of a
 13-man counternarotics Rural Guard unit beat and shot two suspected drug traf-
 ickers. These Rural Guards, known as the "Cobra Command, were also accused
 of mistreating local residents, forcing some to serve as supply- bearers, and assault-
 ing two women. The entire squad was taken into custody when the Judicial Police
 began an immediate investigation. The two commanding officers (charged with com-
 mitting the murders) are under indictment; the other 11 were subsequently re-
 leased.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known or reported incidents of politically moti-
 vated abductions or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. These prohibitions are generally respected in prac-
 tice, but incidents of police mistreatment are sometimes reported.
 Although there was considerable debate over the suitability and adequacy of the
 law enforcement system in 1993, efforts to professionalize the various police agen-
 cies and standardize training had little success. A bill, submitted over 2 years ago,
 to grant career status to the police and set minimum entry requirements contiied
 to languish in the Legislative Assembly.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment in Costa Rica. While physical
 abuse by prison guards is uncommon, a limited number of guards have been impli-
 cated in swindles, robberies, and drug trafficking. Prisoners may bring complaints
 
 
 404
 before the special defense counsel for prison inmates, which will investigate them.
 Especially serious cases are handled by the Office of the Chief Prosecutor.
 Public concern about crowded penitentiaries and the availability of weapons in
 prisons is growing. Occasional rioting is a problem in several large prisons. The
 Government continues to earmark funds to repair or improve the more rundown fa-
 cilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Judicial warrants are required for ar-
 rests and an arraignment before an officer of the court must take place within 24
 hours of arrest. The Constitution entitles detained persons to a judicial determina-
 tion of the legality of the detention. These rights are generally respected, although
 persons charged with serious offenses often remain in pretrial custody for long peri-
 ods due to judicial backlogs. The past 2 years brought some improvement in this
 regard. The number of prisone-s awaiting trial stod at 1,145 at the end of March
 1990; by the end of June 1992, the most recent figures published, it had dropped
 to 688 (as of the end of March 1992 134 prisoners had spent more than 9 months
 in detention without being sentenced).
 The right to bail is provided for by law and observed in practice. Bail is sometimes
 denied to repeat offenders, however, and is usually deniedt foreigners, major drug
 offenders, and terrorists on the assumption they would leave the country before
 coming to trial.
 Generally, detainees are not held incommunicado. With judicial authorization,
 however, suspects may be held for 48 hours after arrest or, under special cir-
 cumstances, for up to 10 days. The judiciary has proven effective at ensuring that
 legal and constitutional safeguards are observed.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and assures a fair
 public trial.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 Its 24 magistrates are elected by the Legislative Assembly to 8-year terms, which
 are automatically renewed unless the Legislative Assembly votes against a renewal
 by a two-thirds majority. Accused persons may select an attorney of their choice.
 Access to legal counsel is guaranteed and honored in practice. The State provides
 counsel to those who cannot afford to hire their own.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reported instances during 1993 of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted
 by, or with the knowledge of, the Government. Judicial warrants are required to
 search private homes, and police seldom fail to comply. Government authorized
 wiretaps remain illegal, pending enactment of implementing legislation by the Leg-
 islative Assembly.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution specifically provides for free-
 dom of speech and press, and these freedoms are respected in practice. Nine major
 privately owned newspapers, several periodicals, 6 privately owned television sta-
 tions, and over 70 privately owned radio stations pursue independent editorial poli-
 cies. The media freely criticize the Government, and there is no evidence of self-cen-
 sorship or governmental intimidation.
 In 1993 the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court expanded press free-
 dom by finding Article Seven of the Press Law unconstitutional. The law had im-
 posed heavy penalties, including jail terms, for those accused repeatedly of libel. The
 revision now requires a separate finding of guilt in each individual case regardless
 of prior legal history. A 1969 law requires journalists to be accredited by the
 government- sponsored journalists' guild. The Calderon administration publicly sup-
 ported the licensing requirement on the grounds that it ensures professionalism.
 An Office of Censorshi rates films and has the authority to restrict or prohibit
 their showing; it has simiar powers over television shows and stage plays. A censor-
 ship tribunal reviews appeals of the office's actions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Constitutional provisions for
 freedom of assembly and association are fully respected. Permits required for pa-
 rades or similar large-scale gatherings are granted routinely; they are not required
 for other public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution and
 generally observed in practice. Foreign missionaries and clergy of all denominations
 work and proselytize freely. Roman Catholicism, however, is the official state reli-
 gion, and Costa Ricans affiliated with non-Catholic groups note that non-Catholic
 churches are required by law to comply with building codes from which Catholic
 churches are exempt. These groups seek remedial legislation. Catholic priests may
 
 
 405
 perform marriages, whereas non-Catholic religious marriages are not valid without
 an additional civil marriage. The current law on career educators stipulates that all
 teachers of religion, including non-Catholic teachers, must be approved by the
 Catholic Church s Episcopal Conference. In July 1991, a number of teachers of reli-
 gion (most of them Catholic) filed suit before the Supreme Court asking that the
 law be overturned. As of the end of 1993, their plea was still pending.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Though there are no restrictions on travel within the country, all citi-
 zens and residents are required to obtain an exit visa before traveling abroad. Emi-
 gration and right of return are not restricted. Costa Rica supports multinational ref-
 ugee programs and has accepted many refugees from Central and South America.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits repatriation of anyone subject to political per-
 secution. Political asylum traditionally has been grantedto exiled dissidents of var-
 ious political orientations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Costa Ricans choose their government through free, open, and competitive elec-
 tions (by secret ballot) every 4 years. The integrity of elections is ensured by the
 independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and election results are respected. The
 Legislative Assembly can and does reject executive branch initiatives. Citizens can
 and do petition their elected representatives for legislative redress and assistance
 with government bureaucracies. Prior to the February 1994 elections, the ruling So-
 cial Christian Unity Party and the opposition National Liberation Party controlled
 29 and 25 seats, respectively, in the 57-member Legislative Assembly. A leftist Coa-
 lition Party held one seat, and two independent provincial parties each held one
 seat.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics. Women are
 underrepresented in leadership positions in government and politics, but this has
 begun to change. There are two women cabinet ministers, three vice ministers and
 six members of the Legislative Assembly. Ten women candidates for national deputy
 have solid chances to win in the February 1994 elections, and a woman is assured
 election as vice president, since both major parties have female candidates.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A 1984 executive order created the Office of Ombudsman for Human Rights, now
 housed in the Ministry of Justice. The Ombudsman's office hears complaints from
 individuals about human rights abuses. As noted above, a similar office considers
 complaints within the penitentiary system. Three nongovernmental groups monitor
 and report on human rights in Costa Rica: the Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights; the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America; and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica. There are also several
 private groups dedicated to assisting refugees.
 A new ombudsman's office, the Defender of the People, opened in October with
 a mandate to look into any perceived human rights abuses committed by public offi-
 cials. The office will concentrate initially on administration of justice, public health,
 and medical administration (malpractice); however, the offices of the Ombudsmen
 for Children and Women are also in the process of being transferred to the new au-
 thority.
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of multilateral and private
 human rights organizations. Both the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights
 and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights maintain their headquarters inSan
 Jose. The Government has invited the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights to visit the country whenever it wishes.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is legally unre-
 stricted. According to the latest Census Bureau statistics, 30 percent of working-age
 women earn wages, as opposed to 79 percent of working-age men, although these
 figures probably underestimate the number of women in the work force due to the
 nature of their employment. The number of female professionals and technical work-
 ers is grwing
 Women an   men are generally paid equally for equal work. In 1990 the Legisla-
 tive Assembly passed significant legislation designed to supplement existing laws
 against sex discrimination. The new law reinforces women's property rights, forbids
 employers from firing a woman for becoming pregnant or adopting children, and r-
 affirms the necessity for institutional safeguards to prevent and punish violence
 
 
 gainst women. Two relatively new government agencies the Justice Ministry's
 women's Defense Counsel and the Government Ministry's Women's Delegation, act
 as advisors and legal advocates for women who have suffered abuse, harassment,
 or discrimination. The White Cross Center, which reports to the Ministry of Public
 Security, was established in 1992 for the specific purpose of investigating and pros-
 ecuting crimes against women and providing temporary shelter for battered women.
 However, owing to a lack of personnel and funds, it has had little impact.
 A recent government-sponsored survey indicated that 78 percent of 1,300 women
 interviewed reported having suffered abuse, either physical or mental, with 35 per-
 cent reporting frequent abuse. (The definition of "abuse" was not reported in the
 survey.) The increase in reported crimes against women may reflect increased atten-
 tion to human rights, making it easier for women to file charges and take advantage
 of social services. Physical abuse of women, including domestic violence is pros-
 ecuted and often results in stringent punishment. Still, many proponents o? women's
 rights want an overhaul of the Penal Code to stiffen penalties and broaden the defi-
 ni 'ion of rape. (Abuse of female minors, for example, is only considered aggrvated
 assault.) There are a number of private organizations, including the Arias Founda-
 tion, that monitor abuse of women, provide counseling, and work to inform women
 of their legal rights.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare
 within the constraints of a limited budget. Although spending has decreased some-
 what in recent years due to continued economic strains the Government has con-
 sistently spent over 4 percent of its gross domestic product on education and over
 5 percent on medical care. This commitment to children has yielded a high rate of
 literacy and a low rate of infant mortality.
 Children are not the victims of any systematic or organized discrimination or ex-
 p loitation, but public awareness of crimes against children has grown. During the
 lirst 3 months of 1993, 625 new cases of the mistreatment or sexual abuse of-chil-
 dren were reported, compared to 203 cases of child sexual abuse for all of 1990 (esti-
 mates are that two-thirds of all abuse is sexual). As with violence against women,
 it is difficult to determine whether the increasing number of cases is due to better
 reporting or reflects an actual increase in the number of such crimes. Legal proceed-
 ings against those who commit crimes against children are hampered by traditional
 family attitudes and the fact that such crimes are treated as misdemeanors.
 Among the governmental programs that provide services and safeguard the rights
 of children are an integrated program for adolescent health, a national guardianship
 for infancy, and a program for abused children. Private organizations that provide
 assistance include the Arias Foundation and Paniamor.
 Indigenous People.-Costa Rica's population of 3.2 million includes some 24,000
 indigenous people. Most live in traditional communities on 21 reserves which, in
 part because of their remote location, often lack access to schools, health care, elec-
 tricity, and potable water. Although hampered by budgetary restraints, the Govern-
 ment is attempting to improve the quality of basic services in the indigenous areas.
 Indigenous people participate in the management of their own affairs through the
 National Indigenous Commission (CONAI), and indigenous leaders continue to urge
 the Government to devote more resources to helping their communities. A serious
 concern is the management and control of natural resources located within indige-
 nous reserves.
 Until quite recently, about 20 percent of indigenous people were undocumented
 and so lacked proof of citizenship. That problem has been all but eliminated by leg-
 islation that helped nearly 7,000 indigenous people obtain identification papers, al-
 lowing them to vote and making it easier for them to obtain credit. A number of
 cases were filed in 1993 with the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights alleg-
 ing discrimination against indigenous people. Most of these cases involved
 actionstaken by CONAI rather than allegations of discrimination by individuals.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities. --Costa Rica's 30,000 blacks, who reside large-
 ly on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of citizenship, including the protection
 of laws against racial discrimination. The 1990-94 Legislative Assembly includes
 one black member. The Government treats all matters of racial discrimination as
 human rights issues; the Office of the Ombudsman for Human Rights received no
 complaints of racial discrimination in 1993.
 People with Disabilities.-Government funding for those with disabilities has been
 limited. Discrimination against those with disabilities is not prohibitedby law, and
 there are no laws mandating access for such persons. Social services that exist func-
 tion primarily as charities, with little emphasis on integration into the larger soci-
 ety. Both governmental and private agencies provide services, among which are the
 Costa Rican Foundation for the Blind, the National Council for Rehabilitation and
 Special Education, and the Costa Rican Federation for the Functionally Limited.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are nominally free to join unions of their
 choosing without prior authorization, although barriers exist in practice. Approxi-
 mately 15 percent of the work force is unionized. Unions are independent of govern-
 ment control and are generally free to form federations and confederations (three
 social democratic labor federations merged in 1991), and to affiliate internationally.
 However the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organiza-
 tions (AFL-CIO), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),
 and other trade union organizations contend that trade unionism's right of associa-
 tion has been hurt by Costa Rica's "solidarismo" (solidarity) movement.
 This movement espouses cooperation between employers and workers, offering
 workers such benefits as credit unions and savings plans in return for their renunci-
 ation of the right to strike and bargain collectively (although, in practice, solidarity
 associations have in the past acted as psuedo- collective bargaining agents). Solidar-
 ity associations are financed in part by employers and are allowed under Costa
 Rican law to offer a range of services and engage in profit-making activities, which
 unions are not permitted to do.
 In November the Legislative Assembly approved a package of reforms to the
 Labor Code that addressed International Labor Organization 13LO) concerns based
 in part on activities of the solidarity movement. These reforms included: reducing
 the number of members necessary to form a trade union to equal that required to
 form a solidarity association; explicitly prohibiting the dismissal of workers who at-
 tempt to organize or join a union; and increasing fines and tightening enforcement
 against employers who violate the Labor Code. A separate reform proposal would
 include a fund ('cesantia") created to provide severance and retirement benefits,
 partially funded by employers but employees could designate the organization which
 would receive the funds. This would enable unions to compete directly with solidar-
 ity associations in a number of service activities. As of the end of the year, the sev-
 erance pay reform had not been approved.
 "Permanent workers' committees" made up of members of solidarity associations
 have entered into 'direct agreements" with their employers, sometimes in order to
 stop attempts by an established union to negotiate a collective bargaining pact. In
 June 1991, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association concluded a 2-year in-
 vestigation and ruled that management's use of solidarity and the associations' in-
 volvement in trade union activities (such as collective bargaining) were violations
 of freedom of association. The 1993 package of labor code reforms included a provi-
 sion explicitly prohibiting solidarity associations from participating in collective bar-
 gaining or direct agreements affecting labor.
 Strikes and labor unrest increased somewhat but remained at a low level in 1993.
 There are no restrictions on the rights of private workers to strike, but the Labor
 Code contains clauses that employers have used to fire employees who try to orga-
 nize or strike. Very few private sector workers are union members, and there were
 no notable private sector strikes in 1993. Costa Rican law restricts the right of pub-
 lic sector workers to strike, but two articles of the Penal Code that mandated tough
 punishment for striking government workers were repealed by the Legislative As-
 sembly in June. The Government has indicated that it will present a new law to
 the Legislative Assembly that would guarantee organization and collective bargain-
 ing rights to all public sector workers and afford the iight to strike to public work-
 ers who are not in "essential services" as defined by the ILO. Public sector labor
 disputes produced a scattering of demonstrations and brief strikes, notably one that
 occurred in late summer andcaused minor disruptions in social services, particu-
 larly in classrooms due to the participation of teachers' unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize is pro-
 tected by the Constitution. Specific provisions of the labor code reforms provide pro-
 tection from dismissal for union organizers and members during the period of union
 formation. In a separate decision in October, the Constitutional Chamber of the Su-
 preme Court ruled that Costa Rica's ratification of ILO Convention 135 in 1977 pro-
 tects union leaders from being fired without cause. These two events greatly en-
 hanced legal guarantees for workers seeking to organize. Previously, employers used
 a clause in the Labor Code, permitting employees to be discharged "at the will of
 the employer provided the employee received severance pay, to fire labor organiz-
 ers. Currently mandated severance pay equals 1 month's salary for every year
 worked, up to a total of 8 years. The payment of severance benefits to dismissed
 workers has often been circumvented in practice. Public sector workers cannot en-
 gage in collective bargaining because the Public Administration Act of 1978 makes
 aor law inspplicable in relations between the Government and its employees.
 Collective bargaining is allowed in the private sector but, due to the dearth of
 unions, is not a widespread practice. All labor regulations apply to the country's
 
 
 nine export processing zones (EPZ's). Labor Ministry oversight of labor regulations
 within the EPZ's is limited, however, by a lack of manpower and resources.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there are no known instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution provides special
 employment protection for women and minors and establishes the minimum work-
 ing age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers under 15. A child
 welfare agency, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, is responsible for enforce-
 ment. Enforcement in the formal sector is reasonably effective. Nonetheless, child
 labor appears to be an integral part of the large informal economy and there were
 scattered reports of children being employed in export industries. (These incidents
 appear to be isolated and do not represent an industry-wide pattern.)
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the right to a mini-
 mum wage. A National Wage Board, composed of three members each from govern-
 ment, business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. The
 monthly minimum wage ranges from $111 (16,829 colones) for domestic servants to
 $540 (81,501 colones) for certain professionals. Pay can and does exceed the set
 amounts. The Board usually meets at the beginning and middle of each year. While
 violations sometimes occur, the wage and salary levels are generally respected. The
 minimum wage set in November was to take effect on January 1, 1994 for the pri-
 vate sector. Public sector negotiations, based on the private sector minimum wage,
 were still under way at year's end. Workers at the low end of the wage scale often
 find it difficult to maintain an acceptable standard of living, whether they have a
 family to support or not, and must spend an inordinate percentage of their pay on
 basic human needs such as food.
 The Constitution sets the workday hours, remuneration for overtime, days of rest,
 and annual vacation rights. It requires compensation for discharge without due
 cause, although this provision is often circumvented in practice. Maximum work
 hours are 8 during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours,
 respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not considered unhealthful or
 dangerous, but weekly totals may not exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers re-
 ceive an overtime premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work in excess of the
 daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not paid overtime, however, if they work
 beyond their normal hours voluntarily. There is little evidence that employers coerce
 such overtime from employees.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This law requires indus-
 trial, agricultural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a
 management-labor committee and allows the Government to inspect workplaces and
 to fine employers for violations. Most firms required to set up such committees have
 followed the letter of the law, but often little effort is made to utilize the committees
 or turn them into effective instruments for improving the workplace. Workers have
 the right to leave work if conditions are dangerous. In practice, however, workers
 who leave the workplace may find their jobs in jeopardy unless they file a written
 complaint with the Labor Ministry. There are too few labor inspectors, especially
 outside the capital, to ensure that minimum conditions of safety and sanitation are
 maintained.
