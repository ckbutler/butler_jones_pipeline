 HONDURAS
 Honduras has been ruled by two successive military
 governments since 1972. The legislature has been
 suspended since then. Freedoms of the press, religion, and
 emigration are respected. During 1977 there were
 almost no reports alleging violations of the integrity of
 the person, such as arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 invasion of the home, inhuman punishment, or violations
 of the independence of the judiciary. There is
 no known group engaged in terrorism or insurgency.
 The final political arbiter in Honduras is the
 Superior Defense Council (SDC).  Interest groups
 such as trade unions, peasant federations, and other
 private sector organizaions have a significant impact
 on government policy formulation. The Chief of State
 has fostered and institutionalized private sector
 participation through the device of advisory commissions
 on various subjects. One of the most significant
 of such commissions, representing a spectrum of
 Honduran groups, drafted an Electoral and Political
 Organization Law which was reviewed by the SDC and
 approved by the Cabinet in December 1977. The law provides
 for the return to electoral government in 1979, with
 participation of various political parties, registration
 procedures to avoid fraud, and other characteristics
 of a pluralistic democracy. The present Government-
 has also embarked since 1975 on an ambitious development
 plan emphasizing social services in rural areas.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No reports of torture have been received in recent years.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been instances of mistreatment by local
 police, usually confined to pushing and shoving which
 may be the result of poor training and individual
 excesses. There have been some incidents of harassment
 of social workers, including priests. There is
 
 (177)
 
 
 no indication that any of the above treatment is
 condoned by the Government.
 In 1975, peasant unrest and occupation of unused, but
 cultivable land in remote, rugged, and isolated Olancho
 Province led to confrontation between landowners and
 peasants, resulting in the death of a number of peasant
 leaders and others. The landowners were apparently
 supported by some military officers in the area although
 there is no indication that the latter were acting
 on government orders. Incidents involving abuse of
 peasants, particularly in the more remote areas, may
 have occurred in connection with eviction of squatters
 from private land. However, the Honduran military and
 police have generally avoided undue force in removing
 squatters. No other cases of serious mistreatment
 of peasants or others are known. Exile is not employed
 as a punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although some campesino leaders were briefly held
 following the 1975 Olancho incident, they were soon
 released. On the other hand, several land owners and
 military officers were arrested and are still in prison
 in Tegucigalpa pending announcement of the court's
 verdict in their trial. No reports of arbitrary arrest
 or imprisonment were received during 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally considered fair. The Honduran
 judiciary is independent of the executive branch.
 Honduran law provides for arraignment shortly after
 arrest. Any delays which may occur appear to be due
 to administrative inefficiency, not deliberate violation
 of the law. Just before Christmas 1977, the Government
 declared a pardon for common criminals which will
 fully or partially commute sentences or pretrial detention
 after individual review of each case. This pardon was
 apparently based in part on the Government's recog-
 nition that there are often inordinately long delays
 because the court system is overburdened. Access to
 legal process for redress of grievances varies according
 to the socio-economic status of the individual,
 particularly in rural areas. Trials are held in
 
 
 judges' chambers with the parties to the trial and
 their attorneys present.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 No reports of invasions of the home have been received
 in recent years.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The objectives of the Honduran five-year Development
 Plan (1975-79) are to integrate the rural poor into
 the national economy and to increase social services
 in rural areas. The Development Plan has moved
 forward in agrarian reform and land distribution.
 There is a national program for expanding basic health
 care and family planning services in rural areas through
 construction of 500 health posts by 1980 and training para-
 medics to staff them. The Government also has increased
 its budget for primary school teachers and has financed
 the construction, on a pilot basis, of low-cost rural
 housing.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of the press and of religion are respected
 in Honduras. Political parties cannot hold public
 demonstrations but are allowed to hold publicized
 internal elections and to publish declarations which are
 often critical of government policies. Otherwise
 freedom of speech and assembly are respected.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within Honduras. Citizens
 are also free to travel and emigrate except for
 restrictions at some border crossings because of
 the 1969 border war with El Salvador.
 
 
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Since a coup in 1972, the military has exercised
 power and the legislature has been suspended. Currently,
 a number of.advisory councils to the Chief of State
 are functioning, with the participation of various
 political groups.
 One of the main councils is preparing for elections
 which have been promised for 1979. A new electoral
 law providing for participation of some small parties
 as well as the two major parties was promulgated in
 December 1977. Political parties have already begun
 to revive and articulate their platforms.. Labor unions
 are free to organize and engage in concerted activity
 to achieve economic objectives. They are particularly
 strong and active in the northern banana plantation
 regions.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 In May 1976, an Amnesty International investigative
 mission to Honduras "enjoyed the full cooperation of the
 goverment" according to Amnesty. No other requests
 for investigation have been reported. Honduras has
 ratified the American Convention on Human Rights.
