 ALGERIA
 Aftr gaining independence in 1962, Algeria had a single-party state dominated
 by the country's military leadership and supported by the bureaucracy and the Na-
 tional Liberation Front (FLN). The FLN's rule ended in 1992 with the resignation
 of President Chadli Benjedid and the dissolution of the FLN-dominated Parliament.
 President Liamine Zeroual, a former general, was elected in November 1995 to
 a 5-year term. Zeroual had previously served as president of a transition govern-
 ment established by the army in 1994. The President controls defense and foreign
 policy, appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, and may
 dissolve the legislature. The presidential election was competitive. Three opposition
 candidates had some access to state-controlled television and radio and also received
 heavy coverage in the independent press. Zeroual received 61 percent of the votes
 according to government figures; losing candidates claimed that there were in-
 stances of fraud but did not contest Zeroual's victory. Algeria has not had an elected
 parliament since January 1992. In 1994 the military-backed Government appointed
 a National Transition Council as a surrogate parliament. The President pledged to
 hold new parliamentary elections in the first half of 1997.
 Under the 1989 Constitution, there was to be a transition to a pluralist republic
 with a strong president. The democratization process was suspended in 1992 when
 the Army forced the President to resign, canceled the second round of parliamentary
 elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, and installed
 a ruling five-man High State Committee, which banned the FIS and jailed more of
 its leaders. The cancellation of the elections in 1992 escalated fighting between the
 security forces and armed Islamist groups seeking to overthrow the Government and
 impose an Islamic state.
 In May the President began reviewing with legal opposition parties a memoran-
 dum containing his ideas on how to develop a political system. These included
 amending the Constitution to define acceptable political practices and to establish
 a second parliamentary chamber (a senate). The President also insisted the electoral
 andpoitical party laws be changed. In September several important opposition po-
 parties joined with the  esident to sign a national charter encompassing
 these ideas. In November the Government obtained approva of proposed changes
 to the Constitution, including provision of a second parliamentary chamber and
 greater presidential authority, in a flawed popular referendum.
 The Government's security apparatus is omposed of the a rmy, air force, navy, the
 national gendarmerie, the national police, communal guards (a local police), and
 local self-defense forces. All of these elements are involved incounterinsurgency and
 counterterrorism operations. The security forces were responsible for numerous seri-
 ous human rights abuses.
 The economy is slowly developing from a centrally planned system to a more mar-
 ket-oriented system, in the wake of stabilization policies and structural reforms un-
 dertaken in 1994 and 1995. The pace of structural reform slowed in 1996. Uncom-
 petitive and unprofitable state enteprises constituted the bulk of the industrial sec-
 tor. The state-owned petroleum sector's output represented about a quarter of na-
 tional income and about 95 percent of export earnings in 1996. Algeria is a middle-
 income country whose annual per capita income is about $1,700. Unemployment
 continued to rise in 1996, hitting young people especially hard. About 70 percent
 of persons under the age of 30 could not ind adequate employment. Some made a
 livingfrom petty smuggling or street peddling.
 Although the Government's human rights performance improved somewhat, there
 were continued serious human rights abuses. The security forces carried out
 extrajudicial killings, were responsible for numerous cases of disappearance, rou-
 tinely tortured or otherwise abused detainees, and arbitrarily arrested and held in-
 communicado many of those suspected of involvement with armed Islamist groups.

 Although the Constitution provides for an independent judiciary recent executive
 branch decrees have restricted some of the judiciary's authority. Poor prison condi-
 tions, lengthy trial delays, illegal searches, and infringements on citizens' privacy
 rights also remained problems.Th~ne Government heavly ensored news about secu-
 rity incidents and the armed groups. The Government also continued to restrict
 freedm of speech, press, assembly, and movement. During the November constitu-
 tional referendum, there were no independent observers at the polling stations dur-
 ing the vote or the ballot counting. Political parties opposing the constitutional
 amendments were denied access to the electronic media, and their activitists suf-
 fered occasional government harassment. The Family Code limited women's civil
 rights, while domestic violence against women remained a serious problem.
 Armed groups and terrorists also committed numerous serious abuses, killing
 thousands of civilians. Armed Islamists have conducted a widespread insurgency
 since elections were canceled in January 1992. Although some areas of the country
 saw less conflict in 1996 that heretofore, acts of terrorism were still numerous.
 Islamist groups targeted government officials and families of security service mem-
 bers. They also assassinated political and religious figures, businessmen, teachers,
 journalists, state enterprise workers, farmers, and children. Armed Islamists tar-
 getwomen s         Xpeciall; there were repeated instances of kidnaping and rape. Bombs
 Ieft in cars, cafes, anmarkets killed and maimed people indiscriminately. By year's
 end, most commonly accepted casualty estimates were that 60,000 people had been
 killed during 5 years of turmoil.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were fewer credible reports
 that security forces killed persons suspected to be members or sympathizers of
 armed groups. According to an Algerian human rights organization, in August a
 group of sal-defense force members killed 21 civilians outside of Boufarik. An Alge-
 rian human rights organization credibly reported that in September a communal
 guard killed the parents of a suspected terrorist in Draa Ben Khedda after the
 guard 'a father was murdered. There was also a credible report that security forces
 a dozen members of an armed group trying to surrender in a western Alge-
 rian province in June.
 Human rights activists also stated that manypersons arrested by poie died in
 custody. For example, police took a young man from his Algiers home in January;
 his family learned that his bedy was atthe Algiers morgue the following day. Nei-
 ther the police nor other government authorities have explained how he died.
 _ The Government maintains that the security forces resort to lethal force only in
 the context of armed clashes with terrorists . The Government also contends that as
 a matenr of policy disciplinary action is taken against soldiers or policemen who are
 guilty of violating human rights, and this occurred in some cases. In September the
 Government put a group of slf-defense force members on trial in Blidai on charges
 of wrongly killing 5 persons in May. In December a Tipaza court found guilty two
 policemen for torturing a young man in Tipaza; the officers received suspended sen-
 tences. There were no other reports of action or serious sanctions taken against se-
 curity force members for killings or other human rights abuses.
 Armed  roups targeted both security force members and civilians. Terrorists at-
 tacked civilians whom they regarded as instruments of the State or whose lifestyles
 they considered in conflict with Islamic values. Sometimes they killed in the course
 of armed robberies or to enforce local protection rackets. Some terrorist bombings
 seemed intended only to create social disorder by causing a high number of civilian
 casualties without any aparent concern for the particular target.
 The terrorist Armed slamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for dozens of mur-
 ders, including the killing of seven rench monks in June. Terrorist targets included
 current and former government officials, businessmen, teachers, doctors, and farm-
 ers. An official from the  eamas Movement, a legal Islamst party, was murdered
 at Ksr Al-Boukhari in January, while an official reom the former Communist Party
 was killed in May. Three men murdered a French-language teacher in a classroom
 in front of her students in elida in March. Also in March terrorists killed six textile
 clant workers near Tizi Ouzou because the workers' villages had organized local de-
 ense groups. Armed men shot and killed a popular singer in Constantine in Sep-
 tembr. Ther   s     re instancs throughout the year of terrorists stopping buses
 and cars and murdering civilian passengers. In some cases the victims apparently
 were murdered merely because they were young men of draft age eligible for mili-
 tary service. In April an armed group assaulted the village of Larbaatache east of
 Algiers and reportedly killed 60 persons, including women and children. There were
 
 
 1223
 a series of massacres in Blida, Tipaza, and Boumerdes provinces during November
 and December.
 Terrorist bombs also killed hundreds. In some cases, the terrorists targeted gov-
 ernment buildings. In others they sought to retaliate against the families of mem-
 bers of the security services by exploding car bombs outside their homes. In January
 a bomb planted in a mosque in Barakikilled six persons. Another bomb killed the
 Bishop of Oran in August. The Algiers region suffered from a series of cafe bomb-
 ings during the summer. Terrorists also left bombs at several street markets during
 the year;, one such bomb in Boufarik killed 17 persons in September. Since 1993 at
 least 59 journalists have died in terrorist attacks; at least 9 were killed during the
 of the journalists klled in 1996 died in a February car bombing of the
  ss Bulding in Algiers, along with 12 other persons (see Section 2.a.). Ter-
 rrists also murdered a well-known Algerian news photographer, a reporter for the
 national television station, sad a bradcaster for Algerian Radio. Many journalists
 had to change their addresses every few days to make themselves less accessible
 targets. Over 120 foreigners have been killed since 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-The government-affiliated National Observatory of Human
 Rights (ONDH) received reports of about 50 cases of disappearance in 1996, down
 substantially from the 116 received in 1995. The ONDH did receive some responses
 to its inquiries about disappearance cases from 1996 and previous years. Some of
 these cases involved arrests by security forces, others involved persons kidnaped by
 armed groups and still others involved persons who fled to join armed groups.
 These resolved cases represented only a small fraction of the total number of cases;
 the great majority remained unresolved. An independent Algerian human rights
 group said in December that it had 400 outstanding cases of persons arrested who
 have disappeared since 1992.
 Independent human rights groups in Algeria had no specific total for 1996, but
 they also suggested that there were fewer cases of disappearance than in previous
 years. Armed men in uniforms took away an electrician named Mourad in Algiers
 in July in a vehicle clearly marked "security;" the family was unable to verify if or
 where he was being held. A man named Hakim was arrested in April by men in
 uniforms and taken away in the type of vehicle normally used by Defense Ministry
 elements, but his family could obtain no official confirmation of Haki's detention.
 An electrician was arrested ad taken from his home in Algiers by men in uniform
 in September, but his family could obtain no further information on his where-
 abouts. Families of 14 persons arrested by men in uniforms during a security force
 sweep of the district of Le Chevalier in March also could not obtain any news of
 their relatives. The Government asserted that terrorists disguised as security forces
 pepedtrated numerous incidents.
 Terrorist groups kidnaped hundreds of civilians, including famiy members of s-
 curity service members. Sometimes the mutilated corpses of such victims were later
 found. In many other instances, however, the victims disappeared, and their fami-
 lies could obtain no information about their fate
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or 1Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution and legislation ban torture and other cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment. However, according to human rights groups and lawyers, the po-
 lice regularly resort to torture when interrogating persons suspected of involvement
 in or of having sympathies with armed Islamists. There were several credible re-
 ports of torture at the Algiers police facility called Chateau Neuf. Rachid Mesli, a
 defense lawyer for the Fh was detained in August; he had severe bruises on his
 face and arms when he apperd for his first Algiers court hearing. There also were
 credible reports that an Islamist p arty activist and his wife were arrested and tor-
 tured in Setif in March. Security forces reportedly tortured residents from the town
 of Belaoudi during interrogations in the midst of a sweep for armed groups in July.
 There were repeated reports that police applied to prisoners a technique called
 "Le Chiffon," in which a cloth soaked in noxious fluid was put in the victim's mouth.
 There were also reports that the police applied electric shocks to sensitive body
 parts. Poice beatings of detainees appeared to be ommon.
 Many victims of torture hesitate to make public allegations due to fear of govern-
 ment retaliation. The Interior Ministry in 1992 said that it would punish those who
 violated the law and practiced torture, but it has never revealed whether any of
 those responsible for torture have been punished. In its 1996 report, the ONDH
 stated that there had been complaints of torture in the Government's campaign
 against terrorism. It also pointed to a connection between incommunicado detention
 and allegations of torture. The ONDH called on the Government to put an end to
 torture of detainees, noting that such practice hurt the credibility of the State.
 Armed groups also committed abuses, including frequent beheadings and dis-
 menIberment of their victims. There were frequent reports of young women being
 
 
 1224
 abducted and repeatedly raped, often for weeks at a time. The terrorists sought to
 justify this sexual abuse by referring to it as "temporary marriage," but all other
 observers, including Islamic scholars, uniformly condemned the practice as rape.
 Prison conditions are poor and prisons are very overcrowded. According to human
 rights activists, cells often contain several times the number of prisoners for which
 the originally were designed. Medical treatment for prisoners is also severely lim-
 ited. The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or deten-
 tion centers by groups such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 or Amnesty International (AI).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. It stipulates that incommunicado detention in criminal cases
 prior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 charged or released. According to the Antiterrorist Law of 1992, the police may hold
 suspects in prearraignment detention for up to 12 days; they also must inform sus-
 pects of the charges against them.
 However, the security forces routinely exceed the lawful detention limit in prac-
 tice. The 1996 ONDH report noted that detainees frequently are held incommuni-
 cado much longer than allowed by law. In the spring, there were credible reports
 from three villages in Jijel province that Communal Guard forces arrested persons
 suspected of sympathies with armed groups and detained them at Guard barracks.
 The most prominent case involving a prisoner held incommunicado was FIS vice-
 president Ahl Benhad; his family has heard nothing about him since mid-1995 de-
 spite repeated approaches to the Justice Ministry by Benhadi's lawyers.
 The ONDH report and human rights activists also stated that court judges could
 not exercise effective control over the police to ensure that the law was applied con-
 sistently.
 The Antiterrorist Law of 1992 suspended the requirement that the police obtain
 warrants in order to make an arrest. During the year, the police made a few broad
 nighttime sweeps of neighborhoods in the Algiers suburbs in search of suspected ter-
 rorists and often detained suspects without identifying themselves. In some cases,
 they purposely arrested close relatives of suspected terrorists in order to force those
 suspects to surrender. In June the police arrested a 69-year old woman named
 Daouia in Constantine in order to compel her son, wanted for involvement in an
 armed group, to surrender. As of late fall, the family was unable to determine where
 the woman was being held.
 According to the ONDH, there are several hundred persons awaiting trial on secu-
 rity-related charges. Other human rights groups allege that the number is much
 higher. The 1996 ONDH report stated that 12,000 persons were serving prison sen-
 tences after being convicted of security-related offenses; an independent Algerian
 human rights monitoring group put the number at 40,000. In both estimates, how-
 ever, many-if not most-of those being held were allegedly involved in acts of vio-
 lence. There were cases, however, which clearly appeared political. For example,
 Abdelkader Hachani, a senior FIS official, has been imprisoned since January 1992
 without trial. Similarly, lawyer All Zouita has been held since 1993 despite a court's
 acquitting him in 1993 of aiding a terrorist group; he has never been tried on other
 charges.
 Persons accused of crimes sometimes did not receive expeditious trials. During the
 year, the Government arrested hundreds of state enterprise officials on charges of
 corruption. Only a few have received a trial. The rest remained in detention. Mid-
 level officials from an Annaba State Enterprise accused of corruption staged a hun-
 ger strike in August to protest their 6 months of detention without trial.
 Under the state of emergency, the Minister of Interior is authorized to detain sus-
 pects in special camps administered by the army. The Government closed the last
 camp in November 1995, and announced that it had released the 641 prisoners
 there, although there were subsequent reports that some were rearrested later. The
 Government and other sources contended that some persons released from this pris-
 on had joined armed groups.
 Exile is not a legal orm of punishment and is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. In practice, however, the Government does not always respect the independ-
 ence of the judicial system.
 The National Judges Syndicate publicly charged several times during the year
 that the executive branch was interfering in matters that pro erly belong to the ju-
 dicial system. It cited a Justice Ministry order of March that enied judges the right
 to release provisionally those accused of corruption without approval from the Min-
 istry. The Government did not retaliate openly against the National Syndicate after
 it made these charges. However, the authorities prevented the Syndicates's leader-
 
 
 1225
 ship from convening a syndicate meeting in Algiers in December and reportedly en-
 couraged the emergence of new syndicate leadership.
 The judiciary is composed of the civil courts, which try misdemeanors and felo-
 ries, and military courts, which have tried civilians for security and terrorism of-
 fenses. There also is a Constitutional Council which reviews the constitutionality of
 treaties, laws, and regulations. Although the Council is not part of the judiciary, it
 has the authority to nullify laws found unconstitutional.
 The Government in 1995 abolished the Special Security Courts which human
 rights observers had contended did not provide defendents fair trials. Regular crimi-
 nal courts now try those accused of security-related offenses, but there have been
 very few actual trials.
 According to the Constitution, defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 uilt. The        riht to confront their accusers and may appeal the conviction.
 y hav e t e fn   hav   the rg
 na   are public, and  efen       t     ert to legal counseL. However, the au-
 thorities do not always respect all legal provisions regarding defendants' rights.
 Lawyers defending state enterprise managers accused of corruption in Annaba with-
 drew from the case afer the Interior Ministry refused to share the evidence gath-
 ered against the managers as the law stipulates. Seie lawyers would not accept
 cases of those accused of security-related offenses, due to fear of retribution from
 the security forces. Defense lawyers for members of the FIS have suffered harass-
 ment, denth threats, and arrest (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.).
 There are no credible estimates of the number of political prisoners. An unknown
 number of persons who may be onsidered poltical prisone ere serving prison
 sentences or detained without charge because of their Islamist sympathies and
 membership in FIS (see Section 1.d).
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, but the State of Emergency
 authorizes provincial governors to issue exceptional search warrants at any time.
 Security forces oft entered residences without warrants. The security services also
 deployed an extensive network of secret informers against both terrorist targets and
 political opponents. The Government monitored telephones and sometimes discon-
 nected service to political opponents (see Section 3). Security forces detained rel-
 atives of suspects to try to compel the suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 There were credible reports that people had to leave their homes dlue to the Gov-
 ernment's antiterrrist operations. In the spring, communal  ards forced the evac-
 uation of at least one small village in Jijel province in the mit of a security sweep.
 There were additional reports that Communal Guard forces blocked the supply of
 food and water to several villages in Jijel untl they ageed to form self-defense
 forces. During the summer, gendarmerie forces compelled the residents of a village
 near Larbaa to abandon their homes when they refused to organize a self-defense
 force.
 Armed Islamists routinely entered private homes either to kill or kidnap residents
 or to steal weapons, valuables, or food. In early 1996, armed groups kidnaped all
 of the daughters of several families in Jijel province. Armed Islamist groups consist-
 ently used threats of violence to extort money from businesses and families across
 Algeria.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of
 speech, but a 1990 law specifies that such speech must respect "individual dignity,
 thecimperatives of foreign policy, and the national defense.  The state of emergency
 decree gave the Government broad authority to restrict these freedoms and to take
 legal action against what it considered to be threats to the State or public order.
 In March 1994, the Government issued, an interministerial decree that independent
 newspapers could print security information only from official government bulletins
 carried by the government press service APS.
 In February the Interior Ministry reminded newspapers of the existing require-
 ment that only APS bulletins about security incidents and the armed groups could
 be published. In September President Zeroual reiterated that the Government would
 restrict information about security incidents.
 Compliance with the Government directive varied among independent news-
 papers, but they ra rey  ported information about security force losses. The Gov-
 ernment seized some newspapers f      oroting whatrit tconsidered sensitive informa-
 tion. For example, in April an issue o Al-atan was seized at the printers when
 it carried an unauthorized story about a massacre at Larbaatache. Similarly, the
 Interior Ministry blocked two issues of Al-Acil, printed in eastern Algeria, in June,
 for allegedly trying to publish information about security incidents.
 
 
 1226
 The Government's definition of security information often extended beyond purely
 military matters to encompass broader political affairs. The Interior Ministry
 blocked publication of the weekly La Nation three times in February and March for
 articles which, it alleged, justified terrorism. However, one issue's articles were re-
 prints of articles about human rights already printed in the French newspaper Le
 Monde Diplomatique. The Interior Ministry seized an issue of the weekly Al-
 Houriya in March when it tried to publish an article about the history of political
 assassination in Algeria. In May the Interior Ministry briefly jailed two journalists
 from the weekly political satire Al-Mesmar and then banned the paper permanently.
 In June the Interior Ministry brought charges of defamation against an Al-Watan
 journalist after she wrote about corruption at the Oran Customs Administration; the
 Oran court convicted her. The Government closed the independent daily La Tribune
 in July after the paper carried a cartoon that the Government alleged defamed the
 Algerian flag; an Algiers court decision in September suspended the newspaper for
 6 months. The Government also revoked the credentials of the Spanish correspond-
 ent of the Madrid daily El Pais because of its dissatisfaction with his analysis of
 the security situation. In December the Government again seized an issue of Al-
 Houriya, although it never explained why. Al-Houriya's editor presumed the seizure
 stemmed from his effort to publish a story about a book published in France about
 Algeria's human rights situation.
 The Interior Ministry cautioned newspapers to avoid printing interviews with offi-
 cials from the banned FIS. In 1995 FIS officials who had been freed from detention
 in 1994 received direct orders from the Justice Ministry to make no further public
 statements. This ban remains in force.
 Journalists at independent newspapers often avoided printing stories about the
 security situation and Islamist groups in order to avoid difficulties with the Govern-
 ment. The Government frequently sanctioned journalists who wrote offending arti-
 cles by putting them under judicial control. This required them to check in regularly
 with the local police. It also prevented them from leaving the country. The ONDH
 stated in February that the Government should apply this measure less routinely.
 The independent press remained free to criticize economic and social policy broad-
 ly, but the Interior Ministry and the ourts often retaiated against newspapers that
 accused specific officials of policy failures or crimes. The editor in chief of Al-Watan
 was cnvic"ted and fined for defaming the Health Minister in March after the news-
 paper alleged that he did not ontrol wasteful spending by the Ministry. The editor
 of E1-Kilaa was jailed briefly in May after his newspaper pointed out that the gov-
 ernor of Tebessa did not attend a local province ceremony as expected. The Interior
 Ministry charged journalists from La Nation and its fellow weekly Ach-Chourouq
 with defamation after they wrote exposes about the internal maneuvering of the
 National Liberation Front in May. In general, journalists exercised self-censorship
 by not publishing specific criticism of specific officials.
 President Zeroual in a September press conference said that the problems con-
 fronting the press resulted from market forces, not censorship. However, the Gov-
 ernment maintained an effective monopoly of printing companies and newsprint im-
 ports and blocked a UNESCO grant to establish a private printing press.
 The Government also tightened controls over vital newspaper advertising reve-
 nues, centralizing in April all state companies' advertising decisions in a single state
 agency called ANEP. (This advertising is crucial in an economy in which state com-
 panies' output and government services still represent approximately two-thirds of
 national income.) M   P provided significant amounts of advertising to particular
 publications with an antislamist editorial line and that did not undertake inves-
 tigations of corruption. Other newspapers with different editorial policies received
 very little or no advertising, even though they had a larger national readership and
 sometimes even offered cheaper advertising prices. For example, the anti-Islamist
 newspapers L'Authentique and Le Matin received much more advertising than did
 L'Opinion or El Al-Alem As-Siyasi newspaprs, even though the latter two news-
 papers had about the same circulation and     a   vertising p ries.
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies. Opposition political parties occasionally were
 able to present their points of view, but these appearances represented only a small
 fraction of the total radio and television broadcast time. Satellite dish antennas are
 widespread, and millions of citizens have access to European and Middle Eastern
 broadcasting.
 Armed groups continued to target journalists of both the government-controlled
 and independent media. The February bombing against the Main Press Building
 was the most visible incident, but at least 9 journalists were murdered during the
 year (see Section L.a.).
 
 
 1227
 
 Many artists, intellectuals, and university educators fled Algeria after widespread
 violence began in 1992 being especially fearful of Islamist terror. Few returned in
 1996. As a result, there were few aademic seminars and colloquia, although there
 appeared to be more in 1996 than in 1995. The Government did not interfere with
 nonpolitical seminars it did sometimes with those that were more political in con-
 tent. For example, it banned seminars that an Algerian youth group sought to hold
 to discuss human rights (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of assembly and association, but the 1992 Emergency Law sharply cur-
 tails these freedoms. Citizens and organizations must obtain a permit from the ap-
 pointed local governor before holding public meetings.
 The Government had a mixed record of permiting public meetings during the
 year. The local Algiers authorities refused permission for a labor union in March
 to protest wage cuts in February. They also banned a sit-in by a nongovernmental
 organization called The Children of War Martyrs to protest social conditions. An-
 other nongovernmental organization, The Rally for Youth Action, sought permission
 to hold seminars on human rights in June and on democracy in October, but both
 were denied. The Algiers authorities did permit a rally in front of the Main Press
 Building in support of freedom of the press in July, however. In addition the Social-
 ist Forces Front obtained approval for a public rally in downtown Algiers in Septem-
 ber. In December political parties and a coalition group called the "Call for Ieace"
 sought permission to hold marches and meetings, but all requests were refused.
 The authorities' record outside Algiers also was mixed. During the first half of the
 year, some legal Islamic parties could not obtain approval to hold public meetings
 in the provinces of Setif, Khenchala, and Tebessa. During the second half of the
 year, however, the local authorities granted permission to these same parties. The
 legal Islamist party An-Nahda could not obtain authorization for a rally in Algiers
 during the autumn. The Socialist Forces Front also sometimes could not obtain au-
 thorization for party rallies during the year. At various times throughout the year
 Interior Ministry officials sought to gather names of political party activists, and
 sometimes they summoned activists briefly to police stations to question them about
 their activities.
 The Rally for Youth Action was able to hold human rights conferences in western
 Algeria and in the Kabylie region east of Algiers, but police later detained its activ-
 ists in Oran and Bejaia temporarily.
 The Interior Ministry licenses all nongovernmental associations, and regards all
 associations as illegal unless they have licenses. It may deny a license to, or dis-
 solve, any group regarded as a threat to the existing political order. After the Gov-
 ernment suspended the parliamentary election in 1992, it banned the FIS as a polit-
 ical party, and the social and charitable groups connected to it. Membership in the
 FIS is illegal.
 According to a 1989 law all citizens except judges, army, and security service per-
 sonnel, and members of the Constitutional Council have the right to join political
 organizations. The Government was rewriting this law late in the year to bar some
 other government employees in positions of authority from joining political organiza-
 tions. There were several political groups, including some centrist Islamist parties,
 such as Hamas and Al-Nahdah, which were able to conduct political activities,
 though not with complete freedom. Other associations include specialized groups
 such as human rights and women's rights groups, social welfare groups, and region-
 ally-based cultural organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion
 but prohibits discrimination based on religious belief. The Government respects this
 right in practice. It permits the small Christian and Jewish populations to practice
 their faiths without interference.
 The Government appoints preachers to mosques and gives general guidance on
 sermons. The Government monitors activities in mosques for possible security-relat-
 ed offenses.
 Conversions from Islam to other religions are rare. Because of security worries
 and potential legal and social problems, Muslim converts practice their new faith
 clandestinely. The Family Code prohibits Muslim women from marrying non-Mus-
 lims, although this is not always enforced. The Code does not restrict Muslim men
 from marrying non-Muslim women.
 In 1994 the GIA declared its intention to eliminate Jews, Christians, and poly-
 theists from Algeria. The Christian community, composed mostly of foreigners, cur-
 tailed its activities. Some church workers left the country because of GIA tbreats.
 During 1996 the GIA kidnaped and killed seven Roman Catholic monks in central
 Algeria. The Catholic Bishop of Oran also was murdered at his home.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of domestic and forei , travel and free-
 dom to emigrate. The Government generally respects these provisions. It lifted the
 remaining nighttime curfew i1    provinces in Februar. It has, however, placed
 some journalists under 'judicial control' that does not  ow them to leave the coun-
 try (see Section 2.a.). In addition the Government does not allow foreign travel by
 senior officials from the banned FIS. The Government also does not permit young
 men who are eligible for the draft and have not yet completed their military service
 to leave the country if they do not have special authorization; this authorization can
 be granted to students and to those with special family circumstances. The Family
 Code does not permit women under 19 years of age and boys under the age of 18
 to travel abroad without their husband's or father's permission.
 Under the state of emergency, the-Interior Minister and the provincial governors
 may deny residency in certain districts to persons regarded as threats to public
 order. The Government also restricts travel into four southern provinces where
 much of the hydrocarbons industry and many foreign workers are located in order
 to enhance security in those areas.
 The police and the communal guards operate checkpoints throughout Algeria.
 They routinely stop vehicles to inspect identification papers and search for evidence
 of terrorist activity. They sometimes detain persons at these checkpoints.
 The GIA in February warned young Algerians of draft age not to travel across
 the country on pain of death for collaboration with the Government. Armed groups
 establish temporary roadblocks in various regions, including the capital, to rob trav-
 elers of cash and vehicles or to kill them. According to credible reports, they some-
 times massacred groups of civilian passengers at these roadblocks (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum, and the Government
 occasionally grants asylum. The Government cooperates with the office of the Unit-
 ed Nations High Commissioner for Refugees        CR  and other humanitarian or-
 ganizations in assisting refugees. It also provided first asylum. For example, it co-
 operates with the U  CR   on programsto help refugee Sahrawis, the former resi-
 dents of the Western Sahara who left that territory after Morocco took control of
 it in the 1970's. The Government also has worked with international organizations
 helping the Tuaregs, a nomadic people of southern Algeria and neighboring coun-
 tries. Some refugees came from Mali to escape fighting in the northern part of that
 country. There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 President Zeroual was elected in a November 1995 presidential election, officially
 winning 61 percent of the votes cast; there is no elected legislature. The presidential
 campaign was generally freely contested. Three opposition candidates representing
 a spectrum of viewpoints had access to both the independent press and the govern-
 ment-controlled media, including radio and television. Their parties were permitted
 to hold rallies across the country, and they had authorization to send observers to
 polling stations. There was an independent election commission to supervise the
 election process, but the opposition parties complained that it did not carefully re-
 view complaints it received about the conduct of the election.
 Legislative elections have been announced for the first half of 1997. The now-
 banned FIS and the Socialist Forces Front won a majority of votes cast in the first
 round of the last legislative election in December 1991. In 1992 the Army forced the
 President to resign, canceled the second round of parliamentary elections which the
 Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, and installed a ruling five-man
 High State Committee, which banned the FIS and jailed more of its leaders. In 1994
 the military-backed High Council of State appointed delegates to a National Transi-
 tion Council, which still acts as a surrogate legislature to ratify legislation proposed
 by the President. Some opposition parties have representatives on the Council, but
 their numbers do not reflect any proportional electoral base. Several opposition par-
 ties rejected the President's offer to join the Council.
 The President called a popular referendum in November to amend the Constitu-
 tion, and 79 percent of the voters approved the changes, according to the Govern-
 ment. There were no independent observers at the polling stations during the vote
 or the ballot counting. Political parties opposing the constitutional amendments suf-
 fered occasional harassment by local government officials and could not obtain ac-
 cess to the electronic media, which is government-controlled.
 Under the new Constitution, the President has the authority to rule by decree in
 special circumstances. The President must subsequently submit to the Parliament
 for approval decrees issued while the Parliament was not in session. The Parliament
 
 
 1229
 
 will henceforth have a popularly elected lower chamber and a Senate, two-thirds of
 whose members will be elected by municipal councils. The President will appoint the
 remaining one-third of the Senate's members. Legislation must have the approval
 from three-quarters of both the upper and lower chambers' members to be made
 law. Laws must originate in the lower house.
 The President also proposed changing the law regulating political parties. Under
 the proposed new law, parties will need official approval from the Interior Ministry.
 To obtain approval, they will also have to have 25 founders from across Algeria.
 Parties may not seek to utilize religion, Brbrism, or Arabism for political pur-
 poses.
 The existing political parties represent a wide spectrum of viewpoints and engage
 in activities ranging from holding rallies to printing newspapers. However, they
 sometimes encounter difficulties when dealing with local officials who hinder their
 organizational efforts (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government monitored private telephone communications and sometimes dis-
 connected telephone service to political opponents for extended periods (see Section
 1.f.). Opposition parties have very limited access to state-controlled television and
 radio, but the independent press publicizes their views without difficulty (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.).
 There is only one woman in the Cabinet, and there are few others in senior gov-
 ernment positions. There are several women on the National Transition Council.
 About 25 percent of the judges are women, and this percentage has been growing
 in recent years. Only about 1 percent of the candidates in the 1991 legislative elec-
 tions were women, and none of the four candidates in the 1995 presidential election
 was a woman. However, a woman heads a workers' party and a woman was the
 1995 presidential campaign spokesperson for one of the candidates. The major polit-
 ical parties have women's divisions. The Government changed the electoral law in
 1995 to ensure that women cast their own ballots, rather than to permit their hus-
 bands or fathers to vote for them, as frequently happened in previous elections.
 Women voted in large numbers in the 1995 presidential election.
 The Government does not ban political participation by any ethnic minority group.
 The Berbers, an ethnic minority centered in the Kabylie region of Algeria, partici-
 pate freely and actively in the political process. The Berber-populated region of Al-
 geria has given birth to two political parties, the Socialist Forces Front and the
 R ally for Culture and Democracy. These two Berber-based parties will have to con-
 form with changes in the new party law that stipulate that political parties have
 25 founders from across Algeria.
 Independent Berber associations tried in vain to obtain approval to hold con-
 ferences about the Berber language in Batna in July and in Ain Beinan in Septem-
 ber. The local governor in the Berber city of Bejaia, however, allowed a major rally
 in September (see Section 2.b.). The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, do not play
 as important a role in politics, due in large part to their small numbers, estimated
 in the tens of thousands, and their nomadic existence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The most active independent human rights group is the Algerian League for the
 Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) which has members throughout Algeria. The
 LADDH president is a lawyer who speaks out publicly about the general human
 rights situation. In 1996 the LADDH brought some cases to the attention of the au-
 thorities without effect. The LADDH is not allowed access to the authorities or to
 sons beyond the normal consultations allowed between a lawyer and client. Mem-
 rs of the LADDH have suffered harassment. Telephone service of their President,
 for example, was intermittently disrupted, and he and other LADDH activists re-
 ceived death threats from unidentified callers.
 There are two other human rights groups in Algeria. The Alierian League for
 Human Rights (LADH), an independent organization based in Constantine, is less
 active. The LADH has members throughout Algeria who follow individual cases. It
 issued a report on the human rights situation in April. The other organization, the
 National Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH), is a government-affiliated body
 which was established by the Government in 1992. The ONDH is mandated to re-
 port human rights violations to the authorities. It prepares an annual report with
 recommendations to the Government. The 1996 report highlighted murders commit-
 ted by terrorist groups but made no mention of killings by government forces. It did,
 however, recognize violations of the law regarding detention of prisoners. It also rec-
 ommended that the Government reduce the frequency with which it places journal-
 ists under judicial control (see Section 2.a.).
 
 
 1230
 There is an Amnesty International (AI) chapter in Algeria, but it does not work
 on cases in Algeria. An AI team of foreign human rights monitors came to Algeria
 during the year. The team moved around freely; however, it was not allowed to visit
 prson   The Government has extended an invitation to the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Execu-
 tions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on birth, race, sex, belief, or any
 other personal or social condition. However, women continue to face legal and social
 discrimination.
 Women.-Women's rights advocates assert that spousal violence is common, but
 there are no reliable studies regarding its extent. There are no laws to protect
 women from spousal rape or abuse. Battered women must obtain medical certifi-
 cation of the physical effects of the attack before they lodge a complaint with the
 police. According to women's rights advocates, fewer than half of the women at-
 tacked visit doctors for such certification. They also assert that the police and courts
 are lenient with men accused of beating their wives. Women's rights groups had
 great difficulty drawing attention to spousal abuse as an important social problem.
 Some aspects of the law, and many traditional social practices, discriminate
 against women. The 1984 Family Code, based in large part on Islamic law or
 Shari'a, treats women as minors under the legal guardianship of a husband or male
 relative. A woman must obtain a father's approval to marry, for example. Divorce
 is difficult to obtain except in cases of abandonment or the husband's conviction of
 a serious crime. Husbands generally obtain the right to the family home in the case
 of divorce. Custody of the children normally goes to the mother, but she cannot en-
 roll them in a particular school or take them out of the country without the father's
 authorization.
 The Family Code also confirms the Islamic practice of allowing a man to marry
 four wives--a rare occurence. However, a wife may sue for divorce if her husband
 does not inform her of his intent to marry another wife prior to the marriage. Only
 males are able to confer citizenship on their children.
 Women suffer from discrimination in inheritance laws; in accordance with Shari'a
 they are entitled to a smaller portion of an estate than male children or even a de-
 ceased husband's brothers. Women under 19 years of age cannot travel abroad with-
 out their husband's or father's permission (see Section 2.d.).
 Social pressure against women pursuing higher education or a career is strong.
 Women comprise only 8 percent of the work force. Nonetheless, women may own
 businesses and enter into contracts; they pursue opportunities in government, medi-
 cine, law, education, the media, and even the armed forces. The 1990 Labor Law
 bans sexual discrimination in the workplace, but Labor Ministry inspectors do little
 to enforce this law.
 During the year, Islamic extremists often specifically targeted women. For exam-
 ple, they killed wives of members of security forces and female French language
 teachers (see Section L.a.). Armed Islamist groups reportedly kidnaped some young
 women in remote areas and kept them as sex slaves for group leaders (see Section
 1..).
 There are numerous small women's rights groups. Their main gals are to foster
 women's economic welfare and to amend aspects of the Family Law. No such
 amendments have yet been passed.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting children's
 human rights. It provides free education for children 6 to 15 years of age and free
 medical care for all citizens-albeit in often rudimentary facilities. The Ministry of
 Youth and Sports has programs for children, but these face serious funding prob-
 lems. Legal experts maintain that the Penal and Family Codes do not offer children
 sufficient protection. Hospitals treat dozens of cases of child abuse every year, but
 many cases are unreported. Laws against child abuse have not led to notable pros-
 ecutions against offenders.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Public enterprises,
 downsizing the work force, generally ignore a law that requires that they reserve
 1 percent of their jobs for people with disabilities. Social Security provides for pay-
 ments for orthopedic equipment, and some nongovernmental organizations do re-
 ceive limited government linancial support. The Government also tries to finance
 specialized training, but this remains rudimentary.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Berbers are an ethnic minority, cen-
 tered in the Kabylie region. Berber nationalists have sought to maintain their own
 
 
 1231
 
 cultural and linguistic identity while the Government's Arabization program contin-
 ues. As part of the National Charter signed in September, the Government and sev-
 eral major political parties agreed that the Berber culture and language were one
 of the components ol Algerian identity. The Charter did not meet the demands of
 some political groups that Barber be made an official language. In 1995 the Govern.
 ment established a commission to study bow to promote t aching of the Berber lan-
 guage, and some elementary and high schools in the Kabylie region and Algiers
 started teaching it. However, schooi administrations decided to suspend these
 courses in September because they lacked qualified teachers and an approved cur-
 riculum. There are professorships in Berber language and culture at the University
 of Tizi Ouzou. The government-owned national television station began broadcasting
 a brief, nightly news program in Berber in May. Berbers hold influential positions
 in Government, the army, business, andjournalism.
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber orgin, live a nomadic existence and are relatively
 few in number.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to establish trade unions of
 their choice. About two-thirds of the labor force belongs to unions. There is an um-
 brella labor confederation, the Union Generale Des Travaileurs Algeriens (UGTA),
 which dates from the era of a single political art and its affiliated entities. The
 UGTA encompasses national syndicates specialized by sector. There also are cur-
 rently some autonomous unions, such as a Syndicate of Air Algerie Pilots, another
 for airport technicians, and another for teachers in the Kabylie.
 Workers are required to obtain government approval to establish a union. The
 1990 Law on Labor Unions requires the Labor Ministry to approve a union applica-
 tion within 30 days. Early in 1996 a second labor confederation, the Autonomous
 Syndicates Confederation (CSA), tried to organize the autonomous syndicates, but
 it did not gain wide support for this effort. It made its application to the Labor Min-
 istry in September 1995 but had not received its approval by the end of 1996. It
 was allowed to function without official status.
 The law prohibits unions from associating with political parties. The law also pro-
 hibits unions from receiving funds from foreign sources. The courts are empowered
 to dissolve unions that engage in illegal activities. The labor union organized by the
 banned FIS, the Syndicate Islamique Des Travailleurs (SIT), was dissolved in 1992
 because it had no license.
 Under the state of emergency, the Government is empowered to require workers
 in both the public and private sectors to stay at their jobs in the event of an unau-
 thorized or illegal strike. According to the 1990 Law on Industrial Relations, work-
 ers may strike only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitra-
 tion. This law states that arbitration decisions are binding on both parties. If no
 agreement is reached in arbitration, the workers may legally strike after they vote
 by secret ballot to do so. A minimum of public services must be maintained during
 public sector service strikes.
 The UGTA staged a 2-day general strike in February to protest the Government's
 decision to cut wages. This was the first nationwide general strike since 1991, but
 there were approximately 400 local strikes in 1994 and about 200 in 1995. The num-
 ber of local strikes appeared to decrease further in 1996, but teachers in the Kabylie
 region staged a strike in April, textile workers staged a strike in March, and the
 pilots of Air Algerie held a series of strikes n August and September. University
 teachers staged a strike that lasted from October through the end of the year. With
 the exception of the pilots' and university teachers' strikes, most work stoppages
 ended quickly with mediation between company management and the unions. The
 Government did not invoke the state of emergency to block strikes. Some companies,
 such as Air Algerie, filed injunction appeals in court to prevent strikes. The courts
 upheld the companies' motions, and thereby denied the right to strike in these in-
 stances, in apparent contravention of the law.
 Air Algerie in September fired several dozen pilots who went on strike in August.
 It claimed that it did so for financial reasons. Most of the pilots' syndicate organiz-
 ers lost their jobs. Air Atgerie later offered all strikers their jobs again, but only
 for 1-year contracts, providing much less security A  their previous permanent po-
 sitions.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations, affiliate with inter-
 national labor bodies, and develop relations with foreign labor groups. The UGTA,
 for example, has contacts wit   rench unions and the American Federation of
 Labor-Congress of Industrial Oranizations.
 b. The Right to Organize anu Bargain Colectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaiing for all unions. The Gover ent permits this right to be practiced.
 
 
 1232
 
 The UGTA engaged in several rounds of negotiation with the Government over wage
 issues. It won concessions in February talks over the issue of salary deductions and
 it represented workers again in three-way discussions with the Government and
 business associations in September.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiumon
 practices by employers. It also permits unions to recruit members at the workplace.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 prohibits compulsory labor, and the Government effectively enforces the ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce the minimum employment
 age by making periodic or unannounced inspection visits to public-sector enter-
 p rises. They do not effectively enforce the law in the agricultural or private sectors.
 Economic necessity compels many children to resort to informal employment, such
 as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law defines the overall framework for ac-
 ceptable conditions of work but leaves specific agreements on wages, hours, and con-
 ditions of employment to the discretion of employers in consultation with employees.
 The Government fixes by decreee a guaranteed monthly minimum wag for all sec-
 tors. The minimum wage is $87 (4,500 dinars) per month. Ministry of Lbor inspec-
 tors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum wage regulations,
 although their enforcement is inconsistent.
 Algeria has a 44 hour workweek and well developed occupation and health regula-
 tions codified in a 1991 decree. Government inspectors do not enforce these regula-
 tions effectively. There were no reports of workers being dismissed for removing
 themselves from hazardous working conditions.
