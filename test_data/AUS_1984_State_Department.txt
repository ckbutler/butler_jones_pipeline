 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a multiparty parliamentary democracy operating
 within a federal system of government. Federal elections were
 held in December 1984.
 Australia has an industrial economy with important mining and
 agricultural sectors. Most Australians enjoy a high per
 capita income. Government programs provide economic support
 for the relatively disadvantaged elements of the population.
 Individuals are free to hold private property, to pursue their
 economic interests, and to organize trade unions.
 The Australian Government has supported immigration into
 Australia and has also taken a very large number of refugees
 in proportion to its population. As a result, the Australian
 population now has a mixture of European, Middle Eastern, and
 Asian ethnic groups.
 In 1984, the Government established a task force on Federal
 Human Rights Legislation within the Attorney-General's
 department. The task force is considering a National Bill of
 Rights, based on the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights, to which Australia is a party; changes to
 the role and enforcement powers of the Australian Human Rights
 Commission; and substantive changes to the Racial
 Discrimination Act.
 Racial discrimination is prohibited by law. Protection of the
 rights of Australia's 180,000 Aboriginals is a demonstrated
 concern of the Government, which recognizes they are the most
 disadvantaged group in Australia. During 1983-84 the Federal
 Government provided more than $304 million for Aboriginal
 advancement programs. Land rights for Aboriginals and
 protection of Aboriginal sacred sites remain issues of
 controversy. The Federal Government in 1984 passed interim
 legislation regarding sacred sites and remains committed to
 some form of national land rights legislation.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. The Government makes a major effort to
 investigate reports of discrimination and to implement fully
 laws protecting the individual. In 1984 a Federal anti-sex
 discrimination law was passed, implementing Australia's 1983
 Ratification of the United Nations Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 Internationally, Australia has been active in promoting human
 rights in the United Nations Human Rights Commission--to which
 Australia was elected for a three year term beginning January.
 1985, the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous
 Populations, and other forums. The Government regularly
 raises human rights issues in both bilateral and multilateral
 discussions, and has established a special human rights
 section in the Department of Foreign Affairs.
 Australia has supported Amnesty International's campaign to
 end torture. The Government has been actively involved in
 negotiations to conclude an International Convention Against
 Torture and has contributed to the United Nations Voluntary
 Fund for the Victims of Torture.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 killings in 1984 by either the Government or by domestic
 opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced. Australian law
 prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment, and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 Abuse of prisoners and use of excessive force by police are
 not condoned, and there are adequate procedures to deal with
 offenders. Prison and detention facilities provide adequate
 shelter, food, and medical care. Prisoners' families and
 lawyers are allowed freely to visit them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and
 this prohibition is respected in practice. Arrested
 individuals must be brought before a magistrate without undue
 delay. Writs of habeas corpus are available to ensure that
 persons are not arrested without charges being brought against
 them promptly and to guarantee their right to apply to the
 courts for release pending trial. Preventive detention is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to both a fair hearing and
 a fair public trial with an unimpeded right of counsel. These
 guarantees are observed in practice. Public assistance is
 available for those unable to pay for legal counsel.
 Defendants must be promptly informed of charges and have
 pretrial access to evidence against them. Defendants are
 entitled to call and cross-examine witnesses and are protected
 against self-incrimination and double jeopardy. Australians
 are protected by law against ex post facto criminal
 prosecutions. The Australian judiciary is independent.
 Judges remain in office until retirement or resignation.
 Civilians are tried in civil courts and have the right of
 appeal to higher courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. With
 authorization from the judiciary, the Australian Federal
 Police may make use of listening devices in national security
 and narcotics investigation. Australia is a nation of liberal
 political traditions and common law, and the Government does
 not interfere in the private lives of individuals.

 AUSTRALIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is guaranteed in law and respected
 in practice. While there is a government-owned television and
 radio network administered by the independent Australian
 Broadcasting Corporation, private enterprise is dominant in the
 media. Opposition parties are completely free to express their
 viewpoints. Parliamentary debates are broadcast in full on the
 radio and there is no political censorship of media, books, or
 artistic works. There is full academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed in Australia, but some state
 laws provide for limitations in cases where public safety may
 be imperiled. For example, in Western Australia, the Police
 Act, as amended, requires that advance permission be obtained
 from the Commissioner of Police or an authorized officer before
 a procession or a public meeting can be held in a public
 place. The Commissioner may not withhold permission unless he
 has reasonable grounds to believe the meeting will imperil
 public safety. Only infrequently has permission to hold a
 meeting at a specific place been denied because of concern
 about public safety. In Queensland, laws governing street
 marches have led to occasional confrontations between the
 police, civil rights activists, and aboriginal activists.
 Australians are free to form and join private associations,
 including labor unions. About 55 percent of Australia's labor
 force is unionized. Australia operates under a centralized
 system of arbitration and conciliation commissions and
 industrial tribunals. Registration of employer and employee
 organizations is not compulsory but registered associations
 enjoy certain rights and privileges. Australian unions
 exercise considerable influence on the policies of the federal
 and state governments, both on industrial relations and other
 public issues. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) currently
 forming the Federal Government, was created by the trade union
 movement. Organized labor in Australia has great influence.
 The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) is an affiliate
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICPTU). Australian employer organizations, the ACTU, and the
 Government are active participants in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion. There is no established
 church. There are no restrictions on religious activities or
 membership or on missionaries or conversion. Australians are
 completely free to maintain links with coreligionists abroad.
 Religious publishing is freely allowed, subject only to the
 same Post Office registration procedures for all periodicals.
 Some Aboriginals adhere to traditional Aboriginal religion,
 which is without an organized structure but sees the world as
 full of signs of nature's intent towards men. In 1984 the
 Federal Government enacted the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
 Islander Heritage (interim protection) Act as an interim
 
 
 705
 AUSTRALIA
 measure to protect and preserve significant Aboriginal sacred
 sites and objects. Protection of sacred sites remains a
 controversial issue, with continuing confrontations between
 some Aboriginal groups and developers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Australia has been in the forefront of countries accepting
 refugees for resettlement. It has resettled more than 93,700
 refugees from Indochina. In addition, Australia has welcomed
 significant numbers of refugees from elsewhere in the world,
 including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.
 The Migration Act was amended in 1984 to remove distinctions
 between Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth non-Australian
 citizens in matters of deportation. A Passport Amendment Bill
 was passed in 1984 prohibiting the issuance of Australian
 passports to non-Australian citizens, thus removing the favored
 treatment of British subjects who are not Australian citizens.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change their Government
 Australians participate in their government by electing a
 two-chamber parliament. Voting is compulsory for Australians
 18 and over. On December 1, 1984, a national election was
 held. It resulted in the re-election of Prime Minister Hawke's
 Labor Party, but with a smaller majority than it had won in the
 1983 national election. State electoral procedures are set by
 each individual state.
 Legislation was implemented in January 1984 removing the right
 of British subjects who are not Australian citizens, and not
 already on the electoral rolls, to vote in Australian Federal
 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Australia has ratified the International Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is the
 Government of Australia's policy to respond to any
 communication it might receive from the United Nations
 Secretary General alleging violations of human rights in
 Australia. In addition, Australia is once again a member of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits all
 forms of racial discrimination based on color, race, ethnic
 background, or place of birth. The Australian Human Rights
 Commission, established in 1981, investigated 467 complaints
 under the Racial Discrimination Act in 1984. The Commission is
 charged with promoting the observance of human rights by
 monitoring Commonwealth laws and regulations, hearing
 complaints, and making recommendations to the Government. The
 Commission is authorized to cooperate with state governments on
 human rights matters under state jurisdiction. In 1984 the
 Commission actively considered how best to deal with race-
 hatred propaganda and racial defamation. The Government
 
 
 706
 AUSTRALIA
 introduced the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
 Bill late in 1984 which would replace the current Human Rights
 Commission with a commission with expanded powers, particularly
 concerning discrimination in the workplace. The 1984 Amnesty
 International Report had no entry on Australia. Freedom House
 in its 1984-85 report lists Australia as 'free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Australia is an affluent country, enjoying one of the highest
 living standards in the world. In 1982 the per capita gross
 national product was $11,145. In 1984 the infant mortality
 rate was 8.9 per thousand live births. Life expectancy at
 birth was 74.6 years in 1984. Australia's 1984 population of
 15,462,000 was growing at the rate of 1.3 percent a year.
 While there have been no comprehensive surveys in recent years
 on adult illiteracy, recent findings suggest that 3 to 4
 percent of Australians from an English-speaking background may
 be illiterate. Almost all Australians have access to a safe
 water supply; only in some extremely remote regions is access
 to safe water a hardship due to the great expense in
 transporting it. About 28.17 percent of the 1983-84 Federal
 budget was devoted to social security and welfare. Basic food,
 shelter, health care, education, and social security benefits
 are guaranteed for the entire population, including recent
 immigrants.
 In 1984 Australia passed anti-sex discrimination legislation,
 giving effect to the United Nations Convention Against All
 Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which Australia ratified
 in 1983. The legislation outlaws discrimination on the grounds
 of sex, marital status and pregnancy in the areas of
 employment, accommodation, education, the provision of goods
 and services, the disposal of land, activities of clubs and the
 administration of Commonwealth laws and programs.
 Women comprise 37 percent of the Australian labor force. In
 1983 44 percent of women aged 15 and over participated in the
 paid labor force. Although women are beginning to enter jobs
 previously occupied only by men, they remain concentrated in a
 narrow range of predominantly female occupations characterized
 by low pay and low status. Nearly two-thirds of women are
 employed in only three occupational groupings: clerical, sales
 and service, sports and recreation. Full-time unemployment
 rates are higher among women than men. Average weekly
 full-time ordinary earnings for Australian women were 80
 percent of male earnings in 1983.
 In 1984 the Government launched a voluntary affirmative action
 pilot program involving 31 major Australian companies and
 universities with almost a quarter million employees. The aim
 is to improve women's position in the work force by ensuring
 that discriminatory practices or traditions are reviewed and
 removed. An affirmative action resource unit was established
 in the Office of the Status of Women to assist participants in
 the pilot program. In 1981 women comprised 45 percent of total
 undergraduate university students and 29 percent of the
 technical and further education enrollment.
 The Government acknowledges that the Aboriginal population of
 about 180,000 is the most disadvantaged group in such areas as
 education, housing, health, and employment. The Government has
 a broad range of programs aimed at providing Aboriginals
 services available to other Australians, plus additional
 
 
 707
 AUSTRALIA
 services to improve their socioeconomic conditions. The
 question of land rights on Aboriginal reserves is one of
 continuing controversy in Australia. The Federal Government is
 committed to a consistent national approach to land rights and,
 although legislation has not yet been introduced, continuing to
 consult with state governments, developers, and Aboriginal
 communities. In 1984 an Aboriginal was appointed the first
 Aboriginal Secretary of the Federal Government's Department of
 Aboriginal Affairs.
 Australia participated as an observer in the United Nations
 Working Group on Indigenous Populations. At the group's third
 annual meeting in 1984, the Australian Government stated its
 support in principle for a new international convention setting
 international standards for the protection and promotion of the
 rights of indigenous populations.
