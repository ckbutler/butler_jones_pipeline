 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 The Kyrgyz Republic became independent in 1991. Although the 1993 Constitu-
 tion defines the form of government as a democratic republic with substantial civil
 rights for its citizens, the President, Askar Akayev, continues to dominate the Gov-
 ernment. First elected President by the Kyrgyzstan Supreme Soviet in 1990, he was
 reelected in the first open, multicandidate presidential election in December. In Feb-
 ruary a new two-chamber Parliament was elected with a large number of candidates
 contesting each seat. The Constitution defines the role of Parliament, but in 1995
 did not divide responsibility between the two houses. Both Parliament and the Con-
 stitutional Court, which began operating in June, are fairly weak in practice.
 Law enforcement responsibilities are divided between the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs (MVD) for general crime, the State Committee on National Security (GKNB)
 for state-level crime and the procurator's office for both types of crime. The NIVD
 and GKNB both deal with corruption and organized crime. These organizations have
 inherited much of their personnel and infrastructure from their Soviet predecessors.
 Each appears to be under the full control of the Government and must conform their
 actions to the law. Kyrgyzstani borders are manned by Russian troops under an
 agreement with the Russian Federation. The Government has little authority over
 these troops, who often enforce their own rules rather than Kyrgyzstani law.
 The Kyrgyz Republic is a poor, mountainous country with a predominantly agri-
 cultural economy. Cotton, wool, tobacco, and meat are the main agricultural exports.
 Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, and hydro-electricity. The Govern-
 ment has carried out progressive market reforms. Following a successful stabiliza-
 tion program, which lowered inflation and stabilized the currency, attention is turn-
 ing toward stimulating growth. About half of the government's stock in enterprises
 has been sold. Production fell severely since the breakup of the Soviet Union but
 by mid-1995 began to level off as exports increased. There are signs that the econ-
 omy may begin to resume growth. The level of hardship continues to be very high
 for pensioners, the unemployed, and government workers whose salary is in arrears.
 Foreign assistance plays a significant role in the country's budget.
 The basis for participatory democracy has been established. The Government gen-
 erally respected the human rights of its citizens. Citizens enjoy basic rights of free-
 dom of speech, assembly, and religion. However, there were problems in some areas.
 Principal problems included occasional attempts by the Government to interfere
 with the press and restrictions on the right of people to freely change their govern-
 ment. The President successfully sued two journalists for slander under criminal
 rather than civil statutes. Open, multicandidate presidential elections were held in
 December. President Akayev was reelected with wide support over two opposing
 candidates. He used government resources and state-owned media to carry out his
 campaign. Three opposition candidates were deregistered shortly before the election,
 and two opposition campaign workers were imprisoned for aIlegedy passing out
 leaflets that libeled the President. Other human rights problems included executive
 branch domination of the judiciary (with concomitant lack of protection against arbi-
 trary detention and assurance of fair trial). Prison conditions remained poor. Con-
 
 
 917
 
 cerns about ethnic discrimination persisted, but in general the situation for minori-
 ties improved and emigration rates have fallen.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 enployed them.
 Prison conditions are poor but not so bad as to constitute cruelty. Spouses and
 lawyers have been allowed to visit the two imprisoned campaign workers in Issyk
 Kul but local human rights activists could not. GKNB detainess are kept in a
 GKB detention facility; if convicted, they are sent to a regular prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The judicial system continues to operate
 under Soviet laws and procedures. The procurator's office determines who may be
 detained, arrested, and prosecuted. The Mfinistry of the Interior, the GKNB, and the
 General Procurator's office carry out investigations. Since 1990 anyone arrested or
 charged with a crime has the right to defense counsel. The procurator's office, which
 is responsible for the investigation, often nominates the defease counsel, who is re-
 quired to visit the accused within the first 3 days of incarceration. However, some-
 times the accused first sees defense counsel only when the case comes to trial.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain a suspect for up to 72 hours
 before releasinghim or charging him with a crime. The procurator must issue an
 arrest warrant befor the person can be detained. If the procurator elects to charge
 a suspect, he must immediately so advise defense counsel. The accused usually re-
 mains in detention while the procurator investigates the case and prepares it for
 court. At the procurates discretion, he may keep the accused in pretrial detention
 for up to 1 year, but there are provisions for conditional release before trial. After
 1 year, the procurator must release the accused or ask the Parliament to extend the
 period of detention. Since independence, there have been no known instances in
 which Parliament extended a detention.
 The procurator, not the judge, is in charge of criminal proceedings. The courts are
 widely perceived as a rubber stamp for the procurator and not a protector of citi-
 zens' rights. In addition, abysmally low judges' salaries have led to the apparently
 well-grounded view among the population that decisions can be bought easily.
 Economic crimes such as tax evasion, or embezzlement or theft of government
 property, are common, and most managers of state-owned enterprises are believed
 to have committed them. Prosecution or these crimes, however, is relatively rare
 and sometimes appears to be directed at opponents of the Government. For example,
 a case brought and dropped this year against the head of the Kyrgyzstani stock ex-
 change waslelieved to be politically motivated.
 On December 22, two days before the Presidential elections, the head of the cam-
 paign of opposition candidate Sherimkulov and another campaign worker were ar-
 rested in Issyk Kul Oblast while campaigning. They were charged with libeling the
 President by allegedly handing out leaflets defaming President Akayev. Their col-
 leagues deny that they had any leaflets and claim the prosecutor has failed to
 roduce any leaflets as evidence. By year's end, the men had not been released on
 bail and were, along with 30 supproters, carrying out a hunger strike.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, the court system remains largely unreformed, and the executive
 dominates the judiciary. Cases are tried in local courts. Appeals courts are on a dis-
 trict or regional level, and the Supreme Court is the highs  level. The Constitu-
 tional Court began operations in June. There are also arbitration courts that handle
 civil disputes and traditional courts that handle low level crime in rural areas.
 Once the procurator is ready, he brings a case to court and tries it before a judge
 and two people's assessors (pensioners or citizens chosen from labor collectives). The
 accused and defense counsel have access to all evidence gathered by the procurator.
 They attend all proceedings, which are generally pubic,a  are allowed to question
 witnesses and present evidence. Witnesses do not recapitulate their testimony be-
 fore the court; instead they affirm or deny their statements in the procurator's fies.
 Defendants in criminal cases are treated in a demeaning manner by being kept in
 cages in the courtroom.
 The court may render one of three decisions: innocent, guilty, or indeterminate
 (the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation). Both the defendant
 
 
 918
 and the procurator may appeal the verdict to the next higher court or to the General
 Procurator's office. However, the decision of a court to return a case to the procu-
 rator for further investigation may not be appealed, and the accused is returned to
 the procurator's custody and may remain under detention. The Court of Appeal may
 review lower court decisions whether or not a party to the decision has appealed.
 Changes to the lower court's decision frequently result in the imposition of a more
 severe penalty, almost invariably so in criminal cases.
 The Government has recognized the need to reform the system. Western practices,
 including the presumption of innocence of the accused, have been introduced. How-
 ever, a deteriorating economy and a system staffed largely by Soviet-trained officials
 continued to impede reforms.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key positions in the judicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz that the system is arbitrary and unfair, and that the
 courts treat Kyrgyz more leniently than members of other groups. Although system-
 atic discrimination is not clearly evident, it is credible in some cases.
 For most of the year, there were no political prisoners. However, in December two
 campaign workers for a candidate for the Presidency were arrested on charges of
 libeling the President and inciting ethnic tension. The charges relate to material
 contained in pamphlets allegedly distributed by the two. They remain in jail, with
 requests for release on bail denied. No trial date has been set (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the
 occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected by law. The law requires the
 General Procurators's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes, interception of mail,
 and similar procedures. However, a change in the law weakened these protections
 by allowing the procurator to give approval for searches over the telephone. In such
 cases there is then no written proof that a search was approved. Furthermore, in
 certain cases law enforcement officers may conduct a search and then get approval
 within 24 hours afterwards. If approval is not given, any evidence seized is inadmis-
 sible in court, but the search still may be made.
 Personnel and organizations responsible for violations of these privacy rights dur-
 ing the Soviet period have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and
 systematic violations of the privacy of citizens were reported. Some citizens active
 in politics or interested in human rights believe that the privacy of their commu-
 nications was violated. Credible evidence is not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A 1992 law calls for freedom of the press and
 mass media but also provides guidelines proscribing publication of certain informa-
 tion. The law supports the right of journalists to obtain information, to publish with-
 out prior restraint, and to protect sources. However, it also contains provisions that
 the Government has used to restrict press freedom. For example, the law prohibits
 publication of material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or
 religious groups; desecration of national norms, ethics, and symbols like the national
 sealanthem, or flag;, publication of pornography and propagation of "false informa-
 tion." The law also states that the press should not violate the privacy or dignity
 of individuals. It requires all media to register with the Ministry of Justice and to
 await the Ministry's approval before beginning to operate.
 Fully independent newspapers and magazines exist in the capital, as well as a
 few hours of independent television broadcasting and some independent radio sta-
 tions. Almost all electronic media and a significant portion of print media are still
 government supported. The Government continues to influence media coverage. The
 only overt antipress actions this year have been presidential lawsuits for slander
 against newspaper editors and reporters. The President successfully sued two edi-
 tors of the independent newspaper Res Publica after the newspaper published an
 editorial claiming that President Akayev had foreign property and bank accounts.
 The allegations were not proved, and the two editors were found guilty of publishing
 false information which hbeled the President. They were sentenced to 18 months in
 prison and barred from practicing journalism for that period. The prison sentences
 were suspended at the request of the President. The editors have appealed the con-
 viction. The first Appeal Court upheld the conviction, and it is now  eing  pealed
 to the Supreme Court. In November upon returning from Moscow, a meical doctor
 who is a human rights activist was arrested and charged with libel for writing an
 article published in Res Publica in June. He was released on bail and is awaiting
 trial. While living in Moscow he claimed to be in exile since he faced arrest on re-
 turning home.
 
 
 919
 The presidentially created Council on the Activities of the Mass Media continued
 to dampen journalistic freedoms. At least two journalists received warnings from the
 Council to cease writing certain types of artic es. Nonetheless, newspapers like Res
 Publica continued to publish articles critical of the President, the Government, and
 government policy.
 There were a number of complaints that law enforcement officers harassed jour-
 nalists. This was especially the case during the Turkish summit and the Manas
 celebration when both foreign and domestic journalists were sometimes physically
 restrained from taking pictures or approaching restricted areas even when they had
 permission to do so.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under the Constitution, citi-
 zens have the right to assemble and associate freely and do so without government
 interference. Permits are required for public marches and gatherings but are rou-
 tinely available. There were a number of peaceful protests most notably during the
 parliamentary debate on the proposed referendum to extend the President's term of
 office. The demonstrations were carried out without interference, and the demands
 of the proeters were reported in the press. Later, however, several groups were
 unable to get permits for assemblies on public squares. On October 27, the anniver-
 sary of Akayev's election, large numbers of militia patrolled the squares to discour-
 age anyone trying to assemble without permits. Groups staged small rallies at mar-
 kets and stores instead.
 The 1991 Law on Public Organizations, which includes labor unions, political par-
 ties, and cultural associations, requires them to register with the Ministry of Jus-
 tice. A bureaucratic mentality, carried over from the Soviet period, is at least partly
 responsible for the delay some organizations experience in registering. Ultimately
 all organizations have been able to register. The sole exception was a Uighur organi-
 zation with the stated goal of the creation of an independent Uighur state in north-
 west China.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of religion, and
 the Government respects this right in practice.
 Some religious leaders have called for the Government to protect "traditional" reli-
 gions (Islam and Russian Orthodoxy) by regulating the activities of religious groups,
 but the Government has shown no interest in doing so. This year the Government
 issued a decree that prohibited the teaching of religion in public schools. The teach-
 ing of atheism was also prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Government policy supports freedom    of travel within and outside
 Kyrgyzstan. However, certain policies imposed during the Soviet period remain in
 effect and continue to compicate internal migration, resettlement, and travel
 abroad.
 Under the Soviet-era law still in force, citizens need a propiska (official govern-
 ment permission) to work and settle in a particular area of the country. Home and
 apartment owners are legally restricted to selling their property to buyers with such
 permission. This law is seldom enforced, and has become irrelevant as people move
 within the country, freely selling their homes and businesses. However, in August
 before and during the Manas celebration, militia members were reportedly demand-
 ing to see propiskas in Bishkek, the capital, forcing those who lacked them to tem-
 porarily leave the city or hide. On the other hand, during parliamentary elections
 there was no requirement to show propiskas to register to vote in Bishkek.
 There is no law on emigration. Adistrative procedures permit movement of
 people; however, citizens who apply for passports for foreign travel must present a
 letter of invitation from the country they intend to visit or to which they intend to
 emigrate. There were no reports, however, that citizens, after presenting such a let-
 ter, were denied a passport or an exit visa. A Soviet-era law prohibits emigration
 within 5 years of working with "state secrets." In 1995 there was one case of a per-
 son being refused an exit visa for emigration on these grounds until the 2 years re-
 maining in the 5-year period expire. Emigrants were notprvented from returning
 to Kyrgyzstan, and there is reportedly a small but steady ifow of returnees.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of thosehaving a valid claim to refugee status. In Oc-
 tobr UNHCR opened an office in Kyrgyzstan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government peacefully, but
 have limited ability to do so in practice. On December 24, Kyrgyzstan held the first
 ever open, multicandidate presidential election in Central Asia. Prior to setting an
 
 
 920
 election date, the Parliament turned back a petition campaign calling for the presi-
 dent's term to be extended by referendum and passed a resolution stating that
 referenda to extend presidential terms in office were unconstitutional. According to
 the Constitution, presidential elections are to be held every 5 years. There is a limit
 of two terms.
 Although only isolated instances of fraud were reported on election day, opposition
 candidates for the presidency had difficulty getting on the ballot. Three of six can-
 didates registered by the Election Commission were deregistered 2 weeks prior to
 the election after local government officials successfully challenged in court the ob-
 last proportion of the signatures required to nominate the candidates. Voter interest
 and turnout for the election was high. President Akayev won a convincing majority.
 Opposition candidates pretested the President's use of government resources for his
 campaign, particularly his domination of the state-run media despite strict rules
 calling for equal access by all candidates. Two opposition candidate campaign work-
 ers were arrested just prior to the election and remained in detention at year's end.
 Election observers reported that minor procedural violations were widespread dur-
 ing the election.
 In February citizens elected a new Parliament and changed the form and composi-
 tion of that body. Constitutional amendments defining the new Parliament had not
 been put into place prior to the election, however. During the parliamentary elec-
 tions, there were reports of widespread vote buying, ballot stuffing, and other elec-
 tion fraud. There did not appear to be an overall attempt to subvert the election
 results by any one party or group.
 The President and his advisors dominate the Government. Parliament and the ju-
 diciary tend to be subordinate to the executive branch. Most local government offi-
 cials are appointed by the President. Nevertheless, a strong desire for consensus
 gives many different interests a role in decision making.
 Women and ethnic groups are underrepresented in government and politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human ri hts groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally responsive and sensitive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for the rights and freedom of individuals and prohibits
 discrimination, including on the basis of language. The Government expresses
 strong commitment to protecting the rights of members of all ethnic, religious, and
 linguistic groups as well as those of women. In an estimated population of 4.46 mil-
 lion, some 56.5 percent are Ky , 18.8 percent Russians, 13.5 percent Uzbeks, and
 the rest Ukrainians, Tajiks, Kazaks, and others.
 Women.-The dramatic drop in family incomes associated with the transition from
 a Communist to a free market economy has put tremendous pressures on traditional
 family structure. Alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, malnutrition, and the
 breakdown of social support systems have resulted in a rise in abuse of women by
 their spouses. The Government has been unable to respond adequately to these new
 needs due to extreme budgetary limitations. Nongovernmental organizations, which
 might be active in a more developed economy, are only in the formative stages and
 are not able to provide effective support to abused women. Crime, including rape
 and assault, has increased markedly since independence.
 The press sometimes reports violence against women. While no overall statistics
 are available, one Bishkek hospital reported that in the first 9 months of 1995, 123
 women were admitted with injuries sustained in domestic disputes. Normal law en-
 forcement procedures are used in cases of domestic violence. The Government has
 not established programs to address these issues.
 The law gives equal status to women, and they are well represented in the work
 force, professions, and institutions of higher learning. Women probably have been
 more affected by unemployment during the economic transition than men. In addi-
 tion, the Government's failure to pay pensions has disproportionately affected
 women, since they make up the majority of pensioners. In rural areas, women are
 still often seen only in the role of homemaker, mother, and wife.
 Children.-The Government continues to rely on former Soviet law in this sphere.
 There is no monitoring of children's rights. Children in rural areas are commonly
 used to pick crops. Decreased social spending on schools and medical care and the
 closure of kindergartens have had a negative impact on child welfare.
 
 
 921
 
 People With Disabilities.-There is no special law to protect disabled individuals,
 nor any law mandating accessibility. Former Soviet law continues to remain the
 basis for any resolution of complaints. Government officials are inattentive to the
 issue, partly due to the difficult economic situation and the state of the budget.
 Notional/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Re ported complaints of discrimination cen-
 ter on the treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Xyigyz. These groups, which
 make up over 40 percent of the population, are often cae the Russian-speaking
 minority. Members of this minority allege discrimination in hiring, promotion, and
 houring. They complain that government officials at all levels favored ethnic
 Kyrgyz.
 Russian speakers (those who do not speak Kyrgyz) also allege that a ceiling exists
 in government employment which precludes their promotion beon   a certain level.
 The representation of ethnic Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of government
 is proportionally much greater than the percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz in the general
 population. Russian speakers have been replaced in many positions in government,
 industry, and education by ethnic Kyrgyz. This gives credence to perceptions that
 career opportunities are limited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 The Constitution designates Kyrgyz an the official language but provides for the
 preservation and equal and free development of Russian and other languages used
 in the country. In 1994 President Akayev issued a decree designed to protect the
 rights of the Russian-speaking minority and thereby reduce the outflow of Russian
 speakers. The decree stated that the exodus of Russians was caused by social and
 political factors-ethnic hostility and job discrimination-and hurt the national
 economy. The decree gave the Russian language official status alongside Kyrgyz in
 regions and at enterprises where Russian speakers constitute a majority, as well as
 in sectors, such as health services and technical sciences, where use of Russian is
 particularly appropriate. It also provides for the fair representation of the Russian-
 speaking population in the national government, local state administration, and on
 the boards of state organs and enterprises.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Law provides for the right of all
 workers to form and belong to trade unions, and there is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment tried to obstruct the formation of independent unions. The Federation of
 Trade Unions of the Kyrgyz Republic (The Federation), successor to the former offi-
 cial union, remains the only trade union umbrlla organization in the country, al-
 though unions are not required to belong to it. The leadership is changing, and some
 of its properties are being sold off.
 The Federation has been critical of government policies, especially privatization,
 and their impact on working class livin standards. The Federation still regards it-
 self as in a process of transition in whica it is adusting its relations with the Gov-
 ernment, with other unions in the former Soviet Union, and with unions abroad. A
 growing number of smaller unions are not affiliated with the umbrella organization.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. There were
 several small strikes of short duration. One strike at the State Antimony Plant was
 ended by government order after 2 months. T-e strikers were protesting the iring
 of the company director after he was charged with tax evasion. There were no retal-
 iatory actions against strikers. Nor were there instances of human rights abuses di-
 rected at unions or individual workers.
 The Labor Law calls for practices consistent with international standards. The
 law permits unions to form and join federations and to affiliate with international
 trade union bodies. Since independent unions are still in their infancy, no meaning-
 ful affiliation with international trade union bodies has taken place.
 b. The Right to  rganize and Bargain Coectively.-The law recognizes the right
 of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Overall union structure and
 practice are slowly changing from that of the Soviet era, and there is growing evi-
 dence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized enterprises. The
 Government sets the minimum wage, and then each employer sets its own wage lev-
 els.
 The law protects union members from antiunion discrimination, and there were
 no reorde  instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activities.
 The Federation cited one exampl trade in    charter of a newly privatized entity
 precluded its workers frb enaging in union activities.
 There are no export procssing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or compul-
 sory labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d.Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-he minimum age for employment
 is 18 years. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours per day in summer or in
 
 
 part-time jobs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the use of child labor (under
 age 16); the Ministry of Education monitors enforcement. However, families fre-
 quently call upon their children to work to help support the family.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a national, legally man-
 dated minimum wage at a level theoretically sufficient to provide minimal subsist-
 ence. As of November 1, the minimum wage was about $7.00 (75 soms) per month.
 In practice, even the higher median wage is considered insufficient to assure a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. The Federation is responsible for
 enforcing all labor laws, including the Law on Minimum Wages. As the Government
 provides the overwhelming proportion of emploent, minimum wage regulations
 are largely observed. However, enforcement of labor laws is nonexsnt in the grow-
 ing underground economy. Market forces help wages in the unofficial sector keep
 pace with official wage scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state-
 owned industries, there is a mandatory 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 Safety and health conditions in factories are poor. The deteriorating economy hin-
 dered enforcement of existing regulations and prevented investment to improve
 health and safety standards. The April 1992 law established occupational health
 and safety standards, as well as enforcement procedures. Besides government in-
 spection teams, trade unions are assigned active roles in assuring compliance with
 these measures, but agin the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the coun-
 try has made the compliance record of businesses spotty.
