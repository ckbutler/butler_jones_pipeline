 LEBANON
 According to the Constitution,.Lebanon is a parliamentary,
 democratic republic. The political system has ceased to
 function, however, during 15 years of war. Under the
 Constitution, as amended according to the Taif Agreement, and
 the National Pact of 1943, the President is a Maronite
 Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker
 of the Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. The Lebanese
 Government, however, has effective control of very little of
 Lebanon's territory,
 Extralegal militias and local'leaders control much of the
 country where they, in effect, govern the civilian population
 and enforce their own version of justice with little regard
 for the Constitution or legal norms. The presence of foreign
 forces further erodes Lebanese central authority. Syrian
 troops in parts of Beirut, north Lebanon, and the Biqa Valley
 numbered between 30,000-35,000 at the end of 1990. Israel had
 about 1,000 troops in South Lebanon but maintained control in
 and near its self-proclaimed "security zone" largely through
 its surrogate, the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Israel also sent
 regular patrols across its northern border with Lebanon. In
 late 1990, Israel began patrolling outside the "security
 zone," which led to conflicts with Palestinian and Lebanese
 resistance groups. In areas controlled by either Syria or
 Israel, soldiers from these countries and militias in the area
 sometimes carried out security and other functions normally
 reserved to a central government. Militias active in Lebanon
 included the Lebanese Forces militia (LF, supported variously
 by Israel and Iraq), Amal (supported by Syria), al-Waad (Elie
 Hobeika's branch of the LF, supported by Syria), Syrian Social
 Nationalist Party--Emergency Command (SSNP-EC, supported by
 Syria), Hizballah (supported by Iran), and several Palestinian
 factions, including those affiliated with and those opposing
 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
 As a consequence of continued fighting, Lebanon's free
 enterprise economy, already seriously disrupted by more than a
 decade of war, deteriorated throughout 1990. In August, after
 the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the civil war in Liberia, the
 economic situation worsened further as returning Lebanese
 placed an additional burden on the civilian population. The
 value of the Lebanese pound plunged against the dollar by 100
 percent in August 1990 but recovered to midsummer levels by
 the end of the year.
 With the prolonged war, the Government has been unable to
 safeguard human rights nationwide, and the situation remained
 grim in most of the country throughout the year. Factional
 fighting involved clashes between the rival Maronite Christian
 groups in East Beirut, the LF militia and the Aoun insurgency,
 and clashes between rival Shi'a Muslim militias, Amal and
 Hizballah, in the Iqlim al-Tuffah east of Sidon, and in the
 Biqa Valley. Noncombatants often suffered from the location
 of military headquarters in civilian areas and amidst civilian
 facilities. They were also the victims of terrorist bombings,
 sniping, abductions, summary executions, and assassinations.
 The number of human rights abuses declined in and around
 Beirut at the end of the year as militia forces withdrew from
 the capital and the Government implemented its Greater Beirut
 security plan and gained effective control over the area.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 As in the past, rival Muslim, Christian, Druze, and
 Palestinian factions routinely killed for political motives,
 with civilians killed and wounded by car bombs exploded in
 crowded areas and by indiscriminate sniping and other
 exchanges of fire between opposing factions. Political and
 religious figures received death threats in the course of the
 year but few were carried out. Militia forces outside of the
 control of the Government carried out most of these actions
 (see also Section l.g.). President Hrawi issued statements
 against political killings during the year.
 National Liberal Party leader Dani Chamoun, his wife, and two
 children were brutally murdered at the home of his brother
 Dori on October 20 by unidentified gunmen. The home was in an
 area patrolled by Syrian troops. Chamoun had ignored numerous
 threats against him. Ai unsuccessful assassination attempt
 was made in November against Sulayman Tony Franjiyya, grandson
 of former President SuIayman Franjiyya and head of the Maradeh
 militia.
 Accusations of political killing by security forces and
 elements of the Lebanese Armed Forces loyal to either
 President Hrawi or General Aoun were also made. In September
 forces under the authority of General Aoun in East Beirut
 killed four captives. Though initially thought to belong to
 the LF militia, the four were Lebanese Armed Forces (LAFY
 officers suspected of disloyalty to Aoun.
 There were unconfirmed reports of executions of Lebanese
 soldiers loyal to General Aoun by Syrian forces following the
 October r3 military action to. remove Aoun (7see alo Section
 1.g.-. These include testimony from journalists and medical
 personnel about large numbers of Aoun forces' corpses with
 execution-style wounds and bound hands. Equally credible
 journalistic sources reported after touring the same areas
 that they had found no evidence of execution-style killings,
 but only battlefield wounds.
 On March 28, an American working to set up a handicapped
 center at Rashayya in south Lebanon was killed in his home by
 a group calling itself the National Resistance Front. The
 American had received prior threats, based on accusations that
 he was an Israeli agent. A photographer for the Lebanese
 Broadcasting Corporation was killed at the Dog River in May
 during a peaceful demonstration. At the end of the year, the
 pro-Syrian Hobeika LF-and SSNP-EC were accused of political
 killings of supporters of the Samir Jaja's LF. The number of
 such accusations declined at the end of the year as the
 Government consolidated its control over most of Beirut.
 Foreign diplomats also were targeted. Two Polish diplomats
 were attacked on March 30 in an actioh claimed by the
 Revolutionary Action Organization-Martyr Sulayman Halabi
 faction.

 LEBANON
 b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have been kidnaped or have
 disappeared since the beginning-of the war in 1975.
 Independent militias and foreign forces, rather than official
 Lebanese security services, appear to be responsible for most
 of these kidnapings. Some victims probably were summarily
 executed. Most of these persons remain unaccounted for, but
 occasionally hostage exchanges and releases have occurred.
 Following the November truce between Amal and Hizballah, close
 to 100 prisoners were exchanged.
 Abductions and disappearances continued throughout Lebanon,
 especially in the south and, before October, along the
 dividing line between East and West Beirut, and in West
 Beirut's southern suburbs. Various Muslim groups continued to
 hold hostage foreign journalists, educators, and relief
 workers--including six Americans. Two Americans, one
 Irishman, and three Belgians-were released in 1990. In
 addition, a number of foreign relief and other workers,
 including Red Cross workers, were kidnaped near Sidon and
 Tripoli; some were released after being held for a short
 time. Two Swiss employees of the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC), held since October 1989, were released
 in August 1990. In south Lebanon, Israeli forces seized
 several prominent Shi'a religious and militia leaders, many of
 whom were later released.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Overwhelmed by the presence of illegal militias and foreign
 forces, the Lebanese Government controlled little territory,
 and relatively few allegations of torture were made against
 Lebanese security services. On March 15, central bank
 governor Edmund Naim was assaulted by members of the internal
 security services sent to bring him forcibly to a meeting with
 the Minister of Interioi, who later apologized. There were a
 number of allegations of torture and brutal treatment by
 Lebanese militias, Syrian and Israeli occupying forces, the
 SLA, Palestinian factions, and Hizballah, which includes
 several groups that receive support from Iran. The truth of
 these allegations, often brought by fiercely partisan
 elements, could rarely be verified: After the September
 killings of four LAF officers under Aoun's control, there were
 widespread accusations of cruel and degrading treatment of
 detainees in an Aoun facility.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Lebanese law requires that a suspect be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours of arrest, but government
 prosecutors sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for
 interrogation without reference to a court or judge. Every
 defendant has the right to legal counsel, and bail is
 permitted in most cases, but there is no public defender's
 office. However, if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, and
 the judge deems one is needed, the judge requests the lawyers'
 association to appoint a lawyer to handle the case.
 No militia or foreign occupying force observes the legal
 safeguards applicable to arrest cases. In general, persons
 arrested by these groups are denied access to the judicial
 system. Some of the major militia groups periodically turn
 
 
 1525
 LEBANON
 persons accused of civil crimes over to the legal
 authorities. Normally, however, the various militias detain
 persons arbitrarily for indefinite periods, often to be
 exchanged for persons held by rival militias. Such detainees
 are frequently held incommunicado. In addition to politically
 motivated abductions, some militias presume to enforce law and
 order in regions under their control, arresting, imprisoning,
 and executing persons on purely criminal charges. The SLA
 maintains a detention center holding between 400 and 1,500
 prisoners in the city of al-Khiyam in South Lebanon. Amnesty
 International (AI) has reported that there are no legal
 procedures or due process guarantees for prisoners there.
 Prisoners reportedly suffer torture and are denied contact
 with family members or with U.N. and ICRC officials. In
 October 1990, 40 Shi'a prisoners at al-Khiyam were released on
 the occasion of the prophet Muhammad's birthday. Other
 militias hold their prisoners in small numbers in different
 locations and have not concentrated them in one place as far
 as is known. Syria detained as many as 20 Aoun LAF officers
 following the October 13 action against General Aoun.
 Although some were released to LAF commander Lahoud, at the
 end of the year, most of these officers were still in Syrian
 hands.
 Many Lebanese fled the country to avoid the shelling,
 fighting, and disruption in basic services that took place
 during much of the year. Although neither the legal
 Government nor the Aoun insurgency attempted, as a- rule, to
 arrest or exile its political opponents, repeated instances of
 intimidation and threats of violence from opposing factions
 led increasing numbers of prominent Lebanese to seek temporary
 or permanent refuge abroad.
 e. Denia} of Fair Public Trial
 Despite the lack of central government authority, Lebanon
 continued its efforts to maintain a regular court system for
 criminal and civil cases, an-& each- confessional group had its
 own court for family- and personal status cases. The military
 also had its own court-martial system. Lebanese law,
 practice, and custom provide the right to a fair public
 trial. Fifteen years of war, however, have disrupted the
 judicial process, and many cases remained unadjudicated.
 Trial delays result, for example, from the difficulty of
 conducting investigations when most of the country remains
 beyond effective government control, from .a shortage of
 judges, and, most importantly, from the general breakdown in
 security. The various militia groups routinely imprisoned
 persons with no judicial processes, no charges, no court
 hearings, and na right of appeal.
 Although the judiciary is considered independent and
 relatively impartial, and courts exist throughout the country,
 the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends on the
 group in power locally. The militias frequently intervened to
 protect their supporters from detention and prosecution.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Lebanese authorities generally evince no interest in
 controlling personal life. The law requires that government
 prosecutors obtain the equivalent of a warrant before entering
 homes, except when the Lebanese Army pursues an armed
 attacker. Rights of privacy, however, were violated
 
 
 1526
 LEBANON
 frequently in the course of military operations mounted by the
 army, militias, and foreign forces in Lebanon and in the
 militias' administration of areas under their control. All of
 these groups have attempted to gather intelligence on their
 adversaries. These efforts include informer networks and
 telephone monitoring.
 q. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Significant violations of accepted international humanitarian
 standards with respect to treatment of prisoners taken during
 internal armed conflict continued. Prisoners seized as the
 result-of interfactional and intracommunal conflict were often
 subjected to prolonged incommunicado detention and physical
 and psychological abuse, including torture. As a rule,
 permission for humanitarian organizations to visit detention
 facilities was denied by the parties responsible.
 The fighting between army troops loyal to General Aoun and the
 LF militia in January and February resulted in indiscriminate
 killing, as all participants appear to have adopted a
 deliberate policy of applying pressure for political
 concessions through intimidation of the civilian population.
 The incursion into-East Beirut in October by Lebanese and
 Syrian troops to remove General Aoun resulted in casualties on
 both sides and among the civilian population.
 The Shi'a militias of Amal and Hizballah fought in Beirut's
 southern suburbs, the Biqa Valley, and in south Lebanon,
 especially the Iqlim al-Tuffah east of Sidon. This fighting
 became heavy in July, with several hundred killed and many
 more wounded. Exchanges between rival Palestinian factions,
 particularly in the Sidon area, also occurred.
 In October Lebanese and Syrian troops--at the request of the
 Government of Lebanon--conducted a military action against
 renegade General Michel Aoun. Syrian troops spearheaded the
 operation and bore the brunt of the fighting, sustaining
 casualties estimated as high as 700 dead. The LAF, including
 government troops under the command of General Emile Lahoud
 and rebel troops under General Aoun, reportedly sustained
 close to 150 killed. Accusations have been made that Syrian
 troops executed some Lebanese officers loyal to Aoun whom they
 captured after the battles. Lebanese government sources claim
 that Aoun troops opened fire on Syrians who thought they had
 surrendered, and that a mutual massacre ensued. Some reports
 claim that the Aoun LAF troops fired on Syrians because of
 poor communications. Accusations were also made that Syrian
 and Lebanese militia forces killed civilians in the aftermath
 of the operation, but few such incidents were documented.
 Credible reports accuse Syrian forces of killing 14 civilians
 in the village of Bsus southeast of Beirut. There were other
 reports that Syria executed large numbers of pro-Aoun
 civilians in East Beirut, although there was no evidence to
 support these accusations.
 In addition to the army action, two Christian militias--the
 dissident pro-Syrian Hobeika LF (al-Waad) and
 SSNP-EC--reentered Lebanon with the Syrian forces after the
 October 13 military action against General Aoun. During the
 chaos in East Beirut following the military action, these
 groups engaged in looting, rape, abduction of rivals
 (especially among followers of LF leader Jaja), and
 extrajudicial killings. The Hobeika LF -fought Hizballah after
 
 
 1527
 LEBANON
 the latter group entered Christian territory vacated during
 the fighting. Twenty persons died in the clash. Hobeika and
 SSNP-EC forces also clashed. Accusations, especially of
 kidnapings, against these groups continued to be made,
 especially by the LF, in the weeks after October 13. A
 vacated office contested by the LF and SSNP-EC at Awkar Circle
 in East Beirut was blown up in November, killing eight
 civilians. With the consolidation of the Greater Beirut
 security plan and expansion of government authority over the
 Beirut area in late November, the number of reported incidents
 declined.
 Israeli air strikes and commando raids on alleged guerilla and
 terrorist targets during the year occasionally led to
 casualties among the civilian population, but there are no
 reliable estimates of the numbers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,
 and press. Governmental authorities traditionally have
 respected the rights of those who opposed government policies
 through peaceful means. However, as a consequence of the war,
 and particularly the persistent opposition of General Aoun to
 President Hrawi and the legal Government, there were intensive
 efforts in 1990 to control or influence the media for
 propaganda purposes. For example, General Aoun forbade media
 in the areas under his control to refer to members of the
 Lebanese Government by their titles, and temporarily suspended
 several publications which did so.
 Dozens of newspapers and magazines are published throughout
 Lebanon, traditionally representing a wide spectrum of
 opinion. The press tended to reflect the political views of
 those forces controlling the places of publication. Also,
 while the press in Lebanon is nominally independent, virtually
 all newspapers and many magazines relied upon financing from
 specific Lebanese and foreign groups. As a result, these
 supporters, which included Lebanese political and militia
 figures as well as foreign governments, were able to exercise
 considerable influence over the content of the press.
 Lebanon's two "official" television channels (one each
 originating in East and West Beirut) were operated before
 October by the rival cabinets in those areas, with coverage of
 Lebanese developments tailored in accordance with, and to
 support, each side's position. Diverse political groups,
 particularly militias, operated a wide variety of unauthorized
 radio and television stations. These stations typically
 carried heavily slanted propaganda as part of their daily
 programming.
 The widespread breakdown in security and intimidation of
 university faculty, administrators, and students continued to
 seriously threaEtacademic freedom. In August and September,
 American Universiiof Beirut- officials- were threatened by
 Christian militi-a :%ver a decision to close off-campus
 programs in predo.i hantly Christian East Beirut.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Lebanese were theoretically free to assemble and associate in
 a peaceful manner. However, with the outbreak of fighting in
 February between General Aoun's forces and the LF militia,
 
 
 1528
 
 LEBANON
 followed by hostilities between factions in East and West
 Beirut, tolerance for demonstrations or assemblies other than
 those organized by or in support of the authorities in each
 area evaporated. In areas under'the exclusive control of one
 militia, demonstrations or open shows of support for rival
 militias or political groups were not permitted. The o
 Government banned a planned labor demonstration in September
 in the Beirut port area on security grounds. In October, 15
 persons died and over 100 were injured when LF militiamen
 manning a checkpoint fired on a pro-Aoun demonstration that
 was advancing toward the demarcation line. Each side blamed
 the other for the outbreak of violence.
 Israel-did not permit political groups that opposed the
 Israeli occupation to operate in areas under the control of
 the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) or the SLA. The Syrians did
 not allow groups openly hostile- to them to operate in areas
 Syria occupied. Before October, a significant constraint on
 freedom of assembly continued to be the restrictions imposed
 by authorities and militias in East and West Beirut on the
 ability of the Parliament to gather for an electoral session.
 Parliamentarians, however, could cross the line dividing East
 and West Beirut during much of the year, and Parliament was
 free td medt regularly after-October 13' (See also Section 3.)
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In the past, Lebanese practiced their various religions with a
 great:degree of liberty. There is no state religion, nor are
 there restrictions -on particular religious groups, foreign
 clergy, or places of worship. Lebanon has long been a center
 for theological training, and there are numerous seminaries in
 the country. The various religious groups are free to publish
 religious material, participate in charitable activities, and
 provide religious education for their children. Many
 religious groups operate private schools. However, the
 intensification -of religious hatred has led away from
 confessional mixing and towards confessional segregation.
 Today, Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and
 villages inhabited exclusively by one religious-community. In
 militia-controlled areas, this exclusivity sometimes is
 maintained by force.
 Lebanese are free to practice the religion into.which they are
 born. The confessional character of Lebanese society makes
 conversion to another religion difficult, except in the case
 of women, who normally adopt the religion of the man they
 marry. Conversion can mean ostracism from one's family and
 friends and having to live among strangers. In the smaller
 villages, local religious leaders often exert pressure on
 members of their congregation not to participate in the
 religious activities of other religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of internal
 travel, but wartime conditions continued to restrict the
 ability of Lebanese to travel the country freely. Before
 October, the lines dividing Aoun territory from other areas
 were closed on occasion, as were other internal land
 crossings. When the crossings were open, passage could be
 rendered difficult by sniping, arbitrary controls imposed by
 militias and other authorities, and demands for bribes by
 officials. After fighting broke out among rival Christian
 
 
 1529
 
 LEBANON
 factions in East Beirut in February, a majority of the
 estimated 800,000 to 875,000 residents there fled, most to
 other locations within Lebanon. Demarcation lines established
 within the Christian area further restricted freedom of
 movement. In the south, the SLA and IDF maintained tight
 restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out
 of the "security zone."
 In October the Lebanese Government abolished the "Green Line"
 between East and West Beirut as part of its Greater Beirut
 security plan. The plan eliminated militia checkpoints in the
 Beirut area. This greatly facilitated travel in and through
 Beirut.
 Foreign travel by Lebanese citizens was not officially
 restricted by Lebanese state authorities, although militias
 and foreign forces present at ports of entry and exit often.
 prevented certain persons from entering or leaving the
 country. Lebanese who did not want to fly had the option of
 either traveling overland to Damascus or using ferries to
 Larnaca, Cyprus, serving Ouzai in West Beirut and-Jounieh in
 East Beirut. Ferries were occasionally targets of shelling.
 Emigration and dual citizenship were permitted. There-was no
 legal impediment to voluntary repatriation by Lebanese with
 valid identity papers.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community
 continued to be difficult. Lebanon does not grant citizenship
 to Palestinians and other foreigners.  Palestinian status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo accords
 (unilaterally abrogated by Lebanon in 1987) and Palestinian
 involvement in internal fighting from 1975 to 1982 and again
 from 1985 through 1990 brought upon the Palestinians the.
 bitter enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the 1982
 conflict, many Palestinians encountered difficulty in renewing
 residence permits and travel documents, and delays still
 continue.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 With the political system having ceased to function, Lebanese
 citizens do not enjoy the right- to change their government.
 Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. According to
 the Constitution, direct elections must be held for the
 Parliament every 4 years. Parliament, in turn, elects a
 President every 6 years. The President and Parliament
 Speaker,. under the constitutional reforms, choose the
 Cabinet. Political parties may be formed.
 Since the emergence of the post-1943 state, national policy
 has been determined largely by a relatively restricted elite
 of traditional regional and sectarian leaders. The 1943
 National Pact essentially allocated political power on a
 confessional basis, according to the proportion of various
 religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932 census.
 The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the President
 would be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni
 Muslim, and the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi'a Muslim.
 Seats in the Parliament were divided on a six-to-five ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Positions in the government
 bureaucracy were allocated on a simiilar basis. Efforts to
 alter or abolish the confessional system of allocating
 political power were at the center of Lebanese politics for
 more than 3.decades. Those religious groups most favored by
 
 
 1530
 LEBANON
 the 1943 formula sought to preserve it, while those
 disadvantaged by it sought to revise it on the basis of new
 demographic realities or to abolish it entirely. The struggle
 gave a strongly religious coloration to Lebanese politics and
 to the continuing civil strife there.
 In the past 15 years, political violence has robbed democratic
 institutions of much of their remaining substance. No
 parliamentary elections have been held since 1972, and
 Parliament-was unable to decide upon a new president before
 the incumbent president's term. expired on September 23, 1988.
 Through the mediation of Saudi Arabia and other Arab
 countries, Lebanese parliamentary deputies reached an
 agreement in Taif, Saudi Arabia, ratified in November 1989,
 for political reform and new presidential elections. This
 agreement came to be known as the Taif Agreement. The
 Parliament on November 5, 1989, elected Rene Moawad as
 president and, after he was assassinated, they chose Elias
 Hrawi-on November 24, 1989.
 The political reforms stipulated in the Taif Agreement
 represented a dramatic change. The constitutional amendments
 embodying these reforms, approved by Parliament in August 1990
 and signed into law by the President in September, divide
 parliamentary seats equally between Christians and Muslims in
 an expanded 108-member Parliament. New and replacement
 members will be appointed to serve until elections can be held
 nationwide. The.changes also transfer some powers .from the
 President to the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.
 There are at least 17 Palestinian factions operating in
 Lebanon, ranging from several characterized as "Islamic" to
 numerous pro- and anti-Arafat organizations, many built around
 prominent individual leaders. Most Palestinians live in
 refugee camps, better described as neighborhoods or ghettos
 under the control of one or more of the political factions.
 Leaders are not elected, nor are there any representative
 institutions which would permit popular participation in
 running the camps. There is no functioning judicial system in
 the Palestinian camps. Fundamental protections and freedoms
 expected of governments do not exist in Palestinian areas.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Lebanese authorities have a mixed record in dealing with
 international human rights groups, and indigenous groups have
 not pressed the authorities strongly on human rights issues.
 The Lebanese Government (and General Aoun during 1990) stated
 its support for international human rights and the basic
 international documents and declarations on the subject.
 However, the chaotic situation within the country, especially
 the limited control exercised by the Government over foreign
 forces and militias, continued to hinder its ability to be
 responsive to inquiries regarding human rights abuses.
 The SLA has refused requests for access by the ICRC and
 international humanitarian groups to the prison facility it
 maintains at al-Khiyam in south Lebanon. In its 1990 Report,
 covering 1989, AI noted that it had written to the LF in
 January to respond to its offer to hold talks with AI and to
 ask for information from the LF as a basis for discussions.
 AI said that no response had been received trom the LF by the
 end of the year.
 
 
 1531
 
 LEBANON
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. As a result of the National Pact of 1943,
 government jobs, prior to the 1990 constitutional reforms,
 were allocated on the ratio of six Christians for every five
 Muslims. Under the revised system, the Government has agreed
 to Muslim-Christian parity in top-level positions, and to the
 elimination of formal ratios among sects within those two
 broad categories. The Shi'a Muslim community is now the
 largest confessional group in Lebanon, and the proportion of
 Christians in the population has declined significantly.
 Palestinians have suffered discrimination_ in the area of
 employment because the Government has denied them permission
 to obtain work permits. The traditional position of the
 Government has been that it could not open the Lebanese work
 force to outsiders because there were not enough jobs for
 Lebanese who sought employment. The result was that
 Palestinian refugees, who were often skilled workers, were
 compelled to take menial or marginal jobs. With many Lebanese
 returning from the Persian Gulf and Liberia in August and
 September, greater numbers of Palestinians in Lebanon were
 forced to seek relief from international organizations.
 Violence against women is known to occur in Lebanon but, owing
 to the value attached to personal privacy in this traditional
 society, there is little public or private debate on the
 issue. No official statistics are produced on the subject.
 It is therefore difficult to estimate the extent to which it
 may be a problem in Lebanon.
 Each confessional group in Lebanon has its own family and
 personal status laws administered by religious courts.
 Divorce is not permitted among Catholics and those adhering to
 the Catholic rite, but other Christians may obtain divorces.
 Shi'a and Sunni practices differ. Young children reside with
 the mother until a certain age, at which time custody reverts
 to the father. Girls remain with the mother longer than
 boys. The Greek Orthodox follow similar custody rules. In
 practice, there is no set formula and disputes over custody
 can occur. Women in Lebanon are free to own property.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lebanese labor law gives workers the right to unionize; choose
 their own representatives, provided they are employed within
 the bargaining unit; and determine their own policies and
 programs as long as the unions do not involve themselves in
 politics. Workers enjoy the right to strike and exercise it.
 There were strikes in 1990 by bank workers, municipal workers,
 power plant workers, and others which were resolved through
 negotiations involving the Government, management, and
 workers. On several occasions in 1990, however, militia
 forces intervened to suppress strikes and impose binding
 resolutions on all parties to the dispute.
 Lebanese authorities do not control or restrict unions, except
 that government employees may not unionize or strike. The
 operation of trade unions has been affected by the internal
 strife of recent years. There are 160 local labor unions in
 Lebanon; the major umbrella labor organization, the General
 
 
 1532
 LEBANON
 Confederation of Lebanese Workers (CGTL), contains 18
 federations of labor unions. There are no comprehensive
 statistics on union membership, although the CGTL claims
 200,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members, about one-third of the
 600,000 employed persons in Lebanon. It held its fourth
 national congress in September in Beirut, with delegates from
 all over Lebanon. The CGTL is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, based in
 Damascus. Thirteen of its affiliated federations belong to
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Another
 affiliated federation is a member of the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b: The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize'and to bargain collectively
 exists in law and practice in Lebanon. Most workers' groups
 engage in some form of collective bargaining with their
 employers. The stronger federations are able to obtain
 significant gains through their own collective bargaining
 efforts. The weaker unions rely heavily on the mediation of
 the CGTL which, prior to the war, used to negotiate annual
 across-the-board pay increases with the private employers'
 association. The CGTL often has assisted unions not
 affiliated with it in their bargaining efforts, and on
 occasion has assisted nonunionized workers. Lebanese trade
 unions made higher wages one of their chief demands in late
 1990. There is no government mechanism to promote voluntary
 worker-employee negotiations, and workers are not protected
 against antiunion discrimination. Lebanon has no special
 economic incentive or export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While not prohibited by law, forced labor is not practiced by
 the Government. In the present anarchy, however, militias
 have forced workers, especially non-Lebanese manual laborers,
 to perform unpaid duties such as fortifying buildings,
 cleaning offices, and basic day labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Lebanese law specifies the minimum age for employment of
 children as 8 years. In fact, few children under 16 years of
 age are employed.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage rate remained constant in terms of
 Lebanese currency in 1990. Due to fluctuations in the
 exchange rate it was as low as $37.50 per month, but near the
 end of the year it had stabilized at about $64 per month.
 Lebanese focused on the dollar value of wages rather than on
 salary in Lebanese currency and expected adjustments according
 to currency fluctuations. Wages at this level did not support
 a single individual and most workers and employees took on
 extra work and outside jobs to make ends meet.
 The Lebanese work a 6-day week. Labor law prescribes the
 maximum number of hours a person may work per week as 48. In
 practice, workers in the industrial sector work an average of
 35 hours a week, and workers in the other sectors of the
 economy work an average of 30 hours a week.- The labor law
 includes specific occupational health and safety regulations.
 However, given the civil strife and lack-of central government
 authority, most of the regulations are not enforced.
