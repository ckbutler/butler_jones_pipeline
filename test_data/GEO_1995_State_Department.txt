 GEORGIA
 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in April 1991. In January
 1992, a military state council seized power from the elected Government of Zviad
 Gamsakhurdia. Following multiparty parliamentary elections in October 1992, Par-
 liament chose Eduard Shevardnadze as its Chairman in an uncontested election and
 named him Head of State. On August 24, 1995 Parliament adopted a Constitution
 that provides for a unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, and an execu-
 tive branch which reports to the President. On November 5, Eduard Shevardnadze
 was elected President and a new Parliament was selected in elections described by
 international observers as "consistent with democratic norms." The President ap-
 points ministers with the consent of the Parliament. The Constitution entered into
 force on November 18 at the first session of the newly elected Parliament.
 The internal conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remain unresolved. In 1993
 Abkhaz separatists forcibly took control of Abkhazia. In the summer of 1994, Rus-
 sian peacekeepers representing the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
 were deployed in the conflict area with the agreement of the Georgians and the
 Abkhaz. Skirmishes and atrocities against civilians continue despite a cease-fire and
 the presence of the peacekeepers. A Russian peacekeeping force has been in South
 Ossetia since June 1992. While there were no armed hostilities there in 1995, the
 Government has no effective control over the territory.
 The Ministry of Interior (MVD) has primary responsibility for internal security,
 but in times of internal disorder the Government may call on the army and the
 state security service (SGB, formerly KGB) to provide security. The civilian authori-
 ties maintain effective control of the police and security forces. The MVD, SGB, and
 the former governmental Mkhedrioni paramilitary forces ("the Rescue Corps") com-
 mitted serious human rights abuses. The Rescue Corps was disbanded by decree of
 the Head of State on October 1. The Government and the MVD accused senior fig-
 
 
 863
 ures in the SGB and the Mkhedrioni of carrying out the assassination attempt
 against then Chairman Shevardnadze on August 29.
 The decline in some sectors of the economy halted, and growth occurred in the
 small but dynamic trade and services sector. The economy remains primarily agri
 cultural; industry operates at less than 20 percent of capacity. Economic policies dis-
 criminate against exports, and they were meager, mostly fertilizers, citrus, tea, and
 ferrous metals. Foreign aid represents nearly 50 percent of government income. The
 United Nations estimates per capita gross domestic product at between $350 and
 $500. The most vulnerable groups are 250,000 displaced persons from Abkhazia,
 pensioners, the handicapped, and orphans.
 The Government instituted a number of reforms reflecting its serious commitment
 to improve its human rights record, but significant problems remain. Continuing
 abuses include police and security force torture and beating of detainees, inhuman
 prison conditions, judicial corruption, denial of fair and expeditious trial, and arbi-
 trary interference with privacy and home. Progress on human rights included adop-
 tion of a new Constitution by the Parliament; restructuring of the state human
 rights protection body, including the establishment of a human rights ombudsman;
 the Government's rebuke of an effort by local officials to censor a television station;
 arrest of two MVD officers on charges of abusing prisoners; and partial resumption
 of access by international monitors to prisons and detainees.
 Abkhaz separatists tortured and killed dozens of civilians in the area that they
 control. The actual number of Abkhaz abuses is likely much higher. Georgian par-
 tisans committed killings in reprisal.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing.-A series of assassination attempts
 against political figures culminated with the unsuccessful attempt on Head of State
 Shevardnadze on August 29. Shevardnadze sustained only slight injuries when a car
 bomb exploded outside Parliament.
 Unidentified assailants wounded former Defense Minister Giorgi Karkarashvili
 and killed his deputy, Major General Pasta Datoashvili, on January 25 in Moscow.
 Masked men killed Shevardnadze's close political ally Soliko Khabeishvili in front
 of his home on June 20. On December 3, 1994, unknown assassins killed head of
 the National Democratic Party Giorgi Chanturia and seriously wounded his wife,
 member of Parliament Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia.
 The Government and the MVD have charged senior members of the SGB and the
 Mkhedrioni with involvement in the assassination of Chanturia and Khabeishvili
 and the attempted assassination of President Shevardnadze. Deputy Security Min-
 ister Temur Khachishvili was arrested on September 2 and accused of involvement
 in the attempt to kill Shevardnadze. A warrant was also issued for the arrest of
 former Security Minister Ior Giorgadze.
 According to the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europ (OSCE)
 mission in Georgia, "the Abkhaz authorities continue to implement violent ethnic
 cleansing designed to prevent significant repatriation to Gali district and elsewhere
 in Abkhazia." On March 12-14, Abkhaz militia tortured and summarily exected 28
 Georgians in the Gali district of southern Abkhazia. In retaliation, Georgian par-
 tisan groups assassinated seven Abkhaz officials on April 1.
 Prison officials report that 40 persons died in pretrial detention. Officials admit
 that poor conditions contribute to the high mortality rate, but physical abuse and
 torture are also likely factors (see Section 1.c.). The Government plans to build a
 new pretrial detention facility but as yet construction has not begun.
 b. Disappearance.-The fate of many Georgians and Abkhaz who have dis-
 appeared since 1992 as a result of the Abkha conflict is still unknown. Over 1,000
 Georgians are still reported missing, according to the State Committee on Human
 RThe Government officially has no Abkhaz prisoners. Georgian partisan groups,
 which are condoned but not controlled by the Government, hold two Abkhaz pris-
 oners. Other detentions by Georgian partisan groups have been reported but cannot
 be confirmed. The Abkhaz authorities released 30 persons in 1995 in prisoner ex-
 changes and captured an additional 25 persons.
 cTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 While torture in prisons is not always systematic or organized, government officials
 admit that the lack of training and supervision often results in cases of abuse. The
 most serious incidents of torture occurred in the investigative stage of pretrial de-
 tention  when  suspects  were interrogated  by  police. In  March   President
 Shevardnadze reported that more than 350 policemen had been arrested for various
 
 
 864
 crimes, including the abuse of human rights. In accordance with the new Constitu-
 tion, the Government has created the Office of Human Rights Defender to address
 cases of torture and abuse.
 After the July 9 arrest of five suspects in an attempted bridge bombing in Tbilisi,
 MVD police tortured the suspects. One suspect, Gia Korbesashvili, was beaten so
 severely that he could not stand after his interrogation. Human rights monitors vis-
 ited Korbesashvili in the hospital after he slithis wrists, reportedly because he
 could no longer endure the torture.
 On March 25, police arrested Tamriko Khidasheli, her husband and her father,
 and two other men on suspicion of murder. On Augst 7, following reports of beat-
 gs during interrogation    police arrested MVD   narcotics chief Colonel Gola
 Kavtelishvili and police officer Giga Kigacheishvili. At year's end, the two were
 awaiting trial on charges of violating the procedural code on interrogation. The five
 suspects were released.
 Between March 12 and 14, Abkhaz militia detained 300 Georans in Gali District
 and tortured many of them. In the village of Kvem  Bargbi,rthe Ochamchira unit
 of the Abkhaz militia beat prisoners with rods, burned them with hot knives and
 bayonets, stabbed them, and set their bodies on fire. The Abkhaz militia killed 28
 persons, most of whom were tortured to death (see Section L.a.). Despite the claims
 of Abkhaz authorities, there is no evidence that the perpetrators have been pun-
 ished for these atrocities.
 According to the OSCE mission to Georgia, during this period Russian CIS peace-
 keepers maintained fixed checkpoints only and were not on the scene at the time
 of the murders. The OSCE mission reported that as a result of the clearly "unsatis-
 factory posture from the standpoint of resident security, certain changes have since
 been adopted" including mobile patrols. However, the OSCE mission considered
 these changes as "still insufficient to provide the guarantees of personal security es-
 sential to any progress on repatriation. In a March report, Human Rights Watch/
 Helsinki noted that "perpetrators of war crimes on both sides of the conflict are not,
 by and large, being prosecuted and punished, and there is a near certainty that in-
 dividuals accused of war crimes will not receive fair trials." In an effort to hold such
 perpetrators accountable, Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze proposed that the
 Unted Nations create a body to investigate and punish those guilty of crimes
 against humanity in Abkhazia. In May the U.N. Security Council requested that the
 Secretary General consider means to improve the human rights situation in
 Abkhazia. This led to enhanced coordination between the U.N. and the OSCE on
 human rights issues in the region.
 Prison authorities admit that conditions are inhuman in many facilities. They
 blame inadequate cells, medicine, and food on a lack of resources. In the pretrial
 detention facility in Tbilisi, 2,050 inmates are housed in a prison designed for fewer
 than 1,000. Cells contain as many as 36 inmates with so few beds that they must
 sleep in shifts. Lack of sanitation, medical care, and food poses a serious threat to
 life and health.
 In 1995 Amnesty International reported that improper medical care resulted in
 the amputation of the leg of detainee Badri Zarandia in Zugdidi on October 30,
 1994. Zarandia's relatives believe that the amputation was unnecessary and pre-
 ceded by severe beatings by Zugdidi police, which resulted in Zarandia's loss of con-
 sciousness and damage to an artery in his leg.
 The Government permitted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 to visit some prisoners but restricted access to others (see Section 4). Tours of pris-
 ons and pretrial detention facilities conducted for foreign embassy and OSCE rep-
 resentatives are closely monitored by prison officials preventing uninhibited con-
 versations with inmates. Despite assurances provided by the office of the President,
 officials from the office of the prosecutor prevented international monitors from
 meeting several of the detainees arrested in connection with the Shevardnadze as-
 sassination attempt. Among the detainees whom monitors have not been able to
 visit is Guram Papukashvili, a former state security service officer. There are con-
 tinuing credible reports that Papukashvili has been abused since being detained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution adopted on August 24
 provides for a 9-month period of maximum pretrial detention, mandated court ap-
 proval of detention after 72 hours, and restrictions on the role of the prosecutor (see
 Section I.e.). Many of these provisions, although embodied in Soviet law, were ig-
 nored prior to the entering into force of the new Constitution on November 18. No
 significant change in arrest patterns occurred after November, but public awareness
 of citizen's legal rights noticeably improved.
 During most of 1995, former Soviet law continued to be enforced. Under Soviet
 law, prosecutors issued warrants for arrests and searches without court approval.
 Persons could be legally detained for up to 72 hours without charge. After 72 hours,
 
 
 865
 the prosecutor was required to approve the detention. This approval, however, was
 often a formality as the prosecutor had initiated the arrest. The law allowed for a
 maximum of 18 months of detention before trial, although this limit was often ex-
 ceeded.
 Amnesty International notes that the police have held Nikolay Ploshkin for 3
 years since October 28, 1992, without trial. A court ruled on June 28 that the evi-
 dence against Ploshkin did not support the prosecutor's charge of narcotics produc-
 tion, but Ploshkin continues to be held under investigation and without charge.
 The Government resisted a call to declare a state of emergency following the Au-
 gust 29 attempt to assassinate the Head of State. Dozens of supporters of ousted
 President Gamsakhurdia were, however, briefly detained and released following the
 incident. Dozens of Gamsakhurdia supporters were also detained on May 26 when
 police broke up an unsanctioned assembly of protesters (see Section 2.b.).
 In a Shevardnadze-initiated crackdown against the then official but heavily crimi-
 nal Mkhedrioni (Rescue Corps), MVD police arrested a number of Mkhedrioni in Au-
 gust and September on criminal charges, some as old as 3 years.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary. Prior to the adoption of the new Constitution, the courts were often influ-
 enced by the pressure from the executive branch. By year's end, the courts displayed
 no greater independence from the executive branch's prosecutor's office.
 The Constitution delineates the authorities of individual courts. Courts of general
 jurisdiction are undifferentiated as to function; judges may hear criminal, civil, and
 juvenile cases. Military courts are allowed to operate only during wartime. The Con-
 stitution provides for a new Constitutional Court made up of three appointees from
 each branch of government-executive, legislative, and judicial. Parliament has yet
 to adopt specific legislation to determine the powers, duties, and operating proce-
 dures of the Constitutional Court.
 Under former Soviet law which governed for most of 1995, prosecutors were vest-
 ed with powers greater than those of judges or defense attorneys. Prosecutors di-
 rected criminal investigations, supervised some judicial functions, and represented
 the State in trials. The judiciary had little control over the activities of prosecutors.
 The new Constitution limits the role of prosecutors by placing them under the su-
 pervision of the courts.
 Under the law a detainee is presumed innocent and has the right to a public trial.
 Trials, however, are not conducted in an adversarial manner. A detainee has the
 right to demand immediate access to a lawyer and to refuse to make a statement
 in the absence of counsel. The State must provide legal counsel if the defendant is
 unable to afford one. The detaining officer must inform the detainee of these rights
 and must notify the detainee's family of his or her location as soon as possible. In
 practice, these rights are frequently violated. Human rights observers report wide-
 spread judicial incompetence and corruption, including the payment of bribes to
 prosecutors and judges.
 In the trial of 19 persons implicated in the June 1992 attempt on the life of par-
 liamentary deputy and Mkhedrioni leader Jaba loseliani, the Supreme Court sen-
 tenced two of the suspects to death on March 6 and the rest to jail terms of up to
 15 years. The Government consistently violated due process during the investigation
 and trial. Acts of torture, use of forced confessions, denial of legal counsel, and ex-
 pulsion of defendants from the courtroom took place. One of the condemned men,
 Petre Gelbakhiani, had been denied access to legal counsel and trial records to pre-
 pare his appeal. Access to his lawyer and legal records was restored in May after
 intervention by the State Committee on Human Rights. On July 8, the presiding
 judge expelled from the courtroom two other suspects in the same case, Zurab
 Barzimashvili and Omar Kochlamazashvili, when they objected to being denied ac-
 cess to case materials. After a 7-month appeal process, the Supreme Court denied
 the appeal and declared the trial to have been legal and valid. The defendants plan
 a second appeal directly to the Supreme Court Chairman.
 There are no known political prisoners, although detained Gamsakhurdia support-
 ers, organized crime figures, and SGB personnel have claimed that they are political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Credible
 reports indicate that both the SGB and MVD monitor private telephone conversa-
 tions without court order. SGB and MVD officials also enter homes without any
 legal sanction. The frequency and seriousness of such violations, however, are di-
 minishing.
 
 
 866
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 press law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press. The Government improved its respect of this right in
 practice, although some problems remained. Press freedom for private media was
 almost universal in 1995, with the exception of an unsuccessful attempt by certain
 officials to censor a private television station. Observers noted that police harass-
 ment of journalists had declined. Dozens of opposition newspapers with wide circula-
 tion operate without interference throughout Georgia.
 The Government finances and controls many newspapers and most television sta-
 tions, and they reflect principally official viewpoints. The government-financed
 newspapers Sarkartvelos Respublic and Svobodnya Gruzya, do not publish opposi-
 tion viewpoints. The State also owns and operates the major publishing house. Op-
 position spokesmen complain they do not have equal access to government-operated
 nationaltelevision stations nor the resources to print large numbers of their news-
 papers. Th~e government-operated stations have introduced some programs designed
 to air oppsition viewpoints. During the campaigns prior to the November 5 elec-
 tions, all political parties were given equal time on government television with ro-
 tating time slots.
 On June 16, the Ministry of Communications rescinded the license of a local tele-
 vision station "Rustavi TV after the station refused to submit to censorship b. mu-
 nicipal authorities. The Ministry closed "Rustavi TV" under the pretense that it was
 engaging in illegal commercial activity. After media and diplomatic protests to the
 Head- of-State's office, the Ministry of Communications restored the license on July
 18.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The Government generally ob-
 serves the right of peaceful assembly and association. The Government permits un-
 announced assembly, in three locations in Tbfiisi and requires 24-hour advanced no-
 tice for assemblies m other areas. The Government grants permits for assembly and
 reitration for associations without arbitrary restriction or discrimination.
 May 26, police in riot gear broke up an unsanctioned assembly of 2,000 pro-
 testers (mostly supporters of ousted President Gamsakhurdia) in the Tbiisi city cen-
 ter. The protesters complained that some of them, particularly women, were han-
 dled rougly by police. Dozens of protesters were detained.
 _c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in  rice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patition.-The 1993 law on migration provides for these rights, and the Govern-
 ment generaly respects them in practice. The Government Office of Passports,
 Visas, and Foreign Registration (OVeR) often illegally restricts foreign travel by de-
 manding bribes and requiring long delays for passport issuance. The registration of
 residence is no longer required in Georgia. Georgm n citizens are free to live any-
 where in the country. The Government generally respects the right of repatriation
 although approximately 270,000 Meskhetian Turk (primarily Muslim) refug ees still
 face pubdli opposition to their return. Stalin exiled the Meskhetian Turks from
 Georgam in the 1940's. The Government is attempting to return 35 to 40 Meskhetian
 refugee families from Azerbaijan to Marneuli, eastern Georgia, as part of a pilot re-
 settlement pigram. Larger repatriation programs continue to face strong local re-
 sistance.
 Intern.ational law and the 1994 Quadripartite Agreement (Russia, Georgia,
 Abkh.azia, and U.N. H-igh Commissioer for Refees) on repatdriation in Abkhazia
 provie fr tm e ree, safe, and igned return ofintrnally splace persons tlli-'s)
 to teir homes. Since 1994, when only 311 oP's were alowedto repatriate, there
 has been no official repatriation. A p proximately 30,000 of the 250,000 displaced per-
 sons from Abkhazia have returned spntaneously, most all to the southern part of
 Gli District where Abkhaz separatist forces operate only sporadically. The return-
 ees continue to face security threats from Abkhas authorities.
 Se th Ossetian separatists also continue to defy attempts to repatriate IDves.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution and 1995 Election Law provide citizens with the right to peace-
 fally change their government, and citizens exercised this right in the last two elec-
 tions in October 1992 and November 1995. A democratically elected President and
 Parliament governs most of Georgia. The separatist regions of Abkhazia and South
 ssetia are ruled by uneleted leaders, antrnational balloting is not conducted in
 these areas.
 The 223-member Parliament and President Eduard Shevardnadze were elected in
 multiparty elections in 1992 and 1995. International observers judged these elec-
 
 
 867
 tions to meet international standards, despite technical violations. In the 1995 elec-
 tion, opposition parties actively participated in preelection planning and election
 monitoring. The most serious election violations occurred in the regions of Adjaria
 and Southern Georgia but were not sufficiently large to upset the national election
 outcome. Local elections are planned in 1996.
 Women and minorities are less well represented in Parliament than they were in
 the Soviet or Gamsakhurdia governments. Only 16 women (7 percent) were elected
 to Parliament in 1995, and one woman (6 percent) has been named to a ministerial
 pst.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally respects the right of domestic and international orga-
 nizations to monitor human rights, but hns limited the access of such organizations
 in s ecific cases.
 dICC has visited 80 prisoners in Georgian custody and 55 prisoners in
 Abkhaz custody without the presence of third-party observers. The Government has
 denied access by ICRC to 27 prisoners, most of whom are supporters of ousted Presi-
 dent Gamsakhurdia.
 Following the attempted assassination of the Head of State on August 29, the
 Ministry of Interior arrested dozens of members of the Rescue Corps and the Secu-
 rity Service (see Section 1.d.). There are continuing credible reports of abuse of one
 of the detained security service officers, Guram Paukashvili. By year's end, the
 Government granted the OSCE and diplomatic representatives access to some of the
 detained persons in this case, but not to Papukaslivili.
 Domestic human rights monitoring is politicized. Local human rights groups com-
 plain that the State Committee on Human Rights is biased and promotes the inter-
 ests of the Government. The Committee counters that most local human rights
 groups are extensions of partisan political groups. The new Constitution provides for
 a human rights public defender who will be independent from the executive branch.
 The public defender will be elected and funded    iament but will be account-
 able to neite thoute Pariament nor the executive. The position will be filled after
 the Parliament adopts legislation defining its specific duties and authority.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution recognizes the equality of all citizens without regard to race, lan-
 guae, sex, religion, skin color, political views, national, ethnic, or social affiliation,
 origin, social status, landownership, or place of residence. The Constitution provides
 for Georgian as the state language, except in Abkhazia where both Abkhazian and
 Georgian  are state languages. The State  Committee on Human Rights and
 Intrechnic Relations is responsible for combating discrimination but lacks the re-
 sources to monitor discrimination effectively.
 Wornen.-Women's nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) report that family vio-
 lence and rape is not common in most of Georgia, although there have been inci-
 dents of spousal abuse and sexual harassment. They indicate that spousal abuse
 usually goes unreported, and police are reluctant to investigate complaints. They
 also note that sexual harassment is becoming a growing problem in the workplace
 as increasing numbers of women are employed outside the home. The Government
 has no support services for abused women, although police reportedly do investigate
 reports of rape.
 Human rights monitors in Abkhazia noted dozens of reports of rape of non-
 Abkhaz women by young Abkhaz men, often in paramilitary dress. In many cases,
 these rapes were reported to be of elderly women with the clear intent of
 humiliating the victim and her family.
 Women's access to the labor market continues to be confined mostly to low-paying
 and low-skill positions despite frecpuent high professional and academic qualifica-
 tions. There are only a r elly few women working in industry and professional
 fields. Despite their small numbers, prominent women including opposition leader
 Irmna Chanturia-Sarishvili play important roles in politics and business.
 Five new political collectives have been formed to promote women's rights, includ-
 ingGeorgian Women's Choie and the Party for th e  n e of Women's Right.
 Children.-Government services for children are extremely limited. The Hiealth
 Reform Act of Augut 10 withdrew the right of children over the age of 1 year to
 free medical care. While education is officially free, many parents are unable to af-
 ford books and school supplies, effectively excluding their children from participa-
 tion in school.
 
 
 868
 The Georgian private voluntary organization (PVO), 'Child and Environment,"
 notes a dramatic rise in homeless children since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 It estimates that there are as many as 1,000 street children in Tbilisi because of
 the inability of orphanages and the Ministry of Education to provide support serv-
 ices. "Child and Environment" also reports a growing trend towards child involve-
 ment in criminal activity, narcotics, and prostitution despite the cultural tradition
 of protecting children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislative or otherwise mandated provision
 requiring accessibility for the disabled. The Law on Labor has a section which in-
 cludes the provision of special discounts and favorable social policies for those with
 disabilities, especially disabled veterans.
 Many of the state facilities for the disabled which operated in the Soviet period
 have been closed because of lack of government funding. Most disabled persons are
 supported by family members.
 Religious Minorities.-Freedom of religion is widely respected in Georgia. The Pa-
 triarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church, however, is wary of proselytism and has
 exhibited an intolerant attitude towards Baptist missionaries and the Salvation
 Army. The Catholic Church has also complained of the delay in the return of
 churches closed during the Soviet period and later given to the Georgian Orthodox
 Church.
 Organizations promoting the rights of Jewish persons and Jewish emigration con-
 tinue to report that the Government provides exceptional coopration and support.
 This year, during the transition to a new passport regime, the Government expe-
 dited the cases of Jewish emigrants while delaying all other cases. Georgia has a
 tradition of tolerance towards religious minorities.
 National/Racil/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government generally respects the
 ights of ethnic minorities in nonconlict areas. Local government has encouraged
 the repatriation and reintegration of ethnic Osetians into Georgian communities.
 The Government provides funds for ethnic schools, and the teaching of non-Georgian
 landuages is ermitted. Both pro-Georgian and Abkhaz separatist violence against
 ci *iians in Abkhazia reflects historical ethnic conflicts as does the refusal of South
 Ossetian authorities to allow ethnic Georgians to return to South Ossetia.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form and join unions. The Soviet Labor Code, still in effect, specifies that these
 unions must be registered with the Ministry of Justice.
 A single Confederation of Trade Unions, made up of about 30 sectoral unions, op-
 erates in Georgia. Current trade unions, however, are remnants of the Soviet period
 where unions were administrative bodies concerned with property and finance but
 not with workers' rights.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national organizations. The right to form unions is protected under the new Con-
 stitution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the So-
 viet LaborCode allow workers to organize and bargain collectively, and this right
 is respected. The Labor Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members. Employers may be prosecuted for antiunion discrimination
 and be made to reinstate employees and pay back wages. The Ministry of Labor in-
 vestigates complaints but is not staffed to conduct effective investigations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and provides foi sanctions against violators; violations are rare.
 The Ministry of Labor enforces this law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the Labor Code, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 14 years. Children between 14 and 16
 years may not work more than 30 hours per week. Reportedly, the minimum age
 is widely respected.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The nationally mandated minimum wage was
 abolished on July I and replaced by a wage scale which sets the lowest salary grade
 at $4.31 (3.5 lari) per month. There is no state-mandated minimum wage for private
 sector workers. A recent government report concluded that $77 per month was re-
 quired to maintain the basic needs of a single elderly male in Georgia. Pensions are
 undifferentiated, except for World War II veterans, and are set at $4.55 (3.7 lari)
 per month. Pensions for World War II veterans are set at $7.38 (6 lari) per month.
 The law provides for a 41-hour workweek, including a 24-hour rest period, al-
 though the Government workweek was shortened during the winter due to the en-
 
 
 ergy crisis. The Labor Code permits higher wages for hazardous work and permits
 a worker in such fields to refuse duties that could endanger his life.
