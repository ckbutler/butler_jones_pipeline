 NIGERIA
 On October 1, 1979, Nigeria inaugurated its first civilian
 government in 13 years. Several coups and a civil war
 occurred during the period 1966-79, but chiefs of state
 General Murtala Muhammed (1975-76) and his successor Lt. Gen.
 Olusegun Obasanjo (1976-79) made clear their intention
 to return Nigeria to civilian rule and adhered to a schedule
 to meet this goal. Return to civilian rule represented a
 conscious effort by the former military authorities to move
 toward democratic government and the rule of law, and away
 from the restrictions on human rights that military rule
 entailed.
 On September 21, 1978 a 12-year state of emergency and
 accompanying ban on political activity were lifted. Five
 political parties contested in national elections held
 during July-August 1979 for a president and members of a
 national assembly, and for state governors and legislators.
 In general, the elections were free and fair, and all
 persons over 18 years of age were encouraged to register and
 vote. Alhaji Shehu Shagari was inaugurated president on
 October 1, 1979.
 During its first year in office, the civilian government was
 occupied largely with adjusting to a new and unfamiliar
 system of government in which decision-making was far more
 complex than it had been under military rule. The Federal
 Government of Nigeria (FGN) and many of the state governments
 began programs to improve educational and health facilities
 and low-rent housing. The government also declared a
 moratorium on the execution of criminals condemned to death
 by special tribunals prior to October 1.
 Chapter IV of the Nigerian constitution, promulgated on
 October 1, 1979, contains human rights guarantees and
 Chapter II contains a statement of political, social, and
 economic objectives designed to protect and enhance the
 rights of individuals.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Section 31 (1) (A) of the constitution prohibits torture.
 There is no evidence that the government seeks to circumvent
 or ignore this prohibition. Reliable sources report, however,
 that detainees sometimes are beaten for the purpose of
 extracting confessions. This probably takes place at the
 time of arrest or during interrogation at police stations.
 It is believed to be the unauthorized action of individual
 police officers and not a reflection of policy. There have
 been no public charges of torture, and the press and public
 have not evidenced concern. In-February 1980 the ministry of
 internal affairs announced that a board of inquiry would be
 established to look into allegations of poor treatment of
 prisoners. The board has not yet come into existence.
 
 
 195
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Nigerian prisons are overcrowded, primarily because of the
 numb~r of people being held in detention prior to trial.
 The press reported in late 1980 that 13,784 people were in
 prison awaiting trial. The minister of state and internal
 affairs has charged publicly that some people accused of
 vagrancy have been "awaiting trial for one or two years."
 No action has been taken to rectify this situation. There
 have been no summary executions. Capital punishment is
 applied but only after civil trial with a right to appeal;
 executions occur within prisons and receive little publicity.
 Physical punishment is not administered as a sentence
 for crimes. The government has stated that it plans to
 build new and improved prison facilities.
 c.   Disappearances
 Abduction and secret arrest are unconstitutional and not
 sanctioned officially. Only one instance in which this
 seems to have happened is known. In early 1980 Shugaba
 Abdurrahman, the deputy speaker of the Borno State Legisla-
 ture and a member of the opposition party, disappeared. The
 Nigerian judiciary intervened after Shugaba reappeared and
 filed a suit against the government. During the proceedings
 it was revealed that government officials had questioned
 Shugaba without due process and had deported him to Chad on
 the suspicion that he was a Chadian citizen. The court ruled
 that Shugaba was, indeed, a Nigerian citizen and that he had
 been illegally deported. In late 1980 Shugaba resumed his
 office and political activity. The government, however, is
 appealing the case.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no clandestine detentions of political pris-
 oners. The right of habeas corpus exists in law and
 has been honored since the end of the state of emergency
 in 1978. All decrees authorizing preventive detention
 were abolished when the new civilian government took office.
 No cases of preventive detention are known to have occurred
 since then.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Nigerian judicial system is based upon both traditional
 and statutory law. Fair public trials are the norm. The
 constitution provides that an accused individual is entitled
 to a public trial unless the government can satisfy the
 court that it would not be in the public interest for the
 matters at hand to be discussed publicly. Prisoners must
 be advised of the charges against them, have access to
 legal counsel, be informed of the evidence on which charges
 are based, and be given adequate time and facilities for the
 preparation of a defense. These rights seem to be honored
 in practice, and no incidents of harassment of defense
 counsel by the government are known.
 
 
 196
 The judiciary is independent of executive control and
 individuals have the right of redress. Civilians are not
 tried by military courts, nor are there any special courts
 to deal with political or security matters. There is a
 legal aid society, but its resources and activities are
 limited. The government provides counsel for indigents in
 capital cases.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits invasion of the home, and judi-
 cial warrants are required before a home can be entered. No
 allegations of forced entry or violations of the home have
 been made in 1980.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Nigeria has a mixed economy. Energy production facilities
 which account for 95 percent of exports and 85 percent of
 government revenues are government owned. Transportation,
 communications and banking also are state owned enterprises.
 Other business activity is in private hands. Local laws and
 regulations allow the government to monitor extensively
 most of the economy.
 Per capita gross national product is estimated at $560
 (1978) with an average annual growth rate during the period
 1960-1978 of 3.6 percent. The growth rate has doubled in
 recent years because of increased oil prices. The distri-
 bution of income and wealth is heavily skewed, with most of
 the resources being concentrated in the hands of a small
 minority. The distribution of income is as follows
 (fractions rounded off):
 Highest 5 percent ............... 25 percent
 Highest 20 percent .............. 55 percent
 Lowest 20 percent ................ 6 percent
 Lowest 40 percent ............... 15 percent
 Increasing the availability of food supplies, providing
 adequate shelter and improving health care services are
 among the top priorities of the federal government. Heading
 the list of priorities is the "Green Revolution," a commit-
 ment to reverse the declining trend in agricultural produc-
 tion. The primary emphasis of this program is to assist
 small farmers by providing fertilizer and improved seed
 varieties and by-distributing tractors to farmer cooperatives
 at subsidized costs. In its first year, the program has
 been plagued by distribution problems.
 
 
 197
 Housing also has a high priority. The federal government
 is committed to providing 2,000 low and middle-income
 housing units in each of the 19 states and the federal
 capital territory by the end of 1980. The housing program
 has encountered several problems, and a new World Bank pilot
 "sites and services" project indicates that alternative
 housing strategies are being explored. Most state governments
 also have similar housing projects, which typically aim
 toward provision of 2,000 to 4,000 units per year.
 The federal government's basic health services scheme
 is designed to provide all Nigerians with access to primary
 health care. Over the next 10 years the government plans to
 commit 2 billion naira ($3.66 billion) to the plan. In
 addition to primary medical care, the program included an
 expanded immunization program ahd a health and nutrition
 education program. Three levels of health care facilities
 are being provided: 4-bed health clinics to serve small
 rural populations; 14-bed primary health centers; and
 30-bed comprehensive health centers.
 State governments also provide health services. Five of
 the nine southern states are committed to providing free
 health care. Shortage of trained medical personnel,
 even after a doubling of the number of nurses, pharma-
 cists and doctors in the past five years, as well as
 shortages and-problems of distribution of drugs and
 medical supplies are challenges that will have to be
 overcome if the goal of providing health care for all is
 to be met.
 There is some awareness at planning levels of the diffi-
 culties which rapid population growth presents in meeting
 the basic needs of Nigerians. Some family planning
 services are provided by the federal government within
 the maternal and child health care program. The federal
 government is also forming a national population com-
 mission chaired by the vice president, which will be
 charged with the politically sensitive problem of con-
 ducting a census, as well as introducing a vital statis-
 tics registration scheme and formulating national popula-
 tion policies.
 In 1978 total population was estimated to be around 80
 million people, with one-quarter living in urban
 centers. The population is estimated to be growing at
 approximately 3 percent per year. Infant mortality per
 thousand is 163 and life expectancy at birth is 48 years.
 Population per physician is 15,000 and per nurse, 4,030.
 Nigeria's development plan calls for providing free primary
 and secondary education to all children. The success of the
 universal primary education program has been limited by the
 unavailability of recent census data and the shortage of
 schools and trained teachers. Nigeria's literacy rate in
 English is about 25 percent.
 
 
 198
 The Land Use Decree No. 6 of 1978 provides that land
 in Nigeria cannot be owned by private individuals,
 but is instead held in trust by the governors of the
 various states. Customary right of occupancy is
 granted rent-free by the local government when the
 land is used for agricultural purposes. Rent is
 charged for statutory occupancy, but fees can be
 waived or reduced if a state governor determines that
 it would be in the public interest to do so.
 Private and public resources often are diverted from
 needed development projects because of corruption,
 which remains an endemic social and political problem.
 The government has condemned and taken action to
 discourage corruption. A cabinet minister against
 whom allegations of corruption had been leveled was
 removed from his post and he later resigned. Legal
 action is employed with frequency only against the lower
 levels of Nigerian officialdom, such as policemen and
 civil servants. No legal action has been taken recently
 against any high level officials. The various public
 complaints commissions seemingly play little role in the
 examination of corruption. An anticorruption law was
 passed in 1978 providing for a naira 10,000 ($18,300)
 fine or 10 years in jail for officials taking bribes.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression,
 press, peaceful assembly and religion, although it
 prohibits membership in secret societies. Nigerians
 are free to practice the religion of their choice and
 no religious groups are discriminated against or favored.
 All television and radio broadcast organizations are
 wholly owned by the government, and the constitution
 proscribes the ownership of television and radio stations
 by private individuals unless authorized by the president.
 in addition to federal and state government newspapers,
 there are a number of privately owned dailies, weeklies
 and magazines. All of the media are frequently critical
 of federal and state government policies. The government
 is attentive to such criticism and public reaction to it
 and there have been no efforts at censorship. There are
 indications of some self-censorship by the press in the
 treatment of especially sensitive issues. Generally,
 however, the press can be described as articulate and
 aggressive. Domestic and foreign books and artistic works
 are freely available. Some reporters have been banned
 temporarily from the premises of the national or state
 legislatures after having written harshly critical
 articles. One editor was briefly detained following
 a series of articles critical of the police. There is no
 apparent interference with academic inquiry in the natural
 or social sciences.
 
 
 199
 There are 42 industrial unions and one labor federa-
 tion, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC), to which all
 the unions belong. Unions, with the exception of those
 involved in "essential services," such as postal opera-
 tions and transport, have the right to organize, bargain
 collectively and strike. Even those unions in the essen-
 tial service sector often carry out work stoppages and
 slowdowns, however. There is no indication of govern-
 ment harassment of professionals or labor groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are respected.
 Over the years, Nigeria has not been afflicted with
 serious refugee problems.   Prior to the coup against
 Equatorial Guinea's President Macias in August 1979, an
 estimated 500 Equatorial Guineans fled to eastern Nigeria.
 Most of the refugees were assimilated into the local
 economy and are not dependent on the government for
 assistance.
 In March, 6 to 7,000 Chadians fled the civil war in that
 country into northern Nigeria. After March, the inflow
 increased substantially and the Nigerian government
 estimated that there were about 50,000 Chadian refugees
 in Borno state in late 1980. The refugees are generally
 adequately treated. Approximately one-quarter are quartered
 in three camps in Borno state, with the remainder in
 private dwellings. During late 1980 the government spent
 3.2 million naira ($5.9-million) to support those in camps.
 In addition, the government has provided one naira ($1.83)
 a day stipends to those outside camps, most of whom have
 taken up residence with relatives or friends in the area
 and have been more or less integrated into the subsistence
 economy. While the refugees are free to return to Chad, few
 apparently are doing so.
 There are no refugees fleeing Nigeria nor is there
 any restriction on voluntary repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new constitution provides the basis for the legal
 registration of free and independent political parties
 and ensures that appointees to any federal agency, such
 as the cabinet, the federal electoral commission, the
 civil service or the military, be representative of all
 Nigerian ethnic groups. Equal ethnic representation at
 the state level is also mandatory. The president also has
 attempted, through meetings with various party leaders, to
 minimize discrimination by members of the winning parties
 against adherents of losing parties at both state and
 federal levels, including occasional incidents of violence.
 
 
 200
 All citizens 18 years of age or older are allowed and
 encouraged to vote. About 34 percent of registered
 voters participated in the 1979 elections. Opposition
 groups exist openly and the system encourages their active
 participation.
 All rights guaranteed in the constitution apply equally
 to women and men. Under statutory and customary law
 as well as by custom, however, women do not enjoy the status
 of men in many areas. An unmarried woman, who is 21 or
 above, has the legal capacity to sue and be sued, to buy
 and sell property, to engage in business or a profession,
 and choose her own residence. However, married Women
 cannot control their property or enter into loan or pur-
 chase agreements without the consent of their husbands, nor
 can they obtain passports or travel outside the country
 without their husbands' consent.
 Under customary law, apart from the right to support,
 wives do not have rights to their husbands' property or
 income. There also are limitations on the right of di-
 vorced women to remarry. There is no law against a
 married woman's working but, except in government service,
 there is no guarantee of equal pay for equal work.
 Traditional education for women is limited to homemaking
 skills. No statistics are currently available on the
 degree of participation of women in business or the
 professions, although there are significant numbers in
 law and medicine.
 Almost all marketing in southern Nigeria is controlled
 by women, who often belong to politically powerful
 market womens' associations. Most of the states have
 at least one woman in their houses of assembly and
 cabinets. There are three women in the House of
 Representatives; there is a female cabinet minister,
 and a female minister of state. No statistics on
 numbers of women in civil service are available,
 although they seem to be employed generally at the
 lower levels of the civil service. The federal and
 state governments and women's groups, such as the
 National Council of Women, are actively working on
 women's problems and rights.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Nigeria has maintained an interest in human rights viola-
 tions throughout Africa. During a 1980 meeting of the
 African Bar Association in Nairobi, the Nigerians were in
 the forefront of those calling for a committee to investi-
 gate human rights violations in Africa. Nigeria has
 participated actively in the plans and programs of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. No requests
 by an international or nongovernmental institution to
 investigate human rights conditions in Nigeria are known.
 Amnesty International maintains an office in Lagos and the
 Nigerian Bar Association has a Human Rights Committee to
 monitor the government's implementation of human rights
 provisions in the constitution. The minister of education
 announced in October 1980 that a plan to teach human
 rights in Nigeria schools was being prepared.
