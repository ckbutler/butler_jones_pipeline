 FIJI
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy, inherited when the country gained inde-
 ence from Great Britain in 1970, was interrupted in 1987 with the installation
 of a military-led regime following two bloodless coups. Fiji returned to elected gov-
 ernment in 1992. That Government fell in November 1993 over failure to pass a
 budget for 1994. The subsequent general election in February 1994 returned Prime
 Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and substantially the same government to office.
 Ethnicity plays a major role in Fiji's politics, economy, and society. Fiji's more
 than 775,000 people constitute a multiracial society in which indigenous Fijians and
 ethnic Indians together, in roughly equal numbers, account for 96 percent of the
 population. Indo-Fijians dominate the commercial sector and professions and are
 well represented in the lower and middle levels of the Government. Ethnic Fijians
 control the legal and political organizations and dominate the military forces.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and a separate police force
 report to and are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs and, ultimately,
 the President. In 1990 the Government also established the Fiji Intelligence Service,
 with limited statutory powers to search people and property, monitor telephones,
 and access mail correspondence and financial records. There continue to be credible
 reports of occasional human rights abuses by individual police officers.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for almost
 half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The Government is promoting light
 manufacturing for export, notably a garment industry, to diversify the economy and
 lessen its dependence on sugar and tourism.
 Principal human rights problem remained constitutionally imposed and ethnically
 based political discrimination which, inter alia, abridges the right of citizens to
 change their government, as well as overt bias in land tenure and government poli-
 cies favoring ethnic Fijians. Other human rights problems include occasional police
 brutality, potential constraints on the exercise of freedom of the press, continued
 delays in bringing criminal and civil cases to trial, discrimination and cases of vio-
 lence against women, and instances of abuse of children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government or any political group.
 In September a court sentenced two police officers to life imprisonmeat for first
 degree murder following a 1994 death in the arrest of a knife-wielding suspect. A
 third officer pied guilty to a lesser charge and was the Government's major witness
 in the court's finding that police had used excessive force to subdue the intoxicated
 victim.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the authorities have sometimes pun-
 ished offending officers, but these punishments have not served as an effective de-
 terrent to other officers' actions. The Police Department's internal affairs unit inves-
 tigates complaints of police brutality and has begun to work with the Ombudsman's
 ofice to ensure impartial observers in the investigation of complaints about police
 conduct.
 Prison authorities strive to meet minimum international standards, within the
 limits of local financial restraints. Prison conditions are Spartan and food and sani-
 tation limited. The Government permits visits to the prisons by church groups and
 family members.
 The law permits corporal punishment as a penalty for criminal acts, but this pro-
 vision is seldom invoked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Arrest and Detention pro-
 vides that a person may be arrested only if police believe that a breach of the crm-
 nal law has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a court without 'undue delay." This is taken to mean within 24 hours, with
 48 hours as the exception (such as when an arrest is made during the weekend).
 Rules governing detention are designed to ensure fair questioning of suspects. De-
 fendants have the right to a judicial review of the grounds for arrest; in urgent
 cases defendants may apply to a judge at any time, whether he is sitting or not.
 Incommunicado and arbitrary detention, beth illegal, did not occur.
 Exile is not practiced.
 
 
 607
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent under the Constitu-
 tion and in practice. There were no credible reports in 1995 of courts having been
 influenced by the executive.
 The judicial structure was reorganized under the 1990 Constitution, but remained
 patterned on the British system. The rinci al courts are the magistrate courts, the
 High Court, and the Court of Appeal. The Constitution also provides for a Supreme
 Court as the court of final appeal. The Supreme Court held its frlst meeting in No-
 vember, 7 years after Fiji lost its access to Great Britain's Privy Council following
 the 1987 coups. The Court of Appeal has made considerable progress in reducing
 the backlog of cases caused by the Government's failure to appoint a president for
 the Court until December 1991 and the Court's consequent inability to convene be-
 fore that time.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate courts continue to try the large manoity of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
 Defendants have the right to a public trial and to counsel. Trials in the High
 Court provide for the presence of assessors (citizens randomly selected to represent
 the community); cases in magistrate court do not. In litigation involving lesser com-
 plaintsa public legal advisor assists indigent persons in domestic or family law
 cases he right of appeal exists but is hampered by continuing delays in the ap-
 peals process. Bail procedures mean that most defendants do not experience any
 pretrial detention.
 The law sometimes treats women differently from men. In some instances there
 is a presumption of reduced competence and thus reduced responsibility. For exam-
 ple, only women can be charged with infanticide (if a man kills an infant it is treat-
 ed as murder, a more serious charge). A woman in an infanticide case is presumed
 to have diminished mental capacity, and courts reduce or suspend sentences -accord-
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, the Government respects the privacy of the home. However, the Intelligence
 Service has powers, within specific operational guidelines, to search people and
 property, access private financial records, and monitor mail and telephones when a
 warrant is issued by the National Security Council. The Intelligence Service does
 conduct surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat. Some political
 dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but they have not pro-
 duced substantiating evidence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. The
 Government at times criticizes the media for its coverage of sensitive issues, par-
 ticularly if the Government perceives the coverage as resulting in a diminution of
 reset for authority.
 Neertheless, political figures and private citizens can and do speak out against
 the Government. Although the Public Order Act and other laws prohibit actions that
 are likely to incite racial antagonism, there were no reported arrests for such public
 statements.
 The Government has broad discretionary powers to impose restrictions on press
 freedom, and their past use, combined with traditional deference to authority, serves
 to encourage media self-censorship. In late 1994, senior media representatives cre-
 ated the Fiji News Council as a response to periodic government complaints of lack
 of media accountability for its errors, a lack of recourse for those who felt they had
 been wronged, and a perceived threat that a media watchdog body might be im-
 posed. However, this Council has only limited participation by media organizations,
 and it has met with considerable opposition from journalists.
 The only reported case of press restriction was a judicial writ against one news-
 paper to cease publishing the contents of a government commissions report on the
 Vatakoula gold mine. A court granted the mining company an injunction against the
 newspaper on the grounds that the press had surreptitiously obtained the
 u ngazetted report.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA, all newspapers must
 be registered with the Government before they can begin publishing. Although the
 Government has never used the PCA, the Act nevertheless gives the Minister of In-
 formation sole discretionary power to order a newspaper to publish a "correcting
 statement" if, in the Minister's opinion, a false or distorted article has been pub-
 
 
 608
 lished. Should the newspaper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, the Gov-
 ernment can bring suit. If found guilty, the newspaper may be fined approximately
 $700 (individual persons convicted under the Act may be fined approximately $150
 or imprisoned for 6 months). The PCA allows the Government to arrest anyone who
 publishes "malicious" material. This includes anything the Government considers
 false news which could create or foster public alarm or result in "detriment to the
 public."
 The media operate without prior censorship but with considerable self-censorship.
 Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government but rarely do in-
 vestigative reporting they widely report statements about the political situation
 made by opposition figures and foreign governments. The letters columns of the two
 daily newspapers frequently contain political statements from a wide cross section
 of society, including members of the deposed preoup government, who are highly
 critical of the Government, its programs, and the Constitution. Criticism, albeit
 muted, of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is appearing more fre-
 quently. However, the Government still views comments about indivdual chiefs
 with disfavor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an af1il-
 iate of the regional Pacific Islands News Association (PINA). Both FIMA and PINA
 are pressing or better training and the establishment of codes of ethnics for journal-
 ists. In a show of tangible support for strengthening the media, the Government has
 unconditionally prvided space for housing the Fiji Journalism Training Institute.
 The advent of television has raised the specter of censorship, openly advocated by
 the former head of the powerful Methodist Church and others. News production has
 shifted from the Government's video unit to production by the privately owned and
 operated Fiji One Television.
 While academic freedom is respected, the Government has effectively deterred
 university employees from participation in domestic politics. Since 1991 staff mem-
 bers of the Fiji-based University of the South Pacific must take leave if they run
 for public office and must resign their university positions if elected. Senior staff
 may not hold office in political parties. Student groups are free to organize and do
 so-
 b. Freedom of Peacefild Assembly and Association.The Constitution provides the
 right to assemble for political purposes, subject to restrictions in the interest of pub-
 lic order. District officers must issue permits for public gatherings. The Government
 does not always grant permits for large outdoor political meetings or  demonstra-
 tions, particularly if the police advise of difficulties with the anticipated crowd size
 or their ability to assure public safety.
 The Government routinely issued permits for rallies organized by political parties,
 religious groups, and groups opposed to government policies. There was no Govern-
 ment interference in, and permits were issued for, l e rallies against a govern-
 ment decision to lif t the Sunday observance decree (banning all organized porting
 and commercial activities on Sundays), as well as for a march condemning France's
 decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific region.
 All opposition party headquarters operate without government interference. Politi-
 cal organizations operate and issue public statements and they did so repeatedly
 and openly throughout the year.
 c.oFreedom of  eiin.-The Constitutional provision of freedom of religion is
 honored in practice. The Government does not restrict foreign clergy and missionalry
 activity or other typical activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Airport security occasionally detains travelers at the airport, but
 the courts order redress where this is warranted. Citizens are free to emigrate, and
 an estimated 40,000 have done so since 1987. The Government does not restrict
 their return if they choose to do so. It has in fact encouraged those who left after
 the political coups to return. There arino refugees and no forced resettlement pro-
 grams.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitutional provisions ensuring political dominance by ethnic Fijians, pri-
 marilh through race-based voting rolls and representationin cParliament, abridge
 the rght of citizens to change their government. Moreover, the Constitution was
 promulgated by a nonelected interim government and has never been ap proved by
 a national referendum. At year's end, the Constitution was under review by a three-
 member independent commission. The commission has received hundreds of submis-
 sions and held dozens of hearings. Many presentations have offered thoughtful ideas
 
 
 609
 to ameliorate racial divides and forge a stable, peaceful, and prosperous future. Oth-
 ers, including that of the ruling party (the SVT or Fijian Political Party), have taken
 less positive approaches. The SVT urged the commission to ensure ethnic Fijian con-
 trol over Fiji's political process and government, backed by unchallenged ethnic con-
 trol of the military.
 The Constitution provides for ethnic Fijian dominance of the Government by pro-
 viding them with 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower house of Parliament. Ind-
 Fijians are accorded 27 seats, Rotumans (culturally distinct Polynesians) 1, and all
 others 5. In the Senate (an appointed body with essentially review powers and the
 right to veto legislation), ethnic Fijians hold 24 of the 34 seats, Rotumans 1, and
 the other groups 9. Other constitutional features designed to ensure ethnic Fijian
 dominance include a requirement that the Prime Minister be an ethnic Fijian and
 selection procedures which virtually ensure that the President will also be an ethnic
 Fijian.
 The Constitution also incorporates a bill of rights, providing for freedom of speech,
 assembly, religion, and other universally accepted rights and freedoms. These rights
 may not be altered by Parliament except with the approval of two-thirds of the
 lower house. However, the Constitution gives Parliament the authority to pass spe-
 cial acts to deal with certain specified emergency situations, notwithstanding
 human rights guarantees found in other sections of the Constitution. The Attorney
 General's office has taken the view that any legislation introduced under the emer-
 gency powers provision would require the approval of two-thirds of the lower house.
 Critics of the Constitution maintain that only a simple majority would be needed
 and that indigenous Fijians in the lower house would be able, solely on the strength
 of their own numbers, to abrogate constitutional human rights protections. Neither
 interpretation has been tested.
 The Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), a traditional Fijian leadership body, selects
 the President. He appoints the Fijian members of the Senrte on the advice of the
 -CC and the provincial councils and the nine members from other races on his own
 judgment. He appoints the one Rotuman senator on the advice of the Rotuman
 Council. The President chooses the Prime Minister (who, along with the Cabinet,
 holds most of the executive authority) from among the ethnic Fijian members of the
 lower house on the basis of ability to command majority support within that body.
 Elections are held by secret ballot, with voting only by communal constituencies.
 The Constitution calls for elections every 5 years, but the Government may call an
 election at any time as it did for the snap general election in February 1994 after
 failing to pass its 1994 budget. That election, considered free and fair by all observ-
 ers, returned Rabuka and his party to Parliament in strength, and Rabuka was
 again selected as Prime Minister.
 The Constitution provides for a formal review of its provisions within 7 years of
 its promulgation and every 10 years thereafter. This review process began in 1992
 with the creation of an expanded subcabinet committee led by then-Deputy Prime
 Minister Bole. The committee included representatives of the opposition National
 Federation Party (NFP). It formulated terms of reference, which were adopted by
 Parliament in September 1993, for an independent review commission, to include
 impartial foreign advisors. Parliament created its own Joint Select Committee and
 an independent three-member review commission, which began its work in June
 and is currently hearing submissions on proposed changes to the Constitution. It is
 scheduled to present its recommendations by mid-1996. Those recommendations will
 have to be reviewed by the GCC and Parliament, which is responsible for proposing
 and passing changes.
 Fiji has more than a dozen political parties. Five are predominantly Indo-Fijian.
 The major Indo-Fijian ones, the National Federation Party (NFP) and the Fiji
 Labour Party (FLP) pledged to continue their opposition to the Constitution in Par-
 liament. NFP and FLP Indo-Fijian Parliamentarians are joined on the opposition
 side of the legislature by another ethnic Fijian party (the Fijian Association) and
 one "general" party (the General Electors Association).
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although some women achieve responsible positions in public serv-
 ice, politics, and business. Two women sit in Parliament; one is a cabinet minister.
 Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly system. The Presi-
 dent's wife is, in her own right, one of Fiji's three highest ranking chiefs. The former
 Minister for Fijian Affairs, a woman, was widely believed to be the best candidate
 to become Fiji's highest ranking traditional chief.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups which focus solely on human rights matters, but the
 women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political 0ou  includ-
 ing organized political parties) are engaged in promoting human ri ts.  ere are
 also several small, not very active, foreign-base organizations which concentrate on
 human rights causes in Fii, including the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with of-
 fices in New Zealand and Australia) and two United Kingdom-based groups, the
 International Fiji Movement and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 The Government in past years inhibited certain investigations of the political and
 human rights situation by external organizations, considering them to constitute ex-
 ternal interference in its domestic affairs. However, in 1995 it again allowed foreign
 representatives to attend and participate in the University of-the South Pacific's
 continuing "Consultation on the National Agenda," organized with the assistance of
 Conciliation Resources, which is located in London. These meetings roundly criti-
 cized many government policies and politicians as well as the Constitution. The
 views expressed were fully and prominently reported by the press.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of, and provides specific af-
 firmative action provisions for those disadvantaged as a result of, race, sex, place
 of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed. Enforcement of these constitu-
 tional provisions is attenuated by the Government's policy of using "affirmative ac-
 tion" to advance ethnic Fijians, and by traditional mores as to the roles and rights
 of women and children.
 Women.-Women in Fiji are actively addressing the problem of domestic violence.
 Reliable estimates indicate that 10 percent of women have been abused in some
 way. This abuse is a major focus of the women's movement. The authorities are gen-
 erally reluctant to intervene in cases of domestic violence unless necessary to save
 the woman's life. The victims generally do not press charges, and the Government
 has not been active in prosecuting domestic violence.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious punishment for rape convictions. Courts have imposed sentences which vary
 widely but are generally lenient. Women have sought to have all rape cases heard
 in the High Court, where sentencing limits are for longer periods.
 Suva, the capital, and Ba, the regional center, have privately funded women's cri-
 sis centers which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, domes-
 tic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is an overall
 growing awareness of the abuse of women's rights.
 Despite constitutional provisions, the Government practiced a form of sexual dis-
 crimination in the recognition of spousal and offspring rights. For example, spouses
 of Fiji'female citizens are not automatically granted residence, whereas spouses of
 Fiji male citizens are. Children of female ethnic Fijians married to nonethnic Fijians
 are not entitled to registry in the document governing which persons share in in-
 come from communal ownership of native lands, and which stipulates who may vote
 as an ethnic Fijian, and who may hold ethnic Fijian-designated seats in Parliament.
 Men, however, confer ethnic Fijian status on their offspring regardless of the moth-
 er's ethnic background. In a high-profile 1992 court challenge to the registration re-
 strictions, the son of a Chinese father and ethnic Fijian mother won his appeal to
 be registered as an ethnic Fijian. The long-term effects of the decision on registra-
 tion restrictions and, thus, a woman's right to pass on her ethnic status remain un-
 clear.
 In general, women in the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence
 in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian community. Women have full
 rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is espe-
 cially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female,
 are subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower than that in other sec-
 tors.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare but has
 limited financial resources to carry out this commitment. In addition, the legal sys-
 tem is at times inadequate to protect the rights of children, as children's testimony
 is inadmissible unless corroborated by an adult. Societal changes have undermined
 the traditional village and extended family based social structures--an outgrowth
 of this has been a child abuse problem. The Government in 1993 created a Child
 Welfare Committee to address these problems, but it is likely to remain reluctant
 to become involved directly in what are generally perceived to be "family matters."
 
 
 Corporal punishment is widely administered in schools and at home. The Ministry
 of Education has guidelines for the administration of such punishment by principals
 and head teachers. In 1993 one principal was fired for overstepping these guide-
 lines. There are credible reports that not all abuses are reported or punished.
 People With Disabilities.-Legal discrimination against physically disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, and the provision of other state services does not
 exist. However, there is no legislation or mandated provision for accessibility for the
 disabled. Several small voluntary organizations promote greater attention to the
 needs of the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of the 1987 military
 coups was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 p rotect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. To this end, the
 Government initiated a number of constitutional and other measures to ensure eth-
 nic Fjian control of the legislative and executive branches (see Section 3). The Gov-
 ernment also successfully increased the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans
 in the public service to 50 percent or higher at all levels, but most dramatically at
 the senior level: Indo-Fijians represent only 10 percent of the highest levels of the
 civil service. As a result, some Indo-Fijians justifiably complained of a "glass ceiling"
 whereby, despite their experience and higher educational achievements, they are
 promoted onlly to middle management levels of the civil service.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. Ethnic Fijians currently hold,
 communally, about 83 percent of the land, the State holds another 8 percent, and
 only the remaining 9 percent is in the hands of nonethnic Fijians. The British colo-
 nial administration instituted the present land ownership arrangements to protect -
 the interests of the indigenous Fijians whose traditional beliefs, cultural values, and
 self-identity are tied to the land. Most cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians, who lease
 land from the ethnic Fijian landowners through the Native Lands Trust Board.
 Many Indo-Fijians, particularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land ten-
 ure discriminates against them. Between 1997 and 2000, most current leases will
 expire. A review of the current land tenure and leasing arrangements is underway,
 with all indications that the Government will make few changes to the existing sys-
 tem. Some landowners are likely to decline to renew leases; the Government has
 acknowledged its responsibility to help relocate displaced Indo-Fijian farmers, al-
 though it has few resources to offer.
 Indo-Fijians are subject to occasional harassment and crime based on race, which
 is compounded by inadequate police protection. There have been no credible allega-
 tions of government involvement in such incidents, which the police have inves-
 tigated, sometimes resulting in arrests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law protects the right of workers to form and
 join unions, elect their own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters,
 and determine their own policies, and the authorities respect these rights in prac-
 tice. However, the law permits restrictions to be applied in government employment
 and in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health, or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. An estimated 19 per-
 cent of the labor force is unionized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labor Party until mid-1992. It currently takes
 a more independent political stance. The FTUC is free to associate internationally
 and does so. The labor movement is led largely by Indo-Fijians, with ethnic Fijians
 beginning to assume leadership roles. Persons with close ties to the Government
 have organized rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these unions are more ame-
 nable to political cooperation with the Government.
 Following several years in which confrontational tactics have marred labor-gov-
 ernment relations, Parliament in April 1994 completed a 2-year process of reforming
 labor legislation by amending seveial acts. The changes include the elimination of
 a ban on a person holding multiple union officer positions and the elimination of
 restrictions on seeking international support on labor issues. Subsequently, the
 FTUC returned to participation in the Government's Tripartite Economic Strategies
 Committee.
 Strikes are legal, except in connection with union recognition disputes. The Gov-
 ernment remains involved in certifying union strike balloting, which can be an
 elaborate process given the distance between some of the island locations. The Min-
 istry of Labor had recorded six legal strikes as of September 15. Other strikes, such
 as by the sugar cane truck drivers and sugar mill workers, were declared illegal for
 failure to conduct a proper strike vote. The illegal strike by the unrecognized Fiji
 
 
 Mine Workers' Union at the Vatakoula gold mine, which began in 1991, continued
 and was at the center of a government commission of inquiry. The commission's re-
 port had been sent to the Cabinet but not to the Parliament by year's end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is deter-
 mined by union membership rather than by an election. The Government has the
 power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so. Key sec-
 tors of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Following
 the May 1992 return to accountable government, the Government lifted wage guide-
 lines, and unrestricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 Wage negotiations are conducted on an individual company or enterprise basis
 rather than on an industrywide basis. A government proposal to introduce such ne-
 gotiations has been opposed by employers and unions.
 The law specifically prohibits antiunio discrimination. In practice the unions are
 generally successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union activi-
 ties, but the law does not mandate that employers reinstate fired workers.
 Export processing zones (EPZ's) are subject to the same law as the rest of the
 country, and unions have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with many
 EPZ firms.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there is no indication that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Children under the age of 12 may
 not be employed in any caaiy."hldren" (under age 15) and "Young Personsw
 (ages 15 to 17) may not be employed in industry or work with machinery. Enforce-
 ment by the Ministry of Labor and Industrial Relations is generally effective, except
 for family members working on family farms or businesses and "self-employed"
 young homelessyouths. Education is not mandatory.
 e. Acceptable (Conditions of Work-There is no national minimum wage. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labor and Industrial Relations,
 which effectively enforces them. Minimum wage levels will generally support a bare-
 ly adequate standard of living for a worker and family in all sectors except for the
 garment industry, in which the starting hourly wage, $0.50 (F$0.72) for learners
 and $0.65 (F$0.94) for others, is based on the assumption that workers are young
 adults or married women living at home and not supporting a household.
 Fiji has no regulations specifying maximum hours of work for adult meales.
 Women are prohibited from night work in factories (other than overtime work in
 the garment industry) and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably
 transprtation and shipping, have violated prvisions relating to excessive hours of
 work. Indo-Fijians, who generally require a cash income to survive, are more vulner-
 able to pressure to work long hours than are ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians
 can and do return to a noncash economy way of life in their villages rather than
 work what they consider excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a Workmens' Compensation Act, and an ac-
 cident compensation plan. Awards to workers injured on the job are set by a tribu-
 nal. Government enforement of safety standards under the direction of the Labor
 Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcment personnel, but unions do a rea-
 sonable job of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's 1992 recommendations cited the need to improve
 working conditions, particularly in the garment industry. The Government has pre-
 ardgisltion to address some of these shortcomings, but parliamentary action
 has ~o no ee  opltd
