 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a democratic. country which prides itself on the
 protection which it affords human rights. The economy is
 highly developed and the Austrian standard of living compares
 favorably with that of any other West European country. The
 Austrian Stat-e-Tre-aty and the federal Constitution mandate the
 freedom of ttre individual and basic civil and political
 liberties.
 The right of the individual to the integrity of his person is
 well respected in Austria. All mature and mentally competent
 Austrian citizens have the right to vote, except for persons
 sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment, who may not
 vote for a period of five years following release from
 incarceration. Civil rights are respected.
 A unique and significant aspect of human rights in Austria is
 the role which Austria plays as a country of asylum for
 .refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This has
 included an active program of assistance to refugees pending
 their acceptance by countries of final settlement. The
 Austrians have also facilitated the transit of Jewish emigrants
 from the Soviet Union.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are no reports of Austrian police authorities engaging in
 politically-motivated killing. Rightwing organizations during
 the spring and summer of 1982 detonated several explosive
 devices near the homes or businesses of prominent Austrian
 citizens of Jewish heritage. A West German rightwing terrorist
 has been arrested in connection with these explosions, and
 several Austrians have been implicated, although not yet
 formally charged by the authorities. The terrorists'
 motivation appears to have been anti-semitism.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abductions either by Government
 authorities or terrorist groups in Austria during the reporting
 period.
 c. Torture
 Torture was banned by an imperial decree of January 2, 1776,
 and by the incorporation into Austrian law on September 3, 1958
 of article 3 of the Convention of the Protection of Human
 Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There have been no
 allegations of torture by Austrian authorities.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is
 prohibited by article 3 of the European Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which has
 been part of the Austrian Constitution since 1958. There have
 been no reports of such treatment by Austrian authorities.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitutional law of 1862 on the protection of personal
 freedom and article 5 of the European Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, both of
 which are part of the Austrian Constitution, prohibit arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment.   Austrian law does not provide for
 preventive detention as such, but does provide for
 investigative detention. Austria has administrative arrest
 procedures for petty offenses, such as disturbance of the peace
 and traffic violations, as well as detention procedures pending
 deportation. The period of such arrest is regulated and
 limited by law. Detention pending deportation may not exceed
 three months. A law provides for control of these proceedings
 by either the administrative or the constitutional court.
 Arrested persons may be placed in pre-trial, investigative
 detention after a finding by an investigative judge that
 substantial grounds exist for an investigation. The period of
 detention pending completion of an investigation is limited to
 six months which may be extended for up to one year. In cases
 involving a major crime, calling for a minimum sentence of ten
 years, the extension may be for up to two years. Formal,
 clearly stated charges are brought at the completion of the
 investigation, and trial follows speedily. Grounds for
 investigative detention are limited to possible tampering with
 evidence and influencing of witnesses, recommission of a
 similar crime, or potential flight from Austria.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution, the
 European Human Rights Convention, and the Austrian Criminal
 Procedure Code. The judiciary is fully independent of the
 military and the executive. The right to appeal to a higher
 court is guaranteed by pertinent provisions of the Austrian
 code of criminal procedure. Defendants have a right to
 effectfve counsel. Charges are clearly and formally stated.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 A search warrant, issued by a judge, is required for entry of a
 private residence without consent. In the event of rational
 grounds for the presumption of a public hazard or in pursuit of
 a fugitive from justice, the police may enter private premises
 without a warrant. Freedom from invasion of the home is
 guaranteed by law.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is guaranteed by the Austrian
 Constitution, and fully exercised. There is no censorship of
 any kind in Austria.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Fundamental Law on the Rights of Citizens of 1867
 establishes the right to assemble and associate freely. The
 Austrian State Treaty of 1955, however, prohibits the existence
 and activities of fascist and Nazi organizations on Austrian
 territory. As a practical matter, the Government has not
 banned any organizations nor has it forbidden specific
 activities of right-wing organizations, although this
 possibility is frequently discussed. Public demonstrations by
 any organization require the issuance of a permit by the police
 authorities. Such permits are normally granted, with due

 consideration for public safety. The Austrian trade union
 federation and its fifteen constituent unions play a vital role
 in the social partnership (an informal, extralegal arrangement
 among Government, management, and labor which has determined
 the course of the Austrian economy since the mid-1950's).
 Unions have the right to organize workers, to negotiate annual
 wage agreements and to strike; these rights are rarely
 exercised. The unions are controlled through democratic
 processes. Many Government officials are trade union leaders,
 including three cabinet ministers who are presidents of
 national unions and the president of the lower house of
 parliament, who is at the same time president of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation. Trade union membership totals
 approximately 1.66 million or nearly 60 percent of the work
 force. There have been no reports of any harassment or
 intimidation of any union or professional association.
 National unions and the Austrian trade union federation are
 members of a number of international bodies. The international
 labor organization has not expressed any concern about trade
 union freedom in Austria.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Fundamental Law on the Rights
 of Citizens of 1867. There is complete freedom of religion in
 Austria, and most of the world's major religions are
 represented. There is no state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The right to freedom of movement is guaranteed by law within
 Austria. No area of the country is closed to travel on either
 a permanent or a temporary basis, except for military
 facilities. There is no restriction on emigration or reentry
 for former Austrian citizens who wish to return to Austria.
 Austria is a country of asylum for refugees from Eastern Europe
 and the Soviet Union. The Government of Austria has imposed a
 visa requirement for most countries of Eastern Europe, making
 it somewhat more difficult for an intending refugee to obtain
 admission to Austria. Once in Austria, refugees are not
 forcibly returned to their homelands.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 This right is protected by the Austrian Constitution and by the
 Law on Political Parties of 1975, which forms part of the
 Austrian Constitution. All Austrian citizens over the age of
 nineteen are eligible to participate in elections and as a
 matter of practice a large percentage of the population does
 participate. There are three major parties (Socialist Party of
 Austria, Austrian People's Party, and the Freedom Party of
 Austria) as well as several dozen smaller parties. The
 Austrian political process is a lively one and is responsive to
 the voice of the electorate. Women are encouraged to
 participate actively in politics, although in practice far
 fewer women than men hold political office.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for investigations of Austria's
 human rights record by major, non-governmental human rights
 organizations.
 
 
 845
 Austria has deposited a declaration with the Secretary General
 of the Council of Europe recognizing the competence of the
 Human Rights Commission in Strasbourg under Article 25 of the
 European Convention to receive petitions from any person or
 persons claiming to be a victim of the violation of the rights
 set forth in the convention. It also undertakes not to hinder
 the effective exercise of these rights. Thus persons believing
 that their rights have been infringed by the Austrian
 authorities may bring the matter before the Commission.
 Amnesty International is quite active in Austria. Its primary
 concern is with human rights violations in other countries.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The benefits of Austria's economic, social, and educational
 system are available to all Austrian residents, irrespective of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 With per capita gross national product at $10,229 per annum
 (1980), most Austrians are able to meet their daily needs
 without difficulty. The availability of health care is
 indicated by the present life expectancy of 72.4 years at birth
 and the infant mortality rate of 13.9/1000. The population
 growth rate is only .1 percent. The adult literacy rate is 99
 percent, and the primary school enrollment ratio was also 99
 percent.
