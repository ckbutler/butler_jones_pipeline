 HUNGARY
 The Hungarian Socialist Workers (Communist) Party maintains a
 monopoly on political power. The party leadership rules the
 country through the Council of Ministers (executive branch)
 and the National Assembly (legislative branch). The Soviet
 Union has over 60,000 troops stationed in Hungary.
 The secret police and other coercive institutions are active
 and powerful. Through the 1968 Police Surveillance Law and
 subsequent decrees strengthening the powers of the police, the
 authorities have ample means to enforce party policy and state
 control over the activities of the population.
 As a result of party policy initiated in the 1960's launching
 of economic reforms and fostering increased personal economic
 well-being, Hungarians now enjoy a relatively high standard of
 living in Eastern Europe. Moreover, Hungary remains the most
 tolerant and innovative of the East European Warsaw Pact
 countries in the internal economic and political arrangements
 used to maintain control. In recent years, the regime has
 increasingly staked its legitimacy on an ability to deliver
 goods and services more succesfully than elsewhere in Eastern
 Europe. However, recent problems, e.g., slow economic growth
 and the high foreign debt burden, led the Government in
 September to announce austerity measures, including personal
 income and value-added taxes and price increases, which will
 cause the standard of living to fall.
 Hungary's human rights record in 1987 continued to be flawed
 but has not deteriorated since 1986. The police have
 harassed, searched, convicted, and fined dissidents for
 various activities, such as publishing uncensored underground
 materials. They have sometimes denied dissidents passports
 for travel abroad and broken up unauthorized public
 demonstrations. Since the mid-1970's, however, the
 authorities have refrained from imprisoning dissidents, most
 of whom participate regularly in political and other
 discussions in private gatherings and are not prevented from
 traveling abroad.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence that killing for political reasons
 occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No known instances of torture have occurred in Hungary in
 recent years. Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints
 against the police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse," which allows some privileges, such as visiting,
 outside work, and leaving; "jail," which is more punitive; and
 "prison," which means a maximum-security penitentiary.
 
 
 936
 HUNGARY
 Confinement conditions vary in relation to the category of
 incarceration, but all levels are believed to provide adequate
 diet and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying
 degrees of frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment,
 prisoners have rights to visitation by family members, other
 relatives, and friends. While there does not appear to be
 systematic mistreatment of prisoners, there are possible
 exceptions. Zsolt Keszthelyi, who was sentenced in April to 3
 years' imprisonment (reduced in May to 2 1/2 years) for
 refusing compulsory military service on political grounds, has
 reportedly been incarcerated together with felons and beaten
 while in custody.
 The Hungarian authorities have rarely engaged in abuse of
 psychiatry, i.e., the commitment of sane persons to
 institutions for the mentally ill as a form of punishment, and
 there were no reports of such practice in 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Citizens are generally not subject to arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of the offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed and may be held at
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial
 liberty. In cases of suspicion for major crimes, a person may
 be held in jail for 30 days before trial, and this period may
 be renewed twice for a maximum of 3 months.
 The penal code contains an article on incitement which permits
 officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances or
 statements. It is not clear how many cases of incitement
 involve political matters. A vaguely worded penal code
 provision concerning espionage allows the authorities to
 interpret broadly the kind of "data" which may not be conveyed
 to a foreign government or organization. The Police
 Surveillance Law was strengthened in 1985 to permit the police
 to place under surveillance or in internal exile any citizen
 or resident of Hungary above the age of 16 for a period of 2
 years, renewable for an additional year, if that person's
 attitude is judged to represent a permanent danger to the
 internal order or public security of the country. There is no
 indication that the law was used for political purposes in
 1987.
 Under an amendment to the penal code which went into effect in
 1985, a person "who is capable of working but follows a way of
 life of vagrancy" may be punished by loss of liberty for up to
 2 years, by reformatory and educative labor, or by a fine.
 Under this law, "work-shirkers" may be sentenced to a specific
 workplace, such as a state farm, a mine, or the state
 railways. Although Gypsies have been prosecuted under this
 law, there is no evidence of its use against political
 dissidents. There have been no reports of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are few closed trials in Hungary.' The Constitution
 stipulates that all court proceedings are open, except for
 cases specifically exempted by law. Those which are closed
 usually involve "national security," not otherwise defined.
 In general, judicial procedures are investigatory rather than
 adversarial in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defendants
 have the right to choose their own counsel. Nonpolitical
 
 
 937
 HUNGARY
 trials are more likely to be handled in an impartial manner
 than are trials involving offenses considered to be political.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, the secrecy of correspondence, and the privacy
 of the home, but these provisions are violated when it is in
 the State's interest to do so. Search warrants are generally
 obtained. House searches are conducted by a court order and
 must be carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A
 written inventory of items removed from the premises must be
 prepared. These procedures are generally adhered to. In
 politically motivated cases, however, police have been known
 to conduct house searches without warrants on the pretext of
 "suspected housing code violations."
 Since the 1960's, Hungarian authorities have become more
 tolerant with respect to a person's private activities.
 Formal systems for gathering information on people, such as
 the widespread use of informers and block wardens and overt
 intrusions of the police into the daily life of persons, have
 been substantially curtailed. It is widely assumed, however,
 that the authorities tap private telephone lines and open
 correspondence when they have an interest to do so. They also
 use job-related sanctions and occasional harassment, control
 of duplicating machines, searches and seizures of printing
 materials, and penalties for persons without officially
 approved employment as means of exerting social control.
 Hungarians may subscribe to Western publications although such
 subscriptions are relatively expensive. Parents who provide
 religious instruction to their children in their homes are not
 harassed. Membership in the Communist party or in party youth
 and other organizations is not mandatory, though the absence
 of membership may have an adverse impact upon career
 possibilities in some fields. Nonetheless, membership in
 youth organizations seems to have declined substantially.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and a free press,
 but these provisions are qualified by the need to conform to
 the "interests of socialism and the people." The Government
 has shown a general willingness to tolerate some expressions
 of dissent without making an explicit reply or rejoinder.
 The Prime Minister told an international press conference on
 September 18 that the Government is open to dialog with those
 who hold opposing views but not with those who do not respect
 the law. He stated that the authorities assume those who hold
 differing views also are interested in advancing the
 development of the country, although by using different
 methods and instruments. The regime, therefore, maintains a
 distinction between well-intentioned and hostile opposition,
 and political expression remains subject to rigorous scrutiny
 and substantial control.
 The Government is prepared to harass political dissidents to
 keep them in check and has occasionally expelled them or
 encouraged their departure to the -West. No prominent
 dissidents were arrested in 1987 for opposition activity,
 
 
 938
 HUNGARY
 although several faced potential jail terms for having failed
 to pay fines for various alleged offenses, including improper
 receipt of child payments and possession of an unauthorized
 mimeograph machine. In all cases, however, tacit compromises
 were achieved between these persons and the authorities which
 avoided jail terms, even though the fines were not paid.
 Identified dissident activity in Hungary remains largely
 confined to several hundred intellectuals who live primarily
 in Budapest. Hungarian dissidents meet regularly for private
 discussion of political and other topics. Two documents
 circulating almost openly during 1987 merit particular
 mention: the 60-page special edition of the samizdat
 (self-published) Beszelo entitled "The Social Contract:
 Prerequisites for Resolving the Political Crisis," and a
 7-page September 8 "open letter" to members of the Hungarian
 Parliament from over 100 prominent intellectuals, including
 some members of the opposition. "The Social Contract"
 included what amounts to a listing of deficiencies in
 Hungarian human rights performance: one-party rule outside of
 legal checks and controls, arbitrary censorship, and the lack
 of cooperative trade unions or freedom of association. The
 "open letter" pointed out that the reconciliation of diverse
 interests within Hungary is not aimed at achieving democracy
 and is unable to secure consensus or strengthen governmental
 power. The documents were focal points for dialog between the
 opposition and the regime, which included a letter from the
 Prime Minister to a signer of the open letter, a public
 meeting in late September attended by the Secretary General of
 the Patriotic People's Front, and other private meetings.
 Several groups of dissidents are active in the preparation and
 distribution of prohibited books and articles in samizdat form.
 More established samizdat journals, such as Beszelo,
 experienced limited harassment during 1987, including a March
 11 police raid in which 100 copies of the latest issue were
 confiscated. Demokrata coeditors suffered house searches and
 some confiscations of manuscripts and printed materials.
 Two-thirds of a freshly printed edition of Demokrata was
 confiscated by 20 policemen on the evening of August 27. The
 printing press of the fledgling Egtajak Kozott (Between the
 Posts) was confiscated on May 26 and July 13, and a large
 quantity of copies was also seized on April 1. Gabor Demszky,
 an editor of Hirmondo, was detained overnight June 29 after
 police stopped him for "illegally" parking his car near his
 Budapest apartment. The police used the opportunity to seize
 a number of copies of a novel by the Czech emigre author Milan
 Kundera which was being translated into Hungarian.
 Party and government authorities closely supervise the press,
 radio, and television, all of which are government owned. All
 must adhere to the party's ideological guidelines. While
 carefully nuanced differing views appear in the press, they
 are usually well within the general constraints imposed by the
 party; direct criticism of the Government and party is not
 permitted. By East European standards, Hungary permits
 substantial access to Western literature, films, television
 programs, and publications. Major Western periodicals,
 including the International Herald Tribune, Le Monde, The
 Times, and Die Presse, are available for local currency at
 selected kiosks and transportation centers.
 Western viewpoints can infrequently be heard on Hungarian
 radio and television, which tend, like Hungarian newspapers,
 to establish their editorial lines through appropriate
 
 
 939
 HUNGARY
 selective quotation from Western and other Eastern press
 agencies and sources. The views of Western spokesmen have
 been broadcast together with those of other participants in
 panel discussions, and there is straight reporting of Western
 officials' comments on issues such as U.S.-Soviet arms talks.
 Hungary does not normally jam Western radio broadcasts.
 Austrian and Yugoslav radio and television broadcasts reach
 much of the country.
 Pervasive self-censorship supplements formal censorship in
 determining the boundaries of free expression. The Hungarian
 army's chief censor said in an interview in the April 14
 official newspaper Magyar Hirlap that the Constitution
 "guarantees" freedom of the press and, accordingly, everyone
 has the right to publish his or her ideas through the press,
 provided that they do not contravene the Constitution. De
 facto guidelines provided by the 1986 press law have had a
 mixed impact.
 Film is the public medium which enjoys the greatest degree of
 freedom of political expression. Significantly, Hungarian
 films are produced before undergoing governmental review for
 public showing. This means that the making of controversial
 films is not prohibited, but politically controversial
 productions may be kept from public view for years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, governmental approval or tacit
 acceptance is required for the exercise of such rights. For
 example, the police in January confiscated an art exhibit
 commemorating the 1956 revolution, but on March 15 deftly
 handled a major demonstration and march commemorating the 1848
 revolution. The Government allowed the erection and
 dedication on May 15 of a major Budapest monument to missing
 Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of
 Hungarian Jews prior to his 1945 arrest by the Soviets. A
 Western ambassador, however, was denied permission to address
 the gathering. Heavy police presence at the dedication
 ceremonies symbolized official unease and was responsible for
 limiting public attendance. While demonstrations were for the
 most part handled without resort to force, about 70-80 police
 physically broke up a wreathlaying ceremony on June 16 at
 Budapest's Batthyany Memorial commemorating former Prime
 Minister Imre Nagy's death and used low-level force to disrupt
 a June 23 demonstration which had the same purpose. The
 significant police presence may have contributed to heading
 off demonstrations for the October 23 anniversary of the 1956
 uprising.- In general, the authorities remain more tolerant of
 gatherings in private homes.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council, the largest of all
 mass organizations, is for the most part controlled and
 directed by the party. It serves the purpose of indoctrinating
 workers in party policy as well as representing worker
 interests within certain bounds. The chairman of the council
 is a member of the party Politburo. He represents the council
 in meetings with the party leadership and with the Government
 over labor policy, economic planning, prices, wages, and other
 economic issues. At the local and enterpr-ise level, the
 council has a veto right over state nominations of managers
 and administers a system of distribution of bonuses, profit
 sharing, enterprise-controlled housing, health care, union
 vacation plans, and other benefits. Stewards can veto
 
 
 940
 HUNGARY
 management decisions on personnel actions, plant safety, and
 other work-related issues which do not comply with collective
 agreements and labor regulations. Disputed questions are
 referred to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Constitution does not provide for the right to strike.
 Although work stoppages have reportedly taken place in local
 industries in recent years, there has not been a major strike
 affecting an entire industrial sector in over a quarter of a
 century.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are ensured in the Constitution, they are subject to
 restrictions. The State in principle opposes but does not
 rigorously impede the practice of religion. Steadfastly
 committed to atheism, the authorities for tactical reasons
 profess the acceptability of believers and nonbelievers working
 together in the interest of "Socialist society." All
 denominations that will accept the Socialist state are
 officially recognized. The Government has generally
 maintained good relations with the hierarchies of the major
 religious denominations, many of which have representatives in
 the Parliament. The profession of religious beliefs, however,
 can limit the citizen's advancement in government, industry,
 and the professions. Party members and those in the teaching
 profession are not allowed to be active religious
 practitioners.
 Religious denominations in Hungary have generally good access
 to religious materials, including Bibles and prayer books. In
 many cases, they print their own. They also publish
 periodicals and newspapers. The State sets numerical limits
 and imposes censorship on books, but for some smaller
 denominations the main limiting factor is financing.
 Churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent.
 However, a growing number of primarily young believers have
 formed loosely affiliated, grass-roots organizations called
 "basic communities," which function outside or on the
 periphery of official church structures. The authorities have
 not detained or arrested clergy, but over 100 young men were
 sentenced to prison terms ranging up to 3 years for refusing
 military service. The right of conscientious objection to
 military service is recognized for two denominations, the
 Nazarenes and the Seventh-Day Adventists, because it is a
 precept of these religions.
 The major religions have theological training institutes,
 though limits are imposed on the number of seminarians. The
 State permits construction of some new places of worship. At
 the request of the late Catholic primate, Cardinal Lekai, a
 new church was built and dedicated in 1987 in a fast growing
 suburb of Budapest. In the last 20 years, approximately 50
 new Baptist churches have been built in Hungary. The Baptist
 construction, partially funded by overseas contributions,
 illustrates the close connections Hungarians maintain with
 their coreligionists and hierarchies in other countries.
 Religious leaders may generally travel abroad so long as they
 have adequate hard currency resources for the purpose.
 
 
 941
 HUNGARY
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet, which they
 must carry at all times. They must register with local police
 when moving from one locality to another. However, no
 permission is required for moving within Hungary, except to
 Budapest, where overcrowding has led the Government to
 restrict the number of new inhabitants.
 Foreign travel is relatively easy, the chief constraint being
 restrictions on the amount of hard currency available.
 Hungarian citizens may travel freely in Eastern Europe, with
 visas required only for the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. They
 may travel to the West on family visits once a year if
 relatives abroad pay the costs. Nonfamily trips are allowed
 every 3 years, and a modest hard currency allotment is
 available. According to Hungarian sources, 5.2 million
 Hungarians--Hungary's population is 10.6 million--traveled
 abroad in 1984, 5.5 million in 1985, and 6.2 million in 1986.
 The Government, however, reserves the right to refuse
 permission to travel in cases of *state security."
 Officially, some 0.2 percent of passport requests have been
 refused, or between 4,200 and 5,200 per year. The authorities
 continue to invoke security provisions of the law as grounds
 for denying or impeding passport issuance to a small number of
 dissidents. On the other hand, Sandor Racz, Budapest's 1956
 Workers' Council leader, was allowed to leave Hungary for the
 first time to travel to the United States as a guest of the
 American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
 Organizations.
 In October, amid considerable publicity, the authorities
 announced details of a new passport regulation taking effect
 on January 1, 1988, which abolishes exit visa requirements but
 requires that the traveler have a passbook showing sufficient
 legally acquired foreign currency. Passports will be valid
 for 5 years for travel to any country. Passport applications
 reportedly will be simplified and distributed at 135 police
 stations rather than at police headquarters only. Although
 the new procedures should enable virtually any Hungarian with
 the requisite amount of legally acquired hard currency to
 travel abroad, the requirement for currency exchange
 certificates, as well as regulations providing for rejection
 of passport applications of persons subject to prosecution,
 could provide scope for manipulation and continued delays of
 passport requests.
 Emigration for those of working age is allowed only for
 reasons of family reunification, defined as joining a parent,
 spouse, or child abroad. It may be refused, if the relative
 is abroad without permission from the Government, until 5
 years have passed since that person's departure. However, the
 law provides for exceptions to all restrictions in individual
 cases, and persons who are refused permission to emigrate may
 appeal and reapply. Reapplications are sometimes successful,
 especially if there are special humanitaiian considerations.
 Approximately 90 percent of Hungarians who are eligible to
 apply to emigrate for purposes of family reunification receive
 permission. Permission is virtually guaranteed to a Hungarian
 over 55 years of age.
 Those who do not receive permission to emigrate normally
 suffer no official sanctions, such as loss of employment or
 
 
 942
 HUNGARY
 housing. Emigrants are allowed to take a modest amount of
 personal property with them. Persons who have emigrated
 legally from Hungary may apply to return for resettlement, but
 their right to return is not guaranteed. They must establish
 that there is housing and employment or other income available
 to them. Persons who have left Hungary illegally or who have
 defected are subject to criominasl penalties. Such persons
 may be tried in absentia and sentenced to the confiscation of
 their property and a suspended jail term of up to 3 years.
 Those charged with minor travel-related infractions may be
 denied permission to travel abroad for up to 5 years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens-
 to Change Their Government:
 Citizens are not free to change the system of government.
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers Party. Open political activity is not possible
 outside the party or party-sanctioned organizations. The
 party uses mass organizations such as the Patriotic People's
 Front, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League to elicit
 public support. To a growing extent, the party invites the
 opinions and recommendations of nonparty organizations (for
 example, cooperative associations) on policy proposals in
 which they have an interest, but implementation is at the
 discretion of the party.
 Official theorists are exploring the possibility of redefining
 the leading role of the Communist party in a more limited
 fashion. A party leader told a national conference on
 ideology in February that the Hungarian Socialist Workers
 Party, in pressing the hegemony of Marxism-Leninism on
 Hungarian society, nevertheless realized that a plurality of
 views continued to exist in that society.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to accept outside charges or
 investigations of alleged human rights violations on the
 grounds that this is "interference in internal affairs."
 Hungary has shown, however, a willingness to engage in
 discussions with other governments on all aspects of the
 Helsinki Final Act, including its human rights provisions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both in theory and in practice, Hungary is sensitive and
 responsive to the cultural aspirations of its recognized
 ethnic min6rities. Schools providing instruction in the
 mother tongu6 and varieties of ethnic expression are
 encouraged on a nondiscriminatory basis. A major reason for
 this policy is the hope of creating a "demonstration effect"
 which will indirectly benefit the millions of Hungarians
 living as minorities in adjacent countries. Although national
 minority groups are encouraged to form their own associations,
 nonnational groups do not enjoy the same degree of freedom.
 A large number of Gypsies (estimates range up to 5 percent of
 the population) live in Hungary. They are not recognized as
 an official minority. The Government engages in many programs
 specifically designed to raise the standard of living of
 Gypsies and to help them to be absorbed into the mainstream of
 
 
 943
 HUNGARY
 Hungarian life. However, Gypsies are, on the average,
 considerably less well educated and poorer than the majority
 Magyar population or the recognized ethnic minorities. Candid
 discussion continues to appear in the press and specialized
 literature about the social and economic difficulties
 experienced by Gypsies, including the fact that considerable
 popular prejudice against them exists.
 Women account for one-eighth of the management positions in
 Hungarian industry and agriculture. Approximately half of
 them attained these positions in the past 5 years. Women's
 share of senior positions, such as general director at state
 industrial complexes, is considerably lower. Women's share of
 professional positions has been increasing. About 8 percent of
 Hungarian women are professionals, compared to nearly 9
 percent of men.
 More than one-fifth of the members of the National Assembly
 are women. There are very few women at top levels in the
 Government or party. One member of the 23-person Council of
 Ministers and a cabinet-level official are women. In the
 19-member Presidential Council (collective presidency), there
 are 4 women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, with
 restrictions pertaining to shift and night work. There are no
 restrictions on minors older than 16 years of age. Although
 there is no national minimum wage in Hungary, wage charts are
 set for each profession according to the qualifications of the
 jobholder. The average official workweek is approximately 45
 hours. All Hungarians have a right to a minimum of 15 days'
 paid vacation per year; they are entitled to 1 additional day
 for each 3 years of service.
 
 
 944
