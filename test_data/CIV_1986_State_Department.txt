 COTE DIVOIRE
 Cote d'Ivoire, a former French colony which gained independence
 through a peaceful transfer of power in 1960, is a one-party
 state with a civilian government. Power is concentrated in
 the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PCDI) and its long-time
 leader, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, now 81 years old.
 Although the freedom to form other parties is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, in practice no other party has been allowed
 to participate in the political process. More open discussion
 of government policies has been permitted since the country's
 first competitive elections in 1980 for PCDI, municipal, and
 legislative positions. Membership in the party organs, the
 number of municipalities which have elected leadership, and
 the representation in the National Assembly have all steadily
 expanded in the last 26 years to reflect the growth and
 diversity of the Ivorian population. However, the unicameral
 National Assembly has never publicly challenged a policy put
 forth by the executive branch.
 The Ministry of Internal Security includes the Surete National
 and the Gendarmerie, the national police service structured
 along French lines. The Surete has an arm tasked with
 intelligence gathering and counterespionage responsibilities.
 The Gendarmerie is responsible for territorial security,
 especially in the rural areas.
 Cote d'Ivoire has enjoyed considerable economic development
 since independence, but poverty still prevails in much of the
 country. The Ivorian economy is market-oriented and open to
 foreign investment. During the 1980s Cote d'Ivoire has been
 squeezed by a heavy debt burden and flat prices for its exports
 on world markets. In response, the Government introduced
 austerity measures to offset reduced revenues. Gross domestic
 product rose by 4.7 percent in real terms in 1985.
 The human rights situation in Cote d'Ivoire remained generally
 satisfactory. The President continued to advocate "dialog" in
 settling disputes, generally seeking to involve dissenters in
 the operation of the one-party structure rather than to isolate
 them. There are no known political prisoners, and there have
 been no known executions of political opponents. Detainees,
 especially non-Ivorian Africans, are routinely treated roughly
 by the Surete National and the Gendarmerie upon arrest.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have never been reports of officially sanctioned
 political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits official violence without
 legitimate justification. The code does not, however,
 specifically mention or prohibit torture nor does it define
 
 
 84
 COTE DIVOIRE
 what constitutes "legitimate justification" or the level of
 violence officials may use if "justified". There were no
 reports of torture during 1986, and systematic cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment of persons or prison inmates is not
 thought to occur. Foreign Africans are treated more roughly
 by police on arrest than are Ivorians. Prisoners are allowed
 visits from attorneys of their choice and from family members,
 who must provide food to supplement the sparse prison diet.
 Prisons are crowded and conditions are poor. Sanitation and
 medical facilities are minimal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. However, the Government has
 occasionally detained persons considered a threat to internal
 security. It also takes firm nonviolent measures against acts
 it considers threats to internal security. The Government has
 used the threat of forced conscription to discourage student
 involvement in antigovernment activities. Some prominent
 critics of the Government have chosen to live and write
 elsewhere; on the other hand, political exiles from a number
 of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable safehaven.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can order
 the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing
 charges. The code dictates that further detention must be
 ordered by a magistrate who can authorize periods of up to 4
 months but must provide the Minister of Justice, on a monthly
 basis, with a written justification for continued detention.
 There have been no reports that officials failed to adhere to
 these legal guidelines.
 There is no forced labor in Cote d'Ivoire.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ivorian law establishes the right to.a fair public trial. This
 provision is generally respected in urban areas. In rural
 areas, justice is often administered at the village level
 through traditional institutions. These are increasingly
 superceded by the formal judicial system and are increasingly
 confined to purely local questions such as domestic disputes,
 minor land questions and family law. Dispute resolution is by
 extended debate, with no known resort to physical or similar
 punishment. There is general agreement that the judicial
 system is independent of the executive in practice as well
 under the Constitution's separation of powers. Defendants
 accused of felonies or capital crimes have the right to legal
 counsel, and the judicial system provides for court-appointed
 attorneys for indigent defendants. In practice, however, such
 attorneys are not readily available. The Court of Appeals
 reviews verdicts of civilian courts. Civilians are not tried
 by military courts. There are no appellate courts within the
 military justice system. Persons convicted by a military
 tribunal occasionally request the Supreme Court to set aside
 the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 Cote d'Ivoire marked its 25th anniversary of independence on
 Deceber 7, 1985, by releasing 9,500 of its 13,000 convicted
 prisoners. Prisoners involved in violent crimes and armed
 robbery were reportedly not included in the amnesty.

 COTE D'IVOIRE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With a few exceptions, all Ivorian citizens are considered to
 be members of the PDCI. Party regulations call for active
 participation in party activities and payment of dues; however,
 these regulations are not strictly enforced. Ivorians who
 choose not to participate do not suffer retaliation. It is not
 known what percentage of the population actively participates
 in the party. The code of penal procedures specifies that a
 police official or investigative magistrate may conduct
 searches of homes without a warrant if there is reason to
 believe there is evidence concerning a crime on the premises.
 The official must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain
 any objects seized in the search. He is required to have
 witnesses to the search, which may not take place between the
 hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary
 searches are generally respected in urban areas but are
 sometimes ignored in the countryside.
 In the past there have been scattered reports of forced entry
 or other violations of the home, specifically involving
 foreign Africans. There is no evidence that correspondence
 and telephone conversations have been monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is a limited range of free expression in Cote d'Ivoire.
 Critics of the Government feel free to, and do, express
 themselves in informal situations without fear of reprisal.
 Public criticism of basic government policies, the party, or
 the President, however, rarely occurs. Limits--such as the
 cancelation of gatherings--are occasionally placed on the
 expression of controversial views in public forums. As a
 result of 1982 student disorders, only apolitical gatherings
 are now permitted on campus, but students still speak freely
 about politics in informal situations.
 The country has one privately owned daily newspaper; its
 editorial opinion follows the policies of the PCDI. The one
 weekly newsmagazine is controlled by the party. The
 publishing of additional nongovernment publications is not
 prohibited. The Ministry of Information, Culture, Youth and
 Sports operates radio, television, and a wire service.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development. It allows criticism
 of failures to execute policy but not criticism of the
 policies themselves. Investigative journalism is permitted
 except with respect to the Government and its policies. The
 Government has occasionally banned a critical publication,
 such as Islam and Cote d'Ivoire. Foreign publications are
 readily available, but occasionally issues which are
 particularly critical of the Ivorian Government, the party, or
 the President are seized. In July 1986, the Government
 brought to the French Government's attention its displeasure
 with two Paris publications which were critical of the Ivorian
 leadership.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generally respected, except when the
 Government perceives a significant and immediate danger to
 public order. In such infrequent cases, the Government
 
 
 86
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 prohibits meetings and arrests persons who disregard its
 orders, as for example in 1985 when students staged public
 demonstrations to protest against a drop in scholarship aid.
 The vast majority of those arrested were released shortly
 thereafter. There is no history or tradition of assembly for
 purely political purposes outside the established party
 structure.
 The majority of unions are organized and directed by a
 government-sponsored union confederation, the General Union of
 Cote d'Ivoire Workers (UGTCI), the leader of which occupies a
 senior position in the party hierarchy. Union membership is
 encouraged but not mandatory. The UGTCI is a relatively
 passive coordination mechanism rather than an active force for
 workers' rights. The UGTCI secretariat, however, often plays
 a mediation/conciliation role in relations between labor and
 management in individual businesses. The UGTCI also has
 representatives in every major business enterprise.
 Collective bargaining within each company takes place under
 its leadership
 The right to strike exists under statute, but in practice
 strikes are carely authorized by the UGTCI. The 1983 secondary
 teachers' strike was broken by a presidential decree ordering
 teachers back to the classrooms and threatening them with
 fines and prison sentences for noncompliance. Generally, the
 Government negotiates with strikers and resolves at least some
 of their economic grievances. There have been no reports that
 professional groups have experienced persecution or harassment.
 The Government, however, attempts to bring such groups under
 its wing or that of the party so as to exercise control over
 their activities. Unions, trade associations, and professional
 bodies are permitted to maintain relations with recognized
 international professional bodies in their fields. The UGTCI
 is a member of the continent-wide Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. Cote d'Ivoire is a member-state of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), and the UGTCI
 participates in the Ivorian delegations to ILO conferences and
 events.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion, and no particular faith is favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching. The most lucrative government and private sector
 jobs seem to be concentrated among the minority Muslim
 (25 percent) and Christian (15 percent) populations, a
 phenomenon attributable more to urbanization and access to
 education than to a systematic pattern of discrimination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Ivorian Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel, but internal roadblocks for identity checks are
 common. Ivorians can travel abroad freely and can emigrate
 without discrimination. Ivorians have the right of voluntary
 repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safehaven to Angolans,
 Burkinabe, Eritreans, Ghanaians, Guineans, Liberians, and
 
 
 87
 COTE D*IVOIRE
 Vietnamese. While in Cote d'Ivoire, they receive 1-year
 renewable resident visas for their first 5 years in the
 country, after which they may apply for permanent residence.
 Cote d'Ivoire does not take any significant responsibility for
 the economic and social welfare of refugees, which becomes the
 concern of private and international organizations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political participation is limited to the PDCI which is headed
 by President Houphouet-Boigny. No opposition groups exist
 openly, and their formation is discouraged. Within the party,
 the President operates through a 10-member executive committee,
 a 58-member political bureau, and a 206-member steering
 committee. Political power is concentrated in the President's
 hands, and most important decisions are made by the President
 himself. Though legally empowered to do so, the National
 Assembly does not initiate legislation but only acts to confirm
 legislative initiatives received from the President. It has
 not publicly challenged a single government policy or
 initiative to date.
 Within this strictly observed one-party system, the Ivorian
 Government continues to encourage more open participation in
 the political process by expanding the size of the party
 institutions and by permitting party member to contest
 legislative, municipal, and local party elections. In the
 case of the 1985 legislative elections, approximately
 577 individuals ran for the 175-seat National Assembly. Beyond
 the injunction to possess good character and certain age
 restrictions, the 1985 elections were'open to virtually all
 would-be contestants. The party played no role in choosing
 candidates or administering the elections. Intense competition
 took place in all three elections and all citizens were
 eligible to vote. Many incumbents were defeated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights situation, the last of which occurred in 1981.
 Cote d'Ivoire has a local chapter of Amnesty International.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no apparent discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language or social status. All religions are
 represented at top levels of government and throughout society.
 Although French is the official language and the language of
 instruction, radio and television broadcasts are provided in
 major local languages. Social and economic mobility are not
 limited by policy or custom.
 Although males clearly play the preponderant role overall,
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. Nonetheless, in rural areas
 tribal customs dictate the division of menial tasks, which are
 performed mostly by women. Female circumcision continues to
 be practiced among elements of the Ivorian population, although
 it is rare in urban populations. Official party policy is to
 encourage full participation by women in social, economic, and
 political life. The role of women has recently won somewhat
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 greater prominence. In July 1986, the President appointed a
 new Minister for Women's Affairs, a cabinet-level position
 first created in 1976 but which had been vacant for almost
 2 years. Women remain lightly represented at the higher levels
 of government and the party. Ten women are deputies in the
 175-seat National Assembly and 28 women are members of the
 202-member Steering Committee of the PDCI. Non-Ivorian
 Africans living in the Cote d'Ivoire are estimated at over
 2 million, half of whom are from Burkina Faso and the rest
 from other nearby countries. These foreign workers play an
 important role in the Ivorian economy, especially in
 agriculture. The Government's policy of Ivorianization
 requires that all positions be offered to Ivorians before
 foreigners; this prevents foreign Africans from obtaining most
 of the higher paying wage and salary jobs in the modern sector.
 There were no riots in 1986 directed against non-Ivorian
 Africans as had occurred occasionally in the recent past.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory to and seeks to abide by the U.N.
 conventions on workers' rights and conditions of employment.
 Minimum wage levels and a minimum working age of 16 years of
 age have been established by the Government. The Government
 enforces a comprehensive work code of law, Code du Travail,
 governing the terms and conditions of service for salaried
 workers and providing for occupational safety and health
 standards. Extensive safeguards protect those employed in the
 modern sector against unjust compensation, excessive hours,
 and capricious discharge from employment. Month-long paid
 vacations and a substantial severance pay are guaranteed.
 Government medical insurance and retirement programs provide
 an element of income security for salaried employees in the
 modern sector. Urban workers in the informal sector and rural
 workers find conditions quite different, and occupational
 regulations may be underenforced.
