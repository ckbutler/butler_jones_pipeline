 JORDAN
 The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King
 Hussein since 1952. The Constitution concentrates a high degree of executive and
 legislative authority in the King, who determines domestic and foreign policy. The
 Prime Minister and the Cabinet manage the daily affairs of government. The Par-
 liament consists of a 40-member Senate appointed by the King and an 80-member
 Chamber of Deputies elected by the people. Since the elections of 1989 the Lower
 House has increasingly asserted itself in the areas of domestic and foreign policy.
 Reflecting this trend, the Cabinet appointed in February included 22 deputies from
 the lower house, the highest number ever. The judiciary is independent.
 The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) and the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD) share responsibility for maintaining internal security and have broad author-
 ity to monitor the activities of persons believed to be security threats. The State Se-
 curity Court and broad police powers remain in place as vestiges of martial law,
 which was inaplace from 1967 to 1991. The security forces continue to commit
 human rights abuses.
 Jordan has a mixed economy with significant government participation in indus-
 try, transportation, and communications. The country has few natural resources and
 is financially dependent on foreign assistance and remittances from citizens working
 abroad. Because of the Government's policies during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, some
 Arab Gulf state governments discontinued foreign assistance, expelled many Jor-
 danian guest workers, and placed restrictions on imports of Jordanian goods. The
 domestic economy has been buffeted by high unemployment since the late 1980's.
 Traditional exports to Iraq dropped off sharply due to United Nations sanctions
 against that ountry and JordamAan initiatives to redue the export of nonsanctioned
 goods under the bilateral trade protocol with Irq. As part of a structural adjust-
 ment program mandated by the International Monetary Fund, the Government re-
 moved subsidies on bread and animal feed in August, resulting in a doubling of the
 price of bread and other prie rises. The prie inrease was followed by riots in the
 south of the country. Some local commentators estimate that the standard of living
 for the average Jordanian has dropped by over half in the past 10 years. Per capita
 gross domestic product was estimated at $1,500 in 1996.
 Since the revocation of martial law in 1991, there has been a steady improvement
 in the human rights situation. Nonetheless, problems remain, including: Arbitrary
 arrest; abuse and mistreatment of detainees; prolonged detention without charge;
 lack of due process; harassment of opposition political parties; restrictions on the
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association; official discrimination agint
 adherents of the Baha'i faith; and restrictions on women's rights. Opposition alega-
 tions of human rights abuses in 1996 peaked following August riots in southern Jor-
 dan. Human rights activists protested detentions, the arrest of journalists and oppo-
 sition party members, and the harassment of political parties. Discrimination
 against the Bedouin, violence against women, and abuse of foreign servants are also
 problems. Citizens do not have the right to change their form of government, al-
 though in recent years the King has taken steps to increase particip~ation in the po-
 litica system, such as legalizing political parties. Parliamentr elections in 1993
 and nationwide municipal electi'ons in 1995 were largely free and fair although
 there were opposition accusations of government misconduct.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There was one report of death in
 custody. Younis Mahmoud Abu Dawleh was arrested by officers of the PSD for his
 alleged involvement in the December 24 shooting of Hamzh Nazzal, in what has
 
 
 1308
 been described in press reports as a dispute among former Democratic Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine members. He reportedly resisted arrest and police knocked
 him down a flights of stairs, sat on him, and beat him. He died of a heart attack
 on December 24 while enroute to the police station. His body reportedly showed
 signs of repeated blows to the genital area.
 No progress was made in the Attorney General's review of the case of the death
 of Mahmud Khalifeh and wounding of his brother Bashir by security forces in June
 1995. Opponents of the Government charge that security forces used excessive force
 against the two after the pair used firearms to resist arrest. The Khalifeh brothers
 were wanted for shooting at police patrol cars and sending faxes critical of the Gov-
 ernment and the King to prominent citizens.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Legal Code provides prisoners with the right to humane treatment,
 security and other police forces abuse detainees physically during interrogation. Tor-
 ture allegations are difficult to verify because security officials frequently deny de-
 tainees timely access to lawyers. The most frequently alleged methods of torture are
 sleep deprivation, beatings, and extended solitary confinement. Defendants in high-
 profile cases before the State Security Court claim to have undergone physical and
 psychological abuse while in detention. Government officials reject allegations of tor-
 ture.
 There were a number of allegations of torture in connection with those detained
 after the disturbances in the south. Human rights monitors charge that two doctors
 who were treating detainees for injuries sustained at the hands of government au-
 thorities were detained themselves. The doctors were reportedly taken into custody
 for sending detainees to the hospital to be treated for a bullet lodged in the spine
 in one case, and broken hands in another. Credible sources alleged that the doctors
 were then abused. In another case, opposition deputies charged the Government
 with detaining and torturing Essam Al-ajar, a Hamas supporter, for two weeks.
 They alleged that Al-Naijar was beaten in the stomach, throat, and on the soles of
 his feet, was cursed by guards, and had excrement wiped in his face.
 The Court of Cassation overturned the June 1995 death sentences of defendants
 in the so-called "Udwan Mills" case, ruling that the criminal court could not base
 its sentencing solely on the defendants' confessions, which defense lawyers claimed
 were extracted under duress. The convictions were based solely on confessions.
 Local police detention facilities are spartan but generally clean. Prisons generally
 meet minimum international standards. Prisoners detained on national security
 grounds are often kept in separate prisons maintained by the GID.
 e International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is permitted unrestricted
 access to prisoners and prison facilities. In August members of Parliament's Public
 Freedoms Committee visited Suwaqa Prison to assess the condition of Layth
 Shubaylat and Ata Abu Rishtah (see Section i.e.). Following the distarbances in the
 south, however, the Committee was not permitted to inspect prisons or assess the
 condition of detainees until October 15, 7 weeks after the first arrests. In September
 representatives of the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) were given per-
 m     assion by the court to visit th e a in butwe  not permitted by prison officials
 to tour the facility.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution citizens are sub-
 ject to arrest, trial, and punishment for the defamation of heads of state, dissemina-
 tion of "false or exaggerated information outside the country which attacks state
 dignity," or defamation of public officials.
 The Criminal Code requres legaltauthorities to file form  charges within 10 days
 of arrest. The courts routinely gran  requests from  arosecutrs for 15-day extensions
 as provided by law. This practice generally extend pretrial detention for lengthy
 periods ofthme. In cases involving state security, the authorities frequently hold de-
 fendants in lengthy pretrial detention, do not provide written charges, and do not
 allow defendants to meet with their lawyers until shortly before the trial. Security
 defendants usually meet with their attorneys 1 or 2 days prior to the trial.
 Testimony in July in the case of the Bayat Al  am  defendants, charged with
 plotting to carry out extremist attacks and illegally possessing and manufacturing
 of explosives, revealed that they had been detainedby security forces for 5 months
 without charge and without access to an attorney, before being transferred to a mili-
 tary prosecutor for questioning.
 According to the Ministry of Information a total of 572 people were detained fol-
 lowing Au     lst' disturbances in southern Jordan; 521 were released, without being
 charged.All those remaining in custody were released and charges against them
 dropped under a general amnesty in honor of the King's birthday on November 14.
 
 
 1309 "
 The Government detains persons, including jouranalists, for varying amounts of
 time for what appear to be political reasons (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.). During the
 year all such detainees were released within 3 months. Observers estimate that in
 previous years apprximately 400 people were detained each year for national secu-
 rity reasons, of whom all but a few were released after questioning.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public 7Wal.-The Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary. Court rulings against the Government, including the Udwan Mills case
 (see Section 1.c.), indicate that the judiciary functions independently.
 There are several types of courts. Most criminal cases are tried in the civilian
 courts, which include appeals courts the Court of Cassation, and the Supreme
 Court. Cases involving sedition, armed insurrection, financial crimes, and drug traf-
 ficking are tried in the State Security Court, a remnant of the pre-1991 martial law
 period. Islamic, or Shar'a, courts, have jurisdiction over marriage and divorce
 among Muslims and inheritance cases involving both Muslims and non-Muslims
 (see Section 5). Under Shari'a law, a woman's testimony is only equal to half that
 of a man (see Section 5).
 Most trials in the civilian courts are open. Defendants are entitled to legal coun-
 sel, may challeng  witnesses, and have the right to appeal. Defendants facing the
 death penalty orfe imprisonment must be represented by legal counsel. Public de-
 fenders are provided in such cases.
 The State Security Court is comprised of panels of three judges, who may be ei-
 ther civilians or military officers. It frequently restricts public attendance at its
 trials. Defendants tried in the State Security Court are often held in pretrial deten-
 tion without access to lawyers, although they are visited by representatives of the
 ICRC. In the State Security Court, judges have inquired into allegations that de-
 fendants were tortured and have permitted the testimony of physicians regarding
 these allegations. To date the Court has not invalidated confessions obtained under
 duress, but on review, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the State Security
 Court cannot issue a death sentence on the basis of such a confession alone (see
 Section 1.c.). Defendants in the State Security Court have the right of appeal to the
 Court of Cassation, which is authorized to review the testimony, evidence, and judg-
 ment. Appeals are automatic for cases involving the death penalty.
 Defense attorneys have challenged the appointment of military judges to the State
 Security Court to try civilian cases as contrary to the concept of an independent ju-
 diciary. Military judges appear to receive adequate training in civil law and court
 procedure, and State Security Court decisions are reviewed by the Court of Cassa-
 tion. At least partly in response to these charges, a panel of civilian judges was ap-
 pointed to the court for the first time in December 1995 to try the case of Layt
 Shubaylat for slandering the King. The panel was dissolved in September and was
 replaced by military judges.
 A number of the cases brought before the State Security Court in 1995 resulted
 in convictions. In the case of six members of the Islamic Revival Movement, three
 were sentenced to 7  years at hard labor for possession of explosives. The other
 three defendants were acquitted due to a lack of evidence. In two separate cases
 involving free speech, Ata Abu Rishtah and Layth Shubaylat were convicted of slan-
 dering the King and sentenced to 3 years in prison, the maximum sentence for this
 crime. Both sentences were upheld by the Court of Cassation on appeal. On Novem-
 ber 8, the King ordered the release from prison of Shabaylat after he had served
 7 months of his sentence.
 In the case of an attack on the office of the GID at Al Baqaa refugee camp in
 1994, five men were found guilty of plotting to carry out an extremist attack and
 were sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment at hard labor. The five and another de-
 fendant were acquitted of charges of distributing pamphlets slandering the King.
 During the trial the defendants retracted their confessions, saying that they were
 extracted under duress.
 In the case of two men accused of shooting a French diplomat in February 1995,
 the defendants were found innocent of attempted murder in criminal court, but were
 convited of p lotting to carry out extremist attacks and the manufacture and posses-
 sion of filegal arms and explosives. The two men were sentenced to 10 years in pris-
 on at hardlabr. oth men claimed that they were tortured while in custody.
 In the "Bayat Al Imam" case, 4 of the 13 the defendants were found innocent,
 and 9 were convicted. Seven had been charged with plotting to carry out extremist
 attacks, illegal manufacture and possession of explosives with illicit intent, and
 slandering the King. The remaining six were accused with slandering the King. Of
 the seven charged with manufacturing explosives, two were found not guilty, four
 were convicted of the lesser charge of possession of explosives, and the seventh was
 found guilty of all charges. Three of the four were sentenced to 15 years at hard
 
 
 1310
 
 labor the fourth was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor. The one defendant con-
 victea on all charges was sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life
 imprisonment at hard labor. Among those accused only of slander, one was found
 not guilty while the remaining five received sentences ranging from 2 to 3 years in
 prison. During the trial all the defendants claimed that they were forced to confess
 while in security detention for 5 months prior to being charged.
 In 1996 the State Security Court began hearing the case of three men accused
 of planning attacks against Israeli tourists. The men are charged with plotting to
 carry out extremist attacks and possessing illegal explosives. The Court also heard
 the case of Mohammed Salameh Duwaik, an attorney arrested after neighbors ac-
 cused him of making remarks that slandered the King and Government. Duwaik
 was cleared of the charges as a result of inconsistencies in witnesses' testimony. The
 press has carried details of the ongoing cases, including alle-ations of torture.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or dYorrespondence.-The au-
 thorities generally respect the Constitutional prohibitions of such practices. Police
 must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor General or a judge before conducting
 searches. However, in security cases, authorities sometimes-in violation of the
 law-obtain warrants retroactively or obtain preapproved warrants. Security officers
 reportedly monitor telephones, read correspondence, and engage in surveillance of
 persons who allegedly pose a threat to the Government. While these practices are
 not believed to be widespread, the law permits them if the Government obtains a
 court order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, the Government imposes some restrictions on these rights.
 Private citizens can be prosecuted for slandering the royal family or the Government
 and for inciting sedition. Citizens generally do not hesitate to criticize the Govern-
 ment openly but are more circumspect in regard to the King and the royal family.
 The Press and Publications Law of 1993 restricts media coverage of 10 subjects,
 most notably the military services, the royal family, and monetary policy. In addi-
 tion, journalists engage in self-censorship when reporting on security issues and op-
 position to the Government to avoid government censorship or retaliation.
 The Government exercises control over the print media through its ownership of
 61 percent of the Jordan Press Foundation and 40 percent of the Jordan Press and
 Publications Company, which together publish the country's three main daily news-
 papers. The 1993 Law gives the Government until 1997 to reduce its shares mn press
 establishments to a maximum of 30 percent. The Government also requires licenses
 for newspapers and periodicals, but the Press Law does not prescribe penalties for
 publishing without a license. The Government may revoke a license only if a com-
 pany fails to publish for an extended period of time. The Government licensed eight
 new weekly newspapers in 1996. No licenses were revoked.
 The Government also reqires licenses for journalists, editors, and publishers.
 Journalists have long complained about the requirement that they must join the
  ovehment-sponsored Jordan Press Association (JPA). However, the Gevernment
 has not taken legal action against journalists who refuse to join the association. For-
 eign journalists and Jordanians working for foreign news agencies must register
 with the Ministry of Information. The Press Law offers limited protection for the
 confidentiality of a journalist's sources.
 The Penal Code authorizes the State to take legal action against any person who
 incites violence, defames heads of state, disseminates "false or exaggerated informa-
 tion outside the country which attacks state dignity," or defames public officials.
 Abmed Oueidi Abbadi, a former deputy, is charged with undermining national
 unity, inciting people to criminal acts, and fueling bigotry for writing a June edi-
 torial in which he called for Government confiscation of the property of Palestinians
 living in Jordan.
 Persons accused of violating the Press and Publications Law are tried in a special
 court for press and copyright cases. Durin theyear there were 13 cases involving
 violations of the Press and Publications Law, Journalists are also prosecuted for
 criminal and security violations in connection with their work. Most such cases re-
 sult in a  ittal or are dismissed before coming to trial. In 1995 only 2 of the 20
 cases heard resulted in guilty verdicts. The Government uses detention and prosecu-
 tion or the threat of prosecution of press andpublications cases as a means to har-
 ass and intimidate outspoken journalists and encourage self-censorship. Fourteen
 journalists have been charged with security and press offenses related to the Augut
 disturbances in southern Jordan. Charges include "publishing material deemed of-
 fensive to the public," 'arrying inaccurate or misleading reporting," slandering the
 King, and instigating public disorder or sedition, Salameh Na'mat, the Amman cor-
 
 
 1311
 respondent for Al Hayat, was acquitted in April of slander, inaccurate reporting,
 and "damaging national unity" under the Press and Publications Law. He was de-
 tained in October 1995 for 3 days in connection with the charges.
 Two Lebanese journalists and the chief editor of an Egyptian opposition paper
 were denied entry by the Government into the country in December on the grounds
 that their writings were insulting and slanderous to the King and the Jordanian
 leadership.
 Radio and television news is more restricted than the print media. Television
 news airs criticisms of the Government but rarely covers alleged human rights
 abuses. During the August disturbances foreign television crews were permitted to
 film the riots, but the crew from Jordan Television was denied access to Kerak,
 where the disturbances were taking place. All political parties have access to broad-
 cast facilities but the cost of air time is prohibitively high. Opposition parties have
 complained that Jordan Television reports only the Government's position on con-
 troversial matters. In August opposition parliamentarians boycotted Parliament
 over complaints that their views a out the bread subsidy issue were not being aired.
 International television programs are widely available by satellite; Israeli and Syr-
 ian television can be received with an antenna.
 Although the Government does not usually interfere with the importation of for-
 eign newspapers and magazines, individual issues sometimes do not appear on the
 newstands, as was the case with a number of British publications immediately fol-
 lowing the August disturbances. In October over 30 publications on display at
 Amman's International Book Fair were confiscated by officials from the Press and
 Publications Department because they had not been submitted to the Department
 in advance. The confiscated books covered political and social topics and included
 novels and poetry.
 There were no cases of leftist or Islamist university professors being dismissed for
 advocating extremist political views. Intellectuals, however, believe that there are
 no safeguards to prevent such dismissals. University of Jordan sociology professor
 Ibrahim Abu Arkoub was detained in September without charge for 45 days, appar-
 ently for his connections with Hamas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens must obtain permits
 for public gatherings. Since 1989 the Government has granted some permits for
 peaceful demonstrations. The Government denies permits for public protests and
 rallies that it determines pose a threat to security. Following riots and demonstra-
 tions in response to the August increase in bread prices, the Government denied op-
 position and Islamist organizers permission to hold a "hungry million march" to pro-
 test the price increase. The Government indirectly limits conferences, workshops,
 and seminars by requiring that the organizers obtain Government approval for any
 such gathering. The Government has not refused such permission in 1996.
 The Government routinely licenses political parties. Twenty-six parties have been
 licensed since 1992. Membership in an unlicensed party is illegal. The High Court
 of Justice may dissolve a party if it violates the Constitution or the Political Parties
 Law. The Government has no discretion to deny a license to a party that submits
 a complete application, including names of the founders, financial information, and
 bylaws. There are over 50 political movements that are not licensed by the Govern-
 ment as full-fledged political parties.
 In August the Government took action against opposition party members sus-
 pected of instigating unrest in the south. Members and officials of the Jordanian
 Arab Baath Socialist Party, the Jordan People's Democratic Party, and the Jor-
 danian Communist Party from various parts of Jordan were detained and charged
 for involvement in the riots (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-According to the Constitution, Islam is the state religion.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on religion and provides for "per-
 sonal freedom." Sunni Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population. Govern-
 ment control of Islamic institutions is managed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs
 and Trusts, which appints imams and subsidizes activities sponsored by the
 mosques. The Political Parties Law prohibits houses of worship from being used for
 politcal party activity. This has been interpreted to prevent Islamist parliamentar-
 ians from preaching in mosques. However, enforcement of the law has not been con-
 sistent. Religious instruction is mandatory for all Muslim students in public schools.
 The Government does not interfere with public worship by Jordan's Christian mi-
 nority. The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a religion but does
 not prohibit the practice of the faith.
 The law prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing. Muslims who convert to other
 faiths complain of social and government discrimination. The Government does not
 fully recognize the legality of such conversions. Under Shari'a law, converts from
 Islam are regarded as apostates and may be legally denied their property and other
 
 
 1312
 
 rights. In Jordan this principle is not applied. Converts from Islam do not fall under
 the jurisdiction of their new religion's laws in matters of personal status and are
 still considered Muslims under Shari'a law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for the right of citizens to travel freely abroad and
 within Jordan except in military areas. The law requires that Jordanian women and
 foreign women married to Jordanians obtain written permission from a male guard-
 ian to apply for a passport. A woman traveling abroad with children may also be
 asked for authorization from her spouse before being allowed to depart. Legal au-
 thorities enforce requests from fathers to prevent their children from departing the
 country, even when traveling with their mothers.
 Many Palestinian residents are Jordanian citizens, with the rights of citizenship.
 Jordanians with full citizenship receive passports valid for 5 years. Until 1995 the
 Government issued passports valid for 2 years to Palestinians who arrived after
 1967, as well as to Palesinians in areas under Israeli occupation who did not have
 other travel documentation. In 1995 the King announced that virtually all appli-
 cants would be eligible for 5-year passports. The Government stresses that these
 passports are for travel only; they do not denote nationality. Palestinians must ob-
 tain permits from the Ministry of the Interior for travel between Jordan and the
 Israeli-occupied territories. Such permission is routinely granted.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHOR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum. Since 1991 thousands of Iraqis have sought asy-
 lum in Jordan and been assisted by the UNHCR. There were no reports of forced
 return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The Constitution pro-
 hibits the deportation of citizens.
 Over 1.35 million Palestinian refugees are registered in Jordan with the United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency. The Agency counts another 800,000 Palestinians
 as either displaced persons from the 1967 war, arrivals following the 1967 war, or
 returnees from the Gulf.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Executive and legislative powers are so concentrated in the hands of the King
 that citizens do not have any meaningful ability to change their system of Govern-
 ment. The King has sole discretionary authority to form and dismiss cabinets, ap-
 point and remove prime ministers, dissolve Parliament, and establish the broad out-
 lines of public policy. Appointments made by the King to high government pests do
 not require legislative approval. The executive power is vested in the King, who ex-
 ercisesis powers through his ministers in accordance with the provisions of the
 Constitution.
 The Parliament is composed of a Senate appointed by the King and a Chamber
 of Deputies elected by the people. The Pariament is empowered to approve, reject,
 or amend legislation proposed by the Cabinet. In practice Members of Parliament
 ask the Government to submit specific legislation for consideration. The Parliament
 may amend such draft legislation. The King proposes and dismisses extraordinary
 sessions of Parliament and may postpone regular sessions up to 60 days. In August
 the King terminated the eraordinary session of Parliament in which the proposed
 hike in bread prices was to be discussed. The King must approve by decree all laws
 passed by Parliament. If the Government amends or enacts a law when Parliament
 is not in session, it must submit the law to Parliament for consideration during the
 next session.
 Women have the right to vote, and women's groups encourage women to vote and
 become active in the political process. In the Amman area, over 43 percent of those
 who voted in the 1995 muni.cipal elections were women. In 1996 there was one"
 woman in the Cabinet, one in the Chamber of Deputies, and two in the Senate.
 Eleven women were elected to municipal posts in 1995, including one as mayor of
 Khirbet al Wahadneh, near Ajloun.
 Of the 80 seats in the lower chamber, 9 are reserved for Christians, 6 for Bed-
 ouins, and 3 for the Circassian or Chechen ethnic minorities.
 The Palestinian community, estimated to be slightly over one-half the total popu-
 lation, is not represented proportionately in the Government. Five of 31 ministers,
 9 of 40 senators, and 13 of 80 lower house deputies are of Palestinian origin. The
 electoral system gives greater representation to south Jordan, which has few inhab-
 itants of Palestinian origin.
 
 
 1313
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and have published and disseminated findings critical of government
 policy. However, the Press and Publications Law restricts the publication of infor-
 mation about the military and security services, which, in effect, prevents the publi-
 cation by local groups of reports alleging torture and other abuses committed by the
 security services.
 The ICRC is permitted to visit prisoners and assess the condition of security de-
 tainees, including those held bythe GD. The AOHR and the Amman-based Peace
 Center for Humanitarian Studies are registered with the Government and have
 raised human rights cases with government officials. Both organizations have drawn
 public attention to alleged human rights abuses and have pressed the Government
 to explain the status of detainees and to charge or release them promptly. In Feb-
 mary the AOHR released a report detailing human rights abuses in 1995. In Octo-
 ber the AOHR released an "emergency report" about human rights abuses following
 the August disturbancea. The Jordanian Human Rights Society (JHRS) received its
 license to operate on November 30 from the Ministry of Interior.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although Jordanian law does not distinguish between citizens on the basis of race,
 women and minorities are treated differently under the law and may face discrimi-
 nation in empIoent, housing, and other categories.
 Women.-Violence against women over the age of 15 is common. Reported inci-
 dents of crimes against women do not reflect the full extent of the problem. Medical
 experts acknowledge that spousal abuse occurs frequently. However, cultural norms
 constrain victims from seeking medical or legal help and frustrate an objective as-
 sessment of the extent of abuse.
 Abused women have the right to file a complaint in court against their spouses
 for physical abuse but in practice, familial and societal pressures discourage them
 from seeking legal remedies. Marital rape is legal. Nongovernmental organizations
 such as the Jord aian Women's Union, which has a hotline for victims of domestic
 violence, provide assistance in such matters. Wife beating is technically grounds for
 divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority from the
 Koran to correct an irreligious or disobedient wife by striking her.
 The Criminal Code allows for leniency for persons found guilty of committing a
 "crime of honor," the term commonly used for a violent assault against-or murder
 of-a female by a male relative for alleged sexual misconduct. Law enforcement
 treatment of men accused of "honor" crimes mirrors widespread social approval for
 such acts. As of September, the press reported 11 such cases in 1996. However,
 these figures likely understate the actual number of cases, as most crimes of honor
 are not reported by the press, and the actual number of such crimes is believed by
 a local expert to be four times as high. According to the law, a "crime of honor" de-
 fense may be invoked only by a defendant who "surprises his wife or any close fe-
 male relative committing adultery," in which case there is no punishment. Although
 few defendants can meet the stringent requirements for a "crime of honor" defense,
 which requires that the defendant have witnessed the female victim engaging in
 sexual intercourse, convicted offenders rarely spend more than 2 years in prison.
 More commonly, such defenses rely on the male relative having acted in the heat
 of passion upon hearing of a female relative's sexual transgression, without any in-
 vestigation on the part of the killer to determine the veracity of the allegation before
 committing an act of violence. Women may not invoke this defense for murdering
 a male relative under the same circumstances, nor may they use it for killing men
 who attempt to rape, sexually harass, or otherwise threaten their "honor." In con-
 trast to "honor" crimes, the maximum penalty for first-degree murder is death; the
 maximum penalty for second degree murder is 15 years.
 Women als experience legal discrimination in matters of pension and social secu-
 rity benefits, inheritance, divorce, and the value of testimony in court (see Section
 i.e.). The Government provides men with more generous social security benefits
 than women. The Government continues pension payments of a deceased male civil
 servant to his heirs but discontinues payments of a deceased female civil servant.
 Under Shari'a or Islamic law, female heirs receive half the amount of a male
 heir's inheritance, while the non-Muslim widows of Muslim spouses have no inherit-
 ance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes
 to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property.
 Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family members who need assist-
 ance. Shari'a law regards the testimony of two women to be equal to the testimony
 
 
 1314
 of one man. This technically applies only in religious courts but in the past has been
 imposed in civil courts as well, irrespective of religion. Men are able to obtain di-
 vorce more easily than women under Islamic law. Marriage and divorce matters for
 Christians are adjudicated by special courts for each denomination. The Government
 bans married women from applying for diplomatic posts. A woman was appointed
 as a judge for the first time in 1996.
 The law requires a married woman to obtain her husband's permission to obtain
 a passport (see Section 2.d.). Married women do not have the legal right to confer
 citizenship on their children. However, they may obtain citizenship for their non-
 Jordanian husbands who may then confer citizenship on the children. Civil law
 grants women equal pay for equal work, but in practice this law is often ignored.
 Social pressures discourage many women from pursuing careers. Nonetheless,
 women have employment opportunities in many professions, including engineering,
 medicine, education, and law. Women constitute approximately 14 percent of the
 work force. Women's groups stress that the problem of discrimination is not only
 one of law but also of women's lack of awareness of their rights or unwillingness
 to assert those rights. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization re-
 ported in 1995 that women who work in agriculture average 15-hour days and earn
 ess than men. The Jordanian chapter of the Business and Professional Women's
 Club gives seminars on women's rights and assists women in establishing small
 businesses. Members of the royal family are working actively to improve the status
 of women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, espe-
 cially in the areas of education and health. In October the Minister of Labor issued
 a memorandum to all ministry inspectors ordering them to fine every employer of
 children under 16 years of age. However, the Government's progress in these areas
 is constrained by limited financial resources. Education is compulsory to age 15. The
 children of Iraqi citizens living in Jordan without residence permits are not per-
 mitted to attend school.
 The Government safeguards some children's rights, especially regarding child
 labr. Although the law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working, child
 peddlers work the streets of Amman. The Ministry of Social Development has a
 committee to address the problem and in most cases removes the children from the
 streets, returns them to their families or to juvenile centers, and may provide the
 families with a monthly stipend. However, the child usually returns to the streets
 soon afterward. The law prohibits corporal punishment in schools.
 Although the problem is difficult to quantify, social workers believe that there is
 a significant incidence of child abuse in families. The law specifies punishment for
 specific abuses against children. Rape or sodomy of a child under 15 years of age
 carries the death penalty. In January the Court of Cassation upheld the death sen-
 tence of a man for repeatedly raping and threatening the life of a 10-year old girl.
 The incidence of crimes, especially sexual crimes, is significantly higher than re-
 ported in the press.
 People With Disabilities.-High unemployment in the general population restricts
 job opportunities for the disabled. The Government passed legislation in 1993 re-
 quiring future public buildings to accommodate the needs of the disabled and the
 retrofitting of existing public buildings, but implementation has been slow. Since
 1993 the Special Education Department of the Ministry of Social Development has
 enrolled approximately 10,000 mentally and physically disabled persons in public
 and private sector training courses. It has placed approximately 400 disabled per-
 sons in public and private sector jobs. A new law requires that 2 percent of the
 available jobs be reserved for the physically disabled. Private organizations and
 members of the royal family actively promote programs to protect and promote the
 interests of the disabled. Jordan participates in the Special Olympics with the active
 encouragement of the royal family.
 Indigenous People.-The Bedouin, Jordan's nomadic people, carry Jordanian pass-
 ports and are increasingly assimilated into society. However, the Bedouin fae so-
 cial, economic, and professional discrimination, although the Government reserves
 six seats for the Bedouin in the Chamber of Deputies. The military and police forces
 have special units primarily composed of Bedouin.
 Religious Minorities.-The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a
 religion. It does not record the religion on national identity cards issued to Baha'is,
 nor does it register property belonging to the community. Unlike Christian denomi-
 nations, the Baha'i community does not have its own court to adjudicate personal
 status and family matters. Baha'i personal status matters are heard in Islamic law
 courts.

 The Government does not officially recognize Jehovah's Witnesses, the United
 Pentecostal Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
 Day Saints, but it allows them to conduct their activities without interference.
 Established religious groups, which include Muslims, Roman Catholics, Greek Or-
 thodox, Baptists, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Syriacs, and Armenian Orthodox, re-
 quire official government recognition in order to register property in the name of
 the church, but members may practice their religion without government recogni-
 tion. In general Christians do not suffer discrimination. Christians hold cabinet and
 other government positions and are represented in the media and academia approxi-
 mately in proportion to their presence in the general population, which is estimated
 at 6 percent. Christian and Baha'i children in public schools are not required to par-
 ticipate in Islamic religious instruction.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government granted full citizenship to
 all Palestinians who fled to Jordan after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and to a large
 number of refugees who arrived after the 1967 War. However, refugees who fled
 Gaza after 1967 are not entitled to citizenship and until 1995 were issued only 2-
 year passports. As of October 1995, most Palestinian refugees became eligible to re-
 ceive 5-year passports, but the Government has stressed that these passports are
 for travel only and do not connote nationality (see Section 2.d.). Palestinians suffer
 disproportionate scrutiny in taxation and discrimination in the award of university
 scholarships and appointments to senior positions in the Government and the ml-
 tary.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in the private sector and in some state-
 owned companies have the right to establish and join unions. Unions must he reg-
 istered to be considered legal. The law prohibits union membership for noncitizens.
 Over 30 percent of the work force is organized into 17 unions. Although union mem-
 bership in the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU), the sole
 trade federation, is not mandatory, all unions belong to it. The Government sub-
 sidizes and audits the GFJTU's salaries and activities. Union officials are elected
 by secret ballot to 4-year terms. Although the Government cosponsors and approves
 the timing of these elections, it does not interfere in the choice of candidates.
 Labor laws mandate that workers must obtain permission from the Government
 in order to strike. Unions generally will not seek approval for a strike, but workers
 will use the threat of a strike or wildcat action as a negotiating tactic. Strikes are
 prohibited if a labor dispute is under mediation or arbitration. Ifa settlement is not
 reached throug mediation, the Ministry of Labor may refer the dispute to an indus-
 trial tribunal y agreement of both parties. If only one party agrees, the Ministry
 of Labor refers the dispute to the Council of Ministers and then to Parliament. The
 tribunal is an independent arbitration panel of judges appointed by the Ministry of
 Labor. The decisions of the panel are legally binding. Labor law prohibits employers
 from dismissing a worker during a labor dispute. Ther was one reported stike in
 1996.
 The GFJTU belongs to the Arab Labor Organization, the International Confed-
 eration of Arab Trade Unions, and to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have, and exercise,
 the right to bargain collectively. The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion, but the ICFTU claims that the Government does not adequately protect em-
 ployees from antiunion discrimination and that the Government has dismissed pub-
 lic sector employees for political reasons. Workers may lodge complaints of
 antinion discrimination with the Ministry of Labor, which is authorized to order
 the reinstatement of employees discharged for union activities. There were no com-
 plaints of antiunion discrimination lodged with the Ministry of Labor in 1996.
 The national labor laws apply in the free trade zones in Aqaba and Zarqa. Private
 sector employees in these zones belong to one national union that covers both zones
 and have the right to bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition f Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids compul-
 sory labor, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster. Compul-
 sory labor is not practiced.
 d.Minimum Age for Employment of Chiidren.-Labr law forbids children under
 the age of 16 from working except as apprentices. At age 13 children may begin part
 time training for up to 6 hours a day with night work prohibited Ministry of Labor
 inspectors attempt to enforce the law on child labor, but in practice enforcement
 often does not extend to some small family businesses that employ underage chil-
 dren. Education is compulsory to       La   ies in remote areas frequentiy keep
 
 
 1316
 some school-age children at home to work. Child peddlers work on'the streets of
 Amman (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The Gov-
 ernment periodically adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based on
 recommendations of an advisory panel representing workers, employers, and the
 Government. The lowest minimum wage rate on the schedule is about $150 (80 di-
 nars) per month, including allowances. Workers earning the lowest wage find it dif-
 ficult to provide a decent living for their families. The Government estimates the
 poverty level at a monthly wage of about $93 (65 dinars) per month for a family
 of three.
 The law prohibits most workers from working more than the customary 48 hours
 a week, and 54 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema employees. Workers may not
 work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more that 60 hours' overtime
 per month. Employees are entitled to I day off each week.
 The law does not apply to domestic servants, who do not have a legal forum to
 address their labor grievances and have no standing to sue in court for nonpayment
 of wages. Abuse of domestic servants, most of whom are foreign, is widespread. Im-
 prisonment of maids and confiscation of travel documents by employers is common.
 Complaints of beatings, underfeeding, and rape are not generally reported to offi-
 cials by victims, who fear losing their work permits and being sent back to their
 nation of origin should they file a complaint. Domestic servants are generally not
 given a day of.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements for workers, includ-
 ing the presence of bathrooms, drinking water, and first aid equipment at work
 sites. The Ministry of Labor makes an effort to enforce health and safety require-
 ments but is hampered by the lack of qualified inspectors. The inspectors do not
 have the power to order firms to comply with health and safety standards. The law
 does not require employers to report industrial accidents or occupational diseases
 to the Ministry of Labor. Workers do not have a statutory right to remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking the loss of their job.
