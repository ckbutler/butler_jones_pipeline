 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana is a small, developing nation with a unicam-
 eral parliament chosen by direct elections in a multiparty political system. Dr.
 Cheddi Jagan of the Peoples' Progressive Party (PPP), which has a plurality in Par-
 liament, is Executive President. The President appoints a Prime Minister and other
 cabinet ministers. The 1992 general election was considered the first free and fair
 poll since 1965. There is a constitutionally independent, albeit somewhat inefficient,
 Judici ry.
 The yana Defence Force (GDF) and the Guyana Police Force (GPF) are under
 civilian control. The GPF has the authority to make arrests and maintains law and
 order throughout the country. The GDF is a professional military responsible for na-
 tional defense, internal security, and emergency response. The President deployed
 the GDF in 1996 to support police efforts against surging violent and drug-related
 crime. Some members of the police allegedly committed human rights abuses.
 Guyana is a very poor country. Its mixed economy depends on the export of pri-
 mary commodities from agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and mining. Sugar, nee,
 bauxite, and gold are the leading exports. The economy is slowly moving away from
 decades as a centrally directed, nationalized economy to one based on a mix of pri-
 vate and state enterprises. The standard of living for most citizens is low, with more
 than half living in poverty. External debt is high, there are severe shortages of
 skilled labor, and the economy is constrained by an inadequate and ill-maintained
 infrastructure for transportation, power distribution, flood control, and communica-
 tions. The estimated economic growth rate for the first half of 1996 was about 6.3
 percent, with per capita gross domestic product estimated around $632.
 The Government's human rights record remained the same. Human rights prob-
 lems continued to include police abuse of suspects, allegations of extrajudicial
 killings, poor prison conditions, delays in the inefficient judicial system, societal vio-
 lence against women and children, and discrimination against women, minorities,
 and indigenous Amerindians. The authorities continued efforts to improve police
 training and prison conditions, especially in the areas of inmate training and reha-
 bilitation, despite very limited resources. However, police abuses were often commit-
 ted with impunity, and the Police Complaints Authority was largely ineffective be-
 cause it lacks independent power. There are still some limitations on worker rights,
 but political control of trade union activity continued to diminish.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 Some controversial cases led to allegations that police killed criminal suspects
 under questionable circumstances. The GPF's standing orders regulate police con-
 duct in situations where firearms can be used. The principles guiding use of fire-
 arms permit police resort to weapons when other means are ineffective, for protec-
 tion of property, and in self-defense.
 In June the Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) reported an upsurge in
 violent incidents involving the police, asserting that there were 16 fatal shootings,
 6 near-fatal shootings, 4 deaths in custody, and 30 cases of police assaults or brutal-
 ity. The GHRA suggested that this trend in police practice is causing the public to
 be suspicious of anylose confidence in the GPF.
 Cases alleging police abuse of power or unlawful use of deadly force are inves-
 tigated by the statutorily independent Police Complaints Authority (PCA). Any
 lice officer determined by the PCA to have acted unlawfully is reportedly      -
 ciplined, dismissed, or prosecuted. While critics admit that the PCA internal review
 process occurs in some cases, they don't believe that the authorities sufficiently in-
 vestigate and punish many of the police officers responsible. Following a number of
 complaints against the police, the GPF introduced in July an internal affairs com-
 mittee to review controversial cases in order to identify and discipline officers who
 act beyond their legal authority. The GPF also introduced a policy of a 48-hour re-
 sponse time to public complaints and inquiries, along with a special 24-hour hot
 line.
 Allegations of police abuse are not new, but the controversial nature and public
 perception of some of these cases raised questions about the conduct of some GPF
 officers. On May 22, 20-year-old Jermain Wilkinson died from injuries he received
 during a police raid. Lance Corporal Robert Beresford allegedly helped beat
 Wilkinson and shot him in the leg. Wilkinson died hours later. Concerned citizens
 created the Justice for Jermain Committee (JFJC), which held public demonstra-
 
 
 469
 
 tions that led to Beresford being charged with manslaughter. At the conclusion of
 a preliminary hearing in September, the magistrate raised Beresford's charge from
 manslaughter to murder, in view of sufficient doubt that the shooting was justified
 and inconsistent defense testimony. The court remanded Beresford to Georgetown
 prison to await trial, but he did not go to prison as ordered and left the court with
 police escorts. He was later reported to be ill and under guard at a hospital. The
 JFJC claimed that this conduct represents a double standard favoring police crimi-
 nal suspects; and GPF officer involvement appeared designed to thwart the course
 of justice and disregard the court's authority. Beresford appealed the ruling that
 changed his charges to murder, and a hearing was set for early 1997. The Wilkinson
 case is representative of some of the principal concerns about police use of deadly
 force and the perceived failure of the authorities to respond adequately to grievances
 against the police.
 Spontaneous community-based groups formed on three occasions as a result of po-
 lice involvement in shootings: The Justice for Jermain Committee- the Bourda Mar-
 ket Group (BMK); and the Mahaica Justice Committee (MJC). he BMK formed
 after a July incident in one of the capital's major markets where city constable
 Oscar Cambridge shot Frankie Figueira in the chest and crippled him from the
 waist down due to a bullet lodged in his spine. The MJC grew out of a September
 incident in which two police officers were charged with manslaughter for allegedly
 shooting to death Ulrich Lynch, a GDF soldier, in a New Amsterdam disco. The
 MJC wants the joint GDF/GPF board of inquiry to upgrade the charges against the
 police to murder.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and there were no known incidents to suggest
 such an official policy or practice. However, there were credible reports that crimi-
 nal suspects were beaten while in custody of the GPF. In addition, several cases of
 wounding by the police of citizens who were not necessarily criminal suspects were
 reported. In April police allegedly kicked and beat Kenworth Alleyne, and then shot
 him in both legs at close range. Alleyne had no criminal record nor was he charged
 with a crime; the officers were reportedly disciplined. Kamal Khan alleged that two
 police detectives shot him in the penis in a game of Russian roulette, and threat-
 ened him with death if he told what had happened. These officers were brought be-
 fore the court charged with wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.
 Rohoni Caceras alleged that police officers repeatedly kicked and struck her in the
 face after they responded to a traffic mishap involving a minibus and a car in which
 she was traveling. These officers were not disciplined for their conduct.
 Although the P    is the principal body charged with looking into complaints of
 police brutality or abuse, it has no power to interview police officers or witnesses
 and must rely on material submitted by the police. The PCA refers cases of alleged
 abuse to the Police Commissioner. Investigations of such charges sometimes result
 in serious disciplinary action. Officers charged as a result of complaints to the PCA
 are routinely suspended for a few days and sometimes fined, but rarely jailed. In
 1995 the GPF reported that it received 113 complaints and answered 111 of them.
 Additionally, the authorities charged and tried 32 police officers for criminal of-
 fenses, dismissed 5 others from the force, and disciplined several others. Critics of
 this process complain that the police force is responsible for investigating itself.
 Prison conditions are Spartan but generally meet minimum international stand-
 ards. Periodic overcrowding is a problem; 5 prisons had a 1995 daily average of 896
 inmates in space intended for 300. Eight people died in prisons, as distinguished
 from police lock-ups, in 1995. Seven died from medical conditions ranging from HIV
 to tuberculosis and pneumonia, among others. One reportedly died from hanging
 himself. The authorities note, however, that the incidence of communicable diseases
 among inmates is consistent with that of the general population.
 In 1995 the GHRA cited poor diet, inadequate medical attention, underpaid and
 Soorly trained staff, and lengthy trial delays as problems facing the prison system.
 e local press reported that due to overcrowding, tuberculosis, sexually transmit.
 ted diseases including HIV/AIDS, and other health problems are rising, posing seri-
 ous public health risks for inmates when they are freed and return to their commu-
 nities. Additionally, due to restricted budgets and other limitations, the large influx
 of prisoners in recent periods reduces efforts directed at rehabilitation and training.
 Significant progress has been made in facilities improvements in recent years. in
 spite of severe financial shortages, infrastructure deficiencies, and inadequate
 human resources, prison officials have endeavored to train the relatively small staff
 and improve general conditions of diet, medical care, and academic and technical
 skills training for inmates. A successful part of the rehabilitation program is a lit-
 eracy program, and there are options for inmates to achieve secondary school diplo-
 
 
 470
 mas. Technical training in agricultural and construction skills is provided to help
 inmates obtain employment upon release from prison.
 The GHRA participates as a member of the prison's visiting committee, which in-
 vestigates prisoner complaints, inspects diets, reviews primary medical care serv-
 ices, and provides recommendations to prison authorities. The GHRA also partici-
 pated in training and development program for prison staff and a family visit pro-
 gram for children of female inmates in the New Amsterdam prison.
 Groups concerned with conditions in police station temporary holding facilities re-
 port them to suffer often from poor sanitation and limited access to medical care.
 Some lock-ups are bare, overcrowded, damp, and uncomfortable. Few have beds,
 wash basins, furniture, or utensils. Diets and food preparation are of inconsistent
 quality. Each cell can have up to five persons, but rarely a toilet. Inmates are some-
 times escorted by staff members outside of the cells to use holes in the floor for toi-
 lets. Inmates generally sleep on a thin pallet on the concrete floor. The East La
 Penitence police lock-up, where female prisoners are held until sentencing, is below
 standard compared to other lock-ups and prisons in the country. Intended as a tem-
 porary holding place before sentencing prisoners, the station has become a long-term
 home for many women whose cases are delayed by the overburdened judicial sys-
 tem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that the authorities gen-
 erally respected in practice.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official. Police may arrest
 without a warrant when an officer witnesses a crime or at the officer's discretion
 in instances where there is good cause to suspect that a crime or a breach of the
 peace has been or will be committed. The law requires that a person arrested and
 held for more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Bail is gen-
 erally available, except in capital offense cases. In narcotics cases, magistrates have
 limited discretion in granting bail before trial but must remand persons convicted
 on narcotics crimes into custody, even if an appeal is pending.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice.
 The court system is composed of a High (Supreme) Court, a national court of ap-
 peal, and a system of magistrate courts that have branches in the various regions
 of the country.
 Magistrates are members of the civil service and are trained lawyers. The mag-
 istrate courts deal with both criminal and civil matters. The Ministry of Legal AT-
 fairs headed by the Attorney General is the principal legal advisor to the State. The
 Director of Public Prosecution is statutorily independent and can file legal charges
 against offenders. The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law. This right is respected in prac-
 tice.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are caused by shortages of trained court personnel
 and magistrates, inadequate resources, postponements at the request of the defense
 or prosecution, occasional alleged acts of bribery, and the slowness of police in pre-
 paring cases for trial. The inefficiency of the judicial system is so great as to under-
 mine due process. The GHRA asserted that prisoners are often detained for 3 or 4
 years while awaiting trial; however, the authorities denied that delays were this
 long. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal may be made to higher
 courts. Appeals of some murder cases have experienced long delays. Trial postpone-
 ments are routinely granted to both the defense and the prosecution. However, pro-
 grams designed to improve legal structures, reform judicial procedures, upgrade
 technical capabilities, and improve efficiency of the courts are having a positive ef-
 fect.
 Although the law recognizes the right to legal counsel, in practice, with the excep-
 tion of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford to pay. The
 Georgetown Legal Aid Clinic, with public and private support, provides advice to
 people who cannot afford a lawyer, with a special interest in cases of violence
 against women and criminal cases related to civil cases in such matters (e.g., as-
 sault as part of a divorce case). The Government provides a small cash grant for
 the clinic as well as the services of a lawyer from the Attorney General's office.
 Apart from these efforts, very few lawyers provide free services in criminal cases.
 Defendants in murder cases who need a lawyer are assigned an attorney by the
 court. The Guyana Association of Women Lawyers provides free legal services for
 civil cases only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Inteference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the right to privacy. The laws requiring judicially is-
 sued warrants for searches were generally respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government generally respects the con-
 stitutional provision for freedom of speech, and citizens freely criticize the Govern-
 ment and its policies.
 The independent Stabroek News continued to publish seven times a week. Inde-
 pendent and opposition newspapers frequently criticized the Government in edi-
 torials and satirized it in cartoons. The government-owned Guyana Broadcasting
 Corporation operates two radio stations, Radio Roraima and Voice of Guyana. The
 Government also owns and operates one television station. There are no private
 radio stations, but 15 private television stations produce newscasts that are often
 critical of the Government.
 The Government reallocated televisic-n channels in a manner that some critics as-
 sert favors the government-owned station to the disadvantage of the privately
 owned stations, which have been critical of the Government. Independent media or-
 ganizations claim that government supporters have subjected them to telephone
 threats and other forms of intimidation. However, there is no proof that such har-
 assment is directed or sanctioned by the Government.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right. The Public
 Order Act requires police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commis-
 sioner has the authority to refuse permission for a public meeting if he believes that
 it will provoke a breach of the peace. In cases of refusal, applicants can appeal to
 the Minister of Home Affairs whose decision on the matter is final. Political parties
 and other groups held public meetings and rallies throughout the country without
 hindrance.
 The Constitution also provides for freedom of association, and the Government
 generally respects this right.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Members of all faiths are allowed to wor-
 ship freely, and there are no restrictions on foreign religious proselytizing.
 c. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission, the result of a law dat-
 ing from colonial times designed to protect the indigenous people from exploitation.
 In practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas without regard to
 the formality of a permit. Citizens are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to re-
 turn.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government does not have a fixed policy on refugees or asylum but is
 studying draft model legislation prepared by the UNHCR. The issue of provision of
 first asylum did not arise; there were no reports of forced return of persons to a
 country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guyana has a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election in a multiparty po-
 litical system based on proportional representation. The leader of the party that ob-
 tains a plurality of seats in Parliament during national elections becomes President,
 with a 5-year term of office, unless the party loses control of Parliament or calls
 elections earlier. The President appoints a cabinet and a Prime Minister who, with
 the President, exercise executive power.
 Citizens are free to join or support political parties of their choice and established
 nearly 20 new ones in 1996. The two major parties--the PPP and the People's Na-
 tional Congress (PNC)-are largely formed by Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese,
 respectively. The 1992 general election, considered free and fair by foreign observ-
 ers, brought the former opposition party to power. Any citizen 18 years or older can
 register to vote, and about 80 percent cast votes in the 1992 election. In January
 a seven-member commission was sworn in to oversee the national elections expected
 in 1997 and which must take place no later than March 1998. The commission
 be an its first task-preparation of voter registration lists-in June.
 There are no legal impediments to participation of women or minorities in thepo-
 litical process, but historically, neither women nor Amerindians were encouraged to
 
 
 participate, other than by voting. The 17-person cabinet includes 2 women. The 72-
 member Parliament includes 12 women and 10 Amerindians, representing both
 major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference.The GHRA is a nongovernmental orga-
 nization (NGO) formed in 1979 with the participation of trade unions, professional
 organizations, various ethnic groups, and churches. It issues periodic press releases
 and publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. The Government made
 no public statements in direct response to either GHRA or foreign human rights re-
 ports and appears willing to discuss human rights issues with international or do-
 mestic NGO's.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons regardless of race,
 sex, religion, or national origin. However, the Government does not always enforce
 these provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women, including domestic violence, is a significant
 problem. Rape and incest are common. Lawyers say that more victims are reporting
 these crimes to the authorities although there is still a social stigma attached to
 them. The police are sometimes hesitant to interfere in cases of domestic disputes.
 Because of their economic circumstances and the lack of any family shelter or other
 place of solace, victims of domestic violence are often trapped in their homes with
 their abusers. A shelter for battered women, operated by a private organization, is
 expected to open in early 1997. Although the Government has not sponsored or
 funded programs for victims of violence, it provides a subsidy to an NGO working
 in this area.
 The 1990 Equal Rights Act was intended to end discrimination based upon sex,
 but it is too restrictive to be an effective tool. There is no legal protection against
 sexual harassment in the workplace. Legislation prohibits dismissal on the grounds
 of pregnancy and it does not occur in practice. The Women's Affairs Bureau of the
 Ministry of Labor, Human Services, and Social Security monitors the legal rights
 of women.
 Legislation passed by parliament in 1990 protects women's property rights in
 common law marriages and entitles a woman who separates or divorces to one-half
 the couple's property if she had been working and one-third of the property if she
 had been a housewife..Divorce by consent remains illegal. Legislation also gives au-
 thority to the courts to overturn a man's will in the event that it does not provide
 for his wife, as long as she was dependent on him for financial support.
 One of the few organizations that focus primarily on women's rights, other than
 those sponsored by political parties, is the Guyana chapter of the Caribbean Asso-
 ciation for Feminist Research and Action.
 Children.-An estimated 65 to 86 percent of the population lives in poverty, and
 children are more severely affected than any other group. Although the Government
 provides free education through secondary school, the severe deterioration of the
 public education and health care systems has stunted children's futures. The public
 health system is inadequate and for many children private health care is
 unaffordable. Children are often not given the opportunity to attend school because
 their families need them to contribute to running the household by working or pro-
 viding child care.
 The worst effects on children's lives come from migration. More than 3 percent
 of the population emigrates every year in search of a brighter economic future. Par-
 ents often leave behind their children to be raised by family members, friends, or
 by other children. Media reports of rape and incest indicate that violence against
 children is a significant problem. The administration of justice for children is char-
 acterized by a system that lacks social services needed by children fleeing sexual,
 physical, or emotional abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-The lack of appropriate infrastructure to provide access
 to both public and private facilities makes it very difficult to employ the disabled
 outside their homes. There is no law mandating provision of access for people with
 disabilities.
 There are several special schools and training centers for the disabled, but they
 lack trained staff and are in disrepair.
 Indigenous People.-Most of the small Amerindian population, composed of nine
 tribal groups, live in reservations and villages in remote parts of the interior. Their
 
 
 standard of living is much lower than that of most citizens, and their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of
 natural resources is limited.
 Amerindian life is regulated by the Amerindian Act, legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. The act gives the
 Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and what is an Amer-
 indian community, to appoint Amerindian leaders, and to annul decisions made by
 Amerindian councils. It also prohibits the sale of alcohol to Amerindians and re-
 quires government permission before any Amerindian can accept formal employ-
 ment, although these provisions generally are not enforced. Both individuals and
 Amerindian groups remain free to criticize the Government.
 At a February conference sponsored by the World Bank, President Jagan assured
 the Amerindian population that the Government was committed to demarcating the
 lands to which they are entitled and to protecting Amerindian values from exploi-
 tation by foreign and local investors. However, Amerindians themselves did not se-
 lect the Amerindian spokespersons at the conference. The Government chose them,
 and it did not invite the Guyanese Organization of Indigenous Peoples or the Amer-
 indian People's Association, the two major NGO's representing indigenous people.
 These organizations mistrust the World Bank, which they claim has funded the con-
 struction of roads through tribal lands in the Rupununi savannahs. This activity
 has resulted in the decline of the Yanomami, Wapishana, Nimbigara, and Macushi
 nations, which live in areas southwest of the Rupununi river.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Longstanding ethnic tensions, primarily be-
 tween citizens of African and Indian descent, continued to influence society and po-
 litical life. Historical patterns of social organization, formed during the colonial pe-
 riod, have resulted in social and political organizations coalescing around ethnic
 groups. This pattern of racial and ethnic grouping has become politicized over the
 years, polarizing society along ethnic lines. Discrimination and exclusion continue
 to occur.
 Some Indo-Guyanese allege that the 1965-92 PNC government established a pat-
 tern of racial discrimination in favor of the Afro-Guyanese. However, many Afro-
 Guyanese now allege that they suffer racial discrimination and "political victimiza-
 tion" by the predominantly Indo-Guyanese PPP, which they say directs benefits and
 opportunities to its supporters. The civil service and defense and police forces are
 overwhelmingly staffed by Afro-Guyanese. Recruitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guy-
 anese candidates for the uniformed services generally have met with an
 unenthusiastic response, with most qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates optin for a
 business or professional career over military, police, or public service. The chief of
 staff of the Guyana Defence Fare is Indo-Guyanese and there are other Indo-Guya-
 nese officers in both the GDF and the police force.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of association
 and specifically enumerates workers' rights to form or belong to trade unions. The
 law does not require employers to recognize a union in the workplace, even if a large
 majority of workers have indicated their desire to be represented by a union.
 Approximately 34 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union members
 work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises. Organized labor freely as-
 sociates in one major national federation, the Guyana Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), which is composed of 22 unions. There is a tradition of close ties between
 the trade union movement and political parties.
 Historically, the two major political parties wielded significant influence over the
 leadership of several unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles as
 party officials. Although this still occurs, it is less common.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike. Public employees providing
 essential services may strike if they provide the proper notice to the Ministry of
 Labor and leave a skeletal staff in place. A minority of strikes in 1996 were illegal,
 i.e., the union leadership did not approve them, or they did not meet the require-
 ments specified in collective bargaining agreements. However, these strikes occurred
 in crucial sectors of the economy such as transportation.
 There is no legislation prohibiting retaliation against strikers or of antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers. However, this principle is always included by the Govern-
 ment in the terms of resumption after a strike. Arbitration rulings, whenever agreed
 to by the contending parties, are legally enforceable.
 Unions and their federations freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean
 and international trade union and professional groups. All three of the major inter-
 national trade union federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Public and private sector em-
 pio~yspssess and utilize the generaly accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Ministry of Labour certifies all collctive bargaining agreements
 and has never refused to do so. This right is not codified, however, and employers
 are not legally required to recognize unions or to bargain with them.
 Individual unions directly negotiate ollective baaining status, pursuant to the
 1993 repeal of a regulation that required that all collective bargaining be negotiated
 through the TUC. Unions are dissatisfied with a p rvision grant'g the Ministry of
 Finance vetoepwer over wage contracts negotiatedby other ministries.
 The Chief Labour Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labour provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. The Ministry eliminated a backlog of
 pending cases, but insufficient manpower and transportation continued to limit the
 Ministry's ability to function.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Factories Act and the Em-
 ployment of Young Persons and Children Act set out minimum age requirements
 for employment of children. Legally, no person under age 14 may be employed in
 any industrial undertaking and no person under age 16 may be employed at night,
 except under regulated circumstances. The law permits children under age 14 to be
 employed only in enterprises in which members of the same family are employed.
 However, it is common to see very young children engaged in street trading in the
 capital. While cognizant of the situation, the Ministry of Labor does not employ suf-
 ficient inspectors to enforce existing laws effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labour Act and the Wages Councils Act
 allow the Labor Minister to set mimimum wages for various categories of private
 employers. The minimum public sector wage is $2.20 (G$307.84) per day. Although
 enforement mechanisms exist, it is dcultto put them into practice, and unorga-
 nized workers, particularly women and children, are often paid less than what is
 legally reuired. The legal minimum wage for the public sector is insufficient to pro-
 vie an a equate standard of living for worker and family.
 The Shops Act and the Factories Act set hours of employment, which vary by in-
 dustry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day or a 44-hour week
 requires payment of an overtime rate. However, if the initial contract stipulates a
 48 hour workweek, then the overtime rate only applies for hours worked in excess
 of 48 hours. The law does not provide for at least a 24-hour rest period.
 The Factories Act also sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Oc-
 cupation Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labour is charged with con-
 ducting factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Workers cannot remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardizing continued employment.
