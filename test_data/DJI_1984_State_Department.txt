 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a small, resource-poor developing nation,
 strategically located at the southern end of the Red Sea.
 Ethnically, the country is divided among the majority
 politically dominant ethnic Somalis (Issas), who control the
 Government, civil service, and armed, forces; a substantial
 minority of Afars; and Arabs, mainly Yemenis, who have a
 prominent role in commerce.
 Political power is shared by an unwritten arrangement in which
 the President, currently Hassan Gouled Aptidon, is an Issa and
 the Prime Minister an Afar, with cabinet positions divided
 among these ethnic groups. Since 1981, as part of the
 political balancing act, there is a single political party,
 the Popular Assembly Party. The party central committee
 selected the single slate of candidates for the National
 Assembly elections held in May 1982.
 Djibouti has its own armed forces, including a small army, but
 security of the country is also assured by the continued
 presence of 4,000-4,500 French troops, including one unit of
 the French Foreign Legion.
 Despite its meager resources, Djibouti continued in 1984 to
 host refugees from Ethiopia and Somalia, with the assistance
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 and other international relief agencies. In September 1983,
 the Government concluded with the UNHCR and Ethiopia a plan
 for voluntary repatriation for the Ethiopian refugees, but
 serious drought in Ethiopia has hampered full implementation
 of it. By the end of 1984 over 15,000 Ethiopians had
 repatriated, either under UNHCR auspices or spontaneously;
 over 14,000 remain in refugee camps and in the capital city.
 The legal system is still in its formative stages. On any
 topic not yet covered by Djiboutian legislation, the
 Napoleonic code, a product of the French colonial period, and,
 to an extent, the Islamic Shari'a generally apply. No further
 sections of the first Constitution for Djibouti, introduced in
 1981, have been issued.
 Djibouti's economy rests on the activities of a large foreign
 expatriate community, the maritime and commercial activities
 of the port of Djibouti, the airport, and the operation of the
 Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad. Recent economic stagnation has
 been compounded by the refugee burden. Because of Djibouti's
 almost total lack of resources, the major focus of the
 Government is on economic development, which is intrinsically
 tied to foreign economic assistance. Unemployment and
 underemployment remain major problems. Free enterprise is
 encouraged in Djibouti's service-oriented economy, and the
 rignt of private property and freedom of movement are
 generally respected. The openness of the society creates an
 atmosphere in which most citizens feel free to pursue their
 livelihood without much fear of governmental interference.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no incidents of killing by the Government for
 apparent political motives since Djibouti became independent in
 1977. In December, 1981, the reputed leader of a Somali
 dissident group was assassinated in Djibouti City. The
 Djibouti Government arrested several individuals for this crime
 in late 1982 and announced that it had evidence of foreign
 complicity, although no country has yet been identified
 publicly. The Government seems willing and able to prevent or
 punish killings by security, military, or political forces
 under its control.
 b. Disappearance
 No allegations of disappearances have been made in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no allegations of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment in 1984. In past years, however, there
 have been several allegations of both harassment of political
 opposition leaders and torture of political opponents. For
 example, in September 1982, in a television program produced in
 France, former Prime Minister Ahemd Dini reiterated charges he
 and others had made previously that political prisoners were
 being systematically tortured in Djibouti. The Government
 denied these charges. In March 1983, a former government
 employee arrested on charges of espionage escaped to France to
 seek asylum. He told Amnesty International representatives
 there that he had been systematically tortured during
 interrogation. There has been no reaction to these charges
 from the Government, but Amnesty International's 1984 report
 (covering 1983) mentions the 1983 charge and one other
 allegation of torture, specifically hanging by the feet and
 repeated immersion in water.
 Prison conditions are said to be minimally adequate. Family
 members and counsel are permitted access to prisoners, and
 public health and medical services supervise health conditions
 in a generally competent manner.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The current system of justice is a mixture of French and
 Islamic practice. There is no habeas corpus, and preventive
 detention is permitted. However, prosecutors are required to,
 and generally do, file charges in an expedient fashion. The
 most recent major example of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 was the detention of 13 political dissidents in 1981. All were
 released in 1982.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the state security court, established to deal with crime
 against the security of the state, and ordinary civil and
 criminal courts permit family members and counsel, though not
 the general public, to attend trials. The judiciary has
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 remained largely independent of military and executive
 pressures. However, there were several allegations in 1984 of
 corruption within the judiciary, including that individuals
 could arrange favorable judgments in commercial disputes by
 bribery.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Corr espondence
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government
 authorities 'may not enter or remain in the domicile of a
 private individual without his consent and without a legal
 order,' except, among other circumstances, when it is necessary
 to facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of crimes and
 when the public order is seriously disturbed. There are
 reports of noncompliance with this statute, notably in 1981
 with the detention of the 13 political dissidents mentioned
 previously.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All Djiboutian media are government-owned and support the
 Government and its policies. Radio/TV Djibouti claims to
 receive only limited guidance from senior political levels on
 handling news it presents to the public. There is. occasional
 criticism of the shortcomings of local institutions, some
 associated with key political and religious figures, and of
 corrupt and inefficient practices, but not of the central
 Government. There have been occasional confiscations of
 foreign publications which contained commentary critical of the
 Government. The media usually do not carry stories of
 violence, crime, or ethnic disturbances.
 b. jFreedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require a permit which may be denied for
 security reasons. The Government permits free association
 outside the political realm, and there are several independent
 social, religious, cultural, and commercial organizations.
 The right of labor to organize and strike exists, but only a
 small portion of the work force is unionized. Moreover, the
 Government has organized the single national labor federation
 and keeps it under its control and through it, the individual
 unions. Unions freely maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Over 96 percent of the population is Muslim, but other
 religions are permitted to operate freely. Freedom of
 religious practice and association with coreligionists outside
 the country is unfettered.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians exercise their right to travel freely within and
 outside their country. Passports are generally freely
 available. There are no exchange controls.

 DJIBOUTI
 As many as 40,000 refugees, mainly from Ethiopia, fled to
 Djibouti during the height of the armed conflict in the Ogaden
 region. Most of the refugees have received assistance from the
 international community in the refugee camps of Dikhil and El
 Sabieh. Several thousand more have spontaneously settled in
 the capital city. Refugees in the camps are restricted to them
 and are not able to move freely. Given Djibouti's meager
 resources and limited opportunities for employment, current
 government policy is to encourage all refugees to move to
 refugee camps in the short term and to return to their country
 of origin in the long term. Over 14,000 refugees remain in
 Djibouti.
 In early 1983, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and the UNHCR agreed to
 begin a process of voluntary repatriation of refugees in late
 1983. About 10,000 persons have since returned under this
 agreement. It was to have been completed by April 1984, but
 Ethiopian drought and famine conditions have since slowed the
 return of refugees and brought in new flows of drought victims
 from Ethiopia. The continual influx poses serious problems
 regarding refugee status. In August 1984, following a series
 of roundups, several hundred persons were deported to
 Ethiopia. The Djiboutian Government denied the deportees were
 registered refugees and claimed instead they were illegal
 aliens whose presence has created tensions with native
 Djiboutians. In December 1984, 5,000 Ethiopian drought victims
 seeking relief in Djibouti were deported for lack of proper
 refugee documentation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djibouti is today a one-party state whose leaders and
 candidates for Parliament are chosen by the leadership of the
 party, the Popular Assembly Party. The one-party system was
 instituted in 1981, and the Government detained leaders of the
 previous opposition and dissidents allegedly attempting to
 encourage ethnic strife. Traditionally, the Djiboutian
 Government includes in the ruling cabinet representatives of
 all the nation's important ethnic groups. However, some Afars
 complain that the country is run by and for the Issas, who
 dominate the Government, the armed forces, and the single
 party. Others complain that tribal and ethnic considerations
 inhibit appointment of competent administrators.
 While citizens are encouraged to become involved in politics
 and to vote, the party leadership, through a 14-member
 political bureau, carefully controls and directs all political
 activity. There is no democratic or nonviolent means for
 citizens of Djibouti to change their Government.
 Over 90 percent of the reported registered voters went to the
 polls in the May, 1982 elections. There were reports of minor
 scattered violence on election day, as well as some coercion of
 voters.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On at least six occasions since independence, most recently in
 August 1984, there have been foreign press and other reports
 alleging human rights violations by the Government. The
 Government accepted the 1981 human rights investigation request
 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It also
 
 
 98
 DJIBOUTI
 cooperated in 1981 with a delegate from Amnesty International
 who visited Djibouti to investigate charges of torture and
 death from torture. Amnesty International in its 1984 report
 (covering 1983) expressed continuing concern about allegations
 of torture of detainees, including former political refugees
 who had returned to Djibouti from exile. Freedom House rates
 Djibouti 'partly free.'
 Two members of an international fact-finding team sponsored by
 Cultural Survival, a non-profit human rights organization, were
 expelled from Djibouti in December 1983 after making contacts
 in the country with private voluntary organizations and refugee
 officials to investigate reports of involuntary repatriation of
 refugees.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Djibouti is one of the world's least developed countries and is
 almost totally lacking in natural resources. Its economy
 depends on a large French military and expatriate presence and
 outside donor support, mainly from France and Saudi Arabia.
 This support is directed toward many aspects of the economy,
 including education, transportation, and health facilities.
 In 1983 the Gross National Product of Djibouti was estimated at
 $476.50 per capita. However this figure is misleading, given
 the very high poverty levels in much of the country and the
 large, well-paid, predominantly French, expatriate community,
 some 4 percent of the total estimated population of 275,000.
 For Djibouti citizens, the estimated GNP per capita is
 $260.00. A 1980 French study estimated that 47 percent of the
 population earned less that $130 per annum.
 Almost one-third of the population lives a nomadic life of bare
 subsistence in the rural hinterlands of the republic. A United
 Nations Development Program report of 1980 states that the
 Djibouti rural population is "probably one of the poorest
 groups in Eastern Africa," and that 'extreme poverty (also)
 exists in urban environments of Djibouti." Beyond the near
 total lack of natural resources, two factors contribute
 significantly to the poverty level: First, practically all
 commodities are imported for consumption, and prices of even
 basic staples are extraordinarily high for most of the
 nonexpatriate population. Second, the high level of
 unemployment and the shortage of jobs require working members
 of a family to be economically responsible for nonworking
 members. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) 1980 report,
 which uses Djibouti Ministry of Labor statistics, states that
 more than 50 percent of those seeking employment in 1979 could
 not find work. Unemployment in 1982 was estimated at 45
 percent and underemployment at 33 percent of the work force.
 The harsh, hot environment is one of the causes of the low life
 expectancy of 50 years (1973 statistics) and the high infant
 mortality rate of 140.7 per thousand. The latter in turn
 contribute to a relatively high birth rate of three percent per
 annum. There is limited agricultural potential, and the only
 large-scale source of locally produced food is fish. The
 Government has encouraged the population to supplement their
 diets with fish. Use of the narcotic plant khat is a major
 economic and social problem, and W.H.O. held a conference in
 Djibouti on the subject in December 1984.
 
 
 99.
 DJIBOUTI
 Water is a scarce commodity and of poor quality in most of the
 country. There are no surface water sources. The Government
 has made efforts to truck water to remote areas of the
 country. An African Development Fund study of September 1979
 estimated 51 percent of the population received safe water (53
 percent in urban areas, 20 percent in rural areas). Active
 government-supported assistance efforts to identify and to
 utilize further water source and storage areas are currently
 under way.
 According to a November 1980 World Bank report, the adult
 literacy rate in the French language was 17 percent. Primary
 school enrollment was approximately 21,000 in 1983, an increase
 of some 320 percent since independence in 1977. The high
 school enrollment increased from 3,000 to 9,000 during the same
 period. This increase, with a concomitant rise in the number
 and quality of educational facilities, reflects the high
 priority the Djiboutian Government gives to education.
 Women are, in theory, politically equal to men. However, as in
 many Muslim countries, they play a secondary role in public
 life and none hold high government or legislative positions.
