 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Joao Bernardo Vieira was elected President in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau's
 first multiparty elections in 1994. Vieira has ruled the country since taking power
 in a 1980 coup. He is also the President of the African Party for the Independence
 of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which was the only legal political party
 from independence in 1974 until adoption of a multiparty constitution in 1991. The
 PAIGC holds 62 of the 100 seats in the National Assembly where 4 other parties
 are represented. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but its
 functioning is hampered by a lack of resources and by corruption.
 The police, under the direction of the Ministry of Internal Administration, have
 primary responsibility for the nation's internal security. The armed forces are re-
 spnsible for external security and may be called upon to assist the police in inter-
 nal emergencies. The police were responsible for human rights abuses.
 The population of 1 million relies largely upon subsistence agriculture. Annual er
 capita gross domestic product is estimated at $840. The economy remained sta le
 in 1996, but inflation continued at approximately 50 percent. The country is bur-
 dened by a heavy external debt and has inadequate tax revenues.
 Political pluralism brought about greater transparency. However, the overall
 human rights situation did not improve during the year. Police continued to engage
 in arbitrary detention, physical mistreatment, and other forms of harassment. In
 addition, the police shot and killed one person and gravely injured another in the
 aftermath of a demonstration. The Government did not punish any members of the
 security forces for abuses. Prison conditions remain poor, and prolonged detention
 and a lack of due process continue. The Government restricts freedom of assembly.
 Journalists continue to practice self-censorship, and the Government infringes on
 citizens' right to privacy. Discrimination against women and children are problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiin n-There was one known extrajudicial
 killing in 1996. In July the Minister of the Interior agreed to allow Spain to deport
 about 50 Africans of varying nationalities illegally resident in Spanish Morocco to
 Guinea-Bissau. The Spanish Government agreed to pay for the maintenance and re-
 
 
 patriation of the deportees. On September 23, Guinean police shot and killed one
 of the deportees while he was sitting on a wall outside of the jail where they were
 being housed. This action was apparently in retaliation for a march earlier in the
 day that the deportees conducted in front of the Presidential palace to protest their
 conditions. In addition another deportee was shot and severely wounded. The Gov-
 ernment has undertaken an investigation of this affair.
 The 1992 death of Ussumane Quade, an army officer beaten to death while in po-
 lice custody, remains unresolved. Human rights monitors continue to press for a
 thorough and impartial investigation of his death, ostensibly a suicide, but police
 have refused to cooperate.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradin  reatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or other coercion is invalid. However, the Government often ignores
 these provisions. Security and police authorities have historically employed abusive
 interrogation methods, usually in the form of severe beatings or deprivation. The
 Government rarely enforces provisions for punishment of abuses committed by secu-
 rity forces. Beating and deprivation have continued to be used in prisons as a
 means of oercion. The head of the national polie has initiated a program to edu-
 cate police in the interior against using such methods.
 Two policemen accused of rape in 1995 have yet to stand trial, and no trial date
 has been set. Human rights monitors report other incidents in which police accused
 of rape or mistreatment of prisoners have not been prosecuted.
 The Prime Minister and his bodyguards slapped and pushed three citizens in
 three unrelated incidents. The attacks were not politically motivated, and no serious
 injuries occurred.
 .son conditions are poor, but generally not life threatening. The Human Rights
 League has offered to pay for prison improvements, but the Government has denied
 it access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal system provides for procedural
 rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to release if no timely indictment is
 brought, and the right to a speedy trial. In practice, the judicial system generally
 fails to provide these rights.
 Police detain suspects without judicial authority or warrants, occasionally through
 the devices of house arrest. The Government holds detainees without charge or trial
 for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado.
 Human rights monitors estimate that pretrial detainees arrested without war-
 rants and imprisoned without charge make up more than 90 percent of the prison
 population. The authorities do not routinely observe bail procedures.
 The case of the deportees from Spain highlights this problem. They were initially
 housed in a jail in Bissau, although allowed to come and go as they pleased. Follow-
 ing the September 23 incidents, they were held without charges at a military prison
 outside of Bissau. Human rights groups and other interested parties were originally
 denied access to them. The deportees have since been released. The Nigerian, Guin-
 ean, and Spanish Governments repatriated the Nigerian refugees through Gambia.
 The remaining refugees are insisting on greater compensation in exchange for their
 agreement to leave the country.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but judges, who are poorly trained and paid, are sometimes subject to political
 pressures and corruption.
 Trials involving state security are conducted by civilian courts. Military courts try
 only crimes under the Code of Military Justice committed by armed forces person-
 nel. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both civilian and military
 cases. The President has the authority to grant pardons and reduce sentences.
 Despite its problems, the judicial system is sometimes capable of providing a fair
 trial, even in ontroversial cases. Several poli~eman accused of being accomplices to
 armed robbery in September 1995 were tried, convicted, and are now in prison.
 Citizens who cannot afford an attorney have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and urban dwellers often bring
 judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid the costs and bureaucratic im-
 pediments of the official system. Police often resolve disputes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolabiity of domicile, person, and correspondence,
 but the Government does not always respect these rights. The authorities examine
 international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom use judicial warrants,
 and the police sometimes force entry into private homes.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but journalists continue to practice self-censorship.
 In addition to the government-run newspaper, there is a daily newspaper and four
 weekly newspapers. However, the weekly newspapers have not published regularly
 due to financial constraints.
 There are currently five independent radio stations in Bissau in addition to the
 government-controlled station. Two of these are French and Portuguese radio sta-
 tions, retransmitted in Bissau directly from Paris and Lisbon.
 In September and October, Radio Pindjiguiti, one of the private stations, alleged
 Government harassment due to its unfavorable coverage of the Government's han-
 dling of the African deportee situation and temporarily ceased news broadcasts.
 President Vieira intervened and guaranteed the safety of the station, allowing it to
 resume news broadcasts 48 hours later.
 Academic freedom is observed in schools and research institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, but the Government restricts the right in prac-
 tice. Government approval is required for all assemblies and demonstrations. Re-
 quests are not always approved.
 In May the Government denied the Guinean Human Rights League permission
 to march peacefully in protest of Prime Minister Saturnino da Costa s management
 of the economy and three separate assaults by the Prime Minister and his body-
 guards on citizens.
 In September the Government responded with excessive violence to an illegal pro-
 test in front of the Presidential palace by the African deportees from Spain. Police
 killed one deportee and injured another (see Section La.).
 The Government does not prohibit or discourage actively the formation of associa-
 tions, nor does it impose any restrictions on private associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While religious groups must be licensed
 by the Government, none has been refused. Various faiths, including Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, continued missionaryoperations during the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government generally does not restrict movement within the coun-
 try, foreign travel, or emigration. However, checkpoints and police harassment
 occur. Passports are issued by the Minister of Internal Administration. Citizens are
 guaranteed the right to return and are not subject to political revocation of their
 citizenship. There are no provisions for asylum.
 The Government provided first asylum     to Senegalese refugees from   the
 Casamance during that region's conflict. The number of Senegalese refugees has re-
 mained stable at 20,000 as tensions have eased in Senegal's Casamance region. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has set up a refugee
 camp in Jolomete well south of the Senegalese border. The Government requested
 this location in order to prevent refugees from being involved in the Casamance sep-
 aratist movement, thereby eliminating conflicts between the Governments of Sen-
 egal and Guinea-Bissau. As of June, the Jolomete camp had about 550 refugees.
 There were no reports of forced return of Casamance refugees.
 In the case of other refugees, the Government has generally cooperated with the
 UNHCR. It granted first asylum to Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees in 1996.
 There have been no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1994 voters were able to freely choose their government for the first time in
 the nation's history. The PAIGC retained power in elections judged to be free and
 fair by international observers, although they acknowledged some irregularities. The
 Minister of Territorial Administration scheduled local elections for December; how-
 ever, these were postponed until the first quarter of 1997.
 Women are underrepresented in the political process. Eight of the 100 National
 Assembly deputies are women, and there is a women's caucus that cuts across party
 lines. Only 2 of 21 Cabinet ministers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did net interfere with the Guinea-Bissau Human Rights League
 and international human rights groups, which continued to investigate human
 rights abuses objectively without government harassment. However, the League's
 
 
 129
 planned conference on police and prison reform was canceled for the third consecu-
 tive year due to the Government's unwillingness to allow police to attend. The Gov-
 ernment denied the Human Rights League access to some prisoners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and
 religion. In practice, however, the Government does not effectively enforce these pro-
 visions.
 Women.-Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of set-
 tling domestic disputes. Although police will intervene in domestic disputes if re-
 quested, the Government has not undertaken specific measures to counter social
 pressure against reporting domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment
 of women.
 Discrimination against women persists although officially prohibited by law.
 Women are responsible for most work on subsistence farms and have limited access
 to education, especially in rural areas. Women do not have equal access to employ-
 ment. Among certain ethnic groups, women can not own or manage land nor iMerit
 property.
 Children.-The Government allocates only limited resources for children's welfare
 and education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health e xpers as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is widely
 practiced within certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and the Mandinkas. The
 practice is increasing as the population becomes more Muslim. The practice is also
 now being performed not only on adolescent -is, but also on babies as young as
 4 months old. The Government has neither outlawed the practice nor taken effective
 action to combat it.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation mandating accessibility. The law
 does not specifically prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and the
 Government does not ensure equal access to employment and education. The State
 has made some efforts to assist disabled veterans through pension programs, but
 these programs do not adequately address veterans' health, housing, and food needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides all civilian workers with
 the freedom to form and join independent trade unions. However, the vast majority
 of the population works in subsistence agriculture. Most union members are govern-
 ment or parastatal employees; only a small percentage of workers are in the wage
 sector and are organized.
 The Government registers all labor unions. There are 11 labor unions registered
 and operating. All unions are officially independent of the Government, but seven
 unions are affiliated with the National Trade Union Confederation (UNTG), which
 retains close informal ties with the PAIGC. The law does not favor UNTG-affiliated
 unions over others. The Constitution provides for the right to strike and protection
 from retribution against strike activities.
 The only legal restriction on strike activity is the requirement for prior notice.
 Legal strikes were conducted by several unions, with no retribution against the
 strikers.
 All unions are free to affiliate freely with national confederations and inter-
 national labor organizations of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide or protect the right to bargain collectively, and there were no instances of
 genuine collective bargaining. Most wages are established in bilateral negotiations
 between workers and employers, taking into consideration the minimum salaries set
 annually by the Government's Council of Ministers.
 The Government's prvisions for the protection of workers against antinion dis-
 crimination has very little effect due to low union membership. The Government has
 not taken further action, but no workers have alleged antiunion discrimination. The
 Government adopted no laws to establish penal sanctions against employers practic-
 ing such discrimination. The practice is not widespread.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced and Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is
 not permitted by law and is not known to exist. An individual accused of coercing
 labor in 1995 was found guilty and fined.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The General Labor Act of 1986 es-
 tablished a minimum age of 14 years for general factory labor and 18 years for
 heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age require-
 
 
 ments are generally followed in the small-wage sector, but the Ministry of Civil
 Service and Labor does not enforce these requirements in other sectors. Children
 in cities often work in street trading, and those in rural communities do domestic
 and field work without pay. The Government does not attempt to discourage these
 traditional practices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government's Council of Ministers annu-
 ally establishes minimum wage rates for all categories of work but does not enforce
 them. The lowest monthly wage is less than $20 (600,000 pesos). This wage is inad-
 equate to maintain a minimum standard of living, and workers must supplement
 their income through other work, reliance on the extended family, and subsistence
 agriculture. The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek with-
 out further compensation is 45, but the Government does not enforce this provision.
 The Ministry of Civil Service and Labor establishes legal health and safety stand-
 ards for workers, with the cooperation of the unions, which are then adopted into
 law by the National Assembly. However, these standards are not enforced, and
 many persons work under conditions that endanger their health and safety.
 Workers do not have a guaranteed right to remove themselves from unsafe work-
 ing conditions without losing their jobs. Given high unemployment, a worker who
 left for such reasons would be readily replaced.
