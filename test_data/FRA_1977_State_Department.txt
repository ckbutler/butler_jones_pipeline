 France has an established tradition of respect for human

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 France provides ektensive social security benefits, unem-
 ployment compensation, full health services, and free edu-
 cation to all citizens through university levels. The
 French government's progressive decisions to absorb many
 refugees from Algeria and Indochina, and to permit Afri-
 cans from former French colonies to work in France on a
 long-term basis, have been intensely debated and sometimes
 criticized by segments of the French population. Nonethe-
 less, official French sensitivity to these needs has re-

 prevent instances where criticism might evolve into racial
 conflict.

 Assembly

 Travel and Emigration

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Occasions in which outside investigations of human rights
 performance in France would be appropriate have not, to
 our knowledge, arisen.
