 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state
 founded upon the principle of the rule of law. Sovereign
 power rests with the people as represented by their delegates
 assembled in a unicameral parliament. Supreme executive power
 is vested in the President. The Cabinet, composed of the
 Prime Minister and 16 ministers and responsible to Parliament,
 works with the President in governing the country. There is
 an independent judiciary consisting of the Supreme Court and
 the Supreme Administrative Court.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and
 is supervised by the courts.
 Finland has a highly developed and mixed economy with
 state-owned, privately owned, and publicly owned companies.
 Citizens are free to pursue their legitimate private
 interests, hold private property, and engage in economic
 activity without government interference.
 During 1990, there were no violations of fundamental human
 rights reported in Finland. National minorities and women
 enjoy the same economic and political rights as all other
 citizens. Upon joining the Council of Europe in May 1989,
 Finland became aware of certain deficiencies in its human
 rights legislation, which the Government and Parliament are
 correcting. Finland ratified, with one reservation, the
 European Convention on Human Rights in May 1990. The Finnish
 reservation is a result of the lack of immediate financial
 resources to provide oral hearings in the courts of appeal,
 the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, and the
 Water Rights Court. The Finnish Government expects to be able
 to remove this reservation within the next 2 years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing

 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is provided for by law and is
 respected in practice. By law, prisoners must be treated
 justly with respect for their human dignity and without
 distinction on the basis of race, sex, language, nationality,
 religious or political conviction, social position, wealth, or
 any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 ThG law provides for freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 i.wprisonment or exile; it is respected in practice.

 A reform of pretrial procedures took effect on January 1,
 1989. The stated purpose of the reform was to achieve
 uniformity with the practice in other Western countries. The
 law shortens the detention period to 7 days and gives the
 accused access to a lawyer during that time. The accused must
 be given a court hearing within 8 days of notification of the
 arrest, if in a city, or within 30 days, if in rural areas.
 The State pays legal fees for the indigent defendant.
 Circumstances surrounding the arrest are subject to judicial
 review at the time the accused is brought to trial. The
 accused may apply to the same court for civil damages for loss
 of freedom in the event the accused is found to have been
 innocent of the crime charged and the arrest is deemed invalid:
 Bail is not available. Those accused of serious crimes must by
 law remain in custody; those charged with minor offenses may be
 released on their personal recognizance at the court's
 discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared state
 of war for narrowly defined offenses, such as treason, mutiny,
 and arms trafficking. Supervisory personnel from the Ministries
 of Justice and Interior as well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman
 and the-Chancellor of Justice have authority to enter prisonp
 and to order the release of prisoners held without charges.
 The law prohibits the exile of Finnish citizens.
 Legislation with regard to conscientious, objectors to Finland's-
 obligatory military service took effect in 1987 for a trial
 period of 5 years-. While Jehovah's Witnesses are exempted from
 military service under the law, other Finnish citizens must
 serve in the military or become conscientious objectors . The
 law lengthened alternative civilian service for conscientious
 objectors to 16 months, twice the minimum length of military
 service. In April three conscientious objectors went on a
 hunger strike to protest the so-called punitive nature of
 alternative service because of its length. Eventually, after
 public pressure, the President, rejecting the Supreme Court's
 advice, pardoned the hunger strikers on humanitarian grounds.
 The Ministry of Labor in October introduced in Parliament
 amendments to the Civilian Service Act, which if enacted, would
 shorten the length of alternative service.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is provided for by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens temporaily
 residing-in Finland are guaranteed the right to counsel of
 their choice. The law provides that charges must be clearly
 stated and that civilians may not be tried by military courts
 except in time of war.' Local courts may decide to- conduct a
 trial behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and
 guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or
 endanger the national security of the State. In national
 security cases, the judge may withhold information from the
 public pertaining to charges against individuals, verdicts, and
 sentencing. Sanctions may be imposed if such information is
 made public. Provisional tribunals are constitutionally
 prohibited.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the-sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are provided
 
 
 1146
 FINLAND
 for by law and respected in practice. The Security Police is
 subject by law to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided by law, respected in
 practice, and is bolstered by both an independent judiciary and
 a democratic political system. There have been no instances of
 abuse or legal decisions restricting freedom of the press. The
 press occasionally, under no compulsion from the Government,
 exercises restraint in treating issues deemed to be potentially
 harmful to the national interest. An example of such
 self-censorship in the past was the treatment of subjects in
 which the Soviet Union was involved, a practice no longer
 followed. Full academic freedom prevails.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for by
 the Constitution and freely exercised. Organizations with more
 than one-third foreign membership require government permission
 to operate in Finland. Legislation permitting non-Finnish
 citizens to associate with a group whose aim is to influence
 political issues is near passage in Parliament. Public
 demonstrations require prior permission from the police, which
 is routinely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Lutheran and Eastern
 Orthodox. Taxes are collected by the Government from members
 to support churches belonging to these religions. All other
 religious groups enjoy unrestricted freedom of worship.
 Approximately 88 percent of the population belongs to the
 Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the Nordic countries--Finland.
 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland--without passports and
 need not apply for exit visas for travel to other countries.
 No restrictions are placed on emigration or repatriation.
 Debate on the criteria used by the Finnish Government in
 deciding to grant political asylum continued in 1990 due
 largely to the significant increase in the number of asylum
 seekers, which grew from 174 in 1989 to 1,200 by September
 1990. The Government continues to maintain that it grants
 asylum in accordance with the standards of the 1951 U.N.
 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and categorically denies that
 any agreement exists with the Soviet Union regarding
 repatriation of would-be Soviet refugees. Finland has not
 turned back any bitizen of the Soviet Union or a Communist
 country who has asked for asylum, although in some incidents
 over the past few years persons who unwittingly crossed over
 into Finnish territory have been returned. Decisions on who is
 a legitimate refugee are made by the Minister of Interior.
 Finland does not grant asylum to people wishing to escape
 economic hardship. Nevertheless, persons determined not to be
 refugees will not be forced to return to their countries if
 they ask to go elsewhere and are accepted by a third country.
 In June two young Soviet citizens hijacked Soviet passenger

 planes to Finland, and both were. extradited pursuant to a 1974
 Finno-Soviet agreement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 are free to elect their
 representatives from among multiple lists of candidates,
 representing a wide spectrum of political ideologies. The
 Finnish -people freely choose by direct election a 200-member
 unicameral Parliament every 4 years. At present, there are
 eight political parties represented in Parliament, three of
 which have formed a coalition headed by a Conservative Prime
 Minister. Presidential elections are held every 6 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several organizations monitor human rights in Finland,
 including the Finnish Red Cross, the government-sponsored
 Equality Council, and the Women's Rights Union. In conjunction
 with the Swedish-language University in Turku, a Human Rights
 Institute was founded in 1985 with the stated-purpose of
 conducting human rights research, performing studies, and
 distributing information on human rights. Finland has not been
 the subject of an international investigation of alleged human
 rights violations. Finland participates actively in
 international human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Religion, Sex,
 Language, or Social Status,
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 Although fewer than 20,000 aliens live in Finland, instances of
 violence have been recorded against resident Vietnamese
 refugees in Helsinki. The Government has strongly-condemned
 these acts and has asked the police to make a more determined
 effort to apprehend the perpetrators..
 Lapps constitute less than one-tenth- of 1 percent of the
 Finnish population. They benefit from legal provisions
 protecting minority rights and customary practices. There is
 no discrimination in practice.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and
 sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers,
 mothers, widows, and retirees. In 1985 Parliament passed a
 comprehensive equal rights bill, which mandates equal treatment
 for women in the workplace. The Government's Equality
 Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations against sexual
 discrimination.
 The law provides stringent penalties for violence against
 women; it is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts.
 The first shelter for female victims of violence was opened 10
 years ago. During 1989, 1,404 adults (of whom 5 percent were
 men) and 1,084 children turned to the 12 shelters throughout
 Finland for protection. Police statistics for 1988 indicate
 that 8,320 women were assaulted by men, with 25 percent of the
 incidents occurring between spouses. Actual cases exceed those
 
 
 1148
 
 FINLA1D
 reported, as Finnish families tend not to report their own
 members to the authorities in cases of violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike--rights which are
 respected in practice in both the public and the private
 sectors. Trade unions enjoy a protected status and play an
 important role in political and economic life. Of the four
 major labor confederations in Finland, the 1-million-member
 mostly blue-collar confederation, the Central Organization of
 Finnish Trade Unions (SAK,) dominates the trade union
 movement. The three other central organizations cover
 white-collar, professional, and technical employees. The four
 confederations divide along jurisdictional rather than
 political lines. All trade unions are democratically organized
 and managed and are independent of the Government and of
 political parties. Einnish trade unions engage freely and
 actively in Nordic and international labor activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively exists in law
 and practice and is exercised extensively. There are no export
 processing zones in Finland. Finland is a highly organized
 society in which more than 80 percent of both workers and
 employers are members of trade unions and employers' collective
 bargaining associations. With few exceptions, all collective
 agreements since 1968 have been based on incomes policy
 agreements between central &mployees' and employers'
 organizations and the State. The central agreement covers the
 general level of wage and salary increases, other terms of
 employment, and a "social policy package," which provides for
 vacation, holidays, sick pay, maternity and paternity leave,
 taxes, and other benefits. Workers are effectively protected
 against antiunion discrimination, which is prohibited by law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 While the minimum age for employment in Finland is 18, there
 are some paid training/apprenticeship programs starting at age
 16. There is compulsory education legislation in Finland, and
 child labor is not a problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage in Finland although all
 employers--including nonunionized employers--are required to
 pay the minimum wages agreed to in collective bargaining
 agreements in their industrial sector. Collective bargaining
 agreements provide minimum wages of about $9 per hour, which is
 adequate to ensure a family a decent living. While the
 standard legal workweek must not exceed 40 hours in Finland,
 most collective bargaining agreements stipulate workweeks
 ranging from 36 to 38 hours.

 FINLAND
 Extensive legislation protects the worker's health and safety
 and ensures reasonable working conditions. An Act of 1988
 provides that a worker has a right to remove himself or herself
 from work presents a serious danger to life or health. This
 right continues until the employer has taken the measures
 necessary to make the situation safe. All aspects of Finnish
 labor law are effectively monitored and enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor. Compliance with labor legislation is
 effected through the Ministry of Labor and the National Board
 of Labor Protection. Regional and local supervision is
 delegated to 11 labor protection districts, each employing
 several inspectors.
