 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a longstanding democratic republic with an active multiparty system.
 Constitutional power is shared between the popularly elected President and the 225-
 member Parliament. President Chandrika Kumaratunga leads the People's Alliance
 (PA), a coalition of parties, which holds a single seat majority in Parliament. Both
 the Parliament and the President were elected in generally free and fair elections
 in 1994. The Government respects constitutional provisions for an independent judi-
 ciy in practice.
 The conflict between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
 (LT rE), an insurgent organization fighting for a separate state for the country's
 Tamil minority, continued beyond its 12th year. The Government initiated peace
 discussions with the LTIE and reached a cessation of hostilities with the rebels on
 January 3, the first since 1990. The cessation of hostilities broke down in April
 when the LTTE attacked government security forces. By the end of the year, govern-
 ment military offensives on the Jaffna peninsula had succeeded in capturing the un-
 official rebel capital of Jaffna City, although at the expense of tens of thousands of
 displaced persons.
 The Government controls all security forces. The 50,000-member police force is re-
 sponsible for internal security in most areas of the country, and the 80,000 member
 army conducts the war against the LTTE insurgents. The Home Guards, a para-
 military force drawn from local communities, provides security for Muslim and Sin-
 halese communities in or near the war zone. At mid-year, it was expanded from
 1,000 to 5,000 members in response to the resumption of the war. The Government
 also equips various Tamil militias opposed to the LiTE. During the cessation of hos-
 tilities, the security forces committed very few human rights abuses. However, with
 the resumption of hostilities in April the number of abuses committed by members
 of the security forces increased. The Government moved quickly to correct the worst
 relapses.
 The economy is based on the export of tea, textiles, and rubber. Despite a costly
 social welfare system and a large fiscal deficit, the economy grew by 5.6 percent in
 1994, due in part to continued economic reform the continued privatization of gov-
 ernment corporations, and increased foreign trade.
 During the first 4 months of the year, the Government maintained the improve-
 ments it had achieved in human rights practices in 1994. However, with the r-3-
 sumption of hostilities with the LTIE in April-initiated by unilateral and
 unprovoked attacks by the LTTE on government military installations-members of
 the security forces committed some human        rights abuses. These included
 extrajudicial killings of Tamils and 34 confirmed cases of disappearance. Little
 progress was made in several longstanding cases of extrajudicial killing and dis-
 appearance. Torture remained a serious problem, although the frequency of such
 abuses appeared to decline by year's end. Prison conditions remained poor. There
 was an increase in detentions and short-term mass arrests. While the Government
 used excessive force on occasion in its fight against the LTTE, LTIE forces used
 excessive force routinely. The Government censored all domestic news reports relat-
 ing to military or police matters from September to December. Discrimination and
 violence against women and child prostitution continued to be problems.
 Nonetheless, in positive developments, the Government took important steps to
 stem the abuses. In August 18 security force personnel were arrested for the
 extrajudicial killing of 21 Tamils in Colombo. Disappearances and extrajudicial
 killings subsequently ceased. The Government acted decisively to forestall ethic ri-
 oting in the wake of LTTE terrorist attacks. Emergency Regulation (ER) provisions
 governing the behavior of the security forces were strengthened and broadly applied;
 there were no attempts, as in the past, to use the ER provisions to cover up security
 force misdeeds. In general, arrests and detentions took place in accordance with the
 ER. Government security forces took measures to limit civilian casualties during the
 military offensives against the LTTE in Jaffna. The Government also provided relief
 
 
 1353
 to those displaced by the conflict even though most were still under the control of
 the LTIE. Three regional commissions established to investigate disappearances
 continued their investigations, and the legal mandate of the Human Rights Task
 Force (HRTF) to monitor arrests and detentions was extended. The Government's
 promulgation of the "workers' charter" provided a basis for legislation to strengthen
 worker rights.
 The LTrE regularly committed extrajudicial killings (including civilian massacres
 and assassinations) and was also responsible for disappearances, arbitrary arrests,
 detentions, and torture. For the first time, LTTE members used rape as a weapon
 of terror. Controlling large sections of the north and east of the country through au-
 thoritarian military rule, the LTrE denied the people under its authority the right
 to change their government, routinely violated their civil liberties, and severely dis-
 criminated against ethnic and religious minorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the months following the April
 collapse of the cease-fire, 21 corpses, all believed to be young Tamil males, were
 found floating in lakes in the vicinity of Colombo. The victims had been starved and
 tortured. In most cases mutilation and decomposition made identification impos-
 sible. On August 17, police Special Task Force (STF) officers, one army captain and
 seven civilians were arrested and charged with the murders, which police said were
 committed at the STF headquarters in residential Colombo. Further security force
 suspects were being questioned, and investigations were continuing at year's end.
 Police (mostly STF officers) and army personnel committed at least 17
 extrajudicial killings in Eastern Province after April. In some cases these murders
 were reprisals against civilians for LTrE attacks in which members of the security
 forces were killed or injured. Several occurred during cordon and search operations
 by the STF. In many cases, the security forces claimed that the victims were mem-
 bers of the LTTE. However, human rights monitors determined that these victims
 were civilians. In most cases, the perpetrators of these killings had not been ar-
 rested by the Government at year's end. There were also a number of suspicious
 deaths, mostly involving detainees acting as informants for security forces who died
 during operational missions against the LTTE.
 However, extrajudicial killings ceased following the arrests of members of the se-
 curity forces in August. In aldition, the security forces generally exercised much
 greater restraint than they had following a similar renewal of conflict with the
 in 1990.
 Although the ER remained in force in areas of the north and east directly affected
 by the insurgency and in Colombo, there was no evidence that the Government was
 using them, as in previous years, to conceal extrajudicial killings or disappearances.
 The Government amended the ER in September to require the armed forces to in-
 form the nearest police station when it becomes necessary to detain a person for
 more than 24 hours, thereby bringing the ER into line with civil law. (Previously,
 under the ER a person could legally be held without notice being given for 7 days.)
 Security force personnel can be fined or jailed for failure to comply with the ER.
 None were known to have been punished during the year.
 At least 25 people were killed precedin the  arliamentary elections in August
 1994. The violence was apparently causedy individuals and did not appear to be
 an organized attempt by political parties to intimidate voters. The Government pros-
 ecuted alleged perpetrators. At year's end, a Deputy Minister in the Government
 was being tried for murder in connection with one such death.
 There were no developments in the October 1994 suicide bombing that killed the
 United National Party's presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake, and 58 other
 people, although it is credibly believed to be the work of the LTTE.
 The PA Government came 'o power in 1994 promising to bring to justice the per-
 petrators of extrajudicial killing from previous years. In 1994 it began prosecutions
 of suspects in several extrajudicial killings and brought charges against members
 of the security forces and its own political supprters. However, there were no devel-
 opments in the government investigations into the mass graves at Sooriyakanda,
 which contain an estimated 300 bodies, or the grave at Ankumbura, which is
 thought to contain the bodies of 36 people killed by' the police in 1989. In addition,
 the trial of 21 soldiers, accused of massacring 35 Tlamil civilians in 1992 in the vil-
 lage of Mailanthani in Batticaloa district, was put off until 1996. Nor were there
 any developments in the case of four police officers indicted in 1994 for the 1990
 murders of 12 civilians in Wavulkelle. Sinc October 1994, the case has been post-
 poned several times.
 
 
 1354
 The LITE continued to commit extrajudicial killings. In May, in conjunction with
 a declared "Black Week," 42 Sinhalese civilians were murdered by the LTTE in
 Kallarawa, an eastern fishing village. In July an undetermined number of inform-
 ants. were killed; they were blamed for a major battlefield defeat at Weli Oya. In
 addition, a  prominent anti-LTrE     Buddhist monk    was   assassinated  near
 Polonnaruwa. In October over 120 Sinhalese civilians were massacred by LTTE
 forces in an attempt to inflame communal violence. Many of the victims were
 hacked to death with swords and axes. A number of women were raped. In the same
 month an unsuccessful assassination attempt against a prominent anti-LTIE leader
 in Colombo left four persons dead. A number of local political opponents of the
 LTIE were assassinated in the east, including the deputy mayor of Battialoa, who
 was assassinated on October 27. During the year, 29 suspected government spies
 were also known to have been summarily executed. LTrE suicide bombing attacks
 in November in Columbo killed 16 persons and wounded 60. In the past, the LTITE
 has killed university professors, members of nonviolent Tamil opposition parties,
 and human rights monitors.
 During the year, it was revealed that the poet and women's rights advocate
 Thiagaraiah Selvanithy, who was detained by the LITE in Jaffna in 1991, had been
 killed by the LTTE a few months after her arrest. LATE Supreme Leader Velupillai
 Prabhakaran confirmed this in interviews with international correspondents.
 Human rights monitors also report that the LTTE notified Ms. Selvanithy's family
 of her death.
 b. Disappearance.-Prior to May, no disappearances occurred. However, 34 cases
 of disappearance of Tamils were subsequently confirmed by human rights monitors.
 These were about equally divided between Colombo and Eastern Province. The dis-
 appearances may have included some of the 21 unidentified Tamils allegedly killed
 by the security forces (see Section l.a.). Following the arrest of security force offi-
 cials in August no new disappearances were reported.
 There were 10 confirmed disappearanes in 1994, 98 in 1993, 210 in 1992, and
 an average 15 a day in 1990. Those who disappeared in 1995 and in previous years
 are presumed dead. The disappearances involved persons last seen in police custody.
 The Commander of the Army and the Inspector General of Police bth issued direc-
 tives condemning disappearances and stating that perpetrators would be called to
 account. However at year's end, the Government had not identified or charged those
 responsible for the disappearances other than those arrested in connection with the
 21 bodies discovered in the lakes (see Section L.a).
 The Government continued investigations into past disappearances. The three re-
 gional commissions set up in November 1994 to inquire into disappearances occur-
 ring after January 1, 1988, worked throughout the year. Through August the com-
 missions received 61,300 complaints. Of these they were able to review 7,600 indi-
 vidual cases. The commissions were initially charged with producing final reports
 for the President by March, including recommendations for legal action. However,
 the mandates of the commissions were extended into 1996.
 The term of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the involuntary removal
 of persons occurring after January 1991 expired. Its work was superseded by the
 three regional disappearance commissions appointed in 1994, and its term was not
 extended.
 There was no progress in the Embilipitiya incident in which 11 suspects, includ-
 ing an army brigadier general, were indicted for conspiracy and abduction with in-
 tent to commit murder in the disappearance of 32 boys from the southern town of
 Embilipitiya in 1989 and 1990. The case was brought to court in September but ad-
 journed until January 1996 because one of the accused, a soldier, was fighting the
 LATE and could not be released.
 There were also no developments in the Vantharamulle case, in which army
 troops reportedly abducted 158 persons from a refugee camp in Batticaloa District
 in 1990. Observers maintain that there is credible evidence identifying the alleged
 perpetrators.
 The Government continued to give the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) unhindered access to detention centers, police stations, and army camps.
 This played a role in reducing disappearances attributable to the security forces, as
 did the work of the Human Rights Task Force (HRTF), a quasi-independent govern-
 ment body set up to register detainees held under the ER and the Prevention of Ter-
 rorism Act (PTA) and monitor their welfare.
 The LTTE was responsible for an undetermined number of civilian disappear-
 ances in the northeastern part of the island. In November LTTE members kidnaped
 the vicechancellor of Eastern University, allegedly for not cooperating with them.
 Most of the 400 to 600 police officers captured by the LTIE in 1990 are believed
 
 
 1355
 to be dead, as are over 200 security force personnel captured at a battle in Pooneryn
 in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 1egrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1994 the Government acceded to the U.N, Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. -Parliament also enacted
 legislation making torture a punishable offense. However, the Government has not
 yet developed effective regulations under the new legislation to prosecute and pun-
 ish military and police personnel responsible for torture, though it has ceased pay-
 ingines incurred by security force personnel guilty of the offense.
 Members of the security forces continued to torture and mistreat detainees and
 other prisoners, both male and female, particularly during interrogation. Although
 the number of torture reports was somewhat lower than in previous years in the
 Colombo area, the situation in Eastern Province did not improve. Most victims were
 Tamils suspected of being LTTE insurgents or supporters. With the legalization of
 the Sinhalese Janatha Vimukhti Peramuna (JVP), a party which led an insurgency
 in the south suppressed by the Government in 1988-89, JVP members were no
 longer subject to arrest and torture as in the past.
 Methods of torture included electric shock, beatings (especially on the soles of the
 feet), suspension by the wrists or feet in contorted positions, burning, near
 drownings, placing of insecticide, chili powder, or gasoline-soaked bags over the
 head, and forced positions. Detainees have reported broken bones and other serious
 inju-ies as a result of their mistreatment. There were no reports of rape in deten-
 tion.
 Under the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution, torture victims may
 ile a suit for compensation in the Supreme Court. The Court granted awards rang-
 ing from $200 to $2,000. Most cases, however, take a year or more to move through
 the courts. Moreover, with the new legislation that imposed a minimum punishment
 of 7 years' imprisonment for those found guilty of torture, the number of convictions
 of security force personnel for torture in fundamental human rights cases dramati-
 cally fell.
 The LME reportedly uses torture on a routine basis. However, because of the se-
 cretive nature of the LTTE, no first-hand information is available.
 Prison conditions are generally poor and do not meet minimum international
 standards because of overcrowding and lack of sanitary facilities. An increase in the
 number of detentions associated with the resumption of the war with the LTIE has
 caused a significant deterioration in already poor standards in short-term detention
 centers. However, the Government permitted ICRC representatives to visit more
 than 400 places of detention.
 Conditions are also believed to be poor inprisons operated by the LTTE.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under ordinary law, authorities must in-
 form an arrested person of the reason for arrest and bring that person before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours. In practice, persons detained under ordinary law generally
 appear before a magistrate within a few days of arrest. The magistrate may author-
 ize bail or order continued pretrial detention for up to 3 months or longer. Except
 in limited areas of the northeast and in Colombo, security forces may no longer use
 the ER to detain suspects for prolonged periods of time without court approval.
 In spite of government announcements that it would close all secret detention cen-
 ters, the victims of extrajudicial killing by the security forces (see Section L.a.) were
 held incommunicado at secret locations prior to their murders. There were also con-
 tinued reports that security forces held a small number of other people in such a
 manner. However, human rights monitors believe that most such detentions oc-
 curred infrequently and for periods of only a few days before the detainees were put
 into the normal detention system.
 Detention of Tamils rose sharply following the resumption of hostilities in April,
 although arrests and detentions generally took place in accordance with the ER. At
 year's end the Government held as many as 940 detainees, up from 380 at the end
 of 1994. Many of these detainees were arrested during military operations against
 the LTTE and were held in facilities operated by the army. The Government contin-
 ued to detain some individuals under the PTA, which permits detention without
 charge for up to 18 months.
 The ER, which remained in force in the northeastern part of the island and in
 Colombo, allows pretrial detention for a maximum of four consecutive 3-month peri-
 ods. A magistrate must order further detention. Detainees may challenge their de-
 tention and sue the Government for violating their civil rights in the Supreme
 Court.
 Security forces continued to conduct mass arrests of young Tamils, both male and
 female, especially following the resumption of hostilities with the LTTE in April.
 There were also major sweeps subsequent to an LTTE bomb blast in Colombo in
 
 
 1356
 August, which killed 22 people, and an attack on Colombo oil storage facilities in
 October. Although exact numbers of detainees were impossible to determine, they
 certainly numbered in the thousands. Upwards of 1,000 Tamils at a time were
 picked up in actions by the police. Most were released after identity checks lasting
 several hours to several days. The Government justified the arrests on security
 grounds, but many Tamils claimed that the arrests were a form of harassment. In
 addition, those arrested, most of whom were innocent of any wrongdoing, are de-
 tained in prisons together with hardened criminals.
 The HRTF continued to investigate the legality of detention in cases referred to
 it by the Supreme Court and private citizens. In July President Kumaratunga is-
 sued an ER reconstituting the HRTF, which had lost its legal status with the lapse
 of the ER in September 1994. The HRTF thereby regained its powers to exercise
 oversight over arrests and detentions by the security forces and to undertake visits
 to prisons. Included in the ER were directives to the heads of the armed forces and
 the police to assist the HRTF in carrying out its duties. Nonetheless, members of
 the security forces occasionally breached the regulations and failed to cooperate with
 the HRTF.
 There were unconfirmed reports that the LTTE was detaining more than 2,000
 civilians in the northern part of the island. The LTITE did not permit the ICRC or
 any other humanitarian organization to visit its detainees-aside from 22 security
 force personnel and 21 fishermen incarcerated in Jaffna. During the cessation of
 hostilities early in the year, the LTTE released the few remaining police officers in
 their custody. However, in August LTTE insurgents hijacked a civilian ferry, and
 continued to detain two passengers and the Sinhalese crew of eight at the end of
 the year.
 The Government does not practice exile. There are no legal provisions allowing
 or prohibiting its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects these provisions in practice.
 The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, and
 the high courts. A Judicial Service Commission, comprised of the Chief Justice and
 two Supreme Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.
 Judges serve until mandatory retirement age, which is 65 for the Supreme Court
 and 62 for other judges.
 In criminal cases, defendants are tried in public by juries. They are informed of
 the charges and evidence against them, may be represented by the counsel of their
 choice, and have the right to appeal. The Government provides counsel for indigent
 persons tried on criminal charges in the high courts and the Court of Appeal, but
 not in other cases; private legal aid organizations assist some defendants.
 There are no jury trials in cases brought under the seldom-invoked PTA. Confes-
 sions, which are otherwise inadmissible, are allowed in PTA cases. Most convictions
 under the PTA rely heavily on them. In such cases, defendants bear the burden of
 proof to demonstrate that their confessions were obtained by coercion. Nevertheless,
 defendants in PTA cases have the right to appeal.
 The Government claims that all persons held under the ER and the PTA are sus-
 pected members of the LTTE and therefore legitimate security threats. There is in-
 sufficient information to determine whether these detainees, or members of the JVP
 similarly detained in past years, were political prisoners. Between 200 and 300 of
 those previously detained-mostly JVP members-have been convicted under crimi-
 nal law and remain incarcerated. In many cases, human rights monitors question
 the legitimacy of the criminal charges brought against these people.
 The LTrE has its own court system, composed of young judges with little or no
 legal training. The courts reportedly impOse severe punishments. However, the
 courts have no basis in law and essentially operate as extrajudicial agents of the
 LTTE, rather than as an independent judiciary.
 The LTTE also holds a number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual privacy
 and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain proper warrants for ar-
 rests and searches conducted under ordinary law. However, the security forces are
 not required to obtain warrants for searches conducted under the PTA (see Section
 i.e.). The Secretary of Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such
 searches. There is no judicial review or other means of redress for alleged illegal
 searches under the PT
 The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspond-
 ence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the
 LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband.
 
 
 1357
 The LTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. It maintains an effective net-
 work of informants. In 1990 the LTTE evicted thousands of Muslim residents from
 their homes in the north. They currently live in refugee camps.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE resumed violently in
 April, following the collapse of a 3-month cease-fire.
 There were no reports of army massacres of Tamil civilians, such as the ones at
 Kokkadichcholai in 1991 and Mailanthani in 1992, although there were some
 extrajudicial killings (see Section l.a.). Early in the renewed conflict, there were iso-
 lated incidents in which security force personnel used civilians, some of whom suf-
 fered injury, as human shields to clear mine fields and to protect the perimeters
 of security force camps. The Government quickly put an end to these practices.
 However, in an incident in December, members of the STF in the east com-
 mandeered a civilian bus to move quickly to an STF camp at Pudukudlirippu in
 Batticaloa district which was under attackbythe LTTE. They forced the civilians
 to remain on board, resulting in several civilian deaths when the bus came under
 LLTE fire.
 During a military offensive in Jaffna in July, between 250 and 300 civilians were
 killed, 125 in a single incident in which bombs were dropped adjacent to a crowded
 church compound at Navali. Periodic shelling and bombing of the LiTE-controlled
 Jaffna Peninsula caused additional civilian casualties.
 In October the Government opened a second coordinated military attack on LTTE-
 held territory in the Jaffna Peninsula, resulting in the capture of Jaffna City in De-
 cember. Fierce fighting resulted in high casualties on both sides and upwards of
 400,000 displaced persons. The Government, however, took measures to limit the
 number of civilian casualties in the war. During the July offensive, notices were
 dropped warning civilians to congregate in schools, churches, and temples to mini-
 mize risk. In addition, shelling in advance of troops attacking through populated
 areas was kept to a minimum in order to spare civilians. Civilian casualties were
 also reduced due to the relatively slow and methodical manner in which government
 security forces pushed forward, which enabled civilians to flee well in advance of
 troop movements. In the second phase of the Jaffna offensive during October to De-
 cember, during which Jaffna City was taken, about 100 civilians were killed. The
 Government averted a major humanitarian crisis by allowing relief organizations to
 channel emergency food and medical supplies to the civilians displaced in the Jaffna
 fighting. The security forces also continued to carry out human rights instruction
 as part of their training courses.
 The Government detains very few captured LTTE prisoners since many of them
 kill themselves with cyanide before capture. The LTTE claims that it kills security
 force personnel rather than take them prisoner. It admits to holding only 21 secu-
 rity force prisoners. The LTTE is believed to have killed many of the 600 to 800
 police officers and security force personnel it captured in recent years.
 The LTTE used excessive force in the renewed conflict, killing an undetermined
 number of civilians. It was accused of using church and temple compounds (where
 civilians are instructed to congregate in the event of hostilities) as shields for the
 storage of munitions. In July the LTTE forced civilians to return to places aban-
 doned by government troops before the areas were adequately secured and cleared
 of land mines. In August it seized a civilian ferry carrying over 140 passengers, in-
 cluding children and pregnant women, using it as a decoy to lure navy patrol boats,
 two of which it subsequently sank. During the October to December government of-
 fensive on the Jaffna peninsula, LTTE cadre forced some civilians to abandon their
 homes and retreat with them, allegedly as human sheilds, in the face of advancing
 government troops. The LTTE was also reported to be recruiting children into its
 military forces. Dead LTTE insurgents recovered by the Government following a
 major battle at Weli Oya in July were found to be as young as 14. Reports that the
 LTE was conscripting children were impossible to verify.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and expression, restrictions are permitted on national security grounds.
 The Government controls the country's larest newspaper chain, a major tele-
 vision station, and the Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation. However, there are
 also a variety of independent newspapers, journals, and radio and television sta-
 tions.
 Independent journalists reported that from the death of UNP President
 Premadasa in 1993 until September their freedom to report openly and critically
 about the Government had improved markedly. They had been able to provide an
 unimpeded range of views and openly criticize the Government and political parties.
 
 
 1358
 However, in September the Government abridged press freedom. It issued an ER
 subjecting news relating to the armed forces and the police to government censor-
 ship. The Government stated that censorship of military news was necessary be-
 cause certain sections of the media had been reporting in an irresponsible manner,
 jeopardizing the war effort and inciting communal violence. After government secu-
 rity forces captured Jaffna City in December, the Government stopped censoring the
 news.
 A number of other government actions during the year were also of concern to
 the media. The Government failed to reform the press law and privatize govern-
 ment-owned media as promised during the election campaign. The President filed
 a defamation of character suit against a leading editor which journalists claimed
 was frivolous and intended only to harass and intimidate the media. In August and
 September, upon receiving complaints from cabinet ministers, the police Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) raided the offices of several leading editors, ques-
 tioning them about the accuracy of their stories and attempting to coerce journalists
 int revealing their sources. In another incident in February, a leading editor, noted
 for holding antigovernment views, and his wife were assaulted by unknown persons.
 Journalists and civil libertarians also complain that the Parliamentary Powers
 and Privileges Act stipulates an unlimited fine or up to 2 years' imprisonment for
 anyone who criticizes a Member of Parliament (M.P.). Although the Government has
 not invoked the law since 1992, journalists and civil libertarans complain that the
 act is an unjustified infringement on freedom of the press.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom. Legal restrictions on cam-
 pus political activity were removed in most parts of the country in 1994 with the
 lifting of the ER. During 1995 the ER were not used to control students.
 The LTTE does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly restricts the print
 and broadcast media in areas under its control and has often killed those who op-
 ose it. The LTTE also does not respect academic freedom and has repressed and
 killed intellectuals who criticize it, such as Thiagarajah Selvanithy (see Section
 L.a.). In November it kidnaped a university vicechancellor (see Section 1.b.) It has
 severely repressed the University Teachers for Human Rights, which was formerly
 based on the Jaffna Peninsula.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Although the PTA may re-
 strict such freedoms, the Government did not use the act for that purpose in 1995.
 The Government routinely granted permits for demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official na-
 tional religion, but also provides for the right of members of other faiths to practice
 their religions freely. The Government respects this right in practice. Foreign clergy
 may work in Sri Lanka, but for more than 30 years the Government has prohibited
 the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy. It permits those already in the country to
 remain.
 Evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the population, have
 expressed concern that their efforts at proselytization are often met with hostility
 and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work (see
 Section 5). They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such
 harassment. However, there is no evidence to support this.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen 'freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka." The Government gen-
 erally respects the right to domestic and foreign travel. However, the resumption
 of the war with the LTTE prompted the Government to impose more stringent
 checks on travelers from the north and the east, and on those moving in Colombo,
 particularly after dark. These security measures had the effect of restricting the
 movement of Tamils, especially young males.
 The LTTE restricts the movement of Tamils in areas under its control. It levies
 a large "exit tax" on persons wishing to travel to areas under government control,
 requiring the travelers to leave all their property in escrow. In order to ensure that
 the travelers return, the LTTE often grants permission to only one family member
 to travel at a time. The LTrE does not allow displaced persons living in areas under
 its control to return to their homes in government-controlled areas.
 Prior to the October to December government offensive on the Jaffna peninsula,
 an estimated 600,000 citizens had been displaced by the insurgency. Most live in
 camps financed by the Government and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 The offensive displaced an additional 300,000 to 400,000 people on the peninsula,
 who live with friends or relatives, or in makeshift "welfare centers" in schools, reli-
 gious institutions, and other public buildings. These people remained under the con-
 trol of the LTTE insurgents who forbade them to leave LTrE-controlled territory.

 Nonetheless, the Government continued to supply them with food, medicine, and
 other essential supplies. An estimated 69,000 Tamil refugees live in camps in south-
 ern India. Another 100,000 refugees are believed to have been integrated into the
 Tamil society of southern India. The Government allows the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to operate freely. Prior to the resumption of hos-
 tilities, the UNHCR assisted in the repatriation of over 10,000 refugees from India
 during the year.
 The Government does not permit the entry of refugees into the country, nor does
 it aid those who manage to enter to seek permanent residence elsewhere. There
 were no instances of forcible repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. This right was last exer-
 cised dun parliamentary elections in Augast 1994, when the People's Alliance
 Party ended the 17-year rule of the UnitedNational Party (UNP), and during the
 p residential election in November 1994, when PA presidential candidate Chandrika
 Kuratunga won 62 percnt of the vote. International election monitors judged the
 elections to be free and fair. No elections were scheduled in 1995.
 During the parliamentary election in August 1994, 9 of the 10 Jaffna seats were
 won by candidates from a Tamil grup which supported the then ruling UNhP. The
 group's armed militias intimidated vote. though the overall election was marred
 by 25 murders, the harassment of voters appeared equally divided among the par-
 ties and did not appear to be an official government or party 
 The Commissioner of Elections recognizes 26 parties; 9 old seats in the 225-
 member Parliament. The two most influential parties, the PA and the UYNP, gen-
 erally draw their support from the majority Sinhalese community. Historically,
 these two parties have alternated in power. There are 27 Tamil and 21 Muslim
 M.P.'s.
 Although there are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics
 or government, the social mores in some communties limit women's activities out-
 side the home. In August 1994, voters elected a female prime minister for the sec-
 ond time in Sri Lanka's history. In November for the first time, a woman was elect-
 ed president. Eleven women hold seats in the Parliament. In addition to the Prime
 Minister and the Minister of Transport, Environment, and Women's Affairs, four
 deputy ministers are women.
 The LTTE refuses to allow elections in areas under its control.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several local human  ghts goupsn including the Movement for Inter-
 racial Justice and Equality (MI ,  ate  University Teachers for Human Rights,
 the Civil Rights Movement (CRM). and the Law and Society Trust (Tm), which
 monitor civil and political liberties. There are no adverse government regulations
 governing the activities of local and foreign NGOs. However, following the resump-
 tion of hostilities in April, death threats were received by a few human rights mon-
 itors.
 The Government continued to allow the ICRC unrestricted access to detention fa-
 cilities. At the Government's request, the ICRC supervised the delivery of food and
 medical supplies in the northern war zone and provided human rights training ma-
 terialJsto the security forces.
 Several international groups, including the ICRC, provided humanitarian relief to
 those affected by the conflict in the north and east. At the Government's request,
 the ICRC protected convoys of mainly governmental food and medical supplies from
 Colombo into the northern war zone and provided human rights training material
 for the security forces. In the first half of the year, the Government did not hinder
 their activities. However, following the resumption of the war with the LTE in
 April, the Government seriously restricted the movement of supplies of these NGO's
 and international organizations to LTTE-controlled areas. In addition, both the Gov-
 ernment and the press were publicly critical of the operations of these groups in the
 north, calling into question their loyalty to the State. However, in December NGO-
 Government relations improved.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based n Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution guarantees equal rights under the law for all people in Sri
 Lanka. The Government generally respects these rights.
 
 
 1360
 
 Women.-Sexual assault, rape, and spousal abuse (often associated with alcohol)
 represent serious and pervasive forms of societal violence against women. However,
 new amendments to the Penal Code were introduced which specifically address sex-
 ual abuse and exploitation. Rape laws were modified to create a more equitable bur-
 den of proof and to make punishments more stringent. Marital rape is now consid-
 ered an offense in cases of spouses living under judicial separation, and new laws
 govern sexual harassment in the workplace and sexual molestation. While the new
 Penal Code may ease some of the problems faced by victims of sexual assault, many
 women's organizations believe that greater sensitization of police and judicial offi-
 cials will also be required. Laws against procuring and trafficking were strength-
 ened, facilitating the prosecution of brothel owners.
 The Constitution provides for equal employment opportunities in public sector,
 but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector,
 where they are sometimes paid less than men for equal work and often face dif-
 ficulty in rising to supervisory positions. Women constitute approximately one-half
 of the formal work force.
 Women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. However, issues
 related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and inheritance, are adju-
 dicated by the customaiy law of each ethnic or religious group. In 1995 the Govern-
 ment raised the minimum age of marriage for women from 12 to 18, except in the
 case of Muslims, who continue to follow their customary marriage practices. The ap-
 plication of different legal practices based on membership in a religious or ethnic
 group often results in discrimination against women.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs coordinates government efforts to address wom-
 en's issues. Several NGO's are also actively involved in promoting women's rights.
 During the massacres of civilians in the east in October (see Section 1.a.), the
 LTTE raped a number of the victims. This marked the first time in the ethnic con-
 flict that the LTTE deliberately used rape as a weapon of terror.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and rights of
 children, but is constrained by lack of resources.
 The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's rights and wel-
 fare through its widespread systems of public education and medical care. Education
 is compulsory to the age of 12 and free through university. Health care, including
 immunization pro   m   is also free.
 There is a si   cant problem of child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas.
 The Government estimates that there are 2,000 active child prostitutes in the coun-
 try, but private groups claim the number is much higher. Many of these prostitutes
 are boys who sell themselves to foreign tourists. The Penal Code was amended to
 strengthen punishments for trafficking of persons. In 1995 the Ministry of Media,
 Tourism, and Aviation created a task force specifically to study the problem of sex
 tourism and related offenses, but no new legislation resulted.
 In the first quarter of 1995, the Government reported that 1,576 cases of crimes
 against children had been recorded, an increase from previous years. NGO's at-
 tribute the problem of exploitation of children to the lack of law enforcement rather
 than inadequate legislation.
 There have been reports that rural children working as domestic servants in
 urban households have been abused by their employers. Some of these children have
 reportedly been starved, beaten, sexually abused, and forced into prostitution. The
 Government does not have sufficient resources to protect these children from such
 exploitation (see Section 6.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for people with disabilities. The World Health Organization es-
 timates that 7 percent of the population is disabled. Most disabled people who are
 unable to work are cared for by their families. The Department of Social Services
 runs eight vocational training schools for the physically and mentally disabled and
 sponsors a program of job training and job placement for graduates. The Govern-
 ment provides some financial support to NGO's assisting the disabled, subsidizes
 prosthetic devices and other medical aids for the disabled, makes some purchases
 from disabled suppliers, and has registered 74 schools and training institutions for
 the disabled run by NGO's.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, num-
 ber less than a thousand. They prefer to maintain their isolated traditional way of
 life, but are protected by the Constitution. There are no legal restrictions on their
 participation in the political or economic life of the nation.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religious differences is much less
 common than discrimination based on ethnic group or caste. In general, the mem-
 bers of the various faiths tend to be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. How-
 
 
 1361
 ever, evangelical Christians have, on occasion, been harassed by Buddhist monks for
 their attempts to convert Buddhists to Christianity (see Section 2.c.).
 In the northern part of the island, LTTE insurgents expelled some 46,000 Muslim
 inhabitants from their homes in 1990-virtually the entire Muslim population. The
 LTIE has expropriated Muslim homes, lands, and businesses and threatened Mus-
 lim families with death if they attempt to return.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-There are approximately 1 million Tamils of
 comparatively recent Indian origin living in Sri Lanka. About 85,000 of these people
 do not qualify for either Indian or Sri Lankan citizenship and face discrimination,
 especially in the allocation of government funds for education. However, the Govern-
 ment has stated that none oft e  eople will be forced to depart the country.
 Tamils maintain that they have long been the victims of systematic discrimina-
 tion in university education, government employment, and in other matters con-
 trolled by the Government. However, in recent years there has been little evidence
 of overt discrimination in university enrollment or government employment.
 In August the Government released a "devolution" package designed to devolve
 wide-ranging powers to local governments, thereby providing ethnic minorities
 greater autonomy in governing their local affairs. The proposal-was still being de-
 bated at years end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government respects the constitutional right of
 workers to establish labor unions. Any seven workers may form a union, adopt a
 charter, elect leaders, and publicize their views. About 75 percent of the plantation
 workforce is unionized. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the nonagricultural work
 force, which is about 25 to 30 percent of the total work force, is also unionized. Most
 workers in large private firms are represented by unions, but those in small-scale
 agriculture and small businesses usually do not belong to unions.
 Most large unions are affilisted with political parties and together play a promi-
 nent role in the political process. More then 30 labor unions have political affili-
 ations, but there are also a small number of unaffiliated unions.
 The Department of Labor registered 233 new unions and cancelled the registra-
 tion of 93 others. The Department of Labor is authorized by law to cancel the reg-
 istration of any union that does not submit an annual report. That requirement is
 the only legal grounds for cancellation of registration.
 All workers, other than civil servants and workers in "essential" services, have
 the right to strike. By law, workers may also lodge complaints with the Commis-
 sioner of Labor, a labor tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect their rights. Be-
 fore September 1994, the Government controlled strikes by declaring some indus-
 tries to be "essential" under the ER. This practice ceased when the Government ter-
 minated the ER. However, the President retains the power to designate any indus-
 try as an essential service. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has pointed
 out to the Government that essential services should be limited to services where
 an inierruption would endanger the life, personal safety, or health of the population.
 Civil servants may collectively submit labor grievances to the Public Service Com-
 mission but have no legal grounds to strike. Nonetheless, government workers in
 the transportation, telecommunication and ports sectors have staged brief strikes
 and other work actions. There were 183 strikes in 1995, 94 in the agricultural sector
 and 89 in the industrial and other sectors.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers in nonessential sectors. Employers
 may dismiss workers only for indiscipline. Incompetence or low productivity are not
 grounds for dismissal. Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies, and
 many of them have done so.
 In September the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training released a "workers'
 charter designed to provide a basis for legislation to strengthen worker rights. The
 proposed charter consolidates existing labor legislation and reaffirms the rights of
 workers to organize and bargain collectively. It also proposes new amendments to
 the Labor Law which would guarantee the right of workers to join unions, ensure
 that employers recognize and bargain with unions, establish a National Wages Com-
 mission to review minimum wages in all industries, ensure that all workers are cov-
 ered under relevant labor laws, and establish a social security scheme. It is opposed
 by business leaders largely because of the provisions that compel management to
 recognize all unions, collect union dues, and pay above-market wages. The charter
 had not yet become law by year's end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to collective bargaiinmg, and it is widely practiced. Large firms may have employees
 in as many as 60 different unions. In enterprises that do not have unions, work
 councils--compo-sed of employees, employers, and often a public sector representa-
 
 
 1362
 
 tive-are often the forums for collective bargaining, although the councils are not
 mandatory outside the export processing zones (EFZ's) and do not have the power
 to negotiate binding contracts.
 The law currently does not require management to recognize or bargain with
 unions, and in some cases employers have declined to recognize the unions in their
 f actores. However, the law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Employers found
 guilty of such discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties but have the right to transfer them to different locations.
 Workers in the EPZ's have the same rights to join unions as other workers. How-
 ever, employers in the EPZ's offer higher wages and better working conditions, thus
 discouraging union activity. In the place of unions, workers in the EPZ's are rep-
 resented by organizations known as Joint Consultative Councils (JCCs), which are
 chaired by the Government's Board of Investments (BOD and consist of equal dele-
 gations fiom labor and management. The number of strikes after mid-year declined
 from the unsettled period of late 1994 and early 1995.
 In most instances, wage boards establish minimum wages and conditions of em-
 ployment, except in the EPZ's where wages and work conditions are set by the BOL
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. According to some reports, rural children are sometimes employed
 in debt bondage as domestic servants in urban households. The Government does
 not have sufficient resources to protect these children from such exploitation (see
 Section 5).
 The LTTE continues to conscript high-school age children for work as cooks, mes-
 sengers, and clerks, and in some cases, building fortifications.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 15. However, the law permits the employment of younger children by their par-
 ents or guardians in limited agricultural work. It also permits employment in any
 school or institution for training purposes.
 Persons under age 16 may not be employed in any public enterprise in which life
 or limb is endangered. Children are not employed in the EPZ's, the plantations, the
 garment industry, or any other export industry. About 85 percent of children below
 the age of 16 attend school. The law provides that the employment of such persons
 is permitted for not more than 1 hour on any day before school.
 Despite legislation, some child labor still exists. Some children work in the infor-
 mal sectors, including the manufacture of coconut fiber products, fishing, wrapping
 tobacco, street trading, domestic service, and farming. Government inspections have
 been unable to eliminate these forms of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Department of Labor effectively enforces
 the minimum wage law. While there is no universal national minimum wage, some
 38 wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions by sector and industry.
 According to the Statistics Department of the Labor Ministry, current minimum
 wage rates average $40 (2,000 rupees) a month in industry, commerce, and the serv-
 ice sector and $1.50 (75 rupees) a day in agriculture. The minimum wage in the gar-
 ment industry is $40 (2,000 rupees) a month. These minimum wages are insufficient
 to support a worker and the standard family of 5, but the vast majority of families
 have more than one breadwinner.
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from
 working regularly more than 45 hours per week (a 52 day work week). Such work-
 ers also receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and some
 20 local holidays each year. Maternity leave is available for permanent and casual
 female workers. Employers must contribute 12 to 15 percent of a worker's wage to
 an employee's provident fund and 3 percent to an employee's trust fund. Employers
 who fail to comply may be fined.
 Several laws protect the safety and health of industrial workers. However, the De-
 partment of Labor's small staff of inspectors is inadequate to enforce compliance
 with the laws. Workers have the statutory right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions that endanger their health, but many workers are unaware of, or indifferent
 to, health risks and fear that they will lose their jobs if they remove themselves.
