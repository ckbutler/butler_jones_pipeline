 BANGLADESH
 The Bangladesh'Constitution provides for a presidential form
 of government and alunicameral Parliament of 330 members. The
 President appoints the ministers,-20 percent of whom do not
 have to be m mber's of Parliament. The Prime Minister, also
 appointed by the President, serves more as the leader of the
 majority in Parliament than as the leader of the Government.
 Until Parliament was dissolved on December 6, President H. M.
 Ershad's Jatiyo Party enjoyed nearly a two-thirds majority in
 Parliament. The parliamentary opposition (with a total of 116
 seats) was led by Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed,
 whose party held 76 seats.
 The new'Parliament, chosen in elections in May 1986, held its
 first des~ion for 61 days begInning in January 1987. Its
 proceedings were marred by opposition walkouts, by government
 tactics to bypass debate on controversial legislation, and by
 confused procedure. Dissatisfaction with the Government's
 control of Parliament was partly behind the general strike
 called by the opposition in late July. Strong-arm tactics by
 the Government and significant vote irregularities marred
 byelections held in February and June to fill vacant seats in
 Parliament. Government candidates won by wide margins. In
 the face of opposition protests, the Government exercised
 sweeping powers of arrest under the Special Powers Act of 1974
 (which allows detention without charge) to detain opposition
 leaders and student activists. The Government also invoked
 the Act to silence a few newspapers and close drama
 performances. In August the President disbanded government
 student organizations and called for an end to student politics
 in an attempt to control campus violence.
 In November the opposition took their protests to the streets
 mounting demonstrations, rallies, and marches and organizing
 general strikes that continued until the end of December. The
 Government arrested thousands of opposition activists under
 the Act on the grounds that this was necessary to maintain law
 and order. On November 27, President Ershad declared a state
 of emergency which suspended freedom of movement, assembly,
 association, speech, and profession. "Prohibitory orders" in
 force under the state of emergency included bans on
 processions, demonstrations, meetings, strikes (the latter for
 2 months) and a prohibition on criticism of any government
 decision or action. Ershad dissolved Parliament on December 6
 after the resignation of 10 members of an Islamic
 fundamentalist party, Jamaat-e-Islaami, and a vote by the
 Awami League Presidium (the Awami League was the major
 Parliamentary opposition party) to withdraw Awami League
 Members of Parliament. Under the Constitution, new
 parliamentary elections must be held within 90 days from the
 date of dissolution; these are now scheduled for March 3, 1988.
 Bangladesh's defense forces include the army, navy, and air
 force. The army has also undertaken operations in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts against tribal insurgents. Paramilitary
 forces include the Bangladesh Rifles, primarily responsible
 for border security, and the Bangladesh Ansars, a home guard
 which assists the police in maintaining law and order. A
 police force, including an armed police reserve, enforces
 domestic law by investigating crimes and making arrests.
 These paramilitary forces and the police are under the control
 of the Minister of Home Affairs.
 Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest and most densely
 populated countries. The Government's avowed priority has
 
 
 1115
 
 BANGLADESH
 been economic development; its key programs aim at increased
 crop yields, reduced population growth, decentralization of
 administration, and development of the private sector.
 Serious floods in August and September brought further
 economic hardship. Nationwide strikes organized by the
 opposition also damaged the economy. President Ershad
 assigned the military the lead role in distributing disaster
 relief supplies. Foreign diplomats in Dhaka acknowledged that
 the Government had performed well in its relief and
 rehabilitation efforts.
 The human rights situation in Bangladesh in 1987 reflected the
 increasing polarization between the Government and the
 political opposition. The security measures under the state
 of emergency, which the Government claimed was necessary to
 maintain law and order, banned political activity, imposed
 press restrictions, and led to the detention without charge of
 scores of political dissidents.
 The Government's attempts to address concerns about human
 rights abuses in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where tribal
 insurgents are fighting a guerrilla war against the
 Government, left many observers dissatisfied.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A simmering insurgent movement remained active in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts, where some 600,000 tribal people live,
 as clashes continued between government forces and small
 groups of armed tribal insurgents known as the Shanti Bahini
 (Peace Force). The insurgent movement, which began in the
 mid-1970's, reflects concern on the part of the tribal people
 that their traditional way of life and their special status in
 the hill areas were being undermined by settlers who moved
 there from the overpopulated plains.
 Insurgent attacks on Bengali settlements and military
 personnel, many of which resulted in death and the destruction
 of property, continued in 1987. Reliable statistics on the
 frequency of confrontations and the number of deaths involved
 are not available. The conflict widened in June when Indian
 Border Security Force personnel reportedly crossed the border
 into Bangladesh, killing 11 persons and injuring 10. Indian
 personnel were also accused of attacking and killing seven
 members of the Bangladesh Rifles on June 24 in Bangladeshi
 territory. The Indian Government has denied that the Border
 Security Force was involved in either case. As a result of
 clashes at the end of 1986, thousands of tribal people fled
 into India and remain in camps awaiting repatriation and
 resettlement.
 Amnesty International (AI), in a September 1986 report titled
 "Bangladesh: Unlawful Killings and Torture in the Chittagong
 Hill Tracts," and other human rights groups have provided
 accounts of violence and death in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 and accused the Government of sanctioning unlawful killings.
 The Government has denied the allegations contained in the AI
 report. The Chittagong Hill Tracts are generally off-limits
 to foreigners, and contact between tribal people and foreigners
 has not been encouraged by the Government. As a result,
 
 
 1116
 
 BANGLADESH
 independent investigation of allegations of abuse has been
 almost impossible. In 1987 the Government organized a 1-day
 visit to the Hill Tracts for chiefs of diplomatic missions and
 allowed several diplomats and journalists limited access to
 certain areas.-: The outcome of these trips was inconclusive.
 However, the Government has agreed in principle to allow AI
 representatives access to the Hill Tracts to investigate
 allegations of abuse, and AI is currently negotiating with the
 Government on a mutually acceptable date, possibly in early
 1988.
 The tribal leaders continue to demand the preservation of their
 autonomous culture and an end to ethnic Bengali settlement in
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts. No new settlers have entered the
 Hill Tracts for at least 2 years, following a government
 decision to restrict such settlement.
 During the November political unrest, at least 11 people were
 killed in clashes between police and demonstrators. The
 administration issued "shoot on sight" orders November 12 to
 law enforcement personnel to prevent looting, arson, and
 bombing, though these orders were rarely carried out.
 Violence also increased on school campuses, particularly at
 Dhaka University, where student groups affiliated with
 political parties took up arms against each other and the
 Government. Skirmishes between students and police resulted
 in injuries and sometimes death. Following the death of an
 opposition student leader in an explosion in-March, police and
 students clashed at the University. In another campus
 incident, two students and a rickshaw driver were killed in
 July in a gun battle between student groups affiliated with
 two opposition parties. The University then closed "sine
 die;" it reopened September 27 only to be closed indefinitely
 after the imposition of the state of emergency. In August, in
 an apparent move to stop the violence, President Ershad
 disbanded the Government's:student organizations, but not
 those affiliated with opposition parties, and called for an
 end to party politics on campus.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions.- Armed tribal insurgents in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts, however, have reportedly kidnaped
 persons in raids on Bengali villages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 AI, in a June 1986 report titled "Torture in Bangladesh
 1983-1986,." reported that theDirectorate General for (Armed)
 Forces Intelligence tortured some political prisoners held for
 short periods of interrogation. Many of the prisoners who
 were reportedly tortured were student activists. The
 Government has not responded to a 1986 AI request to undertake
 impartial and independent investigations into allegations of
 torture and file criminal proceedings against law enforcement
 personnel-when justified. The 1972 Bangladesh Constitution
 specifically prohibits torture, although-the articles in the
 Constitution prohibiting torture were in suspense while
 martial law was in effect from 1982 until late 1986.
 AI and other human rights groups have charged that security
 personnel in the Chittagong Hill Tracts have tortured tribal
 villagers. The military stated that it investigated several
 
 
 1117
 BANGLADESH
 such allegations of torture and mistreatment by soldiers which
 occurred in the Hill Tracts and punished violators accordingly.
 There is some evidence that the military did follow a policy
 of reprisals against tribal villagers in 1986, but it was
 apparently abandoned in 1987. Human rights groups have asked
 the Government to protect the rights of tribal people,
 particularly property rights, against settlers from other
 parts of the country.
 Police treatment of accused criminals is often rough and can
 include abusive interrogations and beatings, but reports of
 fatalities from such mistreatment are rare. Punishment of
 police and jail officials involved in mistreating prisoners
 sometimes takes place in cases where the victim or his friends
 and family can attract publicity, but mistreatment of ordinary
 citizens often goes unpunished.
 Bangladesh has nearly 26,000 prisoners in jails throughout the
 country, according to the Home Minister. The jails reflect the
 country's extremely poor living conditions. In its 1986 report
 on torture, AI stated that cells for prisoners in the Dhaka
 cantonment had neither light nor furniture, and that the grill
 door to many cells was covered by a wooden board, increasing
 the sense of the prisoner's isolation. As is customary in
 South Asia, in the larger prisons prominent persons and
 political prisoners are held in conditions which are markedly
 better than those afforded to ordinary criminals. Prospects
 for the implementation of prison reforms remain slight.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under the Special Powers Act of 1974, the Government, through
 the Ministry of Home Affairs, can detain a person whom it deems
 a "threat to the security of the country." Initially, the
 Government can detain the person for 1 monthl by the end of
 that month, the Government must provide the detainee with a
 specific charge for his detention. If the Government does not
 provide a specific charge, the detention is considered
 "illegal" and the person is released. If the Government
 brings a specific charge against the detainee, he can be
 detained indefinitely. In practice, although not in the law,
 the detainee is given 15 days to respond to the specific
 charge in writing to the Ministry of-Home Affairs. The
 Ministry can then grant early release. The detention is not
 reviewed by a judge. After 6 months, a review committee of
 three jurists examines the case to ascertain if there is
 sufficient reason to continue the detention. If the
 Government adequately defends its detention order, the
 detainee remains imprisoned. If the.Government fails to
 convince the review committee, the detained person is released.
 The detainrd, person has the right to see a lawyer upon
 detention.I  n practice, however, a lawyer is generally not
 allowed to see the detainee until a specific charge has been
 filed.
 The Act was invoked widely in 1987. During the opposition
 protest movement against the President in the autumn,
 thousands of opposition activists were arrested. The Home
 Minister said 4,832 persons were arrested from October 25
 through the end of November, a period of heightened political
 activity. Of these, 2,465 were taken into custody after the
 proclamation of a state of emergency. The two major
 opposition leaders, Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh
 Nationalist Party, and Sheikh Hasina Wajed, leader of the
 Awami League, were placed under house detention from November
 
 
 "1118
 BANGLADESH -
 11 to December 10. Members of the opposition, student
 activists,-and businessmen who had not repaid loans were also
 detained'4lnder the Act. The organization of political
 activities -against the Government and participation in
 demonstrations prompted the Government to detain individuals,
 although the authorities generally sought to notify families
 expeditiously of the detainees' whereabouts. The arrests and
 detentions disrupted the organization of antigovernment
 political activities. Although these powers provide broad
 flexibility, the Act was breached by the authorities' failure
 to comply with time limits or to produce a prisoner before a
 magistrate. In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, AI expressed
 particular concern about the short-term detention of hundreds
 of govdrnment opponents at times of parliamentary and
 presidential elections, when specific restrictions were
 imposed on political activities.
 The right of a person in detention to a judicial determination
 of the legality of the detention is found in local law. Some
 prisoners released as a result of such determination, however,
 reportedly were arrested again within 24 hours. Bangladeshi
 legal and human rights orgahizations reported cases of
 suspects arrested on minor charges who remained in jail for
 long periods without trial.
 There was no report of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil and criminal cases are'heard by civilian courts in
 public trials in which the right to counsel is respected.
 Civil courts are overburdened and available only to those who
 can afford representation but 'are generally considered fair.
 Processing cases can be both time-consumnrhg and expensive,
 working a hardship on the vast majority of litigants and
 discouragirig many from seeking redress through the courts.
 There are few legal aid programs to assist litigants.
 As of April 1987, over 500,00 criminal and civil cases were
 pending adjudication in the country's courts. Despite a-
 deadline of 240 days-for disposal of cri'minal cases at the
 district level and 120 days for disposal at the magistrate's
 level, delays were common. An acute shortage of judges and
 the failure to provide new judges with adequate training
 prevented the timely dispensation of justice.
 A program to disperse magistrate courts to the Upazilla
 (subdistrict) level of government and decentralize the
 administration bf high court appellate branches failed to win
 support from the bar, While many considered court
 decentralization an important step in bringing judicial relief
 to the majority of the population living outside the capital
 city, lawyers protested and forced some magistrate courts
 functioning at the subdistrict level to close. A strike by
 the Supreme Court Bar Association further delayed the
 administration of justice. In November lawyers went on strike
 nationwide. Courts continued hearing cases during the strike,
 but litigants were deprived of legal counsel.
 Bangladeshi human rights groups do not maintain statistics on
 the number of political prisoners in the country, and estimates
 vary widely. Political prisoners are arrested under the
 Special Powers Act and charged under criminal statutes. These
 statutes do not generally violate human rights standards,
 although Section 144 of the Criminal Code restricts the right
 
 
 1119
 BANGLADESH
 of assembly, when invoked. Another exception would be the
 prohibitory orders, which included bans on processions,
 demonstrations, meetings, strikes (the latter for 2 months)
 and criticism of any government decision or action, issued
 under the emergency. The judiciary in Bangladesh is generally
 considered independent, although pressure may be brought to
 bear in political or-security cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law requires a judicial warrant before authorities enter a
 home, and courts require evidence supporting a reasonable basis
 of suspicion before issuing a warrant. However, Bangladesh
 authorities are known to have entered the homes of opposition
 leaders, detained persons, and searched their premises without
 warrants. Wiretaps are believed to be used selectively, as is
 the monitoring of correspondence. The Government maintains
 civilian and military intelligence services which concern
 themselves, in part, with domestic events. The influence and
 capability of these services is thought to be growing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is provided for in the Constitution. The
 Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities. For most of 1987, as in previous years,
 Bangladesh television and radio focused heavily on the
 activities of government leaders and virtually neglected the
 opposition. In the print media, the Government controls one
 of Dhaka's four English-language daily newspapers, a Bengali-
 language daily in Dhaka, and a Bengali-language weekly through
 two national press trusts. The Government also owns the major
 Bangladesh News Agency (BSS) as well as a daily newspaper in
 the regional city of Rajshahi. Three of the Dhaka English
 dailies and most of the many Bengali-language periodicals and
 newspapers, however, are privately owned; some are supported
 by political parties and reflect various political views.
 There are 61 dailies and 218 weeklies in the country. Major
 newspapers report on both the Government and opposition,
 although coverage of opposition political activities is
 usually somewhat less extensive than that of official
 activities. The Ministry of Information issues informal
 directives, often at night by telephone, on how a newspaper
 should report an event.
 In 1987 the Government exercised its authority under the
 Special Powers Act to ban foreign and domestic publications.
 As part of the state of emergency declared by President Ershad
 in November, a news ban was placed on foreign and domestic
 journalists; journalists were told that they could only report
 news which came from the Government. Violators of press
 restrictions could be jailed for up to 3 years, and foreigners
 could be deported.
 The Government stopped publication of the weekly Amar Desh in
 February for printing an editorial critical of the Government.
 The weekly resumed publication in March. The daily Banglar
 Bani, closely associated with the opposition Awami League, was
 closed in August under provisions of the Special Powers Act
 for alleging that the Home Ministry supplied arms to the
 government-supported Jatiyo Party. The Government also banned
 the Bengali weekly magazine Robbar on December 3 for publishing
 
 
 1120
 BANGLADESH
 objectionable articles. The Bangladeshi correspondent for the
 British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was arrested in Dhaka
 November 23 under the Special Powers Act and was released
 December 8. A few photographers were beaten by police during
 a general strike in July. On December 11, the Government shut
 down operations of the BBC in Bangladesh because of its
 allegedly biased reporting. A BBC correspondent was asked to
 leave the country on December 12. Two books published outside
 the country, one concerned with Bangladesh's political
 development and the other with the Prophet Mohammad, were
 banned in August. A popular weekly, Jai Jai Din, banned in
 1985 and reopened briefly in 1986, was not allowed to publish
 in 1987. However,. the weekly newspaper of the Communist Party
 of Bangladesh, banned by the Government in 1986, resumed
 publication in April 1987. Selected editions of foreign
 newspapers and periodicals were also banned or "delayed" by
 Customs authorities.
 With the imposition of the state of emergency on November 27,
 printers, publishers, and editors of all newpapers were
 forbidden to criticize directly or indirectly any government
 decision or order. Newspapers, therefore, virtually ceased
 coverage of opposition political activities. Restrictions
 began to be relaxed after approximately 2 weeks, however, and
 government-controlled newspapers, in an unprecedented change
 of government policy, began on December 11 to carry statements
 by opposition leaders.
 The Government approves and licenses newspapers, and only
 licensed newspapers are able to purchase newsprint and obtain
 government advertisements. Financial difficulties make most
 publications dependent on advertisements from the Government
 or government owned corporations, which reportedly account for
 75 percent of advertising revenues. Although all newspapers
 are entitled to receive public sector advertisements if they
 meet minimum circulation requirements, publishers complain
 that the Government uses advertisements as a means of
 controlling the press.-
 Under a 1987 ordinance, authorities censored plays and
 required drama groups to obtain certificates from a censorship
 committee. The Inspector of Police was given wide powers over
 drama, mime, and dance, including free entry into halls during
 shows and authority to stop performances at any time.
 President Ershad suspended implementation of the ordinance
 after widespread protests.
 Prior to the state of emergency, students were free to express
 a wide range of political opinion through campus organizations
 and their publications. Taking advantage of the relative
 freedom enjoyed on the Dhaka University campus, opposition
 parties criticized the Government through their student-fronts
 and organized antigovernment activities there which sometimes
 turned violent. In August, in an apparent move to stop the
 violence, President Ershad disbanded the Government's student
 organizatifns, but not those affiliated with opposition
 parties, and called for an end to party politics on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government allowed the major opposition parties to campaign
 openly and protest peacefully until many opposition activists
 were detained beginning in late October. A ban on assemblies
 of more than five persons i'm the Dhaka metropolitan area was in
 effect from November 9 to 15. It was not, however, enforced.
 
 
 1121
 BANGLADESH
 Workers in Bangladesh enjoy a limited right to associate, to
 organize, and to bargain collectively. Although the right to
 strike is not provided in the law, labor strikes and general
 strikes are accepted forms of protest in Bangladesh. However,
 the Government banned strikes and lock-outs for a 2-month
 period from November 27 when the state of emergency was
 imposed. Despite this ban, the opposition continued to
 organize nationwide strikes into December. Because of a low
 level of industrialization, labor unions represent only 3
 percent of the work force. Although only a small portion of
 the work force is unionized, unions are powerful and important
 in certain key sectors such as jute, tea, and transportation.
 A survey of violations of trade union rights by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, published in
 June 1987, stated that the holding of elections and the lifting
 of martial law in 1986 enabled trade unions in Bangladesh to
 act with more freedom. The survey noted, however, that
 Bangladesh's industrial relations legislation continued to
 contain several restrictions on freedom of association and the
 right to collective bargaining.
 Unions are heavily engaged but of relatively little influence
 in politics. Every major political party has a labor wing
 which it uses on occasion to encourage workers to accept that
 party's viewpoint. Most labor unions and their leaders shift
 their allegiance toward the party in power to obtain an edge
 over competing unions and to have a friendly ear in government
 ministries. The Workers-Employees United Council (known by
 its Bengali acronym SKOP), a federation of trade unions allied
 to opposition parties in a strongly antigovernment stance,
 organized a successful 24-hour nationwide strike with the
 support of opposition parties on July 12.  A 48-hour general
 strike October 19-20 which tried to win economic and political
 concessions for labor from the Government, however, failed to
 achieve its aims.
 Unions are free to draw up their own constitutions and rules,
 elect officers, and formulate programs. There are no
 restrictions on joining confederations and affiliating with
 international organizations. Union members need government
 clearance to travel to international labor conferences and
 attend programs sponsored by foreign labor institutions; such
 clearances are routinely granted. Under a provision of
 Bangladesh's labor law, the Government can suspend or dissolve
 individual unions, although no such action was taken in 1987.
 In theory, Bangladesh workers enjoy participatory rights in
 all union business; in practice, these rights are often
 violated by both employers and union leaders. Unions and
 their members are also protected legally against antiunion
 discrimination, although these laws are generally not enforced
 and employers regularly fire workers for union activities and
 harass union activists and leaders. Antiunion discrimination
 is especially prevalent in the garment industry, where most of
 the workers are young women.
 Following labor agitation and violence against firms and
 personnel in the Export Processing Zone in Chittagong, the
 Government banned union activity there in 1985 in an effort to
 enhance its attractiveness to foreign investors. This ban was
 still in effect in 1987. Employers, through connections in
 the Government and the military, sometimes draw out legal
 actions that unions file against them until the cases are
 eventually abandoned.
 
 
 1122
 BANGLADESH
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Predominantly Muslim (87 percent), Bangladesh continues to
 permit cbnversion from one religion to another. Proselytizing
 by Bangladeshi citizens is allowed under Article 41 of the
 Constitution, subjedt to law, public order, and morality.
 Proselytization is largely directed toward minority groups
 such as Hindus and tribal peoples, who are generally Buddhist.
 There is strong social resistance to efforts to convert
 persons from Islam. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Sect has claimed
 that its'members cannot worship freely because of attacks by
 Sunni Muslims and the-occupation of several of their mosques
 by local mullahs. The Government is not known to have been
 involved in these incidents. Certain Islamic organizations
 continue to voiciEconcern over Christian missionary activities
 and the conversioi of Muslims to Christianity. Some Christian
 missionaries face delays in renewing their visas and are
 concerned that the Government might make it difficult for them
 to stay in the country.
 The Government has continued to pledge equality of treatment
 and freedom of worship to Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian
 minorities, who constitute apprbximately 13 percent out of a
 total population o  104 million. Although this policy is
 substantially respected, the numerical predominance of Muslims
 contributes to minority concern.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move within the country,
 except within designated areas in the Chittagong Hill- Tracts.
 There are'also areas near the borders from which nonresidents
 are banned. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and
 emigrate abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls. In
 some instances, persons deemed to be security risks are not
 allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants must obtain
 "no-objection certificates" from the ministry responsible for
 manpower export to travel outside the country. The right of
 repatriation is observed.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis or
 "stranded Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending
 resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these
 persons opted for Pakistani citizenship. Pakistan agreed to
 take them back, provided financing for resettlement costs was
 made available from outside sources. A Saudi-based Islamic
 social organization continues its efforts to raise money for
 resettlement costs. Camp dwellers may seek employment and
 conduct other activities but face disadvantages as noncitizens.
 Some Biharis have lost property as a result of laws
 confiscating Pakistani holdings, but those who choose to
 become Bangladeshi citizens are granted full rights of
 citizenship. Biharis may apply for Bangladeshi citizenship at
 any time.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On November 11, 1986, President Ershad restored the
 Constitution and ended the Martial Law Administration which he
 had proclaimed in 1982. The lifting of martial law followed a
 transition process in 1986 during which parliamentary elections
 were held in May, President Ershad resigned from the Army in
 August, and a presidential election was held in October.
 
 
 1123
 BANGLADESH
 Several major opposition groupings, including the Eight Party
 Alliance, led by the Awami League, and the Islamic
 fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islaami, won seats in Parliament but
 did not participate in the presidential elections. The
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party, founded by the late President
 Zia and led by his widow, Begum Zia, boycotted both elections.
 The opposition parties claim that the electoral process was
 seriously flawed and have long demanded President Ershad's
 resignation in favor of a neutral, caretaker government.
 Parliament convened in two sessions in 1987. The winter
 session (January-March) was the first attended by all members,
 including the opposition, since the parliamentary elections of
 May 1986. Byelections to fill vacant parliamentary seats took
 place in February and June. The government candidates won by
 lopsided margins in elections marred by strong-arm tactics and
 charges of fraud.
 Beginning in November, the law and order situation deteriorated
 and the economy was severely damaged by a series of nationwide
 general strikes organized by the opposition. On November 27,
 -President Ershad proclaimed a state of emergency under a
 Constitutional provision stating that the President may issue
 a proclamation if he is satisfied that the "security or
 economic life of Bangladesh, or any part thereof, is threatened
 by... internal disturbance." The state of emergency, covering
 the entire country, will cease to operate after 120 days
 unless it has been approved by Parliament. The President may
 revoke it earlier. The emergency was initiated by a 32-hour
 curfew in Dhaka and four other large towns.
 Under the emergency, the Government prohibited all political
 activity including strikes, processions, rallies, and meetings.
 "Indoor politics," however, was permitted again after 2 weeks.
 Political parties were not banned. Many opposition activists
 were arrested for violation of the emergency rules. Press
 censorship made it more difficult for the opposition to
 communicate or organize against the Government.
 On December 6, the President dissolved Parliament, preempting
 the likely resignation of the largest opposition party, the
 Awami League. Under the Constitution, new parliamentary
 elections must be held within 90 days from the date of
 dissolution. These elections have been scheduled for March 3,
 1988.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several international nongovernmental human rights
 organizations, including AI, the International League for
 Human Rights, the Law Association for Asia and the Western
 Pacific, and the International Commission of Jurists, continue
 to be represented in Bangladesh. AI and other groups have
 requested permission from the Government to travel to the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts to investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses by Bangladesh security forces. The Government
 reportedly has granted permission in principle for AI
 representatives to visit the Hill Tracts, and a mutually
 acceptable date for the visit is now under discussion.
 
 
 1124
 BANGLADESH
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of'women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in
 rural areas, early marriage, high child-bearing rates, and
 long hours of household labor leave little opportunity for
 nonfamily interests or outside employment. Even in urban
 areas and among the affluent, the traditional social system
 makes women economically dependent on their husbands and other
 male relatives. By custom and by Islamic tradition, women
 occupy a subordinate place in Bangladeshi society. The ability
 of a family to seclude its women is a symbol of middle or high
 social status. Women are virtually absent from. the cash work
 force, except in the export-oriented garment industry. A
 woman's income is generally considered "supplemental" to that
 of her husband; women are usually employed in different
 occupations from those in which men are employed. However,
 even when engaged in the same or similar work, women's wages
 frequently lag behind men's.
 The daily press testifies to a patterD of domestic violence
 (murder, rab6, torture), breach of matrimonial contract,
 denial of'inheritance rights, and desertion, which victimizes
 women and is particularly acute among the poor. The rate of
 suicide among women is reportedly almost three times higher
 than the rate among men. The Government promulgated a
 stringent ordinance in 1983 to deter such cruelties to women
 as murder, kidnaping, abduction, and trafficking in women. In
 the 17 months ending in June 1987, the Government reported
 nearly 4,400 incidents of abduction, killing, and suicide of
 women. The death penalty is imposed against those directly
 responsible for "dowry killing" or for killing a woman in the
 course of rape. "Dowry killings" usually share a common
 theme: The bride's family has not made full payment of a
 supposedly promised dowry, so the husband or his family
 attacks and sometimes murders the bride. There is generally
 little recourse for abused women, especially for crimes within
 the family or home.
 members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, although not in law, in their access to government
 positions and political office. Members of some minorities,
 principally Hindus, have lost or have had serious difficulty
 retaining their properties as a result of prejudicial
 administration of vested property laws which provide that
 property belonging to persons who left Bangladesh between 1965
 and 1971 should be managea by the Government. The Government
 is authorized to use and sell this property, which it has
 sometimesae to the disadvantage of the former owner.
 Reports also persist that the property rights of tribal
 peoples are being violated. Tribal land, for which there is
 frequently no deed, is said to have been parceled out by
 Bangladesh authorities to Bengali Muslim settlers. Over the
 past decade, successive governments settled nearly 300,000
 ethnic Bengalis in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, although there
 have been no new settlers in at least 2 years. Tribal people
 also face loss of land through failure to meet mortgage
 payments, false deeds, and physical attacks. In areas where
 the tribal insurgency is active, the army can take land
 without compensation. Legal aid organizations based in Dhaka

 have been offering representation to a limited number of tribal
 people illegally removed from their lands.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Regulations regarding minimum wages, hours of work, and
 occupational safety and health are not strictly enforced.
 Child labor is a serious problem. Bangladesh's labor law
 stipulates minimum agas for various types of employment; in
 industries where unions are strong, these minimums are
 enforced, but the poverty of the country is such that children
 are regularly engaged in any line of work they can get,
 especially field work. The Employment of Children Act
 prohibits the offering of employment to any person under 15
 years of age but the Act is not enforced. As elsewhere on the
 subcontinent, child labor is prevalent and an accepted
 practice. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the number
 of child laborers at approximately 3 million in 1986. These
 children pedaled rickshaws, worked as helpers in transport
 services, carried loads at railway stations and river
 terminals, and worked at construction sites.
