 NAMIBIA
 Formerly German South West Africa, Namibia has been ruled
 since 1915 by the Republic of South Africa. The United
 Nations lifted South Africa's League of Nations mandate in
 1966, and an advisory opinion of the International Court of
 Justice in 1971 upheld U.N. authority over Namibia and called
 for South Africa's immediate withdrawal. Nonetheless, the
 South African Government's representative in Windhoek, the
 Administrator General, continued to administer Namibia,
 together with the "transitional government of National Unity
 (TG)," which had been serving since June 1985, and which is
 drawn from internal Namibian parties. The South African
 Government directly controlled the territory's defense and
 foreign affairs. The'international community has not
 recognized the TG and has held the South African Government
 responsible for the actions of the Namibian authorities.
 Agreements signed in New York on December 22, 1988, by South
 Africa, Angola, and Cuba, with the mediation of the United
 States, require South Africa to implement United Nations
 Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 435 in the context of
 Cuban troop withdrawal from neighboring Angola. The 1978
 Resolution calls for a ceasefire, the phased withdrawal of
 South African forces, and free elections under U.N.
 supervision. If UNSCR 435 is implemented, the Administrator
 General (AG) will reassume all powers now held by the TG,
 which will be disbanded. The AG will continue to administer
 the territory during the transition process, including the
 election, but under the supervision of the U.N. Secretary
 General's special representative on Namibia. Commencement of
 implementation is scheduled for April 1, 1989.
 Meanwhile, Namibia continued throughout much of 1988 to
 experience low-level guerrilla conflict with insurgents of the
 South West African People's Organization's (SWAPO) military
 wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), fighting
 the South African Defense Force (SADF) and the Southwest
 Africa Territorial Force (SWATF). Early in the year SADF made
 incursions into Angola to strike SWAPO/PLAN bases there.
 Military activity declined to negligible levels after a
 cease-fire went into effect on September l-along the border
 between Angola and Namibia. SWAPO draws most of its support
 from the Ovambo in the north, the largest ethnic group in
 Namibia. SWAPO also operated as a legal political
 organization within Namibia, although it does not participate
 in the TG.
 Some 60 percent of the populatioh of 1.3 million live by
 subsistence agriculture. The modern economy consists of
 mining, fishing, cattle ranching, and food processing. Mining
 and agriculture provide 90 percent of exports; the
 manufacturing industry is very small. Real gross domestic
 product grew by 2.9 percent in 1987, according to government
 statistics. A lack of diversification in the economy has
 produced very uneven growth. Economic conditions are
 particularly severe in the north. Unemplyient is at least 20
 percent, according to one academic estimate, but one survey of
 10 urban areas found an extremely high rate of 33 percent.
 As has been the case over the past 20 years, most reports of
 human rights violations by government authorities or SWAPO
 involved actions taken in the "operational area" in northern
 Namibia (where over half of the territory's population
 lives). The guerrilla war in the north, which began in 1966,
 
 
 240
 NAMIBIA
 continued in 1988, and produced a number of casualties and
 fundamentally disrupted the lives of those living in northern
 Namibia. There were also three major bombings; at a bank in
 northern Namibia, which killed 28 civilians; at a butchery
 shop in Walvis Bay, which killed 1; and at a hotel in
 Windhoek, which killed 2. There has been no final
 determination as to who was responsible for the bombings.
 Despite the TG's bill of fundamental rights, which includes
 many internationally recognized individual rights, the South
 African courts have ruled that these rights can only be tested
 against legislation passed since the TG came into being in
 1985. As a result, all of Namibia's harsh security laws
 remain in force; and in 1988 arbitrary government detention
 without access to counsel or visits by family members
 continued, as did restrictions on the freedom of assembly.
 South African State President Botha in March halted the
 prosecution of six security force members charged with a
 murder during a SWAPO rally in November 1986. An extremist
 white group appeared on the scene in 1988 and admitted
 responsibility for destroying the plant of the outspoken
 newspaper, The Namibian.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were periodic reports of politically motivated attacks
 and killing by both government security forces and SWAPO.
 Some charges of security force abuses, particularly in the
 "operational area" of northern Namibia were confirmed when
 security force members were convicted on various charges,
 including robbery and rape. However, many of the killings
 that occurred in the operational area were difficult to
 attribute to any one group. There were allegations, denied as
 'absurd" by the security forces, that the security forces
 committed crimes, including murder, against civilians while
 masquerading as SWAPO guerrillas. Five black members of the
 security forces were convicted in 1988 of killing two women.
 There were reports of injuries when security forces shot at
 civilians allegedly for violating the curfew, including one
 incident in August, in which the security forces claimed, but
 the victims denied, that warning shots had been fired.
 SWAPO appeared in 1988 to step up a policy of engaging in
 sabotage bombings of nonmilitary targets. SWAPO took
 responsibility for the 1987 bombing of a Windhoek public
 parking garage (two men were on trial in late 1988 for that
 bombing), but it denied responsibility in three bombings in
 1988, including one which killed 28 civilians at a bank in
 Ovamboland in February. A northern Namibian man confessed to
 the police that he had planted the bombs at the bank and at a
 butchery shop in Walvis Bay in 1988; he is now standing
 trial. A third bomb killed two persons at the Continental
 Hotel in Windhoek in September. Government authorities in
 Namibia blamed SWAPO for all three bombings, but SWAPO denied
 these claims, alleging the bombs had been planted by the
 security forces to discredit SWAPO.
 
 
 241
 NAMIBIA
 b. Disappearance
 Security forces are not obliged to notify anyone when a person
 is detained and often hold detainees incommunicado for
 extended periods of time. Legal counsel sometimes has to
 petition the courts to obtain information on suspected
 detainees, and recently the authorities have been somewhat
 more cooperative in responding to requests for information on
 detainees. However, the authorities do not have to notify
 anyone of a detainee's release.
 The security forces claimed that SWAPO kidnaped civilians in
 1988, particularly young people, to gain recruits. The
 security forces claimed SWAPO abducted 40 pupils and 5
 teachers from Ombalantu in Ovamboland in May, bringing the
 total of those allegedly kidnaped by SWAPO in 1988 to 83.
 SWAPO has consistently denied claims of kidnaping, insisting
 that its recruits come voluntarily.
 There were continuing credible reports in 1988 that SWAPO
 kidnaps or kills Namibians, including SWAPO members or
 ex-members, who disagree with the organization's policies.
 SWAPO admits that it is detaining in camps in Angola and
 Zambia a group of Namibians, allegedly because they are spies
 for South Africa, but denies that any of them have been
 executed. SWAPO claims that the organization's security
 prohibits visits by outsiders to these detainees. Because of
 this policy, the fate of approximately 100 disappeared SWAPO
 members that have been of interest to human-rights groups for
 several years remains unknown. In May the International
 Society of Human Rights listed the names of an additional 37
 persons who had disappeared or been murdered following their
 alleged arrest by SWAPO.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of security force abuses continued in 1988.
 Political leaders, clergymen, and others regularly made
 detailed reports that the police and security forces engaged
 in brutal treatment of civilians, primarily in northern
 Namibia, in and out of detention. The Secretary of the
 Legislative Assembly of Ovamboland testified in a South
 African court that he had taken some 690 affidavits over the
 past 6 years alleging acts of rape, murder, theft, and arson
 by the SADF in Namibia. There were several reports in 1988 of*-
 civilians being beaten by security force members. As in
 previous years, the police counterinsurgency unit, formerly
 known as *Koevoet," was accused of harassment and beatings of
 civilians in northern Namibia. In late December, South Africa
 stated that "Koevoet" was being disbanded in connection with
 the planned implementation of UNSCR 435.
 Six members of SWATF were found guilty of raping a girl in
 Ovamboland in April 1987 and sentenced to between 3 and 6
 years. They were also made to pay compensation. There have
 been other cases in which security forces have been required
 to pay considerable sums in court cases arising from human
 rights abuses. However, the police officer involved in a
 widely publicized police beating in 1987 (the Heita case) was
 not prosecuted. He was later transferred. Human rights
 groups claim that the publicity surrounding these cases has
 not led to a significant decrease in abuses.
 
 
 242
 NAMIBIA
 Amnesty International (AI) published a special report in April
 1987, Namibia: Torture and Ill-Treatment of Prisoners, which
 cited evidence of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government employs three pieces of legislation allowing
 broad powers of detention. The first is Article 6 of the
 Terrorism Act of 1967, the harshest of the three laws under
 which a person can be held in indefinite detention without
 review, without access to counsel, his own physician, family,
 or friends. The detainee does, however, have access to
 government-appointed doctors and magistrates. The other two
 laws providing for detention without trial are known as AG-9
 and AG-26. The former allows for access to counsel only after
 30 days; the latter allows for early access and provides for a
 review committee, but the TG Cabinet is not required to follow
 review committee recommendations. The authorities have
 increasingly used the Terrorism Act since 1986, when the
 Supreme Court ruled that detainees under AG-9 had access to
 legal counsel after 30 days.
 One SWAPO member, Jason Angula, who was initially detained in
 October 1987 under AG-9, was transferred to detention under
 the Terrorism Act. He was released without charge in
 December. Angula did not have access to counsel and was not
 charged. There was at least one other case in 1988 of initial
 detention under AG-9 being switched to the Terrorism Act (see
 below). The Windhoek Supreme Court in February upheld a
 Judge's September 1987 order releasing six SWAPO and union
 officials from detention under the Terrorism Act, citing
 insufficient reason for their arrest. In an out-of-court
 settlcment of a civil suit, police paid about $6,000 to each
 of the former detainees, although the police did not admit
 their guilt.
 Some people detained under the three laws are not fully aware
 of their rights while in detention. Lawyers have on occasion
 been able to get their clients released by threatening legal
 action against the authorities. Past legal action appears to
 have made the authorities more responsive to requests for
 details of detentions.
 It is not certain how many people were detained during 1988,
 or how many remained in detention at the end of the year. The
 police publicize numbers of detentions on occasion but usually
 do not name the detainees, announce their releases, or issue
 figures on the total number of detainees at any given time.
 The police said that they are detaining people under AG-9 and
 Article 6 of the Terrorism Act, not AG-26. The Deputy
 Attorney General confirmed that 9 people had been detained in
 northern Namibia between January 18 and 22, and the South
 African Police reported on January 28 that 43 people had been
 detained in the north.
 The Namibian Communications Center in London claimed that 36
 people were in detention "for political reasons" as of early
 October. The police deny the existence of "political
 prisoners," claiming that all of them eventually will be
 charged. The editor of The Namibian newspaper was detained
 under AG-9 for 5 days in June. Five student$ were detained
 for 3 weeks in June under AG-9; they were released without
 charge.
 
 
 243
 NAMIBIA
 In August 37 students were detained and later charged for
 their participation in a gathering at the University of
 Namibia in connection with separate school boycotts (see
 Section 2.b.).
 There were no further challenges to the constitutionality of
 security legislation in 1988. Although the TG's own "Bill of
 Fundamental Rights" stipulates that "no one shall be detained
 for an indefinite period of time without a fair and proper
 trial by a court," the uncertain status of the TG and
 continuing rule by South Africa prevented this right from
 being respected fully. All the security legislation remains
 in effect, although some within the TG would prefer to rely on
 normal criminal statutes rather than the more severe security
 acts.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch (the TG),
 and the Supreme Court is respected for its integrity. Its
 authority is limited, however, by TG and South African
 legislation and subject to appellate review by the South
 African Appeals Court in Bloemfontein. In April South African
 President Botha gave the executive branch--the Administrator
 General and the TG--additional powers with respect to the
 courts, enabling them automatically to refer decisions of the
 Windhoek Supreme Court on constitutional matters to the
 appellate division in Bloemfontein without obtaining
 permission to appeal from the Namibian Court. The Court in
 Bloemfontein is considered significantly more conservative
 than the Windhoek bench.
 Most trials are held in public, and the defendants have a
 right to counsel. There is little criticism of the courts
 themselves; criticism regarding the administration of justice
 generally revolves around the system of detention without
 trial, and whether security fQrce personnel are brought to
 trial for illegal actions. Those who are brought to trial can
 expect a hearing based on the legal merits of their case, and
 there is a right of appeal. Namibia operates under
 Roman-Dutch law. Defendants are generally considered innocent
 until proven guilty, except when charged under the Terrorism
 Act. That Act places the burden of proving innocence on the
 defendant so long as the prosecution has shown that the crime
 occurred and the accused had some knowledge of it.-
 Reform of security legislation remained a dormant issue in
 1988. There was no further action on the Van Dyk Commission
 Report, issued in October 1986, which proposed revisions in
 the security leqislation.
 Two of the year's most noted court cases highlighted the South
 African President's power to indemnify security forces against
 criminal prosecution. South African President Botha in March
 halted the trial of six security force members who had been
 charged in the murder of Immanuel Shifidi in Windhoek in
 November 1986. This was the second time in 2 years that the
 President had halted a murder prosecution against soldiers.
 According to the South African Defense Act, the President may
 stop judicial proceeding against security force members if the
 incident occurred in the "operational area, if the forces
 acted in good faith, and if the action was in the national
 interest." The Administrator General, at the request of
 
 
 244
 NAMIBIA
 President Botha, issued a certificate finding that these
 conditions had been met. At the end of 1988, the validity of
 the Shifidi certificate was being tested in the Windhoek
 Supreme Court. Late in the year, the Windhoek Supreme Court
 overturned a similar certificate which had halted a murder
 trial against four SADF soldiers accused of murdering Frans
 Uapota in northern Namibia in 1985. In that case, the TG had
 issued the certificate at the request of the South African
 President but had vowed never to do so again because of the
 negative impact on its credibility. The Windhoek Court found
 that the military report on which the certificate was based
 had been "most misleading" because it had not included the
 post mortem results showing evidence of injuries consistent
 with prolonged beatings and strangulation with rope. The
 Court also ruled that the certificate improperly took away
 prosecutorial powers that rested with the Attorney General.
 At the end of the year, an appeal of the ruling was pending in
 the South African Appeals Court, and prosecution of the
 soldiers had not resumed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security legislation allows the security forces almost
 unlimited powers of search and seizure. Invasion of homes is
 said to be commonplace in the northern operational zone. Cars
 are searched at security checkpoints. Some charge that they
 are under surveillance periodically and that their houses or
 cars have been searched even outside the operational zone.
 Telephones and mail of those unsympathetic to the TG and the
 security forces are assumed to be monitored. There continue
 to be allegations that security forces have threatened
 civilians to obtain information on suspected SWAPO insurgents.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The South African Government and the TG have at times
 restricted the freedom of speech to criticize the Government,
 "especially through restrictions on assembly (see below). The
 Government controls the electronic media, but newspapers
 represent views covering the entire political spectrum.
 Editorials can, and do, support these views, including
 pro-SWAPO sentiments.
 Namibian newspapers are subject to South African press laws,
 including the Internal Security Act of 1950, which restricts
 reporting on some security matters. Nevertheless, Namibian
 newspapers publish stories critical of the security forces and
 the Government. The South West African Police lodged a
 complaint with the S.A. Media Council regarding the weekly
 Namibian's coverage of alleged security force abuses and
 -alleged SWAPO incidents.
 The Namibian was the victim of an arson attack in September
 which destroyed much of its equipment. A group calling itself
 the "White Wolves," an alleged extreme rightwing vigilante
 group, claimed credit for the attack. One Namibian reporter
 was briefly detained under AG-9 in March while interviewing a
 rape and assault victim. In addition, the police detained
 Namibian Editor Gwen Lister for 5 days in June for publishing
 what was allegedly a classified internal document which
 outlined proposed security legislation and which included a
 call for a crackdown on the press and political parties. The
 
 
 245
 NAMIBIA
 authorities never stated whether the document was actually
 classified, and Lister was not charged.
 Publications are banned both for political reasons and for
 obscenity. Publications which were banned in South Africa are
 for the most part also banned in Namibia. The South African
 Publications Appeal Board, which has jurisdictioh in Namibia,
 banned publication of SWAPO's political program in July. The
 TG's Information and Justice Minister expressed disappointment
 at the action. Other SWAPO publications have routinely been
 declared "undesirable" and thus illegal to sell or distribute.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political rallies on public property do not require approval,
 only prior notice under the notification and Prohibition of
 Meetings Act. Bans on meetings can be imposed under the
 Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956. The Government banned all
 Human Rights Day celebrations in December 1987.
 A dominant freedom of assembly issue during 1988 was connected
 with the presence of military bases near primary and secondary
 schools in northern Namibia, and the request of students,
 church, and community leaders to have them removed. The
 Government claimed the bases had been established before the
 schools, but opponents contended that some of the bases were
 built near schools to counter political activities there.
 The ultimately unsuccessful effort to have the bases removed
 sparked a string of school boycotts beginning in March. The
 boycotts spread to Windhoek in June, prompting absenteeism and
 demonstrations, some of which were broken up by police ?nd
 security forces, with injuries on several occasions. The
 police broke up one in June with tear gas and rubber bullets,
 detaining 43 and causing some injuries. This gathering did
 not have prior government approval, but witnesses claimed, as
 they did in other incidents, that they were given no warning
 before the police employed tear gas and rubber bullets.
 The school boycott also spurred a union-organized, 2-day
 "stayaway" in June. The TG then adopted the Protection of
 Bill of Fundamental Rights Act, which outlawed promotion of
 stayaways or boycotts. The law makes it illegal to "without
 lawful reason, induce or persuade" people to boycott schools
 or government services, or to stay away from work. It also
 makes it illegal to use violence to achieve any of these
 ends. The term "lawful reason" is not defined. Despite its
 name, the law is being challenged in court as being in
 violation of the TG's own Bill of Fundamental Rights, which
 provides for freedom of speech and association. The law was
 employed in the breaking up of an August gathering at the
 University of Namibia and the arrest of 37. They were later
 charged and were awaiting trial in December while the court
 reviewed the constitutionality of the Protection of Bill of
 Fundamental Rights Act.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy freedom of religion. Almost all Namibians are
 Christians, with the Lutheran Church--the largest grdup of
 which belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Ovambo-Kavango
 Church, now known as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
 
 
 246
 NAMIBIA
 Namibia (ELCIN)--having the most adherents. Roman Catholic,
 Anglican, Methodist, and Dutch reformed churches are also
 active. There is one Jewish Synagogue in Windhoek.
 The majority of church leaders are openly critical of the TG
 and the South African Government and are allied through the
 Council of Churches of Namibia (CCN). Church leaders in
 northern Namibia condemned the 1988 bank bombing in which 28
 lives were lost, as well as the use of violence generally.
 Church people claim they are the victims of security force
 harassment. One church official was briefly detained and
 allegedly beaten by police in connection with one of the
 demonstrations. As in 1987, several of these church leaders
 were either denied travel documents altogether or issued
 documents good only for one trip (see Section 2.d.). The
 security forces and the Government have said that these church
 officials are SWAPO supporters. Although the reasons for
 denial of passports do not have to be given, it was assumed
 the Government wished to deny them a platform to criticize the
 TG and South Africa or to urge pressure on South Africa to
 relinquish Namibia. At the end of 1988, it was still not
 known who was responsible for the September 1987 bombing which
 destroyed a Roman Catholic church in northern Namibia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in the entire operational area
 of northern Namibia. The security forces said in August that
 they would lift the curfew on October 1 if there were no
 incidents in September involving SWAPO insurgents. The offer
 had been made in conjunction with the pullout of South African
 troops from Angola and a cessation of hostilities in the
 area. The SADF did not lift the curfew in October, claiming
 continued SWAPO guerrilla activity in northern Namibia.
 Meanwhile, a court challenge by three Namibian churchmen to
 have the curfew declared illegal was still pending before the
 Bloemfontein Appeals Court, which reserved judgment on the
 appeal in September.
 South Africa, through the Administrator General in Windhoek,
 controls foreign travel by Namibians. There continued to be
 cases where political opponents of the TG were either denied
 passports or travel documents. In one such case, several
 Namibians were denied passports or travel documents to attend
 a March conference of West European Parliamentarians in which
 SWAPO and African National Congress officials participated.
 An African Methodist minister, Reverend Kauraera, who
 previously had been denied travel documents, was eventually
 granted permission to attend a conference in the United
 States. The authorities granted passports or travel documents
 to most of the people who attended a conference with SWAPO in
 Lusaka in October, but two people, Dr. Zephania Kameeta and
 union official Jerry Ekandjo, were denied documents. Those
 denied passports or travel documents cannot appeal through the
 courts.
 There were no known deportations under the Residence of
 Certain Persons in South West Africa Regulation Act, which
 allows for the deportation of non-Namibians who threaten the
 public order. A German-born Windhoek businessman, Ulrich
 Eins, who has lived most of his life in Namibia, challenged
 the Act in court as unconstitutional. Eins won his case in
 Windhoek, but the decision was effectively overturned by the
 Bloemfontein Appeals Court.
 
 
 247
 NAMIBIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Namibians did not in 1988 have the right to change their
 government. South Africa maintained control over the
 territory, and the Administrator General represented the South
 African Government in Windhoek. While the TG in theory
 controlled most government portfolios, except for defense and
 foreign affairs, the South African Government still maintained
 ultimate authority over the TG, which it created.
 The TG and the National Assembly were appointed, not elected,
 bodies. Namibia was administered by a three-tiered structure,
 created in 1980 under.a decree known as "AG-8," which provided
 for a central legislative body (the National Assembly), 11
 ethnic-based second-tier authorities, and local or municipal
 authorities. Only some of the second-tier legislatures were
 elected. Several parties in the TG are particularly adamant
 about preserving "group rights," and they continued to press
 for ethnic elections. However, no elections were held.
 Although the UNSCR 435 calls for elections before the drafting
 of a constitution, the South African President in 1987 created
 a Constitutional Council containing members of the TG to
 devise a constitution. The TG never reached a consensus on a
 draft constitution, and offered two opposing drafts to the
 South African Government. The constitutional issue was
 overtaken in late 1988 by progress in the international
 negotiations. The South African Government and the TG then
 focused on a set of constitutional principles drafted by five
 Western powers in 1982 and accepted at that time by all
 parties to the Namibian dispute. The TG wants to havea
 constitutional conference with SWAPO before the U.N.
 elections; such a conference is not part of the U.N. plan.
 Women play a minor role in Namibian politics. There are
 female local government officials and members of the National
 Assembly, but there are no female cabinet members.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Administrator General and the TG extend minimum
 cooperation to various groups investigating the human rights
 situation in Namibia. Namibian authorities denied a visa to
 Reverend John Evenson, Director of the Namibian Communications
 Centre in London. Although the Communications Centre
 publishes material on alleged human rights abuses, Reverend
 Evenson was traveling to Namibia to attend a conference
 organized by the Namibian Peace Plan Group to express support
 for UNSCR 435. Evenson reportedly was accused by Namibian
 authorities of "poisoning the minds of people overseas."
 Others investigating the human rights situation were allowed
 into the country, however. As far as is known, the Government
 did not respond to AI's 1987 special report on torture and
 ill-treatment of prisoners.
 A Human Rights Center was established at Ongwediva in
 Ovamboland in July. The Center offers legal advice and access
 to lawyers through its headquarters in Windhoek. Two employees
 of the Ongwediva Center were detained for 2 days in August
 while investigating the case of seven people detained without
 trial and three alleged killings by security forces. Neither
 the two human rights workers nor the seven others were charged.
 
 
 248
 NAMIBIA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 All Namibians,4nst hold identification documents under the
 Identification of Persons Act of 1979. Race and ethnic groups
 are included in code on the document. Under decree AG-8,
 Namibia maintains nine functioning ethnic or second-tier
 authorities. The population is divided into the following
 racial and ethnic groups present in the territory: Ovambo,
 whites, Damara, Herero, Kavango, Nama, colored (mixed race),
 Kaokovelder, Bushmen, Rehoboth Baster, Caprivian, and Tswana.
 Namibia's population in 1988 was estimated at 1.3 million, of
 whom just over half are Ovambo. There are approximately
 80,000 whites.
 Although there is some sharing of government revenues among
 all the groups, much of the tax revenue collected from members
 of a particular ethnic groups stays with that group. As a
 result, white medical and educational facilities are superior
 to those of the other groups. For example, the white second
 tier authority, representing about 6 percent of the total
 population, had a budget of about $22 million, while the
 Ovambo authority, representing almost 50 percent of the
 population, had a budget of only about $330,000 in 1988.
 The Windhoek Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion in March
 that AG-8 violated the TG's own Bill of Fundamental Rights
 largely because of discrimination in funding based on color or
 ethnic classification. The Bill of Rights prohibits such
 discrimination. However, the opinion was merely advisory, and
 the TG parties remained divided and thus undecided on what to
 do about AG-8.
 Social facilities are generally open to all races, although
 private businesses can, and in a relatively few cases, do
 restrict admittance based on race. Unlike South Africa,
 residential areas are not legally segregated. Economic
 factors do, however, separate townships in the territory.
 Some hospitals, such as the State Hospital in Windhoek, admit
 all patients but have separate wings for different races.
 Although the majority of the TG is in favor of opening the
 schools to all races, the TG has not desegregated schools.
 Parents must register their children in school according to
 race and ethnic group. The Nama opposed the opening of a
 private nonracial school in southern Namibia, apparently
 because of political disagreement with the school's sponsor.
 The white South West African National Party and the "colored"
 Rehoboth Basters, two TG parties, continued their opposition
 to open schools and a loosening of the various ethnic groups'
 control over what is generally known as "own affairs." The
 South African Government has consistently expressed support
 for group rights and "own affairs," both in Namibia and the
 Republic.
 Women still experience unequal treatment in both the
 traditional and modern sectors, particularly with regard to
 financial and legal matters. Under traditional practice, a
 woman is not independent; she is usually the ward of her
 father or, when married, her husband. There is still some de
 facto discrimination in employment in the modern sector. Some
 community groups--and government bodies--are targeting women
 in their development programs. Among these are the Council of
 Churches' Namibian Women's Voice, the Women of Namibia, and
 the Namibian Womens Organization in Ovamboland.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The legal right to associate in labor unions, long enjoyed by
 white and colored workers in Namibia, was extended to black
 workers in July 1978. During the past 2 years, black union
 membership has grown markedly, similar to recent black union
 development in South Africa. Unions have been created in new
 industries, including transport and public workers. Union
 officials in 1988 claimed a membership of at least 50,000
 members in all the unions out of a work force of at least
 220,000. The majority of workers in the largest single
 private sector of the-economy, mining, are unionized.
 Namibian workers have and exercise the right to strike.
 As in South Africa, the labor and political situations are not
 separated, and most of the unions are sympathetic toward
 SWAPO; many union leaders are also SWAPO officials. These    L
 unions organized a stayaway in June to demand the removal of
 military bases from the vicinity of schools in northern
 Namibia and the release of detainees without trial. The
 stayaway closed down the country's largest employer, a diamond
 mine; and participation ranged from zero to 70 percent in
 Windhoek and reportedly from 75 to 100 percent in a few other
 towns. However, the unions' demands were not met. Most
 companies adopted a "no work, no pay" stance towards their
 workers, but several companies, particularly smaller ones,
 fired workers for staying away. At the end of 1988, the
 unions were seeking their reinstatement. The police detained
 one trade unionist for a few weeks under security legislation
 as a result of the stayaway, but he was not charged.
 Unions are allowed to publicize their views. Namibia
 recognizes the May Day holiday, and a large rally was held
 May 1. However, the 1988 Protection of the Bill of
 Fundamental Rights Act seeks to restrict the advocacy and
 organization of work stayaways and boycotts. The law is being
 tested in the Windhoek Supreme Court to see if it actually
 violates the freedoms protected by the 1985 Bill of
 Fundamental Rights.
 Namibian unions participate in the meetings of the
 International Labor Organization, to which Namibia has
 belonged since 1978, and are free to affiliate with
 international trade union bodies. There is also a banned
 union group, the National Union of Namibian Workers, which
 operates in exile out of Angola and is affiliated to the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and to the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of collective bargaining without the intervention of
 a government agency was recognized by the Namibian Supreme
 Court in February 1985. A government policy statement the
 following year endorsed the principle of "tripartism" and
 pledged to promote industrial self-government by employers and
 employees. Since then, there have been continuing efforts to
 develop a workable system. The commission created to revamp
 Namibia's outdated labor laws continued its deliberations in
 1988 and was expected to issue some of its proposals early in
 1989. The commission--headed by the man who oversaw the
 drafting of South Africa's important labor legislation of

 NAMIBIA
 1979, Nic Wiehahn--is expected to devise a system of
 industrial courts as in South Africa, but the Namibian
 proposals will not be exactly the same as those existing in
 South Africa.
 Namibia presently has a system of conciliation boards. Under
 the system, employees or employers must apply to the TG
 Cabinet to have a board appointed under the Wage and
 Industrial Council Ordinance. The board's decisions are
 binding on both sides of a dispute.
 A major labor issue has been the recognition of unions by
 individual companies andthe unions' subsequent registration
 with the TG. Existing labor law prohibits general unions,
 i.e., one union representing workers in more than one
 industry. Although unregistered unions can bargain with their
 employers if they are recognized by management, they do not
 have access to conciliation boards. Disputes have arisen,
 usually along political lines, as to which of two competing
 unions represented the majority of workers at a particular
 company. Important recognition and work condition agreements
 were reached with large employers in the mining and food
 processing industries in 1988.
 Labor legislation applies uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited in law, and there are no reports of
 its practice in Namibia.
 d. Mimimum Age for Employment of Children
 As in South Africa, the minimum working age in most industries
 in Namibia is 15. However, children below the age of 15 often
 work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no statutory minimum wage in Namibia. Several of the
 unions adopted "a living wage" as the theme of most of their
 activity during 1988. Mandated occupational health standards
 are similar to those in South Africa. Improved safety
 conditions were part of union demands in 1988, particularly in
 the mining industry, and some individual agreements have been
 reached. Namibia also has legislation mandating leave
 (including maternity leave) and overtime standards.
