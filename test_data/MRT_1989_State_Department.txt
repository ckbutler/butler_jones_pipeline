 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been governed since
 1978 by the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN).
 Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'ahmed Taya, President of the
 Committee and Chief of State, assumed power in 1984 after the
 bloodless ouster of the former president, Lt. Col. Mohamed
 Khouna Ould Haidalla. All 19 members of the Military
 Committee hold ministerial portfolios or occupy other key
 military or government positions. The Committee functions as
 a legislative body, while the President, assisted by his
 Council of Ministers and a few close advisers, wields the
 executive power. Political parties are not allowed in
 Mauritania.
 The security forces number about 16,000 and, in addition to
 the regular armed forces, include the National Guard, the
 gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police) and
 the police. The National Guard and police come under the
 Minister of Interior and all have'internal security
 functions. Over the past 3 years, the Government purged
 security forces-of hundreds of suspected dissidents,
 particularly non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians and
 Pan-Arab Baathists.
 Mauritania continues to face massive economic and social
 problems: drought, desertification, insect infestation, the
 Western Sahara conflict, extensive unemployment, one of the
 highest per capita foreign debts in Africa, poor infra-
 structure, inadequate health and education systems, and exodus
 from rural areas. Although adequate rains fell in 1988 and
 1989, the prior drought years forced large numbers of nomads
 into towns, with a consequent weakening of traditional Maur
 nomadic culture, and a severe strain on government resources.
 In addition, mutual expulsions and repatriations between
 Senegal and Mauritania after April 1989 resulted in the
 movement of more than 100,000 people, placing an unprecedented
 economic and social strain on Mauritanian society. Many of
 the Mauritanians who returned had been prosperous merchants in
 Senegal, and important sources of foreign exchange earnings.
 At the same time, many of the black Africans who departed had
 held important technical and skilled positions in Mauritania.
 The human rights situation in Mauritania deteriorated
 dramatically in 1989. In April Mauritania experienced one of
 its most serious crises since independence, when anti-
 Senegalese rioting in Mauritania and anti-Mauritanian rioting
 in Senegal left hundreds dead. In the aftermath of the
 rioting, tens of thousands of Senegalese citizens as well as
 Pulaar-speaking Mauritanian citizens were expelled to
 Senegal. Tens of thousands of Mauritanians and Senegalese of
 Maur origin similarly fled or were expelled from Senegal.
 Subsequently, the Mauritanian Government dismissed many
 Halpulaar civil servants and employees of state-owned
 enterprises from their positions. Although the Mauritanian
 authorities argued that the expellees were not true
 Mauritanians, but rather Senegalese with false identity
 papers, the fact remains that in all cases persons were
 forcibly removed, often without being allowed to retain their
 possessions, and without due process of law. Reports of
 unlawful detention and torture also surfaced during 1989, and
 most other human rights, including political freedoms,
 remained tightly circumscribed.

 MAURITANIlA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.' Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been no substantiated cases of members of the
 Government or security forces .perpetrating politically
 motivated killings. However, serious questions remain
 regarding the role of the Mauritanian security forces in the
 initial riots on April 24-25. During the-early stages of the
 rioting, some police officers stood by without intervening, or
 may even have g6aded on the rioters. The Mauritanian army was
 called-in to quell the disturbances only on April 25. Whether
 these incidents reflected official government policy, or were
 isolatdd instances of individuals acting on tneir own, is
 unknown.. The net results of the violence were numerous deaths
 and extensive p~operty damage. The Government conceded a
 death toll of several scores, while other sources contended
 that several hundred persons may have died.
 b. Disappearances
 There were no substgntiated reports of politically motivated
 disappearances 2
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Mauritanian law specifically precludes the use of torture.
 There were, however, recurring reports during 1989 that the
 security forces used torture against dissidents and against
 some non-Hassaniyarspeaking black Mauritanians.
 On February 27, five leaders of the December 1988-January 1989
 student strike at the university of Nouakchott released a
 report describing their 4-day interrogation and torture at the
 hands of the police in December 1988. The students said they
 were deprived of food and sleep, forced to stand without
 clothes outdoors in the chill of night, kicked and beaten with
 rubber hoses, and suspended by their hands and feet from a
 steel beam until they became unconscious. Several also had
 their heads kept immersed in water until they feared
 drowning. According to their report, upon their release,
 several of the students could not walk and remained bedridden
 for over a week. The students provided the names of several
 of their alleged police torturers in their report. The
 Government is not known to have acted against the alleged
 torturers; neither, however, did it retaliate against the
 students, although the report was circulated widely.
 In the aftermath of.the April rioting, there were recurrent
 unsubstantiated reports of police detention and torture of
 non-Hassaniya-speaking. black-Mauritanians, particularly in the
 regions along the Senegal river. These reports generally
 involved incidents in small villages or remote areas and were
 thus difficult to verify. The recurring nature of these
 reports, however, lends-credence to the overall impression
 that incidents of torture did in fact take place.
 One report issued by Amnesty International (AI) involved the
 headmaster of a school in Tetiane, who was allegedly detained
 and tortured by the police in Kaedi in early June. The
 headmaster reportedly died as a result of this treatment. The
 
 
 220
 MAURITANIA
 same report alleged that four Pulaar-speaking black
 Mauritanian herdsmen were detained, tortured, and possibly
 killed by the police in the Kaedi and M'bout region, also in
 June. Numerous other unsubstantiated allegations of torture
 surfaced, often involving efforts by the local security forces
 to intimidate or force Pulaar or Wolof-speaking black
 Mauritanians into leaving their homes and going to Senegal.
 Responsibility for such alleged activities is difficult to
 determine; there may have been incidents in which local
 security forces acted independently, without orders from their
 superiors. Furthermore, in several areas along the river
 local militias of mostly Hassaniya-speaking white and black
 Maurs were formed, ostensibly to guard against cross-border
 incursions from Senegal. Since some of these civilians were
 armed, it is possible that some cases of torture were carried
 out by these militias. On balance, even though some senior
 members of the regime continued to voice opposition to the use
 of torture, reports suggest that its use increased during
 1989, especiall in the aftermath of the April intercommunal
 violence, and there were no known instances of the Government
 punishing those responsible.
 Prison conditions in Mauritania are harsh. Four political
 prisoners died from disease and malnutrition at Oualata Prison
 in 1988, in part because the prison commandant was
 systematically withholding food. As a result of these deaths
 and the international pressures they caused, the remaining
 prisoners were subsequently removed from Oualata, and the
 commandant was dismissed and reprimanded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law in principle assures expeditious arraignment
 and trial, access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal.
 The courts must review the legality of a person's detention no
 more than 72 hours after his or her arrest. Compliance with
 this law, however, is inconsistent. For example, the five
 leaders of the University of Nouakchott student strike were
 detained for 4 days in December 1988 without a hearing. AI
 has also reported that one of these students, Abdallahi Ould
 Bah Nagi, was subsequently detained by the police on May 29
 and held without a hearing. The apparent reason for his
 detention was his role in the distribution of a leaflet
 criticizing the expulsion of non-Hassaniya-speaking black
 Mauritanians by the Mauritanian Government.
 In the aftermath of the April riots, there were widespread
 stories--often from persons in refugee camps in Senegal--of
 detention by local officials of Pulaar-speaking black
 Mauritanians living in the Senegal river valley. For example,
 three high school teachers were reportedly arrested and
 detained by gendarmerie in Bababe and eventually expelled to
 Senegal. There were numerous reports of intimidation,
 arrests, prolonged detention, and expulsion centering on
 security forces in Kaedi and Rosso.
 AI also reported that a number of Pulaar-speaking black
 Mauritanian civil servants, including Oumir Tall, Amidou
 Tidiane Ly, Memkoudou Diop, Abdanlage Wane, were arrested and
 detained incommunicado in May 1989 in Nouakchott. These
 detainees were not charged with any offense, although
 unofficial sources suggested that they were held because of
 suspected involvement in movements opposed to the Government.
 
 
 221
 MAURITANIA
 In mid-November, there were widespread, credible reports of
 the arrest, detention, and possible torture of a number of
 Halpulaar teachers in the town of Kaedi. As many as 50
 persons may have been detained without being officially
 charged, and by year's end their status remained unresolved.
 Internal exile is a method of removing opposition figures from
 the public eye. - Former PresidentHaidalla and five of his
 associates, -who.were-arrested during the 1984 coup but never
 charged, reportedly still remain in internal exile in remote
 locations. There were credible reports of the detention and
 exile without charges-of several black Mauritanian civil
 servants and military personnel since May 1989. Many more
 were expelled to Senegal, in lieu of internal exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal Aystein functions primarily under the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) put in place during the Haidalla regime. The
 Ministry of Justice plays the major role in administering the
 Shari'a and selecting judicial personnel. The Shari'a. applies
 to most crimes and offenses, with the exception of commercial
 and banking offenses, trafficyiolations that cause bodily
 harm, end offenses against the security of the State. These
 three categories of offenses are all handled by the Special
 Court, which renders its judgments .on the basis of laws
 modeled-after-French law. The, Taya administration has urged
 the Islamic.judges not  o.use extreme physical punishments,
 such as amputations, ,hich occurred during the Haidalla
 regime. The Taya Government is slowly eliminating a number of
 unqualified Shari'a judges who were appointed during the
 Haidalla years. By virtue of a repent government decision,"
 judges cannot be tenured before 7 years of service.
 While trials in the ordinary courts are public, the State
 Security Court, which tries offenses against state security,
 may conduct secrettrials. All defendants, regardless of the
 court, have the right to be present with legal counsel during
 the proceedings. If necessary, the accused is provided
 counsel at public expense. Defendants may confront witnesses
 and present evidence. They may appeal the sentences of the
 ordinary courts but not those of the Security Court. While
 the judiciary is nominally independent, some knowledgable
 observers have claimed that judges take their cue from the
 Government when sentencing opponents of the regime.
 The right to a fair public trial in Mauritania was, by any
 standard, seyerely abused during 1989. After April, thousands
 of non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians,. particularly in
 the Halpulaar community, were expelled to Senegal without any
 recourse to judicial proceedings. Those expelled often had no
 advance warning of their expulsion and no time or opportunity
 to carry any possessions with them. According to reports from
 refugee camps in Senegal, many were forced across the frontier
 river at gunpoint.
 The Mauritanian Government contended that many, if not all, of
 the persons expelled were in fact of Senegalese'rationality,
 and that their Mauritanian identity documents were fraudulent.
 Even. if this were the case, an arbitrary determination of
 cnationality seems to have been made without according due
 process to those affected. Furthermore, the Mauritanian
 Government appears to have ignored its own law, which
 
 
 222
 MAUBIIAUIA
 specifies that all persons, including foreigners, have a right
 to the protection of their property and possessions and cannot
 be deprived of them except by a court decision. The
 widespread and credible reports of confiscation and
 destruction of identity papers by security forces indicated a
 conscious and concerted effort to circumvent the legal process.
 The number of political detainees and prisoners held at the
 end of 1989 was unknown. In December the Government released
 19 political prisoners, including the head of the outlawed
 Baathist Party arrested in 1988, and 18 non-Hassaniya-speaking
 black political activists convicted in October 1986 following
 antigovernment political agitation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In the past, government surveillance of individuals was
 generally limited to patrols on major highways and customs
 checkpoints, occasional nighttime inspections of vehicular
 traffic, and inspections of mail suspected of containing
 currency or prohibited items. Under Mauritanian law, the
 police require warrants to perform home searches.
 The right to privacy was severely abused in Mauritania after
 .April 1989. Expulsions of Pulaar-speaking black Mauritanians
 involved systematic entry of homes by security forces and
 forcible removal of families, without search warrants or any
 legal proceedings. These activities occurred predominantly in
 villages along the river, and thus it is unclear to what
 extent they were officially sanctioned by the Mauritanian
 Government, and to what extent they were the the work of
 overzealous local officials. After repeated diplomatic
 protests, the expulsions appeared to slow dramatically after
 mid-July, and there were reasons to believe that the
 Government was making efforts to control the situation.
 Nevertheless, there were continuing reports of government
 surveillance of suspected dissidents, as well as intimidation
 and harassment of Pulaar-speaking black Mauritanians in the
 Senegal River valley.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is restricted. While Mauritanians
 may criticize government policies in conversations with
 friends and relatives, they are somewhat more inhibited in
 speaking with foreigners. Military personnel are under tight
 surveillance, and expression of views that could be construed
 as even mildly critical of the Government is likely to result
 in close questioning by military security officers. The
 Government is quick to react to any public comments it thinks
 pose a threat to the security of the State. Many of those
 persons detained without a trial during 1989, including the
 five student strike leaders as well as many civil servants,
 were targets, it is believed, precisely because they voiced
 opposition to the current regime and its policies. In
 particular, the Government appeared to be sensitive to any
 expression of ethnic dissatisfaction or criticism of its
 ethnic policies.
 Mauritania's only daily newspaper and the radio and television
 stations are government owned and.operated. During the past 3
 years the Government has allowed a limited amount of
 
 
 discussion of government policies within the context of
 interviews with government officials. In early 1988, the
 Government authorized the publication-,of two privately owned
 monthly magazines, Mauritanie Demain and L'Evenement. These
 publications periodically carried articles on mildly
 controversial s.ial issues, but they refrained from any
 direct criti6ism of the Government.
 b. Feedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritanianlaw ricognizes the rights of assembly and
 association,* but since the 1978 doUp the Government has banned
 all politica-l-ovements and generally prohibited meetings of a
 political nature. Any formal grouping must be registered with
 the Mihister of Interior. The Government usually does not
 interfere with assemblies and associations as long as they
 avoid political activity.
 c. Freedo bf Religion
 Islam is the .official religion of Mauritania; virtually all
 -citizens are Muslim. Mauritanian Muslims are prohibited from
 entering non-Islamic-houses of worship and from converting to
 another religion. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and the
 construction of Christian churches and other non-Islamic
 houses of worship -require government permission. The ,Roman
 Catholic-community in.Mauritania has five churches which
 operate freely -as long as they restrict their services to
 resident foreigners.
 d. Feedoi df Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Traditionally, there have been few restrictions on movement
 within Mauritania, where nomadism has long been a way of
 life. Travelers, however, are subjected to routine police and
 customs checks along all major roads and at the country's
 international and domestic airports.. During the riots of
 April 1989, dusk-to-dawn curfews were-imposed in Nouakchott,
 Nouadhibou, and some other cities but were reduced and finally
 lifted as the situation ealmed. During the final months of
 1989, as cross-border incidents from Senegal increased,
 curfews were imposed in a number of villages in the Senegal
 river valley as well. Since 1985 Mauritanians no longer need
 an exit visa to travel abr.ad, although there were-reports of
 some persons being denied passports.
 During 1989 large numbers of Mauritanians had their
 citizenship effectively revoked and were subsequently expelled
 to Senegal. The revocations of citizenship, which may have
 involved as many as 50,000 people, appear in many cases to
 have been based entirely on ethnicity. Only non-Hassaniya-
 speaking Mauritanians, particularly Halpulaar and, to a much
 lesser degree, other black African ethnic groups, were
 affected. Many of these displaced persons were not accorded
 Senegales6 citizenship and thus in effect became stateless
 persons. At year's end, the Mauritanian Government had not
 taken specific steps to permit access to the courts by
 expellees who wished to obtain confirmation of their
 citizenship and right to return home. However, there was a
 small but indeterminate number of cases of acknowledged
 Mauritanians being allowed to return, apparently as a result
 of individual extrajudicial petitions or intervention by
 officials.
 
 
 224
 MAURITANIA
 As many as 80,000 displaced persons arrived in Mauritania from
 Senegal during April and May of 1989. While many of these
 were Mauritanian citizen repatriates, many others were
 Senegalese citizens of ethnic Maur origin. The arrival of
 these repatriates and refugees placed a heavy additional
 burden on the Mauritanian economy. Although hard pressed for
 resources, the Mauritanian Government made commendable and
 largely successful efforts to assist all those arriving from
 Senegal. The Government also permitted the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to establish temporary
 offices in Nouakchott to provide aid to displaced persons.
 There were no reports of refugees being returned forcibly to
 Senegal.
 As a result of the ongoing conflict in neighboring Western
 Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a small number
 of refugees from the Western Sahara have settled in Nouadhibou
 and other northqrn towns. They have been successfully
 absorbed into Mauritanian society.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Mauritania are unable democratically to change
 their government at the national level. All political power
 rests in the hands of the military regime. The Military
 Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) remains the "custodian
 of the nation's sovereignty," and all executive and
 legislative functions reside with it. Membership is limited
 to military officers who occupy ministerial positions or
 important military and security posts. The CMSN is
 predominantely comprised of Hassaniya-speaking Maurs, although
 members of other ethnic groups are members. However, non-Maur
 membership on the CMSN, as well as among those holding senior
 government or military positions, decreased in 1989 in the
 wake of ethnic tensions.
 In early January, the Government held elections in 164 rural
 communes. All Mauritanians, aged 21 years or older and
 residing in these localities, were entitled to vote, and the
 ballot was secret. In most localities, two or more slates of
 candidates competed for the electorate's vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Taya Government in the past has been generally responsive
 to human rights concerns. For example, it cooperated with the
 U.N. Human Rights Commission Working Group on slavery by
 allowing a representative to come to Mauritania to obtain
 information on this issue. In 1987 the Government permitted
 representatives of AI to visit Nouakchott for discussions on
 racial and ethnic tensions in Mauritania. In 1988 a
 delegation from the International Commission of Jurists and
 the Chairman of the African Jurists Association visited
 Mauritania to review human rights practices.
 As a result of President Taya's public support for basic human
 rights, the Mauritanian Human Rights League was formed in
 1986. The League, which is affiliated with the Paris-based
 International Federation of Human Rights, is staffed by
 volunteers who address such concerns as eradicating remaining
 vestiges of slavery, ensuring the uniform application of
 
 
 225
 MAURITANIA
 Shari'a law, promoting the status of women, and preventing
 abuses such as arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture. In
 1988, the League hosted the first conference on Maghrebian
 human rights.
 In the wake of the ethnic disturbances of 1989, the League
 experienced serious difficulties in its efforts to remain a
 viable and independent human rights organization. On May 3,
 1989, League Director Ghali Ould Abdel Hamid was arrested for
 "threatening state security" at Nouakchott airport after he
 publicly faulted the Governments of Senegal and Mauritania for
 failing to address ethnic problems. Ghali was released after
 34 hours of detention.
 In the-weeks following-Ghali's arrest, the League continued to
 speak out on the subject of human rights abuses, and on July
 21, 1989, issued a statement critical of government expulsions
 of non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritamians. The League
 continued to fape considerable pressure from the Government,
 however, and on July 31, 1989, issued a statement critical of
 AI's declaration condemning Mauritania's expulsions of its
 citizens.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 -Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the'
 divide between traditionally nomadic Arabic-speaking Maurs of
 the north and the sedentary black cultivators of the African
 south. The interaction of these two groups produces the
 complex cultural diversity as well as the ethnic tensions
 inherent in Mauritanian society. Historically, the
 Hassaniya-speaking white Maurs have dominated the political
 and economic system. Taken together, the Hassaniya-speaking
 black Maurs--members of the former slave caste--and
 Mauritania's non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks outnumber the white
 Maurs by a considerable majority. This racial majority is by
 no means cohesive, however, since black Maurs identify in many
 ways more closely with the white Maur population.
 Many non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians have long
 contended that since independence, white Maur domination in
 government, state enterprises, business, and religious
 institutions is a result of ethnic and linguistic
 discrimination. Their grievances--have included a reduction of
 the numbers of non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians at
 all levels of government, andthe increasing use of Hassaniya
 rather than Frenchin many sectors of Mauritanian government
 and business. _They-,have also pointed to the Government's new
 land reform law as a means to allow white and black Maurs to
 take control of fertile land in the Senegal river valley that
 had been traditionally the preserve of non-Hossaniya-speaking
 black Mauritanians. Recent movements of nomads into the
 Senegal river valley as a result of the decade-long drought in
 the north further exacerbated tensions.
 The violence in April that resulted in many deaths was in
 general more the result of an eruption of underlying ethnic
 tensions rather than an officially sanctioned government
 policy, but the expulsions of non-Hassaniya-speaking black
 Mauritanians that followed were largely orchestrated by
 Mauritanian security forces.
 Both white and black Maurs were resettled into the villages in
 the Senegal river valley from which Halpulaar residents were
 
 
 226
 MAURITANIA
 forcibly expelled. While many of those resettled were
 themselves refugees from Senegal, others had moved from
 northern Mauritania in search of richer farmlands. These
 resettlements have set the stage for future disputes over land
 tenure and a continuation of ethnic tensions in the Senegal
 river valley.
 Women in Mauritanian Muslim society are often limited to
 traditional roles, which may encompass considerable financial
 and civil autonomy, especially outside the few urban areas.
 The Government is encouraging the entry of women into the
 professions, government, and business. In late 1988, the Taya
 Government created a new Ministry of Women's Affairs, Arts,
 and Tourism, and appointed a woman as the first Minister. The
 Government has also been instrumental in opening up new
 opportunities for employment traditionally reserved for men,
 such as in hospital work. According to Mauritanian law, men
 and women must receive equal pay for equal work, and
 Mauritania's two largest employers, the civil service and the
 state mining company SNIM, respect this law. In smaller
 private enterprises, wages are often determined by informal
 bargaining, leading to sometimes significant discrepancies in
 what two persons are paid for the same work.
 While data are very limited, violence against women does not
 appear to be prevalent in Mauritania. Female genital
 mutilation (circumcision) is a widespread, traditional
 practice. The Government has taken no position nor issued any
 statements on violence against women or on genital
 mutilation. In some areas of southern Mauritania, the most
 extreme form of mutilation, infibulation, is practiced. Some
 evidence indicates that the incidence of female excision is
 diminishing in the modern, urbanized sector, and for an
 Islamic country, women are allowed a relatively great degree
 of freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish unions at the local and national
 level. There are currently 36 trade unions in the country.
 All, however, must be affiliates of the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM), by law the country's only central labor
 organization. The trade unions and the UTM elect.their
 leadership democratically, and they are free to determine
 their programs and policies, provided these avoid political
 issues. The UTM is an active member of the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike. In
 practice, however, the Government discourages strikes, and
 they rarely occur. Under Mauritanian law, tripartite
 arbitration committees, composed of union, business, and
 government representatives, may impose binding arbitration
 that automatically terminates any strike.
 In recent years, the UTM had been paralyzed by bitter
 factional disputes. In early 1989, elections and a national
 congress were held, and a new leadership moved quickly to
 revitalize the UTM. It did not, however, voice any opposition
 to the Government's dismissal of numerous non-Hassaniya-
 speaking black civil servants that occurred after April.
 
 
 227
 MAURITANIA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are free to organize workers without government or
 employer interference. According to the UTM, close to 90
 percent of industrial and commercial workers in Mauritania are
 members of unions. The laws providing worker's protection
 against antiunion discrimination are regularly enforced.
 Collective bargaining, notably to set wages, occurs informally
 between individual unions and employers but also involves the
 Government and the UTM. In addition, employees or employers
 may bring labor disputes to three-person labor courts that are
 overseen jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor.
 Labor leaders regard these courts as unbiased and effective.
 There are no export processing zones in Mauritania, and labor
 laws are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The subject of forced labor is tied to the vestiges of slavery
 which exist in home areas of Mauritania. Slavery was
 abolished officially only in 1980, and some persons whose
 ancestors had worked without pay for generations for a
 particular family still occupied positions of servitude in
 1989. This was due in part to the economic hardships they
 would have encountered if they had left. There were reports,
 however, that in some remote areas persons were sometimes held
 against their will and forced to perform unpaid labor. The
 authorities stop such practices when they come to their
 attention.,, The Taya regime is making a systematic effort to
 appoint members of the former slave caste to high government
 and military positions as a visible indication of the end of
 slavery.
 d. Minimum-Age for Employment of Children
 Education is not compulsory in Mauritania, but Mauritanian law
 specifies that no child may be employed before the age of 13
 in the agricultural sector without the permission of the
 Minister-of Labor, nor before the age of 15 in the
 nonagricultural sector. The law provides that employed
 children aged 14 through 16 should receive 70 percent of the
 minimum wage, and those from 17 through 18 should. receive 90
 percent of the minimum wage. In practice, much younger
 children in the countryside pursue herding, cultivation, and
 other significant labor in support of their families'
 traditional activities. Although there are no data available,
 child labor in the nonagricultural sector is not widespread.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In 1989 the guaranteed minimum wage,for adults was equivalent
 to roughly $70 per month. These wages barely enabled the
 average family to meet its minimum needs. The standard,
 nonagricultural workweek in Mauritania cannot exceed either 40
 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is paid
 at the following rates: 41-48 hours--115 percent; 49-54
 hours--140 percent; 55 plus hours--150 percent of the base
 wage. Reliable data on actual wage levels is scanty and
 unreliable. Enforcement of the labor laws, the responsibility
 of the Labor Inspectorate, Ministry of Labor, is limited by
 the shortage of qualified personnel.
