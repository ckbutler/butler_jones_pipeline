 ECUADOR
 Ecuador has been a functioning multiparty democracy since
 1979, when constitutional government was restored after seven
 years of military rule. Since the return to democracy, the
 Government has vigorously upheld the principles of
 representative rule and respect for civil liberties
 established in the Constitution, and international human
 rights organizations have praised Ecuador for its
 achievements. In 1984 Ecuador held national elections, the
 results of which were widely accepted as representative of the
 popular will.
 The President exercises control over the police through the
 Ministry of Government. Local human rights organizations have
 focused attention on reports of police and military brutality,
 on poor prison conditions, and on alleged violations of human
 rights of rural inhabitants and Indians involved in land
 disputes.
 Many problems which Ecuador confronts in maintaining uniformly
 high human rights standards are attributable to the society's
 relatively low level of economic development, scarce resource
 base, wide income inequities, and lack of education and
 training on the part of law enforcement officials.
 On March 27, 1984, in accordance with constitutional
 provisions, then-President Osvaldo Hurtado declared a state of
 emergency in Esmeraldas and Napo provinces in response to I
 major anti-government demonstrations which threatened
 Ecuador's strategic petroleum sector. The state of emergency
 lasted only 11 days, during which time a nightly curfew and
 restrictions on public assembly were in effect.
 Except for instances of mistreatment of detainees-and prison
 inmates, which the Government does not condone, there were no
 substantiated cases of major human rights violations in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1984 of killing for political
 motives. In March the Supreme Court declined to review its
 1983 decision absolving the police of responsibility for the
 deaths of two workers during an illegal factory occupation.
 Local human rights organizations have occasionally published
 accounts charging government complicity in the deaths of
 campesinos or Indians allegedly killed during land disputes.
 Official investigations into such incidents have failed to
 confirm the allegations.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of official abduction or disappearance were
 recorded during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and inhuman or degrading treatment are prohibited
 under Ecuadorean law and happen only rarely. Charges of
 police brutality have occasionally resulted in administrative
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 33

 ECUADOR
 or judicial action against the perpetrators. A press report
 in February that 21 Peruvian nationals had been arrested and
 tortured in the Ecuadorean city of Machala was denied by
 government officials of both countries. The June 1984 arrest
 for bank robbery of 14 members of the clandestine Alfaro Vive
 (AVC) terrorist group was followed by allegations of torture
 by the group's defense lawyer. In addition, the defense
 lawyer for another AVC member, arrested upon her voluntary
 repatriation from Costa Rica in August, charged publicly that
 she had been tortured while in custody and illegally
 extradited. Ecuadorean and Costa Rican government authorities
 have denied these charges, and local human rights groups have
 given little credence to the allegations.
 Limited economic resources account for the generally poor
 quality of prisons. Cells are frequently overcrowded and lack
 adequate ventilation, light, and sanitary facilities. Food
 quality is considered poor, and rehabilitation programs are
 nearly non-existent. Prison authorities punish inmates for
 disciplinary reasons. While contrary to government policy,
 beatings and solitary confinement do occur. Poor prison
 conditions occasionally provoke hunger strikes among the
 inmates. In practice, prisoners with money can pay officials
 to avoid punishment or obtain better living conditions. Some
 prisoners can qualify for such privileges as day passes,
 conjugal visits, and the right to establish a business within
 the prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Preventive detention is illegal, and the criminal code forbids
 isolated confinement for more than 24 hours and detention
 without charge for more than 48 hours. In some instances,
 however, people have been held beyond these time limits.
 Mayors and municipal council presidents are constitutionally
 empowered to grant habeas corpus. In practice, habeas corpus
 and bail are granted liberally, irrespective of the severity
 of the charges. Forced exile is not practiced.
 The judicial system suffers from a chronic case backlog,
 resulting frequently in prison stays of up to two years for
 detainees awaiting trial. It is reliably estimated that 70 to
 80 percent of the prison population has not yet been convicted
 of any crime. Much of the overcrowding of prisons is thus
 attributed to the large number of suspects awaiting trial.
 Time spent in prison awaiting trial counts toward completion
 of the final sentence. Some long-term detainees have
 eventually been found innocent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have the right to counsel, to face their accusers,
 to refrain from testifying against themselves, and to appeal
 their sentences to intermediate courts and to the Supreme
 Court. Although a public defender system is mandated in the
 Constitution, this provision has never been implemented. The
 lawyers' associations of Guayaquil and Quito recently took
 steps to establish privately supported legal assistance
 programs.
 The National Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the
 power to impeach judges, fix the judicial branch budget, and
 ratify the Supreme Court's judicial review decisions. The
 Supreme Court appoints civil and criminal judges. Beginning
 
 
 505
 ECUADOR
 in September 1984 the judicial branch became the subject of a
 political clash between the Febres-Cordero administration and
 the opposition controlled legislature. The controversy
 centered on Congress' constitutional authority to shorten the
 Supreme Court's term of office and led to two courts--one old
 and one new--claiming constitutional legitimacy. The dispute
 was resolved in December when both courts resigned, allowing
 for the selection of a new court acceptable to both the
 executive branch and its congressional opposition.
 Judges play a central role in investigations as well as in
 deciding guilt or innocence. There is no trial by jury.
 Legal investigations as well as prosecutions are carried out
 by the Attorney General, Solicitor General, and provincial
 prosecutors. These judicial branch officials defend state
 interests in criminal and civil cases, receive complaints
 against judges, conduct fiscal inspections of lower courts,
 and provide often influential legal opinions to all court
 cases.
 Most judges and law enforcement officials are seriously
 underpaid and thereby susceptible to corruption. In addition
 they are hampered by an unmanageable backlog of cases and lack
 of technical and budgetary means to conduct thorough
 investigations. Several judicial branch spokesmen have
 complained that recourse to multiple levels of appeal has
 often resulted in excessive reversals of lower court
 convictions. The judiciary maintains its independence from
 the executive branch.
 The Autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, consisting
 of representatives of the Presidency, Congress, judiciary,
 municipalities, and business and labor sectors, may
 investigate charges of constitutional or human rights
 violations. The Tribunal reviewed and found constitutional
 the President's March 1984 decree of a state of emergency in
 Esmeraldas and Napo provinces. Military courts are empowered
 to try only those cases involving acts against military
 installations and infractions of military regulations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the sanctity of the home and privacy
 of correspondence. The law requires police to have a warrant
 before entering a home except in case of hot pursuit and, in
 most instances, legal requirements are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression,
 and this right is vigorously exercised in the Ecuadorean mass
 media, which is overwhelmingly privately owned and free from
 government control. Thirty-five newspapers, 9 television
 stations, and more than 450 radio stations, representing a
 wide range of political opinion, operate in Ecuador. There
 were no recorded instances of media censorship during the
 1983-84 national election campaign. In 1984 the Inter-
 American Press Association praised Ecuador for maintaining
 freedom of the press.
 
 
 506
 ECUADOR
 Despite this creditable record, the Ecuadorean criminal code
 prohibits written or oral statements which defame or demean
 public officials, governmental institutions, or national
 symbols. During the March 1984 state of emergency in
 Esmeraldas and Napo provinces, the Government temporarily shut
 down one radio station for attempting to broadcast a message
 by a local strike committee. During a series of civil
 disturbances in Guayaquil in October, the Government ordered
 four local radio stations closed because of anti-government
 statements. This order was rescinded after a few hours.
 During the same period, the mayor of Guayaquil was ordered
 jailed for four days for publicly insulting the President of
 the republic. This order was apparently never carried out.
 Citing, among other incidents, the firing of several newspaper
 and TV journalists, opposition groups have alleged that the
 government has used its political influence to attempt to
 limit anti-government media coverage.
 There is no political censorship of foreign or domestic books,
 films, or works of art, nor is there government interference
 with academic inquiry. In April 1984, however, several
 political and human rights groups accused the Government of
 suppressing the freedom of expression of political
 activist/writer Jaime Galarza, who was convicted of libel in
 connection with his 1982 book, "Who Killed Roldos?" (President
 Jaime Roldos died in an airplane crash in 1981.)
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to free assembly and association is established in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. Public rallies
 require prior consent from local governments, but this is
 routinely granted. During the March 1984 state of emergency
 in Esmeraldas and Napo provinces, a night-time curfew and
 restrictions on the right of public assembly were in effect.
 Labor organizations represent perhaps 15 percent of the
 country's economically active population. Organized into four
 major confederations and many independent unions, the labor
 movement reflects widely different political orientations.
 All private sector employees and government blue-collar
 workers enjoy the right to organize unions, bargain
 collectively, and strike. Government white-collar workers may
 not legally strike, and their labor organizations are not
 recognized by the Government as full-fledged unions with
 bargaining rights.
 The labor code provides for a considerable government role in
 the resolution of disputes between labor and management,
 especially through the Labor Ministry's conciliation
 tribunals. Trade union leaders are elected by the
 membership. The Constitution provides for formal labor
 participation in government through representation on the
 executive boards of several national institutions. The labor
 leadership meets regularly with the Labor Minister and other
 senior government officials to discuss ongoing sectoral
 problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion. All Ecuadoreans are free to practice the religion
 of their choice. Clergymen, by local law, may not become
 high-level elected or appointed government officials. Foreign
 missionaries of many faiths operate freely in Ecuador. Radio
 
 
 57
 ECUADOR
 HCJB, the Voice of the Andes, a U.S.-based evangelical
 broadcasting company in Ecuador, is a world-wide, multi-
 lingual shortwave radio service, which also broadcasts
 domestically on FM and medium wave.
 In November and December a controversy arose surrounding the
 activities of two Italian priests working with campesino
 groups in the politically active province of Esmeraldas. The
 provincial governor alleged that the priests were engaged in
 subversive activities. The Ecuadorean Episcopate defended the
 priests against these charges. As of year's end, the
 Government had not acted on demands by their opponents for the
 priests' deportation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ecuadoreans may travel freely at home or abroad. There is no
 discriminatory treatment of women or other groups with regard
 to travel, emigration, or repatriation. Individuals from
 other Latin American countries have readily found asylum in
 Ecuador. No cases of involuntary repatriation of persons
 fleeing political persecution were reported in 1984.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Ecuador is a functioning multiparty democracy, with 17
 registered political parties representing a wide political
 spectrum. Two communist parties of differing orientations are
 legally recognized. Ecuadoreans 18 years of age and over have
 the right to vote. Voting is mandatory for literates and
 voluntary for illiterates. Citizens lacking a valid reason
 for not voting are subject to legal sanctions, although these
 are seldom imposed. Political participation and suffrage are
 open to all citizens without discrimination as to sex, ethnic
 group, or socioeconomic status. All citizens have the right
 to form and join political parties. Groups not fulfilling
 party certification requirements, which include obtaining a
 minimum number of signatures of previously unaffiliated
 voters, are not entitled to field candidates.
 Ecuador held national elections in January and May 1984, in
 which the President, Vice-President, all 71 Deputies to the
 National Congress, and almost 700 provincial and local
 elective officials were chosen. The election campaign was
 vigorously contested by the 17 parties, which fielded 9
 presidential candidates. Almost 79 percent of Ecuador's 3.8
 million voters participated in the May 1984 runoff balloting
 between the top two presidential contenders. On balance the
 elections took place in an open and fair manner. The first
 round of elections in January were marred by allegations of
 electoral fraud, by technical problems with the computerized
 voter registration system and the nationwide distribution of
 ballots, and by sporadic violence involving the supporters of
 one or another candidate. Legal challenges stemming from the
 fraud charges were taken before the Supreme Electoral Tribunal
 and, on appeal, to the Ecuadorean Supreme Court, where they
 were ultimately dismissed.
 The August 10 inauguration of President Leon Febres-Cordero
 marked the first peaceful transfer of power in Ecuador from
 one democratically elected government to another in 24 years.

 ECUADOR
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an open and constructive approach to
 international human rights issues. An Ecuadorean is a member
 of the Human Rights Committee of the U.N. Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights and the U.N. Committee on the Elimination
 of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In May 1984 Ecuador
 proposed that the United Nations issue a yearly report on
 respect for human rights in all countries rather than in a
 selected few, thus showing its support for increased
 international scrutiny of human rights performance. In July
 1984 Ecuador accepted, subject to certain reservations, the
 optional jurisdictions of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission and Court, and the U.N. Human Rights Commission, as
 stated in Articles 45 and 62 of the American Convention on
 Human Rights and Article 41 of the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights, respectively.' During the 1984
 U.N. General Assembly session, Ecuador co-sponsored
 resolutions seeking to improve the rights of migrant workers
 and their families, and opposing summary and arbitrary
 executions.
 No international organization or human rights group has
 seriously questioned the human rights performance of the
 Ecuadorean Government, and domestic human rights bodies have
 been free to investigate human rights practices within the
 country. Freedom House's 1984 report places Ecuador in the
 category of "free' countries; Amnesty International has not
 reported on Ecuador in recent years. Representatives of the
 International Labor Organization's regional office in Lima
 travel regularly to Ecuador in order to consult with
 government officials on labor policies and programs.
 Among the many human rights organizations based in Ecuador are
 Amnesty International, which in 1984 re-opened its Ecuador
 office after several years' inactivity. The regional Latin
 American Human Rights Association (ALDHU) is headquartered in
 Quito. Locally active human rights organizations include the
 Catholic Church-based Ecumenical Human Rights Commission and
 the National Human Rights Commission. In June 1984 the
 Government established an inter-institutional commission,
 composed of Ministry of Government officials and
 representatives of private human rights groups, to accept and
 investigate specific allegations of human rights violations.
 The commission did not meet during 1984. However, individual
 representatives of human rights groups did occasionally meet
 with Ministry of Government officials to discuss human rights
 concerns. In November 1984, the Ecuadorean Congress created a
 human rights subcommittee to study and hear testimony on
 complaints of human rights violations stemming from civil
 disturbances the previous month in Guayaquil, and poor prison
 conditions nationwide.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ecuador's population of 8,648,000 is divided nearly equally
 between urban and rural residents. After a 3.4 percent yearly
 growth rate during the 1962-74 period, the country's
 population is now increasing annually by only 2.7 percent.
 The economy is mixed, with the private sector contributing 60
 percent of the nation's production. Key sectors, such as
 petroleum, telecommunications, and much of the aviation and
 energy industries, are under government control. The economy
 
 
 509
 ECUADOR
 has been stagnant since the end of the petroleum boom of the
 1970's. In 1983 world recession and the destructive effects
 of the *El Nino* weather phenomenon contributed to a 3.3
 percent negative growth rate and to an inflation rate of 48
 percent.
 The World Bank calculated Ecuador's per capita Gross National
 Product in 1982 at $1352. However, the 1983 downturn may have
 increased the percentage of Ecuadoreans living below the
 absolute poverty line, which in 1980 was 40 percent in urban
 areas and 65 percent in rural areas. Nineteen'eighty-four saw
 the beginnings of recovery, with economic growth rebounding to
 between 2.2 and 3.0 percent, and inflation reduced to 25.1
 percent. Although Ecuador lacks precise unemployment
 statistics, official and semi-official sources have calculated
 that open urban unemployment was 12 to 15 percent in 1983, and
 was probably reduced to the 8 to 11 percent range in 1984.
 Underemployment remains a persistent problem, with at least 50
 percent of the work force employed only part-time or
 temporarily. Despite a legal prohibition on child labor under
 age 12, the National Development Council (CONADE) estimates
 that 11 percent of urban children and 62 percent of rural
 children are part of the active work force.
 Considerable strides have been made during the past decade,
 and especially under the 1979-84 National Development Plan, in
 the areas of health and education. The World Bank calculates
 that in 1984 the average life expectancy at birth was 63.28
 years and the infant mortality rate was 74.10 per 1000. The
 caloric supply in 1977 was reported to be 91.88 percent of
 nutritional requirements. Nonetheless, the Ecuadorean Center
 for Population Studies and Responsible Parenthood estimates
 that 40 percent of preschool children and about 90 percent of
 the rural population suffer from malnutrition. Health care is
 improving owing to expanded delivery systems and an increased
 number of doctors. However, many facilities continue to lack
 adequate numbers of trained personnel and modern equipment.
 In October the Government sponsored a nationwide inoculation
 campaign against major childhood diseases, during which
 200,000 children under age five were inoculated. According to
 the World Bank, 42 percent of the population in 1977 (84
 percent in the cities and 13 percent in the countryside) had
 access to potable water. The Febres-Cordero administration
 has focused particular attention on fulfillment of the
 President's electoral campaign promise to provide more 'bread,
 housing, and employment." Housing represents an area of
 immediate concern. Although the average household size has
 dropped from 5.0 to 4.1 from 1974 to the present, the overall
 housing deficit is estimated at one million.
 World Bank statistics on education in its 1974 report revealed
 an adult illiteracy rate of 25.8 percent, of which the urban
 rate was 9.7 percent and the rural rate was 38.2 percent.
 Male illiteracy was 21.8 percent while female illiteracy was
 29.6 percent. According to statistics provided by the
 National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC), the
 illiteracy rate was reduced in 1983 to 14.5 percent (7.8
 percent in urban areas and 21.5 percent in rural areas). The
 primary school enrollment ratio in 1979, as calculated by the
 World Bank, was 115.36, with a male ratio of 117.42 and a
 female ratio of 113.26. USAID estimates that some 30 percent
 of school-age children in rural areas do not attend school.
 The low quality of public education at all levels is cause for
 serious concern on the part of government officials.
 
 
 510
 ECUADOR
 The Ecuadorean Constitution establishes complete legal
 equality for men and women. However, owing to the female's
 traditional role in Latin American societies, there are few
 highly placed women in the political structure. Fewer than 15
 percent of the candidates for elective office in 1984 were
 female. Three of the 71 congressional deputies elected in
 1984 were women; none served in the previous congress except
 as alternates. Several deputies are also of Indian or mixed
 ethnic origin. One of Ecuador's leading female political
 figures heads the Alfarist Radical Front political party.
 Several women, including a provincial governor and two vice
 ministers, serve in prominent positions in the present
 Government. By contrast, despite considerable progress in
 recent years, women suffer some discrimination under civil
 law. In divorce matters and in the right of inheritance, the
 male continues to enjoy preferential status as head of
 household.
