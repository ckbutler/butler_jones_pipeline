 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
 FRELIMO (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique) is
 now the sole political party. Both the Party and the
 Government have stated they subscribe to the principles of
 Marxism-Leninism. Civil and political liberties are
 considerably circumscribed. The Department of State is
 not aware of any credible allegations of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading punishment. The Government is seeking to
 develop a uniform system of justice for the entire
 country. Some progress has been made towards meeting
 the basic needs of the population, especially in the
 fields of nutrition, education and health.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture being practiced
 or countenanced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 While there are occasional allegations by former prisoners
 of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
 none has been substantiated.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Detention without trial is frequently practiced, ostensi-
 bly for purposes of rehabilitation and political "reeduca-
 tion". The Mozambican Government has not revealed how
 many persons are held in detention throughout the country,
 but the total number appears to be considerable. This
 includes common criminals as well as political dissidents
 accused of conduct harmful to.Mozambique's security or
 (127)
 
 
 128
 those guilty of anti-social behavior or crimes against
 economic development. Detainees often serve indetermi-
 nate sentences in reeducation centers and are released
 when the Government decides that they are ready to be
 reintegrated into society. A few former detainees have
 been given Government jobs upon their release.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique lacks a formal or well-developed legal
 system. Some courts are still operating under codes
 dating from the colonial era, while "people's courts"
 are being instituted in rural areas. The Government has
 launched a major campaign to establish a nationwide
 system of people's courts and to codify legal procedures,
 but this effort may take some time to complete. In
 many cases, persons accused of a crime are tried and
 sentenced by a state security official and do not have
 recourse to a public trial. It is impossible for the
 accused to retain private legal counsel since the
 private practice of law was abolished in 1975.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected, except
 when officials believe that there may be a threat to
 the security of the state.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The Mozambican Government has dedicated itself to
 meeting the basic needs of its citizens for housing,
 health care, food and education. In addition to
 constructing new housing, it has sought to rationalize
 the distribution of rental housing under Government
 control. The Government has successfully vaccinated
 most of the population against contagious diseases,
 and an ambitious program to eliminate illiteracy
 was begun in early 1978.
 Food production by state farms, communal villages
 and private farms is given the highest priority, but
 
 
 129
 the departure of most trained Portuguese after
 independence, the effects of the war in Rhodesia,
 floods, drought and lack of seeds and fertilizer
 have hampered attempts to restore production to
 pre-independence levels. Imports of wheat and rice
 are subsidized to keep basic food prices down.
 Mozambique has a strict wage policy to dampen inflation.
 Its tax system is not regressive or confiscatory.
 Corruption is not a significant problem; when cases
 are discovered in or out of government, the perpetrators
 are disciplined.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Criticism may be voiced within FRELIMO. However,
 public criticism of the party and its policies is not
 allowed. Persons who publicly criticize the Government
 or its policies may be sent to reeducation centers
 for political education. The media in Mozambique are
 government-controlled and are not accessible to those
 who might wish to question basic government policies.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution,
 but there has been some repression and harassment of
 foreign missionaries and certain proselytizing sects
 whose activities were seen as politically or ideo-
 logically threatening. Most foreign missionaries
 have now left Mozambique. Churches are not allowed to
 operate schools or hospitals. Party publications
 frequently call religion one of the undesirable
 heritages of colonialism.
 Freedom of assembly is limited by the one-party
 system. Independent trade unions no longer exist. The
 Government and party have emphasized the creation of
 quasi-official workers' assemblies, production councils
 and so-called "dynamizing groups" at industrial and
 commercial establishments to resolve the problems of
 labor and management. The right to strike is not
 
 
 130
 recognized.
 The Government has actively encouraged the creation
 of women's groups and the media report widely the
 activities of the Organization of Mozambican Women.
 The emancipation of women is considered a prime
 objective of the Party and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Movement
 There is freedom of movement within the country except
 in some combat-affected areas adjacent to the Rhodesian
 border. In the past year it has become easier for
 non-citizens to visit the more remote parts of the
 country. The right of emigration has been maintained
 for non-citizens resident in Mozambique but there are
 strict restrictions on the removal of money and property
 Foreign travel and emigration by Mozambicans are
 permitted only at the discretion of the Government.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 Mozambique is a one-party state controlled by FRELIMO.
 The party has adopted principles of Marxism-Leninism.
 There is universal suffrage, but all competition among
 candidates takes place within the FRELIMO party structure.
 There is substantial opportunity for intra-party
 debate, and ordinary citiens are encouraged to make
 their views known to officials. At the local level
 there are spirited contests for elective office.
 Election to national office is indirect and undertaken
 by district and provincial assemblies. Opposition
 political movements are not permitted.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No outside investigations of human rights are known
 to have been carried out in Mozambique or requested
 by international organizations. During the past
 year, Mozambique has permitted foreign journalists to
 tour the country extensively. A few have visited
 reeducation centers. An American journalist has
 reported that conditions in the center he visited
 were spartan and harsh, but not degrading or cruel. He
 added that political reeducation and vocational training
 
 
 131
 to prepare the detainees for reintegration into Mozam-
 bican society were emphasized in the daily routine.
 Visiting journalists have indicated that while there
 are restrictions on civil and political freedoms in
 Mozambique, the nation has made genuine efforts to meet
 the vital needs of the people.
