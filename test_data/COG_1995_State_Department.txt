 CONGO
 The Republic of Congo continues to progress in its transition to democratic gov-
 ernment. Pascal Lissouba became the first President in 1992; elections for the
 multiparty legislature followed in 1993. The Government continued to build upon
 the stable foundation provided by the Libreville Peace Accords, which ended a pe-
 riod of violent civil unrest in 1993 and early 1994. The Government also continued
 to devolve power to regions and municipalities. The judiciary is independent.
 The national police and gendarmerie maintain internal security. The army and
 the border guard are responsible for external security but also have domestic secu-
 rity responsibilities. While the civilian authorities generally maintain effective con-
 trol of the security forces, some members of the security forces committed human
 rights abuses.
 Congo is a very poor country. The economy depends heavily upon petroleum reve-
 nues and external capital, and the country has one of the highest pr capita levels
 of debt in the world. Annual per capita gross national product is $650; economic con-
 ditions began to stabilize in 1995. In the face of these difficulties, the Government
 made some progress in the implementation of structural adjustment measures and
 free market policies.
 The Government's human rights record improved, although serious problems re-
 main in certain areas. Members of the security forces were implicated in instances
 of extrajudicial killing. Security force members continued to use torture and rape
 and to abuse detainees. Prison conditions remain deplorable, and there were iso-
 lated instances of criminality by members of the security forces and private militias.
 Societal discrimination and violence against women are problems. Exploitation of
 Pygmies in remote areas by Bantu farmers persisted. Although the law contains
 strong worker rights provisions, on two separate occasions the Government chal-
 lenged union efforts to protest economic conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In June members of the security
 forces tortured to death a prisoner in a Pointe-Noire police station holding cell. The
 chief of police was arrested upon allegations that he had ordered his agents to tor-
 ture a detainee to extract a confession. At year's end, the police officer remained
 under arrest and had not been brought to trial.
 Members of the security forces and private militias continued to be implicated in
 increasing crime against civilians. At least several deaths were related to this crimi-
 nality.
 The Government continued its efforts to curb abuses by the security forces. It
 made progress in its plan to recreate the gendarmerie, which was dissolved 20 years
 ago; over 400 gendarmes completed training. The integration of private militias into
 the formal security structure continued to be an important part of this process.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Deading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and "cruel, inhuman, or degrading"
 treatment. However, there continued to be credible reports of torture and rape by
 members of the security forces. Army, police, and customs officials continued to
 abuse detainees physically, both to extract information and as punishment. The
 Government attempted to identify and punish the perpetrators of such abuses, in-
 cluding the head of a police station who was imprisoned following the torture death
 in June of a prisoner in a Pointe-Noire holding cell (see Section L.a.).
 Efforts to identify and prosecute those responsible for abuses in prior years con-
 tinued with some success. A Brazzaville court imposed death sentences upon five
 security force members convicted of murder, rape, and robbery.
 Prison conditions are dire and life threatening. The death rate and the incidence
 of disease and malnutrition are considerably higher than among the general popu-
 lation. Buildings are dilapidated, security is lax, and food and medical care are inad-
 equate. Most prisons, built during French colonial rule, were not designed for long-
 term incarceration. Dozens of prisoners are often kept in overcrowded cells for long
 periods of time, sleeping on the floor and subsisting on one meal per day. Although
 men, women, and children are imprisoned in separate areas, rape and sexual abuse
 
 
 of women and children by guards and fellow prisoners is commonplace. The Govern-
 ment endeavored to improve conditions in Brazzaville prison, but progress stalled
 with the death of a Catholic missionary who had been central to the effort.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile. While the Code of Penal Procedure requires that a detainee
 be apprehended openly and have a lawyer.present during initial questioning, police
 often ignored these requirements. According to the Code, the prosecutors office
 must issue warrants, and the authorities must bring detainees before a judge within
 3 days and charge or release them within 4 months. The authorities often fail to
 enforce these requirements as well.
 Lawyers have free access to their imprisoned clients. Over half of all persons in
 custody are pretrial detainees-70 percent at the central prison in Brazzaville. The
 Ministry of Justice estimates that the average detention is less than 6 months. The
 Penal Code provides defendants with the right of representation by lawyers of their
 choice. However, while the State must pay legal fees for the indigent, the authori-
 ties do not enforce these provisions in practice.
 Political exile is not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and this is observed in practice. The institutions are gradually being legally
 constituted and commencing operations. The judicial system consists primarily of
 local courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. In rural areas, traditional
 courts continue to handle many local disputes, especially property and probate
 cases. Many domestic disputes are adjudicated under traditional law and within the
 extended family.
 Some cases never reach the court system, however. For example, it is common
 practice for citizens to beat thieves caught in the act, sometimes to death. In gen-
 eral, defendants are tried in a public court of law presided over by a state-appointed
 magistrate. The defense has access to, and the right to counter, prosecution evidence
 and testimony. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to appeal. The
 judiciary is overburdened with a caseload that far exceeds its capacity to ensure
 fair, public trials. However, there are credible reports of prisoners languishing in
 jal-sometimes for years--because of lost files, oversights, and bureaucratic inertia.
 Supreme Court justices are appointed for life; lower court justices may serve until
 age 65. There were no known cases of termination or transfer of a judge for political
 aesons.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Prvacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and tele-
 ommunications. Official searhes of private properties and communications require
 a warrant, but in practice warrants are not uniformly served. There is a widespread
 belief that the Government continues to monitor telephones.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seech and Press.-The 1992 Constitutionprovids for freedom of
 expression and calls for the establishment of a special council to oversee private and
 electronic media and to safeguard speech and press freedoms. The lower house of
 the National Assembly approved a press bill in September which defines the rights
 and responsibilities of journalists and which outlines the procedures to be followed
 to establish private radio and television broadcasting stations. By year's end, the
 upper house tad not acted on the bill. If the bill is adopted, a special council will
 be established.
 The Government, however, retains monopoly power over radio and television
 pending the establishment of private broadcast media. While there were instances
 in which journalists from the moderately influential independent press were con-
 victed of libel, the Government tolerated extreme criticism by private newspaper.
 There were no known abridgements of academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. In practice, any group wishing to hold a public
 assembly must inform the Minister of Interior, who reserves the right to forbid as-
 semblies which in the Government's view threaten public order. The Minister of the
 Interior, claiming a threat to public order, denied a request by one labor union to
 protest nonpayment of salaries and imposed a ban on demonstrations surrounding
 the National Day celebrations. There are no restrictions on trade associations or
 professional bodies, and affiliation with international bodies is permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-eThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of all citizens to circulate freely
 
 
 63
 within Congo, and it specifically prohibits roadblocks and barriers. Nonetheless,
 military forces, political militias, and opportunists sometimes hindered free move-
 ment with barricades-generally deman dingmoney.
 The National Conference Charter of Rights gives all citizens the right to travel
 abroad and return. At year's end, Congo hosted some 13,500 refugees, the majority
 of whom were Angolans from the Cabinda enclave. Refugees are registered wita the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Development
 Program, and the Government and are allowed to work and to establish residency.
 They may apply for citizenship after 10 years of continuous residence. There were
 no known cases of forced repatriation or deportation of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for popular election of the President and National As-
 sembly.
 The President was elected in 1992 and the National Assembly in 1993. The oppo-
 sition disputed the legislative elections, claiming that the results were fraudulent.
 Following the signing of the Libreville Peace Accords in January 1994, an inter-
 national panel of jurists rejected all but 9 of 58 accusations of election fraud. Runoff
 elections in 1995 resolved seven of the nine disputed districts. Two contests remain
 undecided. In one case the candidate withdrew from the vote-counting, and in the
 other no agreement was reached on the electoral list.
 The Constitution divides power between the presidency and a government headed
 by a Prime Minister and formed with the approval of the National Assembly. The
 Constitution provides for 5-year terms of office for the President and National As-
 sembly Deputies, all elected by universal suffrage, and 6-year terms for senators,
 who are chosen by local councils. International monitors observed the last several
 rounds of legislative elections and have found them to be free and fair.
 The President sought to create a reresentative government by ap poinintg mem-
 bers of each geographical region in the Cabinet. Women occupy 4 of the 28 cabinet
 posts. There are no gal restrictions on representation by women or minority popu-
 lations, although indigenous Pygmies living in remote regions are largely excluded
 from the political process (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Houman Rights
 Several local human rights organizations remained active and operated without
 restriction. These included the  national Committee on Human Rigts, the Congo-
 lese Human Rights League, and the Committee of the Congolese Association of
 Women Lawyers. All freely criticized government human rights violations as well
 as abusive and discriminatory aspects of some traditional local customs.
 The Government permits international nongovernmental human rights organiza-
 tions to operate freely. Several visited in 1995.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically forbids such discrimination, but it persists in fact,
 particularly against women and Pygmies.
 Women.-Vi olence against women occurs frequently and is reportedly on the rise
 due to worsening economic conditions. Rapes occur with increased frequency, accord-
 ing to press reports and women's groups. Wife beatings are handled within the ex-
 tended family. Only in extreme instances of abuse do the police intervene or do the
 courts prosecute these cases. The general population and the media largely ignore
 the issue of violence against women.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens, specifically prohibits dis-
 crimination based on sex, and specifically endorses the right of women to earn equal
 pay for equal work. In practice, discrimination against women is widespread.
 Marriage and familylaws overtly discriminate against women. For example, adul-
 tery is illegal for women but not for men. Polygyny is legal; polyandry is not. While
 the Legal Code provides that 30 percent of an inheritance goes to the wife, in prac-
 tice the wife generally loses all rights to the property.
 Women in rural areas are especially disadvantaged in terms of education and
 wage employment and are confined largely to family farm  work, petty commerce,
 and childrearing responsibilities.
 While inequities persist in salaries, employment opportunities, and access to edu-
 cation, educated women are making some limited progress in professional employ-
 ment. The government Ministry for the Integration of Women into Development is
 working with a number of nongovernmental organizations to educate women as to
 their rights and to reform the legal code.
 
 
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government must protect children in
 accordance with international conventions. Child labor is illegal, and education is
 mandatory until age 16. In practice, limited state resources prevent public action
 toward achievement of these objectives, particularly in rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides for "specific measures of pro-
 tection in relation to their needs." In practice this means very little, although the
 Government has provided special education to some disabled students and hand-
 powered tricycles to some polio victims. The ministry charged with the welfare of
 the disabled has severe financial constraints. The country has not implemented laws
 mandating access for people with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution provides the same rights for Pygmies, an
 ethnic minority numbering approximately 7,000 and living primarily in the northern
 forest regions, as it does for other citizens. In practice-in a society where Bantu
 Congolese predominate in every respect-they do not enjoy equal treatment. Pygmy
 workers are generaly underpaid for their work relative to others, with compensa-
 tion often being in the form of clothing, food, or other goods instead of wages. This
 practice has its roots in the ancestral tradition of Pygmy slavery maintained by
 Bantus. Pygmies are no longer denied access to public education, health, or other
 basic services, nor denied the right to own property. Pygmies have been tradition-
 ally excluded from the political process, and they have little ability to influence gov-
 ernment decisions affecting their interests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and the Labor Code affirm the
 right to associate freely, allowing no restriction on the formation of trade unions.
 Nearly all workers in the formal (wage) sector are union members, and unions have
 made efforts to organize informal sectors such as agricultural and retail. The Con-
 stitution prohibits members of the security forces from formingunions or striking.
 Unions are free to strike but must file a letter of intent with the Ministry of Labor
 beforehand, thereby starting a process of arbitration. In theory, a strike may not
 take place until both parties have submitted to a process of nonbinding arbitration
 under the auspices of a regional labor inspector from the Labor Ministry. The letter
 of intent must include the strike date, at which time the strike may legally begin
 even if arbitration is not complete. Employers have the right to fire workers if they
 give no advance notification of a strike, In practice, the Ministry seldom enforces
 this aspect of the Labor Code, and workers have initiated many strikes without
 prior attempts to resolve disputes through arbitration.
 In January and February, civil servants prtested wage cuts and delays in salary
 payments in strikes conducted in Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire. The Government
 temporarily detained the leaders of the opposition Union Confederation of Congolese
 Warkers (CSTC) for inciting violence. In July the Government evicted the CSTC
 from a government-owned office and confiscated the union's papers. After an unsuc-
 cessful attempt to prevent one CSTC demonstration in August, the Government
 forcibly prevented a second demonstration (see Section 2.b.).
 In March the president of the taxi and cabdriver union in Brazzaville was de-
 tained briefly upon allegations that a strike was illegal. The strike was called to
 protest the conduct of traffic police and to demand road repairs.
 Unions are free to join or form new federations or confederations. There are six
 indendent union confederations, all formally recognized by the State. They are d-
 pendit on the voluntary contributions of their membership.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions. Some trade unions
 have signed cooperative accords with other African, European, and American trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Under the Constitution, em-
 ployers are prohibited from discriminating against employees who exercise their
 constitutional right to organize and join a union. There were no reported firings for
 union activities.
 With union attention absorbed by economic problems, and the Government in the
 midst of structural adjustment efforts, the National Assembly did not complete de-
 liberations on a revision of the Labor Code. Under the current Labor Code many
 benefits are legally mandated, and industry-specific wage scales ("conventions") are
 to be determined by negotiated agreement between umo n representatives, employ-
 ers, and the Ministry of Labor. In many sectors, the Code is not strictly followed,
 and unions may negotiate freely, either independently or in cooperation with other
 unions, federations, or confederations.
 There are no expert processing zones.
 c. Prohibition on Forced or CompJusoly Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there was no evidence of its practice in the formal economy.
 
 
 There were, however, allegations that Pygmies experienced exploitation (see Section
 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits chil-
 dren under the age of 16 from working. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for en-
 forcing child labor laws but concentrates its efforts only on the formal wage sector.
 Young children continued to work on small family subsistence farms in rural areas
 and in the informal sector in cities without government intervention.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a minimum wage about
 $47 (cfa 23,500) per month, a level which the Government claims allows for "human
 dignity." However, high urban prices and dependent extended families oblige many
 workers to seek opportunities beyond their main employment or to practice subsist-
 ence agriculture. This was particularly true for government workers, who were
 forced to cope with salary backlogs of several months and a 27.5 percent cut in sal-
 ary. In those trades still subject to conventions (see Section 6.b.), the negotiated
 minimum wages were without exception considerably higher than the legal mini-
 mum.
 The Constitution provides for not only reasonable pay, but also paid holidays,
 periodic paid vacation, and legal limits on allowable hours of work. The Labor Code
 stipulates that overtime must be paid for all work in excess of 40 hours per week
 and that regular days of leisure must be granted by employers. Although health and
 safety re lations require twice yearly visits by enforcement officers from the Min-
 istry of Labr, in practice such inspections occur on a much less regular basis. There
 is no specific regulation granting workers the right to remove themselves from haz-
 ardous situations without jeopardy to continued employment, but unions were gen-
 erally vigilant in calling attention to such situations.
