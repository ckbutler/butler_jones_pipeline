 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko, having ruled Zaire for 26 years,
 has molded a highly personalized and centralized governmental
 system. Until 1990 his Popular Movement of the Revolution
 (MPR) was the sole legal party, and all government institutions
 were considered its organs. Faced with rising popular
 dissatisfaction, he announced in April 1990 the beginning of
 democratic reform that would lead to a new constitution and
 three-party elections. However, opposition discontent
 continued and resulted in the President's acceptance-of less
 restricted pluralism. By the end of 1991, approximately 300
 political parties had registered. Many of the new parties, it
 was charged, were created at the instigation of the Government
 itself to divide the opposition.
 During this period, the opposition also pressured President
 Mobutu into accepting a National Conference (NC) which-
 following a series of postponements, was convened in August.'
 From the start, the NC was stymied by boycotts and by -
 widespread suspicion of delegate-rigging and rules-
 manipulation. In September an army mutiny and civil riots
 followed by countrywide disturbances exacerbated the sense of
 governmental crisis. Attempts to organize an opposition-led
 coalition government were aborted when President-Mobutu
 dismissed Prime Minister-designate Etienne Tshisekedi- The
 latter refused to acknowledge Mobutu's 1974 Constitution.
 Following the dissolution of a short-lived administration under
 Prime Minister Bernard Mungul Diaka, President Mobutu named
 Nguz A Karl-I-Bond Prime Minister. At year's end, serious
 doubt existed as to the ability of the Nguz Government to lead
 the country and about the willingness of President Mobutu tc-
 cooperate with opposition forces in so-ving, the governmentar
 crisis. The Natfonal Conference, which had been suspended,   -
 reconvened in December, but it is unclear to what extent it
 will be allowed to exercise sovereignty and chart the political
 future of Zaire.
 In addition to the armed security- forces (incruding "elite"
 units, such. as theoSpecial Presidential Division-DSP), security
 services- include the-National Service for Intelligence and
 Protection (SNIP), the Military Intelligence-and Security'
 Service (SARM). the Civil Guard. and the National Gendarmerie.
 The'Gendarmerie, while a branch of the military, is charged
 with providing basic police services in the absence of national
 or local police forces. Elements from virtually all of these
 forces engaged in looting-during the mutinies in September and
 October. As a result of. these incidents, there remained
 serious questions as t- what de facto- oc de 5ure chain of
 command existed within the armed-forces  All of these
 agencies, along wilh-the armed forces DSP, were employed to-
 quell internal- dissent and were responsible for- human rights
 abuses, including arbitrary. harassment-, physical mistreatment,
 and unauthorized detention. There are unconfirmed reports of a.
 secret, special operations force (see Section l.b.). While
 human rights guidelines were issued to the security forces in
 1990, there has been no discernible improvement in their
 observance of human rights.
 Zaire's mixed economy has been stagnant for an extended period
 owing to crumbling infrastructure, mismanagement, capital
 depletion in the state-owned corporations, and official
 corruption. In 1991 export earnings declined precipitously.
 The inflation rate at the end of the year was almost 4,000
 percent, and annual per capita income had fallen to less than
 $100. The September 23-24 riots included systematic looting
 
 
 438
 ZAIRE
 and ransacking of commercial and industrial sites, thus
 undermining investor confidence and resulting in the loss of at
 least 100,000 wage-paying jobs in the Kinshasa area alone.
 Human rights in Zaire remained seriously restricted in 1991.
 As in previous years, Zairians remained subject to arbitrary
 detention and physical mistreatment. The justice system was
 crippled by political interference, a shortage of trained
 personnel, and a prolonged magistrates' strike. Despite
 increased openness in the political dialog, politically
 motivated violence and harassment continued. In early
 September, Kinshasa party offices of two opposition parties,
 the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) and the
 Union of Federalists and Independent Republicans (UFERI), were
 attacked in separate incidents, resulting in loss of life,
 multiple injuries, and property damage. During the violence of
 September 23-24 and subsequent rioting in October, a large
 share of looting-and plundering was carried out by security
 forces. Although over 1,000 military pprsonnel and deserters
 were subsequently arrested by authorities, security personnel
 nonetheless have continued to victimize and dispossess private
 citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from-
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Zairian security forces have often employed excessive force in.
 responding to public demonstrations. Protests by the political
 opposition and others opposed to conditions in Zaire have
 frequently resulted in loss of life; the frequency of these
 incidents and the rarity of disciplinary action indicate that
 the use of excessive and lethal force is condoned by the
 authorities.
 Controversy continues to surround the University of Lubumbashi
 incident of May 1990, in which masked commandos assaulted
 students in a nighttime raid and inflicted an unknown number of
 deaths and injuries. The Government resisted an independent
 inquiry to determine the actual number of casualties or fully
 identify the perpetrators. The Government eventually
 acknowledged that one student had been killed (independent
 estimates vary widely, with some alleging over 100 deaths). As
 a result of the official government investigation, 15
 government officials were brought to trial in March 1991 on
 charges ranging from murder to failure to assist persons in
 danger. In May the Zairian Supreme Court handed down
 convictions for 10 of the 15, including the former governor of
 Shaba, Kogalialo Ngbase (sentenced to 15 years for murder),
 former regional commander Lokiyo (12 years), former
 documentation officer Uba (10 years), and former immigration
 officer" Gata (13 years). A student activist, Digekisa Piluka,
 was also tried in the same proceeding but escaped detention and
 fled to asylum in Belgium prior to his conviction and
 sentencing to 13 years and 6 months in prison. Despite these
 convictions, the extent of the involvement of security forces
 in the Lubumbashi attack has not been and may never be
 adequately addressed, leaving considerable question as to
 whether all those responsible have been brought to account.
 The United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) was
 
 
 439
 permitted to send an investigator to conduct a closely
 monitored 1-day inquiry. The UNHRC Report has not yet been
 released.
 Several additional incidents of violent suppression of protest
 or unrest occurred during 1991. In the Shaba region community
 of Luena, seven persons were killed and six wounded in a
 confrontation with gendarises on July 16. The victims had
 assembled at Gendarmerie headquarters to protest the arrest
 hours earlier of a member of the youthwing of UFERI. Although
 Gendarmerie officials later claimed to have fired into the
 crowd in self-defense and insisted they had been faced with a
 well-armed mob, these claims are widely disputed by credible
 observers.
 On September 2, Civil Guard troops and gendarmes responded with
 lethal force to disperse opposition party militants who had
 formed a march and blocked streets to protest stalemate at the
 National Conference. At least two persons were killed in the
 random gunfire employed by security forces. Gendarmerie troops
 also invaded a UDPS office on the same afternoon, wounding two
 persons, one fatally, in the ensuing melee.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearance in Zaire are frequent but,-by their
 nature, difficult to verify. .There is widespread belief among
 the Kinshasa population that security forces employ short-term
 abduction as a means to intimidate the population- Following.
 disturbances in Kinshasa, on December 3, 1990, human rights
 groups reported the disappearance of some 170 young activists
 who had taken part in the protests. While many of these were
 later released, as many as 50 were still in government custody
 in February 19%1 without having been: formally-charged.
 Similarly,, after the 1990 Lubumbashi assault. there were
 reports of missing students. Many of these students were
 subsequently accounted for. However. as the incident has never
 been adequately investigated to the satisfaction of independent
 observer, it has been impossible to ascertair whether any of
 the students, remain missing.
 The independent press, human rights observers,. and private
 citizens attributed mysterious disappearances during the year
 to a secret special operations force, allegedly formed within
 the security services, with the- mission of carrying out .
 abductions and other forms of intimidation. The existence of
 the unit, popularly known as -Les Hiboux" (the owrs--a name
 share& by a unit of the DSP)  has not been acknowledqed-by the
 Government in: any context or otherwise verified.
 a. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Zairian law, and its use is proscribed
 by official policy. However, it -is common for security
 personnel to employ beatinc and other forms of mistreatment in
 routine criminal interrogations. As noted above,
 disproportionate force is frequently-used to disperse public
 demonstrations. One of the most unusual'reports of cruel
 treatment in 1991 involved the use by security forces in April
 of an apparently modified water cannon to spray scalding water
 on demonstrators in the Limete district of Kinshasa. Doctors
 at Kinshasa Mama Yemo hospital reported dozens of admissions
 for water-burn treatment following the incident.
 
 
 440
 ZAIRE
 Private citizens continue to be beaten and robbed by security
 officials. Security personnel were reported to have taken
 advantage of a curfew imposed following the September 23-24
 disturbances to enter private homes and remove occupants'
 belongings. Reports of physical abuse and robbery by security
 personnel have persisted since the lifting of the curfew.
 Prisons in Zaire are primitive, ill-equipped, underfinanced,
 and overcrowded. Illness and malnutrition constitute the most
 immediate threat to the well-being of inmates! In July the
 national radio service broadcast a report indicating that
 prisoners in the Bandundu central prison had not been provided
 with food or medical care for the previous 2 months and that
 'many" had died as a result.
 The human rights organization Voice of the Voiceless (VSV), in
 a report issued in January, cited deteriorating conditions in
 prisons across the country as a cause of increased prisoner
 morbidity. VSV reported that, in a 2-week period during
 November 1990, 10 deaths were recorded in Makala prison in
 Kinshasa and 51 in Kassapa and Bolono prisons in Lubumbashi,
 mainly due to poor nutrition and primitive conditions. In May
 the Zairian League of Human Rights (LZDH) noted that Makala
 prison had been unable to provide food to prisoners for a
 period of 5 consecutive days during that month and alleged that
 .several" prisoners had died each day during the period. The
 LZDH report also cited the lack of medical treatment at Makala
 and reported that at least 42 prisoners were in urgent need of
 attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Zairian law, a warrant is not required for the arrest of
 a suspect for a crime punishable by more than 6 months
 imprisonment. Any law enforcement officer having the status of
 "judicial police officer" is empowered to authorize arrest.
 This status is vested in senior officers of each of the
 security services. The law also provides that arrestees must
 be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours for a hearing.
 If sufficient grounds for arrest are presented, the-magistrate
 may order continued detention for an initial period of 15 days,
 followed by renewable 30-day periods.
 In practice, these safeguards against arbitrary detention have
 not had a significant effect, and long periods of detention
 without recourse to due process or judicial review are common.
 Judicial oversight of detention centers is mandated by law but
 is largely nonexistent. This chronic shortcoming, due in part
 to a lack of personnel and material infrastructure, was
 exacerbated by a magistrates strike in May over inflation-
 ravaged wages and poor working conditions (see Section l.e.).
 National Security Council guidelines issued in 1990 to end
 unlalwful.and incommunicado detentions and the practice of
 internal exile await implementation and thus have had minimal
 impact on security force behavior. While military judicial
 procedures carry roughly the same legal safeguards as those
 provided for civilians, these too are frequently disregarded.
 Traditionally, persons detained for political reasons have been
 held by nonjudicial means such as administrative detention,
 house arrest, or internal exile. These cases are rarely
 brought to trial.
 
 
 441
 ZAIRE
 Long periods of incarceration without trial (or even charges
 being filed) are common for many detainees. In May the LZDH
 reported that it had identified 91 prisoners in Makala prison
 who had been held for 1 year or more without charge. In the
 same report, it cited 116 cases where inmates recommended for
 conditional release by the authorities nonetheless remained in
 prison.
 As many political detainees are held for only short periods, it
 is impossible to determine the actual number  of-political
 detainees or prisoners at any given moment. Although the
 National Security Council, in its 1990 reform declaration,
 acknowledged the existence of political detainees for the first
 time, the Government has never provided an accounting of the
 extent of the practice.
 Internal exile appears to be losin, favor as a means of
 detention--there were no known new cases in 1990 or 1991.
 Also, in mid-1991 former army chief of staff General Mukobo.
 Mudende was released from a 1987 banishment order restricting
 him to the remote village of Isangi.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is not independent of the executive branch and
 has been consistently responsive to priorities and objectives
 set by the Government and the Presidency.
 The capacity of the judicial system to deliver'fair and
 impartial justice in civil and criminal disputes has been
 further compromised by a lohgstanding pattern of corruption 'nd
 intimidation by central government authorities, especially in'
 politically sensitive cases and those-involving property-and
 labor disputes. These limitations of the system were
 compounded in 1991 by the magistrates' strike which placed the
 courts in a state of general paralysis, effectively eliminating
 them as an avenue of recourse for most citizens. Magistrates
 continued to perform duties in cases deemed important and
 operated a duty'officer system to provide minimal court
 functions but otherwise largely ceased to perform their
 duties. The strike ended in December, but the conditions
 giving rise to it remained largely unresolved at year's end-
 The Zairian legal system is based on Belgian and customary
 law. It includes the district courts, appellate courts in each
 region., the Supreme Court, and the Court of State Security.
 Whil e most cases are initiated-at the local 'level, charges of
 misconduct filed against "high officials" (e.g., ministers and
 governors - are taien directly to the Supreme Court.
 The- Constitution provides defendants with the right to a public
 trial and defense counsel. The right of appeal is provided in
 all cases except for national security, armed robbery, and-
 smuggling cases adjudicated by the Court of State Security.
 When a defendant is unable to afford his own lawyeL, the-Jaw'
 provides for court-appointed defense counsel at state expense
 in capital cases, all proceedings'before the Supreme Court, and
 other cases where requested by the court concerned. In
 practice, these guarantees are applied unevenly at best. Many
 defendants may never meet counsel or, if so. only after months
 of detention and interrogation. With only- 500 lawyers and 6a0
 magistrates in all of Zaire, the modern legal system is unable
 to-meet the country's judicial needs, even when functioning
 effectively. The majority of lega1 disputes in Zaire are,
 therefore, adjudicated by local administrative officials or
 
 
 442
 ZAIRE
 traditional authorities with predictably varying compliance
 with acceptable procedure. The-Ministry of Citizens' Rights
 and Liberties, created in 1986 to act as the ultimate guarantor
 of human rights in Zaire, had virtually no impact as a watchdog
 against human rights abuses and focused instead on industrial
 and property conflicts and civil disputes. It was absorbed by
 the Ministry of Justice in 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While the law requires security forces to have a warrant prior
 to searching a home, security forces in practice enter and
 search private homes at will. The privacy of homes and offices
 of political opposition leaders is routinely violated (see
 Section 2.b.).
 In the aftermath of the nationwide urban rioting and looting of
 late September-October 1991, security forces entered the homes
 of private citizens under the guise of seeking recovery of
 stolen goods and seized personal possessions for their own use.
 Although it is widely believed that Zairian security services
 open private mail and tap telephone conversations, these
 practices have not been documented.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights suffered serious setbacks in 1991. While the
 Constitution provides for the citizen's right to express
 opinions and feelings freely, these rights are subordinate to
 "public order and good conduct." Until the recent past, these
 limitations had a chilling effect on public discourse.
 Beginning in 1990, the limits of political dialog and debate
 expanded considerably. Although the broadcast media remained
 under government control, an energetic free press emerged in
 Kinshasa and, to a lesser extent; in other cities. Over a
 dozen independent newspapers in Kinshasa began aggressively
 reporting on national and international events.
 The sincerity of President Mobutu's commitment to democratic
 reform, his personal finances, governing style, and 26-year
 record in power were the frequent targets of scrutiny by the
 independent press. The views of opposition party leaders and
 democratic reformers were openly discussed and debated.
 The impact of an independent press, however, was largely
 limited to Kinshasa. Distribution to the interior is severely
 limited by transportation and other obstacles, and very few
 papers leave the city limits. Moreover, the security services
 blocked wider distribution in the interior, in some cases, by
 buying up any surplus copies which may have been available for
 distribution by air.
 The Government's tolerance of print medium independence
 diminished in 1991. There were serious incidents of harassment
 of editors and publishers, apparently with the intent of
 influencing treatment of the news through intimidation.
 Security forces vandalized the offices of several Kinshasa
 newspapers and detained and held for interrogation members of
 their staffs.
 
 
 443
 ZAIRE
 The most concerted intimidation effort was directed against
 editor Essolomwa Khoy and the staff of Elima, a Kinshama daily
 which was arguably the most professionally run-paper in the
 country and also a harsh critic of President Mobutu.
 Essolomwa, who had been arrested in 1990, was arrested again in
 May 1991 after having published an article critical of the
 conduct of the Zairian armed forces inRwanda. On October 16,
 uniform-clad persons ransacked Elima offices and started a
 fire. Essolomwa vowed to continue publishing, but on October
 27 the Elima press room was completely destroyed by a massive
 explosion of unexplained origin. In the aftermath, many
 smaller independent papers vanished temporarily because print
 shops did not want to risk servicing them.
 Radio and television, the only media which are c~pable of
 reaching nationwide audiences, remain under the control-of the
 Government. Nightly newscasts report government activities'in
 the most favorable light and, with some short-lived exceptions,
 assume a proregime and pro-Mobutu slant when reporting on
 controversial subjects. Perhaps in reaction to the
 liberalizing trends in the print sector early in the year. some
 individual broadcast journalists attempted to sway policy at
 the Office of Zairian Radio and Television (OZRT) toward more
 liberal treatment of the news. OZRT increased, albeit
 meagerly, its presentation of alternative views in radio and
 television broadcasts in 1991, broadcasting in July a two-part
 debate focused on the planned National Conference. During the
 aborted October effort to forge a coalition government, parties
 aligned against the MPR received increased coverage on nightly
 newscasts.
 In the confusion surrounding the foreclosing of negotiations
 for a coalition government, dissident telejournalists seized
 control of broadcast facilities in late October, apologized on
 the air for biased coverage, and demanded the resignation of
 the president of OZRT. For 1 day a standard videotape of the
 President, which normally opened and closed all news-
 broadcasts, was taken off the air. Authorities acted quickly
 to reassert control, however, temporarily replacing dissidents
 with military personnel and a few loyalist journalists willing
 to resume past broadcasting practices..
 Foreign journalists are permitted to operate in Zaire. In
 spite of the confused situation in Zaire since September 23,
 foreign journalists have been able to enter Zaire to report on
 the security and government crisis.
 The university system in Zaire was largely disfunctional in
 1991 due to-student unrest and the- Government's inability to
 pay faculty. The 1991 university year had not begun at year's
 end. While scholars continue to publish independent works,
 government tolerance of academic freedom was largely untested
 in 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful-Assembly and Association
 The right of the people to assemble peaceably has never been
 firmly established in Zaire. Nonetheless, in 1991 political
 movements were allowed sufficient freedom to build party
 organizations, hold rallies, and otherwise conduct their
 affairs in an open fashion. While less common than in the
 past, there continued to be incidents of harassment and
 violence perpetrated against independent groups, creating an
 atmosphere of uncertainty concerning the security of public and
 private gatherings. In September party offices of the UDPS and
 
 
 444
 ZAIRE
 UFERI parties were ransacked in two separate incidents.
 Security forces in the first case and MPR activists in the
 second appeared to have seized on the general urban unrest as
 an opportunity to assault and intimidate political opponents of
 the status quo.
 Zairian security forces are not trained to perform effective
 crowd control and often respond to unsanctioned gatherings
 (either organized or spontaneous) with unwarranted or
 disproportionate force as a preemptive measure or out of
 concern for their own well-being. On October 21, an orderly,
 peaceful march by 15,000 opposition supporters, expressing
 solidarity with embattled erstwhile Prime Minister-designate
 Etienne Tshisekedi, was subjected to a tear gas attack by
 security forces even though it posed no apparent threat to
 public safety. In the ensuing panic, several persons were
 injured, some seriously.
 President Mobutu's disestablishment of the MPR as the nation's
 sole legal political movement (with mandatory universal
 membership) has freed private organizations of some
 constraints, and they are now free to organize and conduct
 their affairs without political obligations being imposed upon
 them by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is recognized in the Constitution, but there
 are significant restrictions on some groups. The population is
 about 50 percent Catholic, 36 percent Protestant and
 Kimbanguist (a Zairian Christian church), and 5 percent Muslim.
 Indigenous beliefs and religious traditions are also strong.
 Officially recognized religions are free to establish places of
 worship and to train clergy, but the process for becoming
 officially recognized is fairly restrictive. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses and a number of other small religious groups and
 sects, banned in 1986 on charges of subversive activities or
 fraud, remained banned in 1991. Most recognized churches have
 external ties, and expatriates are allowed to proselytize.
 There is no legally favored church or religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry
 identity cards, and police and soldiers sometime set up
 checkpoints on major roads to inspect papers. While passports
 and exit permits are in principle available to all citizens,
 the Government has interfered with individual travel in the
 past by denying these documents.
 The Government has practiced a liberal asylum policy,
 permitting refugees and other displaced persons to enter freely
 and providing adequate land for refugee camps or resettlement.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 maintains a permanent office in Kinshasa and is the lead
 international agency on refugee affairs. There were no known
 incidents of forced repatriation of genuine refugees in 1991.
 Some 465,000 refugees and other displaced persons are currently
 in Zaire, including about 300,000 Angolans. The number of
 Sudanese refugees in the northeastern corner of Zaire rose from
 40,000 to over 110,000 in 1991 and was still growing, while the
 number of Burundis rose from 13,000 to 43,000.
 
 
 445
 ZAIRE
 Approximately 61,000 Zairians are registered as refugees in
 neighboring countries. An estimated 7,000 to 10,000 persons,
 many of them non-Zairian, fled from Zaire to the Congo during
 the September civil unrest. Would-be returnees are dealt with
 an a case by case basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens still did not have this right in 1991. However, moved
 in part by political reform efforts in neighboring countries,
 they signified their desire for change through demonstrations
 and support for the emerging opposition parties, notably the
 "Holy Union" alliance of several of the larger opposition
 parties such as UDPS, the Christian Social Democratic Party,
 and (for a time) UFERI. At year's end, President Mobutu,
 backed by the military and the MRP, still continued to control
 the Government, even though his power was ebbing in the face of
 the worsening economic crisis and continuing public and
 international demands for reform. In responding throughout the
 year, the President moved to control the pace of political
 reform, in part by splitting the opposition. In October, for
 example, at a crucial moment in the process he dismissed Prime
 Minister-designate and UDPS leader Etienne Tshisekedi, who had
 been charged with forming a government of national'unity, and
 instead nominated Bernard Mungul Diaka, the head of a small
 party with disputed opposition credentials. Mobutu resisted
 calls for a National Conference through the first half of the
 1991. Once the National Conference was under way, the
 Presidency, the MPR, and the United Democratic Front (FDU-a new
 Mobutuist political grouping) engaged in intensive
 behind-the-scenes efforts to exert'control over the process.
 Thus, at the end of 1991. while over 3a0 political parties had
 been formed and the President had promised freely contested
 elections for all offices, including the Presidency, it
 remained an open question whether this would actually occur.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several independent Zairian human rights organizations have
 been active since early 1990, including the Zairian League of
 Human Rights, the Voice of the Voiceless, and the Zairian
 Association for the Defense of Human Rights. All of these have
 been aggressive in reporting and documenting human rights
 abuses as well as in issuing reports on the Government's
 ability to provide the population with basic human needs
 (health care, education, etc.)- These organizations operate
 openly and have not been- subject to harassment despite the
 consistently critical tone of their reports.
 The Government has consistently rejected efforts by
 international and private human rights organizations to
 investigate individual cases of alleged human rights abuse.
 The refusal to permit an outside inquiry concerning the
 Lubumbashi incident of 1990, despite demands by the Government
 of Belgium, local officials, and others, is an example of the
 Government's willingness to endure international criticism
 rather than allow independent investigation. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintains a resident office
 in Kinshasa and monitors general conditions in Zairian
 prisons. At times, ICRC access to-prisons has been impeded by
 the Government.

 ZAIRE
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Zaire's diverse population of 34 million includes over 200
 separate ethnic groups. Four indigenous languages have been
 accorded official status, while French is the language of
 government, commerce, and education. The President has been
 careful to divide political offices among ethnic groups, but
 members of his own Ngbandi tribe are disproportionately
 represented at the highest levels of the security and
 intelligence services. In addition, the Special Presidential
 Division, the best equipped and trained element of the armed
 services, is overwhelmingly dominated by members of the
 President's ethnic group.
 Women occupy a secondary role in traditional Zairian life.
 They are the primary farm laborers and small traders while also
 exclusively responsible for childrearing. In the
 nontraditional sector, it is common for women to receive less
 pay for equal work while few can aspire to positions of high
 responsibility and salary. Women receive less education than
 men. A recent U.N. study indicates that females in Zaire
 receive only one-third of the schooling of males. While women
 are represented in the professions and civil service and have
 held cabinet positions in the past, it remains rare for a woman
 to occupy a position in which she would exercise authority over
 male professionals.
 Women are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission
 prior to engaging in routine legal transactions, such as
 selling or renting real estate, opening a bank account,
 accepting employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987
 revision to the family code does permit a widow to inherit her
 husband's property and provides some protection for a married
 woman's right to control her own property and receive a
 property settlement in the event of divorce.
 Neither the Government nor women's organizations have addressed
 the issue of domestic violence. This issue has also been
 ignored by the press and human rights groups, despite general
 acknowledgement that it occurs and indeed may be common.
 Female circumcision is not generally practiced in Zaire, but it
 is believed to occur to some bxtent among some isolated groups
 in northern Zaire.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Before 1990 the labor movement was limited by statute to the
 National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZa), which was an
 integral part of the MPR. After the President promised on
 April 24, 1990, to allow labor pluralism to coincide with the
 promised political liberalization, the UNTZa declared itself
 independent of the MPR and reorganized itself with new
 leadership chosen through elections which were deemed by most
 outside observers to be relatively free and fair.
 Several new labor organizations emerged in 1990-91, most of
 which are organized according to occupational groups. Some
 have antecedents in labor organizations which existed in the
 early years of Zaire's independence. While most have yet to
 receive official government recognition, several have already
 
 
 447
 ZAIRE
 had an impact in the workplace by employing various means
 (including wildcat strikes) to push for improvements in pay and
 conditions.
 The right to strike is recognized in Zairian law, but, because
 the law also provides for lengthy (and mandatory) arbitration
 and appeal procedures, legal strikes have been rare.
 Nonetheless, strikes have occurred. The most important strike
 in 1991 was the magistrates' strike and a civil service work
 stoppage. The civil servants' strike has since ended. While
 the Government has used force to put down strikes in the past,
 there were no attempts to coerce workers to return to their
 jobs in 1991.
 UNTZa participates actively in the continentwide official trade
 union body, the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and
 maintains ties with a number of foreign trade union  I
 organizations. The new unions are only beginning to explore
 establishing foreign labor ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Over the past several years, the UNTZa has negotiated nearly
 1,000 collective bargaining agreements. Under an existing
 arrangement between the UNTZa and the Zairian Employers
 Association (ANEZA), wages and prices have been fixed jointly
 on an annual basis with only minimal government supervision.
 This system, which had functioned fairly well prior to 1991,
 broke down as a result of the rapidly depreciating purchasing
 power of Zaire's national currency and at year's end had not
 yet been replaced by an alternate system. Neither the UNTZa
 nor the emerging new unions have demonstrated the capability to
 protect worker interests or defend worker rights in the current
 environment.
 The Government has yet te promulgate revisions to the Labor
 Code promised in 1990, which would strengthen provisions of the
 law safeguarding the right to form unions and bargain
 collectively. These revisions also would protect workers
 against antiunion discrimination. While UNTZ& has gained a
 large measure of credibility since its break from the MPR, its
 inability to generate revenue and internal competition for
 positions of authority have weakened its capacity to
 effectively represent workers.
 There are-no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law in Zaire, and there is no
 indication. that it is imposed extralegally.
 d. Minimum Age and Employment of Children
 The legislated minimum age for employment is 18 years, although
 minors 14 years and older may be legally employed with the
 consent of a parent or guardian. Employment of children of all
 ages is common in the informal economic sector and in family
 subsistence agriculture. Neither the labor unions nor the
 Ministry of Labor make an effort to enforce child labor laws;
 however, larger enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor.

 e. Acceptable*Conditions of Work
 The majority of Zairians are engaged in subsistence agriculture
 or small-scale commerce outside the formal sector. In 1991
 already meager wage levels in the modern economy were
 devastated by inflation rates measured in four digits. The
 minimum legal daily wage does not provide a decent living for
 employees and their families, and workers must rely on the
 extended family and subsistence agriculture to survive. Public
 sector remuneration for all but the highest level does not
 approach a minimum subsistence wage; public employees typically
 work at a second "real" job or resort to corrupt activities.
 The maximum legal workweek in Zaire is 48 hours with one
 24-hour rest period required every 7 days. The Labor Code
 specifies health and safety standards, ostensibly enforced by
 the Ministry of Labor, but there is little enforcement in
 practice. Minimum wage, safety, and health standards are not
 applied to employees engaged in subsistence agriculture.
