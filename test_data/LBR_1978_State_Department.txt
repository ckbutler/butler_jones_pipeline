 LIBERIA
 Liberia is the oldest republic in Africa. It was
 settled in 1822 by blacks seeking the fundamental human
 rights then denied them in the United States. The
 Liberian Constitution of 1847 closely follows the
 American pattern of separation of powers and protection
 of fundamental liberties. Subsequent amendments have
 served to reinforce these principles.
 On the election of President William V. S. Tubman in
 1944, Liberia began to address the problem of the
 division between the descendants of the settlers and the
 original inhabitants. The "Unification Policy" has
 managed over the past thirty years to alter substantially
 societal patterns in Liberia and to defuse a potentially
 explosive schism. The descendants of the settlers
 nevertheless remain in control of political and economic
 power, and the tribal peoples have yet to gain full
 equality.
 The administration of President William R. Tolbert, Jr,
 who succeeded Tubman in 1971, has increased efforts to
 promote development throughout the country and to bring
 social justice and equality of opportunity to all.
 There have been no substantiated charges of human
 rights violations during President Tolbert's term of
 office.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is neither sanctioned nor practiced in Liberia.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 
 100
 The Constitution prohibits, and the Government does not
 impose, arbitrary deprivation of life or involuntary
 servitude. While public flogging of convicted thieves
 is a legally approved punishment, to the knowledge of
 the Department of State there has not been such a
 flogging since early 1977. Prison conditions, which
 were abysmal during the first half of this century,
 have improved markedly. An assistant minister of
 justice heads a rehabilitation project to promote
 vocational training for prisoners. Religious groups
 work within the prisons, and friends and relatives are
 allowed to visit and bring food.
 C. Arbitary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In recent years Liberian authorities have observed
 constitutional and legal restraints against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. There are no known political
 prisoners in Liberia. There is no provision in the
 penal code for preventive detention. The Emergency
 Powers Act, which permitted the suspension of habeas
 corpus for certain criminal offenses, was allowed to
 lapse in 1978.
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Access to protection under the legal system is available
 to all. Accused have the right to defense counsel, and
 trials are fair and open to the public. A new penal
 code is being drafted to liberalize the traditional and
 statutory restraints on individual legal rights.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are no reports of invasion of the home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The Tolbert administration is strongly committed to
 directly assisting the country's poor. The budget for
 education increased 64 percent from 1977 to 1978, and

101
 that for health and welfare rose by 53 percent. The
 Government has begun several ambitious urban housing
 projects. It aims at a marked increase in agricultural
 producton, concentratinq on self-sufficiency in rice by
 1980 and on cash-croppinq of rice, rubber, palm oil,
 coffee and cocoa, stimulated by support from state
 marketing corporations. The Government is trying with
 some success to improve its progressive income tax
 collection system. As the privileged few pay more
 of their income tax burden, more money will be available
 for developmental puiposes. The regressive austerity
 tax has been repealed.
 The efforts of the Government to deliver services to
 the poor are hampered by a persistent pattern of
 corruption. While some of the more flagrant abuses
 have been eliminated, the pursuit of outside, private
 occupations by some office holders and civil servants
 reduces efficiency and raises conflict-of-interest
 problems. The President is attempting to alter these
 long-established practices and has taken action against
 dozens of the most serious offenders.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly.
 These freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed and
 observed in practice. The Government's attitude toward
 organized labor has been generally benevolent. Liberia
 is active in maintaining established procedures in the
 International Labor Organization and is an energetic
 moderate voice in that forum. The legal prohibition
 against the organization of agricultural workers by
 industrial labor unions has been the sole criticism of
 governmental labor policy.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the
 country. Regulations governing travel abroad are
 
 
 102
 minimal and Liberians travel freely. Liberia's emigra-
 tion policies are liberal.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The democratic process is open to all who meet the
 age and citizenship requirements. Since the late
 nineteenth century, Liberia has been governed by the
 True Whig Party.   There are, at present, no other
 registered national parties although opposition groups
 function freely. Many opposition parties have existed
 over the years, and their active presence has been
 accepted as part of Liberia's political tradition. An
 opposition party is now being organized.
 Liberia has an enviable record in the advancement
 of women to positions of responsibility and influence.
 Women presently hold key positions in the cabinet
 (agriculture and health), the senior levels of the
 civil service, and the legislature and judiciary, as
 well as in the professions, business, education (one
 university president) and religion.
 The sole discriminatory legal provision is that of
 the Liberian Constitution which limits those who may be
 citizens to "persons of Negro descent"; this is defined
 to mean at least one-quarter Negro ancestry. This
 provision denies citizenship and land ownership to two
 economically important groups of resident aliens, the
 Lebanese and the Indians. Recently the Government
 began to reconsider this measure. Despite this exclusion
 from citizenship, Lebanese and Indians dominate commerce.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Over the past century, Liberia has cooperated in
 investigation of Liberian practices by the League of
 Nations and the International Labor Organization. No
 international orgnization has called for an investigation
 of human rights conditions in Liberia in recent years.
