 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations,
 is a small two-island state with a democratic, parliamentary
 form of government. The Constitution provides the smaller
 island of Nevis considerable self-government, as wdll as the
 right to secede from the federation if certain enumerated
 procedures are followed. The country is governed by a prime
 minister, a cabinet, and a legislative assembly. The Governor
 General, with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head
 of State. The Constitution requires general elections at
 least every 5 years. Elections were last held in 1989,
 retaining Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds and his People's
 Action Movement in power;
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which
 -includes a 50-person Special Service Unit that receives some
 light infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane,
 tourism, and light industry. Most commercial enterprises are
 privately owned, but the sugar industry (the country's largest
 economic enterprise) and 85 percent of all arable land are
 owned by a state corporation. Economic growth slowed somewhat
 in 1990.
 St. Kitts and Nevis maintained its good human rights record
 during 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional
 prohibitions against the use of torture or other forms of
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family members,
 attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees
 regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 this provision is respected in practice. The law requires
 that persons detained be brought before a court within 48
 hours. There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that every person accused of a crime
 receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these
 requirements are generally adhered to. The judiciary, a part
 of the Eastern Caribbean legal system, is highly regarded and
 independent. Final appeal may be made to the Queen's Privy
 
 
 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or
 political courts. Legal assistance is available for indigent
 defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Neither the Government nor the police interfere arbitrarily in
 the private lives of individuals. Warrants are required to
 search private homes.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government owns the only radio and television
 station on St. Kitts. There is a religious television station
 and a privately owned radio station on Nevis. The
 government-owned radio and television on St. Kitts generally
 do not publicize adequately rallies and conventions held by
 the opposition political party. It is difficult for
 opposition party leaders to gain access to the
 government-owned electronic media. For example, during a
 dispute over the Government's decision to bring in Vincentian
 workers to harvest sugar cane, opposition leader Denzil
 Douglas was reportedly denied access to radio air time to
 explain his party's position on the issue. Prime Minister
 Kennedy Simmonds also threatened to arrest Douglas for
 incitement after the opposition leader told Vincentian trade
 union leaders that the safety of the workers could not be
 guaranteed if they came to St. Kitts.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, although
 each of the major political parties publishes a weekly or
 biweekly newspaper. The papers are free to criticize the
 Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International
 news publications are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meetings
 sponsored by political parties occur regularly, usually taking
 place without government interference. However, during the
 dispute in the spring over government importation of laborers,
 from St. Vincent to harvest sugar cane, the Government
 reportedly threatened to arrest anyone who participated in a
 planned airport demonstration when the workers arrived. The
 demonstration was canceled.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. Most church
 members belong to Protestant denominations. All groups are
 free to maintain links with coreligionists' in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel inside and outside of the country is unrestricted.
 
 
 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are able to change their government by peaceful
 means. A vigorous multiparty political system exists in which
 political parties are free to conduct their activities.
 Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote by secret ballot.
 The People's Action Movement (PAM) of Prime Minister Kennedy
 Simmonds holds a majority of seats in the Parliament. PAM has
 worked closely with the Nevis Reformation Party of Nevis
 Premier Simeon Daniel. Since the March 1989 national
 election, the two parties have held 8 of 11 elected seats in
 Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization maintains an office
 in St. Kitts and Nevis. There were no requests for
 investigations or visits by such groups in 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There were no reports of systematic discrimination based on
 race, sex, creed, language, or social status. The role of
 women in society is not restricted by law. However, the role
 of most women in the country is still circumscribed by culture
 and tradition. The Government created the Ministry of Women's
 Affairs to help redefine the role of women in society and to
 ensure that women's rights are promoted. According to a
 Ministry official, violence against women is a problem in St.
 Kitts-Nevis, but gauging the extent of the problem is
 difficult because many women are reluctant to file a complaint
 or pursue their complaints in the courts. Despite this
 reluctance, there were publicly reported cases of both
 domestic violence and rape in 1990, and a few convictions. In
 June local women's groups protested when a newspaper reprinted
 graphic details of.a rape given during a court hearing; they
 also announced plans to pack the courtroom during a rape trial
 scheduled for January 1991 in order to minimize the
 embarrassment to the victim during her testimony. According
 to the Women's Affairs Ministry, the police stand ready to
 investigate allegations of violence (both domestic violence
 and rape). A special police unit dedicated to abused women
 and headed by a policewoman who has received special training
 in the United States works closely with the Ministry to
 investigate domestic violence and rape cases.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs, headed by Constance Mitchum,
 a lawyer and St. Kitts, only female member of Parliament,
 continues to be active in counseling abused women, as well as
 in other aspects of women's rights. The Ministry in September
 submitted to the Cabinet a new national policy statement for
 women that included sections on job discrimination and
 domestic violence. The Ministry also sponsored two seminars
 on women's rights, including a U.N.-funded program to discuss
 the concept of a national policy for women, and a Caribbean
 Community (Caricom) seminar focused especially on women's
 changing role in the workplace and problems with male
 attitudes.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to form and belong to
 trade unions. The major labor union, the St. Kitts Trades and
 Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St. Kitts
 Labour Party and is organized in all sectors of the economy.
 Membership appears to be declining, as the Government assumes
 some of the social welfare roles formerly played by unions.
 There is also an independent teachers' union, a union
 representing dockworkers in the capital city, and a
 taxi-drivers association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well
 established and respected in practice. There were no major
 strikes in 1990, although sugar harvester machine operators
 struck for 2 days in February over a management proposal to
 change their pay determination from a formula based on the
 amount harvested to a regular weekly wage; the Government
 withdrew the proposal.
 Unions are free to form federations or confederations, and to
 affiliate with international organizations. The islands'
 unions maintain a variety of international ties. St. Kitts is
 not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions are free to organize and to negotiate for better
 wages and benefits for union members. There are no areas,
 such as export processing zones, where union organization or
 collective bargaining are discouraged or impeded. There is no
 legislation governing organization and representation of
 workers, and employers are not legally bound to recognize a
 union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of
 workers polled wish to organize. The Labor Commission
 attempts to mediate in disputes between labor and management
 on an ad hoc basis.
 Union and opposition party officials vigorously opposed the
 Government's decision to bring in laborers from St. Vincent to
 aid in harvesting the 1990 sugar crop. The Government claimed
 it could not obtain enough local workers to harvest the sugar
 cane, while the union charged that the Government was
 unwilling to provide sufficient wages to entice workers to
 join the canecutting crews. Eventually several groups of
 Vincentian workers came to St. Kitts, but their performance
 was disappointing, and the Government finally agreed to a wage
 increase to attract more Kittitian canecutters.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and forced labor, and they do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 14. The Labor Ministry
 relies heavily on school truant officers and the Community
 Affairs Division to monitor compliance, which they do
 effectively.

 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are
 guaranteed a minimum vacation of 2 weeks. Minimum wage rates
 for domestic servants and retail store employees were
 established by law in 1984 and updated in 1989. These range
 from about $24 per week for a shop clerk to $36 per week for a
 maid and $60 for a shop supervisor. The minimum wage would
 provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for the wage
 earner and family. Wages may be supplemented by the
 widespread practice of keeping small animals such as goats and
 chickens. Most people live in extended families where there
 may be more than one wage earner.
 The Labor Commission undertakes regular wage inspections and
 special investigations when complaints are received; employers
 found in violation are required to pay back wages. While
 there are no specific health and safety regulations, the
 Factories Law provides general health and safety guidance to
 Labor Ministry inspectors.
