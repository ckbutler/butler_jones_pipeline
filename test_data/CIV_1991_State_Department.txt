 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Power in-Cote d'Ivoire is concentrated in President Felix
 Houphouet-Boigny, who has been the country's leader since
 indepdndence, and in the political- party he founded, the
 Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI). After many years as
 a de facto one-party state, Cote d'Ivoire adopted a multiparty
 political system in 1990 and held multiparty elections at the
 presidential, legislative, and municipal levels. In the same
 year, the President appointed a Prime Minister who serves at
 his pleasure. Despite-genuine reforms which have resulted in a
 flourishing of political parties and opposition groups,
 Houphouet-Boigny and the PDCI, winners of the 1990 elections,
 continue to dominate all levels of government.
 Cote d'Ivoire's security apparatus includes the Security Police
 (Surete) and the Gendarmerie, a branch of the armed forces with
 responsibility for general law enforcement. The Gendarmerie is
 the primary police organization outside the cities and is under
 the Ministry of Defense.
 During the 1980's, Cote d'Ivoire was squeezed by a heavy debt
 burden and failing prices for its exports, principally cocoa,
 coffee, and tropical woods.' Per capita annual income slipped
 in recent years from well over $1,000 to about $700. After
 reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 and World Bank on a stabilization program in 1989, the
 Government brought its budget under tighter control, instituted
 changes in the tax code, and launched an ambitious program of
 privatization and administrative reform.
 Human rights'in general improved in 1991 as the Government came
 to accept the existence of various opposition groupings and a
 vigorous and vigilant press. Nonetheless, there were serious
 human rights-violations, including physical abuse resulting in
 the death of one soldier and a raid on university dormitories
 in which three young women were repeatedly raped, and many
 students severely beaten.. Security forces sometimes use.
 beatings to extract confessions or as punishment. Further, the
 Government climped down on the press for defamation of public
 officials and insulting the President.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings by government forces;
 one student was killed by other students (see Sea. l.d.). In
 the only known extrajudicial killing, according to credible
 reports Corporal Benjamin Ble Liade died on July 19 as a result
 of severe physical abuse while being interrogated by the army
 in connection with an alleged mutiny.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no substantiated Feports of officially sanctioned
 abduction or disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Criminal suspects are sometimes beaten by the police in order
 to extract a confession or as punishment. Non-Ivorian Africans
 
 
 94
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 residing in Cote d'Ivoire are routinely treated more roughly by
 police on arrest than are Ivorians. There were no instances in
 1991 of officials being punished for mistreatment of detainees
 or prisoners.
 On May 17-18, military commandos staged a midnight raid on
 University of Abidjan dormitories in Yopougon to arrest
 dissident student leaders. Three women were repeatedly raped
 by soldiers, and several students were severely beaten. The
 soldiers forced students to engage in humiliating acts such as
 licking up the blood of fellow students. Under public
 pressure, President Houphouet-Boigny established a Commission
 of Inquiry which reported to him on November 15. The report
 was only made public on January 29, 1992. The President did
 not accept the Commission's recommendation that those persons
 identified as responsible be punished.
 Sanitary conditions in many prisons are abysmal. Common
 problems include open sewers, lack of bathing facilities,
 unclean food, and infestation by rats and mice. Such
 conditions at the Yopougon Prison resulted in an outbreak of
 cholera in early September which killed some 50 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-
 Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor may
 order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 bringing charges. The Code dictates that longer detention must
 be ordered by a magistrate, who may authorize periods of up to
 4 months, but who must also provide the Minister of Justice, on
 a monthly basis, a written justification for continued
 detention. There have been some reports that local police have
 held persons for more than 48 hours without bringing charges.
 Defendants are not guaranteed the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of their detention. The
 Government has been known in the past to have critics convicted
 on trumped-up criminal charges so as to avoid being accused of
 holding political detainees. Over 100 students were detained
 briefly after the May events, even though most were innocent of
 any wrongdoing.
 Following the June 17 murder of Zebie Thierry, a reputed
 government-hired thug, by a University of Abidjan student mob,
 some 20 students were arrested and jailed. Two of them were
 charged with murder, instigation, and destruction of property.
 The others were held without charge until President
 Houphouet-Boigny ordered their release 2 months later.
 In the past, some prominent critics of the Government have
 chosen to live and work abroad. With the restoration of a
 multiparty political system in 1990, however, many of those
 with serious political aims returned. Political exiles from a
 number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable safe
 haven as long as they do not engage in political activities
 directed against their home governments.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and
 includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. Although the
 judiciary is generally considered independent of the executive
 in ordinary criminal cases, in practice as well as under the
 Constitution's separation of powers provisions, the judiciary
 follows the lead of the executive in cases concerning perceived
 national security issues. There have also been credible
 
 
 95
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 reports that the courts have given lenient treatment to persons
 with personal connections to the Government.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a public trial, although
 key evidence 'is'sometimes given in camera. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trials, and their innocence is
 presumed." Those convicted have the right of appeal, though in
 practice verdicts are rarely overturned. Defendants accused of
 felonies or. capital crimes have the right to legal counsel, and
 the judicial system provides for court-appointed attorneys for
 indigent defendants. In practice, many defendants cannot
 afford private counsel, and court-appointed attorneys are not
 readily available.
 In rural areas, justice is often administered at the village
 level through traditional institutions which handle domestic
 disputes, minor land questions, and family law. Dispute
 resolution is by extended debate, with no known instances of
 resort to physical punishment. These traditional courts are
 increasingly superseded by the formal judicial system.
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. Although there are
 no appellate courts within the military justice system, persons
 convicted by a military tribunal may petition the Supreme Court
 to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 It is a crime, punishable by 3 months to 2 years in prison, to
 offend the President. In 1991 a journalist, who wrote that
 President Houphouet-Boigny had "lost his reason" and was a
 "tyrant," and his publisher were convicted and served 3 months
 and 2 months, respectively, in prison. They also paid
 substantial fines. A businessman, Innocent Anaky, who was
 widely believed to have been charged with financial impropriety
 because of his political activities, was convicted and given an
 unusually harsh 20-year sentence. He served nearly 3 years in
 prison until his release in a general amnesty on September 29.
 The total number of political prisoners is unknown but is
 believed to be small. The Government claims that there are
 none.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In Cote d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are
 free to join any political party or none at all. However,
 public officials and employees of state-owned corporations are
 subjected to pressure to become members of the PDCI. Party
 membership lists are sometimes passed to employees by their
 supervisors, and those who fail to sign up are believed to
 suffer in terms of promotion.
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or
 investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes without
 a judicial warrant if there is reason to believe that there is
 evidence on the premises concernin% a crime. The official must
 have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in
 the search and is required to have witnesses to the search,
 which may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.
 The police sometimes use'a general search warrant without a
 name or address. Such was the case in mid-July when the houses
 of three prominent opposition leaders were searched in
 connection with the Zebie killing a month earlier. None of
 those searched had been at the scene of the crime, and no
 incriminating evidence was found in their homes. In addition,
 the police have entered, homes of foreign Africans (or rounded
 them up on the streets), taken them to the local police
 
 
 96
 COTE DIVOIRE
 station, and extorted small amounts of money for alleged minor
 offenses. In October officials of the Bureau of Mines in
 Odienne, without notice, burned down a mining camp in which
 about 500 people were living. According to the officials, the
 miners had been working without a permit. There is an ongoing
 government investigation of the incident, but no results have
 yet been released nor has anyone been charged.
 There are credible reports that the police used informers at
 the University of Abidjan to provide data on dissident
 political activity. Private telephone conversations are
 believed to be monitored to some degree, although the extent of
 such monitoring is unknown. There is no evidence that private
 correspondence is monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free expression is provided for in the Constitution, but until
 recently this right was significantly limited in practice. In
 1991 public criticism of government policies and even of the
 President was common. Critics of the Government express
 themselves in informal situations without fear of reprisal.
 The Government operates the radio and television networks. and
 uses these media to promote its policies. Most.of the news
 programming is devoted to coverage of the activities of the
 President, the Government, and the PDCI. The opposition
 parties repeatedly appealed to the Minister of Communication to
 grant them greater access to the state-run broadcast media.
 The National Assembly President negotiated an agreement with
 the opposition to increase coverage of opposition policies and
 viewpoints. As a result, coverage has increased.
 The variety of newspapers expanded significantly in 1991 to a
 total of more than 20. There are now four daily newspapers.
 Those with the widest circulation, Fraternite-Matin and the
 evening paper Ivoire Soir, are government run. In 1991 both
 newspapers ran stories critical of government policies and
 increased their coverage of the political opposition. A third
 daily, La Voie, is an organ of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI),
 Cote d'Ivoire's strongest opposition party. Finally, La
 Chronique du Soir is independent. Most of the weekly
 newspapers are either affiliated with opposition political
 parties or, if unaffiliated, nevertheless critical of the
 Government. Foreign publications circulate freely, but the
 Government occasionally expels foreign journalists who write
 unfavorable articles. An Agence France Presse journalist, who
 inaccurately reported that students were killed in the Yopougon
 raid of May 17-18, was expelled from the country.
 Although criticism of government policies is tolerated, insults
 or attacks on the honor of the country's highest officials are
 not. Two Ivorian journalists served jail sentences in 1991 for
 offending the President. In addition, six journalists from
 four newspapers were convicted on November 6 for alleging
 without proof that the Prime Minister was corrupt. Each was
 given a suspended sentence of 2 months in jail and a fine of
 about $3,500. The National Assembly President strongly
 criticized the press in an October speech, accusing them of
 "violence of the pen." A press law was enacted in December
 which created a new commission to enforce laws against
 publishing defamatory material or material "undermining the
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 credit of the-nation." The law imposes stiff penalties,
 including the seizure of offending newspapers.
 Many prominent Ivorian scholars are active in opposition
 politics and have not suffered professionally. The Government
 insists, however,- that teachers separate their political
 activity from their work in the classroom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution but in
 practice is restricted when the Government perceives a
 significant and immediate danger to public order. Although
 opposition parties believe that the Constitution permits
 privatd associations of any sort, the Government disagrees, and
 all organizations must register before commencing activities.
 Registration is sometimes denied, and this device has prevented
 the formation.of some political parties, although 40 were
 registered by the end of the year. Further, Ivorian law
 prohibits the formation of political parties along ethnic or
 religious lines.
 Permits-are required for public meetings and are sometimes
 denied to the opposition but never to the PDCI. Gatherings
 occasionally are prohibited to- prevent the expression of
 controversial views in public forums. Following the Yopougon
 raid of May 17-18, the Ivorian League of Human Rights (LIDHO)
 applied for permission to organize a protest march. The
 Minister of Interior and Security proposed an itinerary which
 was unacceptable to LIDHO. On June 5, LIDHO demonstrated
 withbut a permit. Police used truncheons and tear gas to
 disperse the peaceful crowd, and eight people were injured.
 On June 17, several thousand students rioted at the University
 of Abidjan, and part of the mob killed a reputed government
 agent (see Section l.d.). Three days later, the Prime Minister
 ordered the prosecution of the executive board of the
 Federation of Students and Pupils of Cote d'Ivoire (FESCI) for
 incitement to murder, and he dissolved FESCI under the law
 which prohibits associations from provoking public disorder.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel.
 However, there are numerous internal roadblocks at which
 persons are fiequently harassed, and small amounts of money are
 extorted for contrived or minor infractions.
 Ivorians normally can travel abroad and emigrate freely. In
 1991, however, teachers were required to present to the Ivorian
 passport control before boarding an airplane the written
 authorization of the Ministry of Education; if they were on
 strike, authorization was denied. Ivorians have the right of
 voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation
 of citizenship.
 
 
 98
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safe haven to many refugees
 from different countries. In 1990 more than 230,000 refugees
 from the Liberian civil war entered the country, and most
 stayed through 1991. While in Cote d'Ivoire, refugees receive
 1-year renewable resident visas for their first 5 years in the
 country, after which they may apply for permanent residence.
 The Liberians are a special case; the Government expects that
 they will go back to Liberia as soon as that country returns to
 normal. The Government is actively involved in managing
 Liberian refugee relief, even though most resources come from
 foreign and international donors. The continued arrival of
 Liberians in 1991 has led the Government to fear that relief is
 acting as a magnet.   It has established a committee to review
 the case of each new arrival to determine whether the person
 should be accorded refugee status. The Government is reluctant
 to implement self-sufficiency activities that might encourage
 refugees to remain in Cote d' Ivore.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Houphouet-Boigny and the PDCI were returned to power
 in 1990 in the first multiparty presidential, legislative, and
 municipal elections since independence. Proceedings were
 marred by some serious irregularities. Only at the end of 1991
 did the National Assembly, which has the authority to decide on
 the validity of the elections of its members, convene a
 committee to decide whether irregularities in 11 districts
 would invalidate the results.
 Before the presidential elections, the National Assembly
 effectively restricted the number of candidates by imposing the
 stringent requirement that each candidate must pay a large
 deposit (approximately $80,000), refundable only if the
 candidate received more than 10 percent of the vote in the
 first round of balloting. Opposition parties, which- became
 legal only in May 1990, charged that there had been inadequate
 time to prepare for elections held during October-December of
 the same year. Further, they faced onerous restrictions on
 holding meetings and demonstrations and unequal access to the
 state-controlled media. There were numerous assertions by
 opposition parties of ballot box stuffing, procedural
 irregularities, and fictitious, or late-designated, polling
 places. In the legislative election, the names of well over
 100 duly registered candidates did not appear on the ballot.
 President Houphouet-Boigny is both Head of State and president
 of the PDCI. In late 1990, he appointed a Prime Minister in
 whose hands are concentrated most day-to-day governmental
 affairs and much economic power. The Prime Minister serves at
 the pleasure of the President. The PDCI holds 165 of the 175
 seats in the National Assembly, which is subordinate to the
 Executive branch. The Assembly. confirms and ratifies
 legislative initiatives received from the President. Under the
 President's leadership, the party is governed by an 86-member
 Central Committee and a 418-member Political Bureau. The PDCI
 is a conservative party which has accepted the new multiparty
 political system. The chief opposition party, the FPI, calls
 for a more honest and democratic government and an end to
 cronyism.
 Elections for President, the National Assembly, and municipal
 councils are held every 5 years, with the next elections
 scheduled for 1995. Although under the Constitution only
 
 
 99-
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 citizens are entitled to vote, the electoral law extends voting
 rights to non-Ivorian Africans living in Cote d'Ivoire, who
 constitute approximately one-third of the country's
 population. There is a secret ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An internal, independent human rights organization, the Ivorian
 League of Human Rights (LIDHO), was formed in 1987 and was
 recognized by the Government in July 1990. The League has
 actively investigated alleged violations of human rights and
 issued press releases and reports, some of which were critical
 of the.Government. In June 1991, the Ivorian Association for
 the Promotion of Human Rights (AIPDH) was established for the
 purpose of improving Ivorians' awareness of their'basic
 rights. The group's first major project consisted of
 translating human rights documents into local languages.
 Neither LIDHO nor AIPDH has been impeded by the Government (see
 Section 2.b.Y.
 The Government has been cooperative in the past towards
 international inquiries into its human rights practices.
 Although the Government has not responded publicly to appeals
 from Amnesty International and the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), it has subsequently taken positive action
 to correct abuses.
 Section 5 -Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no overt, official discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. Although French is the
 official language and the language of instruction in the
 schools, radio and television programs are broadcast in major
 local languages. Social and-economic mobility are not limited
 by policy or custom on the basis of ethnicity or religion, but
 there are pronounced inequalities based on sex, with males
 clearly playing the preponderant role overall.
 While some Ivorian traditional societies accord women
 considerable political and economic power, in rural areas
 tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are performed mostly
 by women, although farm work by men is also common. Government
 policy is to encourage full participation by women in social
 and economic life, but there is considerable informal
 resistance among employers to hiring women, who may be
 considered "undependable" by virtue of potential pregnancy.
 Clitoral excision, which is illegal in Cote d'Ivoire, is
 nevertheless practiced particularly among the rural population
 in the north and'west, The operation, which usually takes
 place at puberty as one part of a rite of passage, is generally
 performed outside modern medical facilities and can be
 extremely painful and dangerous to health. The Government does
 not make strong efforts to prevent the practice, and social
 pressures are sufficiently strong that it persists,
 particularly in small villages where the tribal chief is the
 primary decisionmaker. Excision is becoming less common as the
 population becomes better educated.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is neither
 widely practiced nor tacitly condoned. However,
 representatives of women's organizations state that wife
 
 
 100
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 beating does occur, often leading to divorce. Doctors state
 that they rarely see the Victims of domestic violence. A
 severe social stigma is attached to domestic violence of any
 kind; neighbors will often intervene in a domestic quarrel to
 protect a person who is the object of physical abuse. The
 courts and police view domestic violence as a family problem
 unless serious bodily harm is inflicted; in which case criminal
 proceedings do take place. The Government has no clear-cut
 policy regarding wife beating beyond the obvious strictures
 against violence in the civil code.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form unions under the Labor Code of
 1964, but union membership is not mandatory. For almost 30
 years the government-sponsored labor confederation, the General
 Union of Workers of Cote d'Ivoire (UGTCI), dominated union
 activity, except for the independent university teachers',
 secondary school teachers', and doctors' unions. In 1991
 several formerly UGTCI-affiliated unions including those
 representing transport, media, customs, and bank workers broke
 away and became independent. An independent labor federation,
 Dignite, was officially authorized in 1990 but has attracted
 few members. The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior
 position in the PDCI hierarchy. The UGTCI is a relatively
 passive coordination mechanism rather than an active force for
 worker rights, although it has had some success in improving
 working conditions and safety standards. The UGTCI represents
 approximately one-third to one-half of the organizable work
 force. Independent unions tend to be more activist than those
 within the UGTCI structure. Some of the independent unions
 have links to opposition political patties.
 In March gendarmes broke up an extraordinary congress of the
 secondary school teachers' union, using billy clubs and whips.
 The Union congress voted in a new Secretary General, whom the
 Government refused to recognize. The previous Secretary
 General was perceived by the union membership as being too
 close to the ruling PDCI. In November the progovernment
 faction of the union elected a different Secretary General with
 the result that there are two claimants on the position. The
 leader of an independent trade union was repeatedly called in
 for questioning by security authorities during 1991.
 The right to strike is protected in the Constitution and by
 statute. The ILO's Committee of Experts in 1991, however,
 reiterated earlier observations that the Labor Code gives the
 President excessive power to submit an industrial dispute to
 compulsory arbitration in order to bring an end to a strike.
 The Constitution requires a protracted series of negotiations
 and a 6-day notification period before a strike may be held,
 effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize.
 Strikes are seldom authorized by the UGTCI; however,
 independent unions freely strike. In 1991 university teachers,
 secondary school teachers, media workers, and doctors held
 strikes. Although the Government declared the strikes illegal,
 it met many of the strikers' demands.
 The UGTCI, which is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade.Union Unity, formally prohibits its individual trade
 unions from forming or maintaining affiliations with other
 international professional organizations in their fields.
 Independent unions may freely affiliate with international
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 101
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 bodies. Dignite is a member of the World Confederation of
 Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Code grants all Ivorians the right to join unions and
 to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are
 in effect in many major business enterprises and sectors of the
 civil service. In most cases in which wages are not.
 established in negotiations between unions and employers,
 salaries are set by job category in the Ministry of Employment
 and Civil Service. A law prohibiting antiunion discrimination
 is enforced by labor inspectors. There are no export
 processing zones.
 a. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There have been no reports of forced labor, which is prohibited
 by law.
 d. Minimum Wage for Employment of Children
 In most instances, the -legal working minimum age is 16, and the
 Ministry of Employment and Civil Service enforces this
 provision effectively in the civil service and in large
 multinational companies. However, children often work on
 family farms, and in Abidjan some children routinely act as
 street traders and vendors of consumer goods in the informal
 sector. There are-also reports of children working, in what
 could be described as sweatshop conditions in small workshops.
 Many children leave the formal school system at an early age;
 lower grade education is mandatory but far from universally
 enforced, particularly ip rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Cote d'Ivoire has an administratively determined monthly wage
 rate which was last adjusted in January 1986.' A slightly
 higher rate applies to construction workers. The minimum wage
 is enforced only with respect to salaried workers employed by
 the Government or registered with Social Security. Minimum
 wages vary according to occupation, with the lowest
 insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and his family. The majority of Ivorians work in
 agriculture or the informal sector where the minimum wage does
 not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service, the
 Government enforces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the
 terms and conditions of service for wage earners and salaried
 workers and providing for occupational safety and health
 standards. Those employed in the modern sector are reasonably
 protected against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and
 capricious discharge from employment. The standard legal
 workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment on a
 graduated scale for hours in excess of the standard.
 In the large informal sector of the economy, involving both
 urban and rural workers, the Government's occupational health
 and safety regulations are enforced erratically at best.
 Government. labor inspectors are empowered to order employers to
 improve substandard conditions and, if the employer fails to
 comply, fines can be levied by a labor court.
