 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain is a monarchy with no democratically elected institutions or political par-
 ties. The Al Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th century
 and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir as
 hereditary ruler. The current Amir, Shaikh Isa Bin Sulman Al Khalifa, governs
 Bahrain with the assistance of his brother, the Prime Minister, his son, the Crown
 Prince; and an appointed Cabinet of Ministers. In 1975 the Government suspended
 some provisions of Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating to
 the National Assembly, which the Government disbanded in the same year. There
 are few judicial checks on the Amir and the actions of his Government. Social ties
 and interpersonal associations are important and are formed in a complex web of
 family, tribal, economic, and religious affiliations. Bahrainis belong to the Shi'a and
 Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising over two-thirds of the indigenous
 population. There are important sectarian and ethnic divisions among the Shi a. De-
 spite their minority status, the Sunnis predominate because the ruling family is
 Sunni and is supported by the armed forces, the security service, and powerful mer-
 chant families.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. Under its auspices, the
 Public Security Force (police) and the extensive and efficient Security Service are
 responsible for maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) de-
 fends against external military threats. It does not play any role in internal secu-
 rithrain has a mixed economy, with government ownership of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 and natural gas reserves, Bahrain is intensifying efforts to diversify its economic
 base and has attracted companies doing business in banking, financial services, pe-
 trochemicals, and light manufacturing. The Government has used its modest oil rev-
 enues to build an advanced infrastructure in transportation and telecommunications
 and has become a leading regional financial and business center.
 Although there was little formal change in the human rights situation in 1993,
 Amiri decrees in March and May authorized the release of 75 prisoners, including
 political detainees, and granted amnesty to a number of Bahraini exiles living
 abroad. The appointive Consultative Council (Majlis AI-Shurs, established by Amiri
 
 
 1157
 
 decree in 1992), held its first session from January to June and reconvened for a
 second 6-month period in October.
 Civil liberties, however, remain circumscribed in Bahrain. The main human rights
 concerns continue to include the denial of the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment; the occasional practice of arbitrary and incommunicado detention; the ab-
 sence of impartial inspection of detention and prison facilities; restrictions on the
 right to a fair public trial, especially in the Security Court; and restrictions on free-
 dom of speech and press, freedom of assembly and association, women's rights, and
 worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law, and there were very few credible reports of torture in
 1993. Little is known about what happens inside Bahrain's prisons, however, since
 nonofficial visits are generally prohibited. There is anecdotal evidence that Bahraini
 police occasionally have used primitive forms of torture, such as beating the soles
 of prisoners' feet, when questioning criminal suspects. Bahrain's small size and so-
 cial structure would make it extremely difficult for the Government to conceal seri-
 ous abuses if they were frequent or systematic.
 The Government continues to deny that torture takes place, but it has not imple-
 mented minimal procedural safeguards that would help deter such practices, nor
 has it allowed inspection of detention facilities by impartial international organiza-
 tions, despite its announced willingness to do so. Allegations of torture are all the
 more difficult for the Government to rebut because of governmental regulations per-
 mitting the practice of incommunicado detention and detention without trial. There
 were no known instances in 1993 of authorities being punished for human rights
 abuses committed in previous years.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under provisions of the Security Law of
 1974, most often applied to those suspected of antiregime activity, persons may be
 detained and arrested for attempting to exercise the rights of free speech, associa-
 tion, or other rights. In recent years, there has been some loosening of control on
 activities previously considered "subversive." There were several credible reports
 that the security forces held persons suspected of engaging in antiregime activity
 for questioning in 1993. In all cases, the suspects were released with a warning
 within 2 or 3 days, after the authorities determined that there was not enough evi-
 dence to make a formal ar-est. The Embassy confirmed one case in 1993 of deten-
 tion without trial for 80 days, as allowed under the 1974 Security Law. The individ-
 ual in question was released by Amiri decree on Bahrain's National Day before for-
 mal charges could be brought against him.
 Activities that could lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest include:
 membership in illegal organizations or those      deemed   subversive; painting
 antiregime slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations; possessing or
 circulating antiregime writings; preaching sermons with a distinct antiregime politi-
 cal tone; or harboring or associating with persons committing such acts.
 Under the State Security Act of 1974, persons accused of subversive or antiregime
 acts may be detained without trial for a period not to exceed 3 years. Detainees
 have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months and, if the ap-
 peal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original detention.
 There were no credible reports of persons being detained for more than a few days
 in 1993 under the provisions of the 1974 Act, and the Government is not believed
 currently to be holding any prisoners without charge.
 In addition to overseeing the Security Service and police, the Ministry of Interior
 also controls the office of the Public Prosecutor, whose officers initially determine
 whether sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in "investigatory
 detention." The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In
 the early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any
 authority outside the Ministry of Interior.
 Exile h been utilized by Bahraini authorities in dealing with individuals sus-
 pected of antiregime activity. In the early 1980's, following the Iranian revolution,
 there were confirmed reports that young Bahraini men suspected of antigovernment
 activity were forced to reside outside Bahrain without benefit of trial. Bahraini au-
 thorities maintain that, in many cases, individuals were presented with the evi-
 dence against them and given a choice of standing trial or living outside Bahrain
 
 
 1158
 
 for a specified period of time. In April the authorities briefly detained three Bah-
 ramis, residing in Lebanon, at the airport and refused them entry. Bahraini officials
 contend that all three could have been charged with belonging to a subversive orga-
 nization if they had entered Bahrain. In the same month, Amnesty International
 reported that the Government was preparing to exile Hashim AI-Musawi, a Bah-
 raini convicted in 1988 of antiregime activity, after he had completed his 5-year sen-
 tence without any new charges having been brought against him.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary
 criminal court or, if required by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary
 civil or criminal trials provide procedural guarantees for an open trial, the right to
 counsel (with legal aid available when necessary), and the right to appeal. Security
 cases are tried directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as the Security
 Court. Procedures in Bahrain's Security Court do not provide appropriate safe-
 guards. For example, the Security Court is exempted from adhering to the proce-
 dural guarantees of the Penal Code, proceedings are held in secret, and there is no
 right to judicial review of the legality of arrests. Although there were no such re-
 ports in 1993 in the past therehave been credible allegations that convictions in
 the Security dourt have been based solely on confessions obtained while in official
 custody and possibly elicited under duress. There were no reports of security court
 trials in 1993.
 Bahraini attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs
 to act as counsel. Sentences imposed by the Security Court may, at the discretion
 of the Court or the request of the defendant's family, be referred to the Amir for
 clemency.
 The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) maintains a separate court system for military
 personnel accused of offenses under the military code of justice. Military courts do
 not review cases involving civilian criminal or security offenses.
 The number of prisoners decreased in 1993. Between 270 and 300 persons were
 believed to be held in Bahraini prisons, some of whom may be political prisoners.
 The number of political prisoners in Bahrain cannot be determined precisely be-
 cause the Government does not release data on security cases, such cases are not
 tried in open court, and prisoners convicted of security offenses are not always al-
 lowed visits.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government continued to release and grant am-
 nesty to a small number of prisoners, including self-declared political prisoners, on
 major Islamic holidays. In 1993 the Government released 15 such prisoners in
 March during the Eid AI-Fitr holiday and another 8 in May following the Eid Al-
 Adha celebrations, as well as another 52 released by Amiri decree on December 16.
 Despite the amnesties, a small number of persons convicted in trials in the early
 to mid-1980's for antiregime activity remain in Bahraini jails, although most are
 nearing the end of their 12- to 15-year sentences. Government sources have indi-
 cated that the small number of prisoners convicted for nonviolent antiregime activ-
 ity in the 1980's and still remaining in custody will shortly be released either
 through governmental amnesty or upon completion of their sentences. It is not ex-
 pected, however, that the small number-approximately 10--of persons sentenced to
 life imprisonment for actively taking up arms against the Government will be grant-
 ed amnesty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, the Ministry of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into private prm-
 ises without specific judicial intervention, although the Ministry is thought to use
 such power rarely. Domestic and international telephone calls and correspondence
 are subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are extensive and sophisticated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," Bahrainis are not, in practice, free publicly to
 challenge the legitimacy of, or even express opposition t the regime in speech or
 writing. Politicaf meetings are not permitted. Gatherings that might take on a polit-
 ical tone freeuently are monitored;however, the informal relaxation of some govern-
 mental restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly begun in 1991 continued in
 1993. Although some subjects-particularly the Hawar Islands dispute and anything
 directly critical of the rulin g family-remain strictly taboo, the local press's coverage
 and commentary on economic, commercial, and labor issues is increasingly open,
 and private discussion of political issues was more widespread than in the past.
 The Information Ministry exercises broad authority over local media. All news-
 papers are privately ownedbut routinely exercise self-censorship of stories on sen-
 sitive topics. In 1993 the Government shut down the Arabic daily Akhbar AI-Khalecj
 for 3 days after the newspaper, apparently inadvertently, published a news wire
 
 
 1159
 story accompanied by a map showing the Hawar Islands, which are claimed by both
 Bahrain and Qatar, as part of the territory of Qatar. The Government does not con-
 done unfavorable coverage of its domestic policies by the international media and
 has occasionally revoked the press credentials of offending journalists. Since the
 Ministry also sponsors foreign journalists' residence permits, this action can lead to
 deportation. There were no reports of such actions in 1993.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts in Arabic and Farsi from neighboring countries and Egypt can be
 received without interference. Since 1991 Cable News Networ (CNN) has been
 broadcast 3 hours a day on a local television channel without censorship and is
 available on a 24-hour basis by subscription. The British Broadcasting Corporation's
 World News Service is carried on a local channel 24 hours a day free of charge and
 uncensored. U.S. Armed Forces Radio is also available. Many senior government of-
 ficials, ruling family members, and major hotels use satellite dishes to receive inter-
 national broadcasts, and well-to-do private citizens are using dishes to receive tele-
 vision programs from outside Bahrain. The Ministry of Information closely controls
 access to satellite dishes, and the importation or installment of dishes without prior
 government approval is illegal.
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, as a prac-
 tical matter academics try to avoid contentious political issues. In general, there is
 greater latitude to discuss politics in an academic setting. Nevertheless, strict limits
 are observed, and research, publications, and discussions critical of the Government
 are at best highly infrequent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Bahrain Constitu-
 tion's affirmation of the right of free assembly, all public political demonstrations
 or meetings are prohibited. Religious gatherings that may take on political over-
 tones are also strictly controlled. In March the Bahraini security services reportedly
 prevented a joint Sunni-Shiapolitical seminar from taking place at a local mosque
 and briefly detained the acheduled speakers for questioing. Political organizations
 are prohibited, but many social and sports clubs have traditionally serve as forums
 for discreet political discussion, although these are also closely monitored by the
 Government. Since the Gulf war, the Government has been more tolerant of infor-
 mal discussion of political issues than in the past, but organized discussions and
 meetings are still discouraged.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Bahrain's population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and
 Islam is the state religion. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including
 Jews, Hindus, and Baha'is, enjoy considerable freedom to practice their religion and
 maintain their own places of worship. Bibles and other Christian publications are
 displayed and sold openly in local bookshops, which also sell Islamic and other reli-
 gious literature. Adherents of faiths other than Islam maintain places of worship
 and may display the symbols of their religion. Some small groups worship in their
 homes. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of sermons delivered by Mus-
 lim preachers from other countries, and publications of other religions are readily
 available.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is not encouraged, and anti-Islamic writings are
 prohibited, but conversions from Islam to other religions are tolerated. Both Sunni
 and Shi'a sects are subject to governmental control and monitoring, but there is no
 interference with routine worship, preaching, or religious activities. Public religious
 events, most notably annual commemorative marches by the Shi'a, are permitted
 but are closely watched by the police. There are no restrictions on the number of
 Bahrainis permitted to makezilgrimages to Shi'a shrines and holy sites in Iran and
 Iraq; however, owing to con itions in Iraq, very few Bahrainis make pilgrimages
 there. Religious study in, and pilgrimages to, Iran were strongly discouraged in the
 past. Although the Government continues to monitor travel to Iran and scrutinizes
 carefully those who choose to pursue religious study there, Bahraini travel to Iran
 for pilgrimages, business trips, tourism, and family visits is increasingly common.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their place
 of residence or work. Passports, however, may be denied on political grounds. At
 least 3 to 5 percent of the indigenous Bahraini population, mostly Persian-origin
 Shi'a, do not have passports and cannot readily obtain them (see Section 5). Bah-
 rainis living abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may face ar-
 rest and trial upon return to Bahrain. The Government is reported to have issued
 limited "l-year validity" passports to persons whose travel it wishes to restrict. In
 1993 the Government continued an amnesty program initiated in 1992 to allow the
 return of certain persons who, because of their known opposition to the Government
 have resided outside of Bahrain since 1980. Permission was given to 128 exiles and
 their family members to return to Bahrain. The Government waived charges against
 
 
 1160
 them for disrupting the security of the State and violating passport and immigration
 laws. A few amnestied returnees were picked up for resuming their dissident activi-
 ties, but all were released into the custody of their families after being warned by
 the authorities.
 Bahrain does not generally accept refugees; however, in practice refugees are not
 repatriated to countries from which they have fled. Some Iranian emigres who fled
 Iran since 1979 have been granted permission to remain in Bahrain, but they have
 not been granted citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and political activity in general is strictly controlled by the
 Government. Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have
 been no formal democratic institutions, and neither political parties nor opposition
 organizations are permitted. The Government makes all appointments to govern-
 ment positions. About one-third of the Cabinet ministers are Shi'a, although they
 do not hold security-related offices. The ordinary Bahraini may attempt to influence
 government decisions through submission of written petitions and informal contact
 with senior officials including appeals to the Amir and other officials at their regu-
 larly scheduled public audiences called majlises.
 On December 16, 1992, the overnment announced the formation of an all-ap-
 pointive 30-member Consultative Council, known as the Majlis Al-Shura. The Majlis
 held its first session from January 16 to May 25 and opened its second, 6-month
 session on October 2. The members of the Majlis are evenly divided between Sunni
 and Shia and were deliberately chosen to represent the major constituent groups of
 Bahrain, including representatives from the business, labor, professional, and reli-
 ous communities. There are no members of the ruling A-Khalifa family in the
 Majlis, and religious "extremists" are conspicuously absent. The Chairman of the
 Majlis is a Shi'a who formerly was Minister of Transport and Communications. Al-
 though the Majlis has no formal legislative power, it may draft proposed legislation
 for the Government to approve andis empowered to summon Cabinet ministers to
 answer questions at its closed deliberations. During its first session, the Majlis un-
 dertook to debate a number of contentious social and economic issues, particularly
 in the areas of unemployment, labor policy, and education. A number of proposals
 were drafted and are now under consideration by the Government. The Government
 has accepted and implemented some of the recommendations. The Government has
 also acted on a number of Majlis Al-Shura proposals designed to combat Bahrain's
 rising unemployment rate, including a proposal to institute training programs for
 Bahrainis, toughen entry requirements or oreign workers, and deport a number of
 illegal expatriate workers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically based investiga-
 tion and public criticism of the Government's human rights policies would face
 major obstacles. The Government has consistently characterized as baseless charges
 of torture and denial of access to detainees. The Government maintains that it is
 "not opposed" to visits in good faith by "bona fide human rights organizations," but,
 in practice, international human rights organizations have found it difficult to oper-
 ate in Bahrain. The Government extended a formal invitation to Amnesty Inter-
 national in 1992 but no arrangements for a visit had been made by the end of 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of Bahraini women. Spe-
 cific rights vary according to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as deter-
 mined by the individual s faith or the court in which various contracts, including
 marriage, have been made. Bahraini labor law does not discriminate against
 women; however, some women's groups complain about informal discrimination in
 the workplace, including inequality of wages and denial of opportunity for advance-
 ment.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Although local religious courts may grant a divorce
 to Shi'a women in "routine" cases, occasionally Shi'a women seeking divorce under
 unusual circumstances must travel outside of Bahrain, as the Ja'afari sect courts
 in Bahrain are said to lack a religious scholar of sufficient rank to issue rulings in
 controversial cases. Women of either sect may own and inherit property and may
 
 
 1161
 represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the absence of a direct male
 heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property; in contrast, Sunni women-in the ab-
 sence of a direct male heir-inherit only a portion, with the balance being divided
 among uncles and male cousins of the deceased.
 In the event of divorce, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody
 of daughters under the age of 9 and sons under age 7. In all circumstances except
 mental incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains the right to mae
 certain legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of any property belong-
 ing to the child until the child reaches legal age. A non-Bahain woman automati-
 cally loses custody of her children if she divorces their Bahraini father. Women may
 obtain passports and leave the country without the permission of a male head of
 the household. Bahrahni women are free to wear the clothing of their choice (a large
 percentage wear Western dress outside the home), to work outside the home, and
 to drive a car without an escort. As the Bahraini economy has developed, women
 have increasingly taken jobs previously reserved for men.
 Women constitute over 20 percent of the Bahraini work force. The Government
 has encouraged the hiring of women, enacted special laws to promote female entry
 into the work force, and is a leading employer of women. Bahrain's Labor Law does
 not recognize the concept of equal pay for equal work, and women are generally paid
 less than men. Except for a few exempted professions, women are prohibited from
 working at night. Generally, women work outside the home during the years be-
 tween secondary school or university and marriage. Women make up the majority
 of students at Barain's universities. Ther are women's organizations which seek
 to improve the status of women under beth civil and Islamic law.
 Increasingly women have expressed the view that, despite growing female partici-
 pation in the work force, women in Bahrain are not significantly advancing their
 rights and that much of their lack of progress is due to the influence of Islamic reli-
 gious traditionalists, especially in the government-run school system and in the
 Shri'a ourts. Other women, however, desire a return to more traditional religious
 values and support calls for a return to Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Violence against women is known to occur, but knowledge of incidents is usually
 kept within the family in this traditional society. In general, there is virtually no
 public attention to, or discussion of, violence against women and no government
 policies that address it. Women's groups and health care professionals state that
 spous e  sis relatively common, particularly in poorer communities. There are
 very few known instances of Bahrani women seeking legal  ress for violence, and
 anecdotal evidence suggests that the courts are not receptive to such cases.
 Cases of foreign women working as domestic servants being beaten and sexually
 abused have been reported to local embassies and the police. Most victims are too
 intimidated to sue their employers. Those who do, however, appear to be received
 sympathetically in the courts. In December a Bahraini court sentenced a Bahraini
 couple to prison terms after their extreme neglect led to the death of an expatriate
 domestic worker. Anecdotal evidence from other embassies and local contacts indi-
 cate that other serious abuses occur but are infrequently reported.
 Chitdren.-The Government of Bahrain has oren statedits commitment to the
 rotection of children's human rights and welfare within the social and religious
 femework of this traditional society. The Government honors this commitment
 through enforcement of its civil and criminal laws and an extensive social welfare
 networ'k.
 The status of children in Bahraini society is dictated by tradition and religion to
 a greater extent than by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the
 preference of the authorities has always been to leave such matters within the pur-
 view of the family or religious groups. In 1993, however, the government-.ontrlled
 press featured commentaries decrying "growing trends of child prostitution, abuse,
 and begging. Baraini authorities actively enforce the laws against prostitution, in-
 cluding child prostitution, procurin, and pimping. Violators are dealt with harshly
 and can be imprisoned or deported if non-cB aeraini. In some cases, authorities re-
 portedly will return Bahraini children arrested for prostitution and other crimes to
 their families rather than actively prosecute them, especially for first offenses. In
 January a local women's society held a seminar on the legal rights of children in
 which some participants called for greater governmental protection of children, in-
 cludin the establishment of a separate juvenile court. Juvenile cases currently are
 heardn the regular courts 1 day a week. Other Bahrainis, however, insist that the
 protection of children is a religious, not a secular, function and would oppose greater
 governmental interference in this traditional sphere. Independent and quasitern-
 mental o     fanizations such as the Bahraini o ciety for the Protection of  dren
 and the other and Child Welfare Society play an active part in the protection of
 
 
 1162
 children by providing counseling, legal assistance and advice, and, in some cases,
 shelter and financial support to distressed children and families.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A g_up of 3,000 to 5,000 mostly Persian-ori-
 gin Shi'a Bahrainis commonly known as "bidoon" (those without), enjoy less than
 full citizenship under the Bahraini Citizenship Act of 1963. Without citizenship
 these individuals reportedly are unable to buy land, start a business, or obtain gov-
 ernment loans. The law does not address the citizenship rights of persons who were
 not registered with Bahraini authorities prior to 1959, creating a legal lacuna for
 such _persons and their descendants and resulting in economic and other hardships.
 The Government maintains that the figure 3,000 to 5,000 is too high and that many
 of these persons in fact own property and businesses.
 Religious Minorities.-Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims
 enjoy a favored status in Bahrain in comparison with the Shi'a. Sunnis generally
 receive preference for employment in sensitive government positions and in the
 managerial ranks of the civil service. Shi'a Bahrainis are not allowed to hold signift-
 cant posts in the Bahrain defense and internal security forces. On the other hand
 Shi'a Muslims occupy most of the senior positions in the major government-owned
 industries and are disproportionately represented in the educational sphere as sec-
 ondary school teachers, professors, and university administrators. In general, how-
 ever, employment opportunities for Shi'a are more restricted than for Sunnis, and
 Shi'a tend to be employed in lower paid, less skilled jobs. Social and municipal serv-
 ices in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particularly in rural villages, are inferior to those
 found in Sunni urban communities. In an effort to remedy social discrimination, im-
 prove living conditions for the Shi'a, and encourage integration, the Government has
 uilt numerous subsidized housing complexes open to all Bahrainis on the basis of
 financial need.
 People with Disabilities.-Bahraini law protects the rights of people with disabil-
 ities, and a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental, and religious institutions
 are mandated with the support and protection of disabled persons. The Regional
 (Arabian Gulf) Center for the Treatment of the Blind is headquartered in Bahrain.
 Bahraini society tends to view people with disabilities as special cases in need of
 protection rather than as fully functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the
 Government is required by law to provide vocational training for disabled persons
 wishing to work and maintains a list of certified, trained disabled persons. The
 Labor Law of 1976 also requires that any employer employing over 100 employees
 engage at least 2 percent of its employees from the Government's list of disabled
 workers. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs works actively to place people
 with disabilities in public sector jobs, such as in the public telephone exchanges. The
 Government's housing regulations require access be provided to disabled persons.
 Most large public buildings (including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense,
 the University, and schools) are equipped with ramps and other aids which make
 them accessible to disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The partially suspended 1973 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of workers to organize, but trade unions do not exist in Bahrain, and
 the Government does not encourage their formation. Article 27 of Bahrain's Con-
 stitution states: "Freedom to form associations and trade unions on national bases
 and for lawful objectives and by peaceful means shall be guaranteed in accordance
 with the conditions and in the manner prescribed by the law. No person shall be
 compelled to join or remain in any association or union." In response to labor unrest
 in the mid-1950's and in 1965 and 1974, however, the Government passed a series
 of labor regulations which, among other things, allow the formation of elected work-
 ers' committees in the larger Bahraini companies.
 Worker representation in Bahrain today is based on a system of Joint Labor-Man-
 agement Consultative Councils (JCC's) established by Amiri decree. Since 1982, 12
 JCC's have been established in the major state-owned industries. The JCC's are
 composed of equal numbers of appointed management representatives and worker
 representatives elected from ani'by company employees. The selection of worker
 representatives appears to be a fair process, and worker representatives appear gen-
 erally to genuinely represent worker interests. Under Bahraini law, the Ministry of
 Interior may exclude worker candidates with criminal records or those deemed a
 threat to national security. The elected labor representatives of the JCC's select the
 11 members of the General Committee of Bahraini Workers (GCBW) established in
 1983 by law, which oversees and coordinates the work of the JCC's. The Committee
 also hears complaints from Bahraini and foreign workers and assists them in bring-
 ing their complaints to the attention of the Ministry of Labor or the courts. Al-
 though the Government and company management are not represented on the
 
 
 1163
 
 GCBW, the Ministry of Labor closely monitors its activities and must approve the
 distribution of GCBW funds (raised by government taxes on employers) and the
 rules and procedures of the GCBW.
 The JCC-GCBW system now represents close to 70 percent of the island's indige-
 nous industrial workers, although both government and labor representatives read-
 ily admit that nonindustrial workers arm underrepresented by the system. In 1993
 the GCBW announced the extension of the JCC system into the private sector and
 the planned formation of at least five new ,JCC's in private companies. The Ministry
 of Labor supported these moves and has urged the formation of JCC's in all public
 and private sector companies employing more than 200 workers. Although 67 per-
 cent of the Bahraini work force is expatriate, expatriates are underrepresented in
 the work of the GCBW, and none currently participate on its board. It is a longterm
 goal of the Government to replace expatriate workers with Bahirainis and to create
 new jobs for Bahrainis seeking employment.
 Bahraini labor law is silent on the right to strike, and there were no strikes in
 1993, but strikes with a political onnotation were repressed in the 1960's and early
 1970's. Actions perceived to be detrimental to the existing relationship" between
 employers and employees or to the economic health of the State are forbidden by
 the 1974 Security Law. There are no recent examples of major strikes, but walkouts
 and other job actions have been known to occur without governmental intervention
 and with positive results for the workers.
 The GCBW represents Bahraini workers at the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) and in the Arab Labor Organization, but does not belong to any international
 trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar an Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, Bah-
 raini labor law neither grants nor denies workers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively outside the JCC system. While the JCC's described above are empow-
 ered to discuss labor disputes, organize workers' services and discuss wages, work-
 ing conditions, and productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized vehi-
 cle for representing their interests on these or other labor-related issues. JCC's do
 in fact make suggestions to management on some working conditions and limited
 aspects of wage issues, but management must agree before a proposal can be put
 in force.
 Minimum wage rates are established by Council of Ministers' decree. Increases in
 wages above the minimum, which are subject to discussion in the JCC's, are set by
 management, with government salaries for comparable work often serving as an in-
 formal guide. Private businesses generally follow the Government-JCC lead in es-
 tablishing their wage rates.
 There are two export processing zones, but labor law and practice are the same
 in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Conpulsoy Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is le-
 gally prohibited, and the Labor Ministry is charged with enforcing the law. The
 Ministry enfrces the labor laws with periodic inspections and routinely fines viola-
 tors. New provisions to the Labor Law passed in November stiffened the maximum
 fines imposed and mandated imprisonment for certain violations. The press often
 performs an ombudsman function on labor problems, reporting instances in which
 private sector employers occasionally compelled foreign workers from developing na-
 tions to perform work not specified in their contracts, as well as Ministry of Labor
 responses.
 Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker, the Labor Ministry opens an in-
 vestigation and often takes remedial action. A number of abuses undoubtedly go un-
 reported, particularly involving domestic workers and others in Bahrain on "free
 visas.* In the most common cases, these workers come to Bahrain under the spon-
 sorship of one indvidual or company (often fronting for an unlicensed employment
 agency), then switch jobs, while continuing to pay a fee to their original sponsor.
 The Government has announced its intention to abolish this illegal practice, which
 makes it difficult to monitor and control the employment conditions of domestic and
 other workers. The Labor Law amendments passed in November stiffened the pen-
 alties for engaging in visa switching to include a jail sentence of up to 6 months
 for each illegally sponsored worker. However, the Government's efforts to find and
 deport illegally sponsored workers make these domestic workers even more reluc-
 tant to bring cases of abuse to the courts. Even if the courts rule in their favor in
 a particular case of abuse, the workers concerned are very likely to be deported as
 illegal immigrants after the case is concluded. The intense fear of deportation al-
 most certainly allows some sponsors" to impose abusive conditions, which approach
 coerced or bonded labor, on their employees. The elimination of such abuses is one
 objective of the Government's vigorous campaign to crack down on "free visa ped-
 dlers."

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14. Juveniles between the age of 14 and 16 may not be employed in hazardous
 conditions or at night and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a piecework
 basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors in
 the industrial sector; child labor outside that sector is less well monitored but is not
 believed to be significant outside family-operated businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing for workers and their families. The current minimum wage for the public sector
 in Bahrain is $236.60 (91 Bahraini dinars) a month. Wages in the private sector
 are determined on a contract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits
 such as annual repatriation and housing and education bonuses part of the salary.
 Bahrain's Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, man-
 dates acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate stand-
 ards regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety
 and health. The Fourth High Court (labor) has jurisdiction over cases involving al-
 leged violations of the Labor Law. Complaints brought before the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs that cannot be settled through arbitration must, by law, be re-
 ferred to the Court within 15 days. In practice, most employers prefer to settle such
 disputes through arbitration, particularly since the Court and abor Law are gen-
 erally considered to favor the worker/employee. Under Bahraini Labor Law, workers
 have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeop-
 ardy to their continued employment.
 In February the Government strengthened the Labor Law by Amiri decree, an-
 nouncing that significant fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon private
 sector employers who fail to pay legal wages. This law applies equally to employers
 of Bahrainis and expatriates and is intended to reduce abuses against foreign work-
 ers who in the past have sometimes been denied legal salaries. In 1993, after con-
 sulting with the GCBW and the Majlis Al-Shura, the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs submitted a further package of 29 amendments to the Labor Law to the Gov-
 ernment for consideration. These changes were proposed, in part, to bring Bahrain's
 labor laws into greater conformity with international norms.
 The law provides equal protection to Bahraini and foreign workers. However, all
 foreign workers are required to be sponsored by Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institu-
 tions and companies. Subject to sanctions for wrongful dismissal, sponsors are able
 to cancel the residence permit of any person under their sponsorship and thereby
 block them from obtaining entry or residence visas from another sponsor. Foreign
 workers particularly those from developing countries, are often unwilling to report
 abuses for fear of losing residence rights and having to return to their native coun-
 tries. Although instances of foreign workers being denied their guaranteed holidays
 days off, and vacations without compensation are periodically reported in the local
 press, government attempts to address individual abuses in these and other cases
 are often hampered by the workers' unwillingness to make a formal complaint. In
 September a senior Ministry of Labor official publicly invited a group of expatriate
 contract employees to lodge official charges against their Bahraini company after
 their letter protesting 13-hour workdays, 6 days a week, with no break, no overtime,
 or compensatory time off was published in the press.
 In addition, the Labor Law specifically favors Bahrainis, followed by Arab expatri-
 ates, over all other foreign workers in the areas of hiring and firing. Because em-
 ployers include housing and other allowances in their salary scales, Asian workers
 are legally paid lower regular wages than their Bahraini counterparts, although
 they sometimes receive the same or greater total compensation package because of
 home leave and holiday pay allowances. Western expatriates and Bahraini workers
 are paid comparable wages, with total compensation packages often significantly
 greater for the former. Women are prohibited from performing night work, except
 in certain exempted fields. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave,
 nursing periods during the day, and up to 1 year of unpaid maternity leave. How-
 ever women are generally paid less than men.
