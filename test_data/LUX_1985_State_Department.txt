 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government. The Grand Duke is the Chief of State.
 Under the rule of law, the judicial and penal systems in
 Luxembourg function with fairness and nondiscrimination for
 all. The integrity of the person and civil and political
 rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and protected in
 practice.
 Luxembourg is a highly developed industrialized state. Its
 free-enterprise economic system places heavy emphasis on steel
 production, agriculture, and service industries such as
 banking, radio-television broadcasting, and tourism.
 Luxembourg insures that human rights are respected at home and
 works actively to promote human rights internationally. It
 continues efforts to treat its large foreign population fairly
 and to engage labor unions in the industrial decisionmaking
 process.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political reasons by the Government or opposition
 political organizations is unknown in Luxembourg.
 During 1985 there were a series of mysterious bombings aimed
 at public utilities, Gendarmerie facilities, and government
 buildings, resulting in property damage but no injuries to
 individuals. No group has claimed responsibility for the
 bombings. There is thus far no evidence linking the bombings
 to international terrorist groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or officially sanctioned abduction or secret
 arrest has not occurred in Luxembourg.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not practiced. Prisoners
 are fairly treated, have free choice of attorneys, and are
 allowed visitors. A new modern prison to serve all Luxembourg
 was recently opened.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Luxembourg law is a composite of local
 practice, legal tradition, and foreign systems--French,
 Belgian, and German. Preventive detention does not exist.
 Defendants must be charged no later than 24 hours after
 arrest. Persons can be incarcerated pending trial, if so
 ordered by a judge. Exile is not imposed, nor is there forced
 labor.

 e. Jgenial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary, free from executive
 or military interference. There are military courts, but
 civilians are not subject to their jurisdiction. Defendants
 have the right to legal.counsel. Charges are formally and
 clearly stated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to enter a
 private home. Luxembourg statutes prohibit other violations
 of the home such as demolition, sealing doors and windows, and
 electronic surveillance. The privacy of correspondence is
 universally respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 Except for restrictions against pornography, there is no media
 censorship. The Government does not interfere with public
 criticism or academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings, and the right of free
 assembly is denied to no group.
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate, and strike,
 although by tradition strikes are virtually unknown in
 Luxembourg. Unions participate directly in a tripartite
 arrangement with government and management, which forms a
 decisive step in the decisionmaking process on major economic
 issues. A large percentage of the work force is unionized.
 Unions and professional groups maintain unrestricted contact
 with international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion, and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of any religious faith.
 The population is statistically 99 percent Roman Catholic, and
 this faith is deeply intertwined with the conservative culture
 of the country. Thus, a consensus with Roman Catholic beliefs
 often surfaces on social issues; for example, there is no
 government funding for abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions regarding movement within
 Luxembourg, foreign travel, or emigration and repatriation.
 There are no barriers to potential immigrants from countries
 of the European Community (EC). Since 1970, Luxembourg has
 had a large Portuguese population. The status of citizens of
 Portugal in Luxembourg is guaranteed by bilateral agreements
 and is similar to that accorded citizens of the EC. Although
 Luxembourg is not a country of first application for refugees,
 government officials believe that on a per capita basis within
 
 
 1035
 LUXEMBOURG
 the EC relatively liberal numbers of refugees (notably
 Vietnamese) have been admitted. Once admitted, refugees
 benefit from state social programs and are well treated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under Luxembourg's parliamentary democracy, all citizens 18
 years of age and older may participate in national elections
 which are held every 5 years. Luxembourg's sizable foreign
 resident population (26 percent) does not have the right to
 vote, although it enjoys the rights of free speech, press,
 assembly, movement, and religion.  It may also join
 organizations such as labor unions which exert considerable
 indirect influence on the political process. Womem
 participating in politics or holding political office include
 the leader of the Liberal Party and the Mayor of Luxembourg.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Luxembourg governments have consistently supported
 international and nongovernmental investigation of alleged
 violations of human rights. The Red Cross, Amnesty
 International, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 have representatives in Luxembourg. Amnesty International did
 not mention Luxembourg in its 1985 Report. Freedom House
 rated Luxembourg "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Luxembourg is a small country with a population of about
 366,000 and a growth rate of 0.1 percent. Per capita gross
 national product for 1983 was $14,650. The unemployment rate
 is approximately 1.9 percent. A notable feature of the
 Luxembourg economy is the importance of one industry, steel,
 which accounts for a high percentage of Luxembourg exports.
 However, steel is undergoing basic restructuring and is
 declining gradually in terms of overall economic importance.
 Luxembourg enjoys a high standard of living and the usual
 indices of a developed western society--adequate medical care
 with life expectancy of 73.2 years, 99 percent literacy, and a
 general lack of poverty.
 The right to work is guaranteed to every Luxembourger by the
 Constitution. The employment of children under the age of 16,
 however, is prohibited. The normal workweek is 40 hours,
 spread over 5 workdays. Work on Sunday is generally
 prohibited, except in continuous process industries (like
 steel) and for individuals such as maintenance and security
 personnel.
 Worker representatives are required in all businesses of 15 or
 more employees. In businesses with over 150 employees, 50
 percent of the joint works councils are elected by the
 employees, and in those with more than 1,000 employees,
 one-third of the boards of directors must be employees.
 Although few women in Luxembourg are senior executives, the
 situation is gradually changing as women become increasingly
 involved in the political process and enter the financial and
 business community.

 LUXEMBOURG
 About 26 percent of Luxembourg's population are foreigners,
 and although immigration is now low, the foreign population is
 growing gradually while the native Luxembourg population is
 declining. Economic recession has created a slight rise in
 unemployment. However, Luxembourg remains notably free from
 social and related political instability.
