 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of
 the Commonwealth of Nations. A Prime Minister, a cabinet and a bicameral legisla-
 tive assembly compose the Government. A Governor General, appointed by the Brit-
 ish monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial powers. Prime
 Minister Lester B. Bird's Antigua Labor Party (ALP) has controlled the Government
 and Parliament since 1976. During the last elections in March 1994, the ALP re-
 tained power by capturing 10 of 17 parliamentary seats, down from the 15 it held
 under the administration of V.C. Bird Sr., the current Prime Minister's father. The
 Governor General appoints the 15 senators, 11 with the advice of the Prime Min-
 ister and 4 with the advice of the opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the small Antigua and Barbuda
 Defence Force. The police are organized, trained, and supervised according to Brit-
 ish law enforcement practices and have a reputation for respecting individual rights
 in the performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. Tourism
 is the most important source of foreign exchange earnings. The country is burdened
 by a large and gwing external debt which remains a serious economic problem.
 Although the Government generaliy respected constitutional provisions for politi-
 cal and civil rights, opposition parties complained that they received no coverage or
 opportunity to express their views on the gvernment-controlled electronic media.
 Societal discrimination and violence against women also continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Inluding Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Crue, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respected
 these prohibitions.
 Conditions at the lone, 8th-cntury-vintage prison ar he  i   and repairs are
 still being carried out a year after hurricane Luis bit Antigua. While the prison is
 not overcrowded, death row prisoners get exercise only three times a week, and all
 prisoners receive only one meal a day, consisting mostly of cornmeal mush and a
 small piece of fish or chicken. Prisoners are permitted to supplement their diet if
 their relatives are able to bring food to the prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Crimi-
 nal defendants have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their de-
 tention. The police must bring detainees before a court within 48 hours of arrest
 or detention. Opposition leaders claim the Government has developed a pattern of
 arresting suspects on Fridays and holding them until Tuesdays in order to prolong
 the incarceration. Most of these cases involve youths suspected of narcotics viola-
 tions.
 There were no reports of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is part of the Eastern Carib-
 bean legal system and reflects historical ties to the United Kingdom. The Priy
 Council in London is designated by the Constitution as the final court of a ppea,
 which is invariably employed in the case of death sentences. There are no milit"ary
 or political courts. The Constitution provides that criminal defendants receive a fair,
 open, and public trial. In capital cases only, the Government provides legal assist-
 ance at public expense to persons without the means to retain a private attorney.

 Courts can reach verdicts quickly, with some cases coming to conclusion in a matter
 of days.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 the press, and other forms of communication. The authorities generally respect
 these provisions in practice. However, the Government dominates the electronic
 media-the only daily source of news-and effectively denies equal coverage to oppo-
 sition parties. The Government owns one of the two general interest radio stations
 and the single television station. A religious station broadcasts without impediment.
 One of the rime Minister's brothers owns the second radio station, an another
 brother is the principal owner of the sole cable television company. The government-
 controlled media report regularly on the Government's and the ruling party's activi-
 ties but the opposition party has alleged that it is provided neither coverage in the
 electronic media, nor access.
 The sole daily newspaper criticizes the Government on a variety of issues. When
 the newspaper tried to start a radio station, police shut down the station claiming
 that it did not have a license to operate. The owners sued the State for illegal search
 and seizure and claimed that their constitutional right to broadcast had been vio-
 lated.
 Political opposition parties and private sector organizations such as the Chamber
 of Commerce publish several weekly newspapers which offer a variety of opinions
 without government interference.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. The police normally issue the required permits for
 plic meetings, but sometimes deny them in order to avert violent confrontations.
 hle the authorities placed some restrictions on demonstrations in the past, the
 opposition held numerous rallies, public meetings, and a large march with no inter-
 ference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status. The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise. However, government
 practice on refugee and asylum cases remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewpoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The law obligates the Government to hold voter registration during a fixed
 period (of only 5 days) each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives
 free of government interference.
 Except for a period in opposition from 1971 to 1976, the ALP has held power con-
 tinuously since 1951. The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding mo-
 nopoly on patronage and its influence over access to economic opportunities make
 it extremely difficult for opposition parties to attract membership and financial sup-
 port. In 1992 public concern over corruption in government spawned the merger of
 three opposition political parties into the United Progressive Party (UPP). The UPP
 succeeded in increasing its representation to seven seats from five during the 1994
 election. Opposition and press regularly charge members of the Government with
 corrupt practices.
 No women have been elected or currently serve in the House of Representatives.
 Two women are senators, which are appointed positions. Eight of the 14 ministry
 Permanent Secretaries (the top civil servant position in ministries) are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 from individuals or international human rights groups during the year.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and the Government generally observed its provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a recognized social problem. It is treated as
 a matter of public conscience, and there are nongovernmental social welfare groups
 focused on the problem. Women in many cases are reluctant to testify against their
 abusers. Police generally refrain from intervening in cases of domestic violence, and
 some women have charged credibly that the courts are lenient in such cases.
 While the role of women in society is not legally restricted, economic conditions
 tend to limit women to home and family, particularly in rural areas, although some
 women work as domestics, in agriculture, or in the large tourism sector. The Gov-
 ernment promised in previous years to provide better programs and educational op-
 portunities for both sexes as well as family planning services, but failed to imple-
 ment any new programs during the year. The Directorate of Women's Affairs exists
 to help women advance in government and the professions, but progress was slow.
 Children.--Child abuse remains a hidden problem. While the Government repeat-
 edly expressed its commitment to children's rights, it made no significant efforts to
 protect those rights in practice, and abuse tends to go unpunished.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no specific laws mandating accessibility for
 the disabled, but there are constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination
 against the physically disabled in employment and education. There is no evidence
 of widespread discrimination against physically disabled individuals, although the
 Government does not visibly enforce the constitutional antidiscrimination provi-
 sions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. Al-
 though fewer than 50 percent of workers belong to unions, the important hotel in-
 dstry is heavily unionized. Antiga and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the
 Antign Trades and Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antiga Workers' Union (AWU).
 The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the larger and more active AWU
 is rather loosely allied with the opposition.
 The Labor Code recognizes the right to strike, but the Court of Industrial Rela-
 tions may limit this right in a given dispute. Once either party to a dispute requests
 the court to mediate, there can be no strike. Because of the delays associated with
 this process, unions often resolve labor disputes before a strike is called.
 Unions are free to affliate with internatilona lo  oniations and do so in
 practice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labo or rganizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and
 there were no reports that it occurred. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation are not required to rehire employees fired for union activities, but must pay
 full severance pay and full wages lost by the employee from the time of firing until
 the determination of employer fault. There are no areas of the country where union
 organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law stipulates a minimum
 working age of 13, which is respected in practice. The Ministry of Labour, which
 is required by law to conduct periodic inspections of workplaces, has responsibility
 for enforcement. There have been no reports of minimum age employment viola-
 tions. The political strength of the two major unions and the powerful influence of
 the Government on the private sector combine to make the Ministry of Labour very
 effective in enforcement in this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law established minimum wages for var-
 ious work categories in 1981. The lowest minimum wage, for domestic workers, is
 $0.46 (EC$1.25) per hour, the highest minimum wage, for skilled labor, is $1.30
 (EC$3.50) per hour. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but in practice tof reat majority of workers
 earn substantially more than the minimum wage.
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day workweek, but in practice the stand-
 ard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum of 12
 days of annual leave and up to 13 weeks of maternity leave.

 There are no occupational health and safety laws or regulations; thus there is no
 provision for a worker to leave a dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
