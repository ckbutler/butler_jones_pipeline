 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a tradition of democratic parliamen-
 tary rule. Queen Margrethe II is titular Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable
 to the unicameral Folketing (parliament), leads the Government. A minority coali-
 tion led by Prime Minister Poul Schlueter has governed since 1982.
 Denmark has a unified national police. Its higher ranks are often filled with law-
 yers on internal rotation from the civil service. It is fully controlled by and respon-
 sible to civilian authorities.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has a mixed economy combining private
 and public ownership. The Government is seeking ways to reduce the public sector's
 share of the economy. Personal freedoms and the right to pursue private interests
 and to hold private property are protected by law andrespected in practice.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition, a lively press, and
 highly developed educational and social we are systems have made Denmark a
 leading defender of human rights in the world. Anyone may protest to an Ombuds-
 man, established by the Folketing as mandated by the Constitution, if he or she
 feels wrongly treated by any national or municipal authority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.--Such killings did not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. Torture does not occur. Allegations of inhuman
 treatment are rare, and there are legal means of redress when it occurs. Two cases
 alleging excessive use of police force against African tourists were investigated; the
 result was a 1992 court finding that force was used, but that it was not done to
 gain information or a confession, or to punish, frighten, or coerce. Finally, the court
 'nd that the force was not used as a manifestation of discrimination.
 An innovative Center for Torture Victims (from abroad) at a Copenhagen hospital,
 supported by the Foreign Ministry, treats patients, assists torture victims, and stud-
 ies ways to hinder the use of torture worldwide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-No person may be deprived of personal
 libertv without due orocess of law. Those arrested must appear before a judge with-
 
 
 760
 in 24 hours. A judge may order that they be held in pretrial detention, including
 detention in isolation, for a period up to the length of the prison sentence for the
 crime for which they were arrested. All accused have the right to obtain their own
 attorney or a public attorney. Bail is allowed. There is no exile.
 e. Den/al  Fair Public Tria.-The Danish judicial system consists of a series of
 courts, local and regional, up to the Supreme Court. Trials are usually public; judges
 may make exceptions, e.g., in paternity and divorce cases. In criminal cases, trials
 are closed when necessary to protect a victim's privacy, such as in rape cases, or
 to safeguard a witness' identity.
 The rights of the accused are carefully protected. Defendants have the right to be
 present, to confront witnesses and to present evidence. They enjoy the presumption
 of innocence. Both the defendant and the prosecution may appeal a sentence. The
 judiciary is fully independent. Judges apinted by the Minister of Justice serve
 until age 70. They may not be dismissed lut may be impeached for negligence or
 criminal ads. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Priacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 constitutional prohibition against searching homes, seizing papers, and breaching
 the secrecy of communications without a court order is respectedb
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system ensure freedom of speech and press. There is one
 large state-owned radio and television company. Editorial control is exercised by a
 board independent of the Government. A second national television channel is one-
 third government subsidized. In both cases, management decides progrmming con-
 tent, but operational decisions are restricted by government mandate. Programs
 critical of the Government appear on both channels. The growing popularity of cable
 television and satellite dishes has greatly increased access to foreign news broad-
 casts.
 The state radio operates the only normal wattage stations. The Government has
 said it will favorably consider an independent nationwide radio station. Private sta-
 tions are otherwise restricted to transmitters of 10 watts for radio or 100 watts for
 television. Direct relay transmission of foreign radio broadcasts such as those of the
 Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation is prohibited, although
 both are carried on the cable net.
 Publications, including books and newspapers, reflect a wide variety of political
 opinion. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Danes may freely assemble
 and form associations. Public meetings require permits, which are routinely given.
 Any organization may affiliate with international bodies in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom. The
 Evangelical Lutheran Church is the state church and is state supported. No religion
 is banned or discouraged; conversion is unrestricted. No one may be discriminated
 against for religious beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Danes have full freedom of travel and movement. Persons determined
 to be political refugees are never repatriated against their will. However, the Gov-
 ernment decided in 1991 to start repatriating persons who had been unsuccessful
 in claiming political asylum. In 1991, over 100 Palestinians affected by this decision
 took refuge in a state church to-protest the decision. The situation was resolved this
 year when a special law was passed by the Folketing letting the Palestinians stay,
 but makinF clear that others denied asylum would be returned to their homelands.
 A large influx of asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia began in September
 1992; Denmark's financial and logistical resources are being stretched to help ab-
 sorb the new arrivals. By year's end about 14,000 new asylum seekers had entered
 Denmark. This was more than three times as many as came last year, and signifi-
 cantly more than came in the previous record years of the mid-1980's (the era of
 the Iran-Iraq war). The Minister of Justice is considering a reexamination of the
 country's liberal asylum rules with a view to restricting the inflow of asylees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Danes have the right to change their government peacefully. Ministers are re-
 sponsible to the Folketing and may be removed by a vote of no confidence. The
 Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen after consultation with parties in the
 Folketing. Parliamentary elections must take place every 4 years, or earlier by deci-
 sion of the Prime Minister a parliamentary vote of no confidence, or the Govern-
 ment's resignation. The Foiketing's 179 members are chosen in free and open elec-
 
 
 761
 tions under a complex system of proportional representation designed to help small
 parties and to reflect the opular vote. Twelve parties ran in the 1990 election;
 eight, with a wide range o political views achieved the minimum 2 percent of the
 vote needed to obtain seats. The current dovernment is a two-party minority coali-
 tion. Danes over 18 years of age may vote. Foreigners who are permanent residents
 may both vote and run in local elections; they hold 13 city council seats nationwide.
 Women head 4 ministries and hold 56 seats in the Parliament. There are no restric-
 tions, in law or in practice, on the participation of women in government or politics.
 The territories of Greenland (which has a primarily Inuit population) and the
 Faroe Islands (whose inhabitants have their own language) have democratically
 elected home rule governments with broad powers encompassing all but foreign and
 security affairs. Greenlanders and Faroese are Danish citizens and enjoy the same
 human rights as in Denmark. Each territory elects two representatives to the
 Folketing.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations operate freely. The Danish Center for
 Human Rights, a gvernment-Eunded institution, conducts research and provides in-
 formation on human rights. Denmark is party to various international human rights
 conventions that promote and protect human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The extensive state welfare system ensures that every member of Danish society
 regardless of race, religion, sex, age, or ethnic background is provided with food,
 shelter, health care, and education. Children in Denmark are protected by law; par-
 ents are required to protect children from physical and psychological abuse. The au-
 thorities act quickly to protect children from actually or potentially abusive or ne-
 glectful parents.
 The rights of the people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands are well protected.
 Greenlandic law is specially designed for Inuit customs. It provides for the use of
 local people, rather than outsiders, as judges. There are holding centers-rather
 than prisons--whose inmates are encouraged to work, hunt, or fish during the day.
 Despite a recent high level of violence and murders in Greenland, the Government
 rejected suggestions that the treatment of criminals be made more severe.
 The inflow of ethnically and racially dissimilar refugees and immigrants (mostly
 Iranians, Palestinians, and Sri Lankans, but in late 1992, overwhelmingly former
 Yugslavians) has provoked tensions between Danes and immigrants. Incidents of
 random racially motivated violence occur. The Government effectively investigates
 and deals with all cases of racially motivated violence. In a major case, the Supreme
 Court rejected racial and ethnic quotas in public housing. Towns may no longer
 limit the number of immigrants who can live in a building. Proponents claimed the
 policy prevented ghettos, while opponents thought it was discriminatory.
 Denmark places no restrictions on the participation of women in the civilian work
 force. Women hold positions of authority throughout society, including in politics,
 though they are much less represented at the top of the business world. Some 76
 percent of all women between 16 and 66 years old work; 46 percent of the work force
 is female, while 22 percent of all supervisors are women. Wage inequality exists,
 but wages are generally high for both women and men.
 Danish authorities do not tolerate, in law or in practice, violence or abuse against
 women or children. Crimes against women and children are considered serious and
 are vigorously investigated. Experts estimate, however, that very few cases of do-
 mestic violence are reported. Denmark has no programs for the prevention of rape
 and domestic violence, but there are 30 crisis centers for counseling and housing vic-
 tims which are supported by local governments, volunteer workers, and donations.
 In addition, Denmark's first center for abused men and its first shelter for abused
 families opened in 1991.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law states that all workers, including military
 personnel and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing. Approximately
 80 percent of Danish wage earners belong to unions, which are independent of the
 Government and political parties. The Danish Federation of Trade Unions (LO)
 which includes about half of the country's work force, remains closely associated
 with the Social Democratic Party. Over the years there have been a few-but widely
 reported-incidents in which workers who joined trade unions not affiliated with the
 LO were harassed or rejected by members of the mainstream unions in the work-
 place. All but civil servants have the right to strike. The number of workdays lost
 due to labor conflicts in 1991 was 100,979. Unions may freely affiliate with inter-
 
 
 762
 national organizations and do so actively. Greenland and the Faroes have the same
 respect for worker rights, including full freedom of association, as Denmark.
 b. The Right to Organize and Br4ain Co/leetivedy.-Workers and employers ac-
 knowledge eh othe's right to orgaze. Collective bargaining is widespread. In the
 private sector, salaries, benefits, and working conditions ax agred upon in biennial
 negotiations between the various employers' associations and the union counter-
 parts. In the event of a stalemate, the Federtion of Danish Empoera' Associations
 and the IA) will conduct these negotiations. If the negotiations f u, a national con-
 ciliation board tasked with mediating labor contracts mediates, and its proposal is
 voted on by both management and labor. If the proposal is turned down, the Gov-
 ernment may force a legislated solution on the parties (usually baaed upon the me-
 diators' proposal). The agreements, in turn, are used as guidelines by the rest of the
 labor mairket, including the public sector. Collective bargaining in the public sector
 is conducted between the public sector employees' unions and government represent-
 atives, led by the FinancetiMinity.
 Labor relations in Greenland, a beneficiary of the Generalized System of Prf-
 ernces, are conducted in the same manner as in Denmark. Working conditions are
 negotiated through collective bargaining, usually led by the largest Greenlandic
 union, SIK, which has about 8,000 members, virtually the entire indigenous work
 force. In disputes, Greenlandic courts are the first recourse, hut Danish mediation
 services or the Danish Labor Court may also be used.
 In the Faroes, there are several important unions, but there is no umbrella labor
 organization. Labor relations inprinciple are a matter between management and
 labr. Between them, they decide on salaries, wages, and terms of employment.
 Should the parties not be able to reach an agreement, a mediator is called in to re-
 solve the dispute. Faroese legislation exists to regulate conditions of apprenticeship,
 cost-of-living adjustments to negotiated wages, minimum wages in the fisheries se-
 trlength of the workweek, and annual vacations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for full-time
 employment is 5. Te law prescribes specific limitations on the employment of
 those btween 15 and 18 years of   and it is enforced by the Agency for Super-
 vision of Labor Standards, n autonomous arm of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Workn-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage, but the lowest wage in any national labor agreement is sufficient for
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Danish law provides for 5 weeks
 of paid vacation, and a 37-hour workweek is generally applied. Danish law pr-
 scribes onditions of work, including safety antihealth; duties of employers, super-
 visors, and employees; work performance; rest periods and days off; ndmedicaex-
 aminations. The Labor Inspection Service ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations without jeopardizing
 their employment, and there are legal protections for workers who file complaints
 aboutunaeorunealthy conditions.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the Farces, except that
 their workweek remains at 40 hours, and there is no publicly supported unemploy-
 ment insurance available. Unemployment benefits in bth places are either con-
 tained in the labor contract agreements or come from the general social security sys-
 tem. Sick pay and maternity pay, as in Denmark, fall under the social security sys-
 tem.
