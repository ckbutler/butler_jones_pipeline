 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of a dispute between
 the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front, an organization seeking inde-
 pendence for the region. The Moroccan Government sent troops and settlers into the
 northern two-thirds of the Western Sahara after Spain withdrew from the area in
 1975 and extended its administration over the southern province of Oued Ed Dahab
 after Mauritania renounced its claim in 1979. The Moroccan Government has under-
 taken a sizable economic development program in the Western Sahara as part of
 its long-term efforts to strengthen Moroccan claims to the territory.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front has challenged the claims of Spain, Mauritania,
 and Morocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces fought intermittently
 from 1975 to the 1991 ceasefire and deployment to the area of a United Nations
 peacekeeping contingent, known by its French initials, MINURSO.
 In 1975 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the sta-
 tus of the Western Sahara. The Court held that while the region's tribes had histori-
 cal ties to Morocco, the ties were insufficient to warrant recognition of Moroccan
 sovereignty. According to the court, the people of the Western Sahara, called
 Sabrawis, are entitled to self-determination. Most Sahrawis live in the area con-
 trolled by Morocco, but there is a sizable refugee population near the Western Saha-
 ran border, in Algeria, and, to a lesser extent, in Mauritania. The bulk of the
 Sahrawi population lives within the area delineated by a Moroccan-constructed
 berm, which encloses most of the territory.
 Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sovereignty
 question collapsed in 1984 when the OAU recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic
 Republic, the civilian arm of the Polisario Front. Morocco withdrew from the OAU
 in rotest.
 1988 Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted the United Nations' plan for a
 referendum that would allow the Sahrawis to decide between integration with Mo-
 rocco or independence for the territory. IThe referendum was scheduled for January
 1992, but was postponed because the parties were unable to agree on a common list
 of eligible voters-despite theprevious acceptance by both parties of an updated ver-
 sion of the Spanish census of 1974 as the base for voter eligibility. A complicated
 formula for determining voter eligibility was ultimately devised, and in August
 1994, MINURSO personnel began to hold identification sessions for voter applicants.
 The voter identification process ground to a halt in December 1995 and, after sev-
 eral fruitless efforts to coax the two parties to cooperate, the United Nations Secu-
 rity Council formally suspended the identification process in May. The United Na-
 tions and friendly governments have continued to urge the two parties to seek a po-
 litical solution to the conflict, but efforts thus far have yielded no results.
 Since 1977 the Saharan provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in local elections organized and controlled by the Moroccan Government.
 The southern province of Oued Ed Dahab has participated in Moroccan-controlled
 elections since 1983. Sahrawis whose political views are aligned with Rabat fill all
 10 seats allotted to the Western Sahara in the Moroccan Parliament.
 The civilian population living in the Western Sahara under Moroccan administra-
 tion is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign human rights groups
 report that Sahrawis have difficulty obtaining Moroccan passprts, that the Govern-
 ment monitors the political views of Sahrawis more closely than those of Moroccan
 citizens, and that the police and paramilitary authorities react especially harshly
 against those suspected of supporting independence and the Polisario Front. Access
 to the territory is limited by the Moroccan Government and international human
 rights organizations and impartial journalists have sometimes experienced dif-
 ficulty in securing admission.
 After years of denying that Sahrawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government released 300 such prisoners in
 1991. Entire families and Sahrawis who had disappeared in the mid-1970's were
 among those released. The Government has failed to conduct a public inquiry or to
 explain how and why those released were held for up to 16 years in incommunicado
 detention without charge or trial.
 There are a number of other Sahrawis, including Kelthoum el-Ouanat, who re-
 main imprisoned for peaceful protests urging Saharan independence. EI-Ouanat is
 currently serving a 20-year term after being arrested in October 1992 following a
 demonstration in Smara. Prior to her trial she was held in secret detention for up
 to 10 months during which time she reportedly was beaten, tortured, and sexually
 abused.
 
 
 1354
 In May 1995, 8 Sahrawi youths were arrested for demonstrating for Sahrawi inde-
 pendence; in June 1995, they were given 20-year sentences. The sentences were
 later commuted to 1 year by the King, and the 8 Sahrawis were released in July,
 14 months after having been taken into custody. They report that they continue to
 be closely monitored by the Moroccan police.
 There are credible reports that 10 Sahrawis were arrested, beaten, and kept in
 seclusion in May following demonstrations in several cities of the Western Sahara
 in support of Sahrawi independence. Reportedly these 10 demonstrators have been
 sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from 18 months to7 years.
 The Polisario Front claims that the Government continues to hold several hun-
 dred Sahrawis as political prisoners and approximately 300 prisoners of war
 (POW's). The Government formally denies that any Sahrawi noncombatants remain
 in detention. On October 31, Morocco released 66 Sahrawi combatants who were
 flown to the Tindouf area of Algeria under International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) auspices. They were accompanied by foreign diplomats. The Govern-
 ment also claims that 30,000 Sahrawi refugees are detained against their will by
 the Polisario in camps around Tindouf, Algeria. The Polisario denies this charge.
 There are credible reports that the number of refugees far exceeds 30,000, but their
 desire to return to their homeland is unclear.
 The ICRC also reports that the Polisario now holds approximately 1,900 Moroccan
 POWs. A group of 185 POW's was repatriated to Morocco in a humanitarian airlift
 conducted under ICRC auspices in November 1995.
 Both the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front refuse to repatriate the
 remaining POW's, claiming that the U.N. settlement plan calls for the release of
 POW's only after the identification process is complete. This rationale only delays
 progress on this issue, given the indefinite suspension of the U.N. identification
 process in May.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. Elsewhere, security forces subject travelers to arbitrary questioning and de-
 tention.
 There is little organized labor activity in the Western Sahara. The same labor
 laws that apply in Morocco are applied in the Moroccan-controlled areas of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccan unions are present in the Moroccan-controlled Western
 Sahara but are moribund. The 15 percent of the territory outside Moroccan control
 does not have any major population centers or economic activity beyond nomadic
 herding. The Polisario-sponsored labor union, the Sario Federation of Labor, is not
 active in the Western Sahara.
 There were no strikes, other job actions, or collective bargaining agreements dur-
 ing the year, but on August 3 a group of approximately 1,000 young Sahrawis dem-
 onstrated in Rabat, urging the Government to create job opportunities for them. On
 August 8, this group attempted to block a major roadway, and reportedly several
 demonstrators and police officers were injured in the ensuing scuffle. On August 10,
 after receiving assurances of high-level attention, the demonstrators returned to the
 Western Sahara. A ministerial delegation from Rabat subsequently traveled to the
 Western Sahara to discuss the concerns of the demonstrators. Most union members
 are employees of the Government or state-owned organizations. They are paid 85
 percent more than their counterparts outside the Western Sahara. Workers in the
 Western Sahara are exempt from income and value-added taxes and receive sub-
 sidies on such commodities as flour, oil, sugar, fuel, and utilities.
 Moroccan law prohibits forced labor, which does not appear to exist in the West-
 ern Sahara.
 Regulations on the minimum age of employment are the same as in Morocco.
 Child labor appears to be less common than in Morocco, primarily because of the
 absence of industries most likely to employ children, such as rug knotting and gar-
 ment making. A government work program for adults, the Promotion Nationale, pro-
 vides families with enough income that children need not be hired out as domestic
 servants. Children in the few remaining nomadic groups presumably work as shep-
 herds along with other group members.
 The minimum wage and maximum hours of work are the same as in Morocco. In
 practice, however, workers in some fish processing plants may work as much as 12
 hours per day, 6 days per week, well beyond the 10-hour day, 48-hour week maxi-
 mum stipulated in Moroccan law. Occupational health and safety standards are the
 same as those enforced in Morocco. They are rudimentary, except for a prohibition
 on the employment of women in dangerous occupations.

 OMAN
 The Sultanate of Oman is a monarchy which has been ruled by the Al Bu Sa'id
 family since the middle of the 18th century. It has no political arties or directly
 elected representative institutions. The current Sultan, Qaboos Win Sa'id Al Sa'id,
 acceded to the throne in 1970. Although the Sultan retains firm control over all im-
 portant policy issues, he has brought tribal leaders--even those who took up arms
 against his family's rule-as well as other notables into the Government. In accord-
 ance with tradition and cultural norms, much decisionmaking is by consensus
 among these leaders. In 1991 the Sultan established the 59-seat Consultative Coun-
 cil or Majlis Ash-Shura, which replaced an older advisory body. The Government
 sefects Council members from lists of nominees proposed by each of the 59 wilayats
 (regions). After the first national census in 1993, the Sultan expanded the member-
 ship of the new Council to 80 seats. The Council has no formal legislative powers
 but may question government ministers, even during unrehearsed televised hear-
 ings, and recommend changes to new laws on economic and social policy, sometimes
 leading to amendments to proposed decrees. On November 6, the Su tan promul-
 gated by decree the countys first written "basic law," which provides for citizens'
 basic ihts in writing for the first time. It also provides for a bicameral body known
 as the Majlis Oman (Council of Oman), which is to include a new Council of State
 (Majlis Al-Dawla), and the current Consultative Council.
 The internal and external security apparatus falls under the authority of the Min-
 istry of Palace Office which coordinates all intelligence and security policies. The In-
 ternal Security Service iall matters related to internal security. The
 Royal Oman Police, whose hea also has cabinet status, performs regular police du-
 ties, provides security at airports, serves as the counts i gration agency, and
 maintains a small coast guard. There are credible reports that security forces occa-
 sionally abused detainees.
 Since 1970 Oman has used its modest oil revenue to make impressive economic
 progress and improve public access to health care, education, and social services.
 Oman has a mixed economy with significant government participation in industry,
 transportation, and communications. The Government seeks to diversify the econ-
 omy and stimulate private investment.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny important human rights. Human
 rights abuses include arbitrary arrest, mistreatment of detainees, prolonged deten-
 tion without charge, and the denial of due process. The Government restricts free-
 dom of expression and association and does not ensure full rights for workers and
 women. As a practical matter, the people do not have the right to change their gov-
 ernment.
 The new basic law provides for many basic human rights, e.g., an independent
 judiciary, freedom of association, speech, and press. The basic law permits the Gov-
 ernment 2 years to adopt the necessary implementing decrees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Security forces abuse some detainees, particularly during interrogation. The abuse
 does not appear to be systematic and often varies depending upon the social status
 of the victim and the official involved. Techniques range from sleep deprivation to
 harsher measures such as hanging a bound victim from a steel bar in such a way
 that the wrists must support the full weight of the body. Security officials some-
 times beat detainees but are often careful to conceal evidence of abuse by employing
 such tactics as restricting blows to less visible areas of the body. Detainees are
 sometimes left in isolation with promises of release or improved treatment as a fur-
 ther means to elicit confessions or information. Although judges have the right to
 order investigations of allegations of mistreatment, there is no recent evidence that
 any officer has been punished for abusing detainees. The new basic law, yet to be
 implemented, specifically prohibits "physical or moral torture" and that all confes-
 sions obtained by such methods will be considered null and void.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons. Neverthe-
 less, prison conditions appear to meet minimum international standards. Access to
 some prisoners is severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The police may obtain warrants prior to
 making arrests but are not required by law to do so. The authorities must obtain
 
 
 1356
 
 court orders to hold suspects in pretrial detention. Within24 hours of arrest, the po-
 lice are required to file charges or ask a magistrate judge to order continued deten-
 tion. In practice, however, the police do not always follow these procedures. Judges
 may order detentions for 14 days to allow investigation and may  rant extensions
 if necessary. There is a system of bail. The announced new basic law provides for
 certain legal and procedural rights for detainees.
 Police handli  of arrests and detentions constitutes incommunicado detention in
 some instances-   e police do not routinely notify a detainee's family or, in the case
 of a foreign worker, the worker's sponsor of the detention. Sometimes notification
 is made only just prior to the detainee's release. The authorities post a list of per-
 sons scheduled for trial near the magistrate court building in Muscat. The police
 do not always permit attorneys and family members to visit detainees. Judges occa-
 sionally intercede to ensure that security officials allow such visits.
 The Government does not practice exile as a form of punishment. The new basic
 law prohibits exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The various courts are subordinate to the Sultan
 and subject to his influence. The Sultan appoints all judges, acts as a court of final
 appeal, and intercedes in cases of particular interest, especially in national security
 cases. However, there have been no reported instances in which the Sultan has
 overturned a decision of the magistrate courts or the Authority for Settlement of
 Commercial Disputes (ASCD). The announced new basic law affirms the independ-
 ence of the judiciary The judiciary comprises the magistrate courts, which adju-
 dicate misdemeanors and criminal matters; the Islamic, or Shari'a, courts, which ad-
 judicate personal status cases such as divorce and inheritance; the ASCD; the Labor
 are a        an  the Rent Dispute Committee, which hears tenant-landlord dis-
 putes. A State Security Court tries cases involving national security and criminal
 cases which the Government decides require expeditious or especially sensitive han-
 dling. Magistrate ourt judges have p resided over trials in the State Security Court.
 The Criminal Code does not         the rights of the accused. There are no writ-
 ten rules of evidence, or codified procedures or entering cases into the criminal sys-
 tem, or any legal provision for a public trial. Criminal procedures have developed
 by tradition and precedents in the magistrate courts. In criminal cases, the police
 provide defendants with the written charges against them; defendants are presumed
 inncent and have the right to present evidence and confront witnesses. The pros-
 ecution and the defense question witnesses through the judge, who is usually the
 only person to question witnesses in court.
 There are no jury trials. A singl]e judge tries misdemeanors; a panel of three
 judges tries felonies and security offenses. Magistrate court judges must be citizens.
 Public prosecutors are enior police officers. They may bring additional charges after
 defense attorneys have inspected the charge sheet or during trial.
 A detainee may hire an attorney but has no explicit right to be represented by
 counsel. The Government does not pa for the legal representation of indigents.
 Judges often pronoueence  ed            e     within 1 day after the completion
 of a trial. Defendants may appeal jail sentences longer than 3 months and fines over
 the equivalent of $1,300 to a three-ncge panel. Defendants accused of national secu-
 rity offenses and serious felonies  no have the right of appeal. Death sentences,
 which are rare, cannot be carried out without the Sultan's approval.
 In June the Omani press announced that the Government had convicted 69 males
 in the State Security Court of crimes involving rape, kidnaping, torture, theft, and
 fraud. An undisclosed number of persons were acquitted, and some of those con-
 victed were minors. Since the cases were tried in the State Security Court, the con-
 victs may appeal only to the Sultan. Their sentences ranged from 6 months to 25
 years. Defendants tried by the Security Court are not permitted to have legal rep-
 resentation present. The timing and the location of the Court's proceedings are not
 publicly disclosed. The Court does not follow legal procedures as strictly as the mag-
 istrate courts, although prominent civilian jurists form the panel. The Sultan has
 exercised his powers of leniency including in political cases.
 There are no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice are not required by law to obtain search warrants. There is a widespread belief
 that the Government eavesdrops on both oral and written communications, and
 Omanis are guarded in both areas. Citizens must obtain permission from the Min-
 istry of Interior to manry foreigners, except to nationals from the Gulf Cooperation
 Council (GCC) countries. Such permission is not automatically granted. Delays or
 denial of permission have resulted in secret marriages within Oman. Marriages in
 foreign countries can lead to denial of entry into Oman of the foreign spouse and
 prevent a legitimate child from claiming citizenship rights.
 
 
 1357
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law prohibits criticism of the Sultan in any
 form or medium. The authorities tolerate criticism of government officials and agen-
 cies, but such criticism rarely receives media coverage. The announced new basic
 law provides for freedom of opinion expressed in words, writing, or all other media
 within the limits of the law.
 The 1984 Press and Publication Law authorizes the Government to censor all do-
 mestic and imported publications. Ministry of Information censors may act against
 any material regarded as politically, culturally, or sexually offensive. However, jour-
 nalists and writers generally censor themselves to avoid government harassment.
 Editorials reflect the Government's views, although the authorities tolerate some
 criticism on foreign affairs issues. The Government discourages in-depth reporting
 on controversial domestic issues and seeks to influence privately owned dailies and
 periodicals by subsidizing their operating costs.
 The Government prohIbits the entry onto the market of foreign newspapers and
 magaines containing reports or statements deemed critical of Oman. Customs offi-
 cials sometimes confiscate video cassette tapes and erase offensive material. The
 tapes may or may not be returned to their owners. Government censorship decisions
 are periodically changed without apparent reason. At least two books for sale locally
 for a number of years were banned in 1996, one when it was released in Arabic
 translation. The lifting of the boycott against Israel has eliminated prohibitions on
 publications from or about Israel that meet other censorship standards. There is a
 general perception that the confiscation of books and tapes at the border from pri-
 vate individuals and restrictions on popular novels has somewhat eased. However,
 it has reportedly become more difficult to obtain permission to distribute books that
 censors decide have factual errors about Oman (including outdated maps) in the
 local market.
 The Government controls the local radio and television companies. They do not
 air any politically controversial material. The Government does not allow the estab-
 lishment of privately owned radio and television companies. However the availabil-
 ity of satellite dishes has made foreign broadcast information accessible to the pub-
 lic.
 The appropriate government authority, such as Sultan Qaboos University, the po-
 lice, or the relevant ministry must approve public cultural events, including plays,
 concerts lectures, and seminars. Most organizations avoid controversial issues due
 to fear that the authorities may cancel their events. Academic freedom is restricted,
 particularl regarding controversial matters, including politics. Professors may be
 missed or going beyond acceptable boundaries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law does not guarantee
 freedom of assembly. All public gatherings require government sponsorship. The au-
 thorities do not always enforce this requirement, and gatherings sometimes take
 place without formal government approval. Regulations implemented in 1994 re-
 stricting most types of public gatherings remain in effect. The new basic law pro-
 vids for limited freedom of assembly.
 Current law states that the Ministry of Social Affair and Labor must approve
 the establishment of all associations and their bylaws. Despite this ruling, some
 rups ar allowed to function without formal registration. The Government uses
 the power to license associations as a means to control the political environment.
 It doe not license groups regarded as a threat to the predominant social or political
 views of the Sultanate. Formal registration of associations for expatriates is limited
 to a maximum of one association for any nationality. The new basic law's provi-
 sions-not yet in effect-regulate the formation of associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, which is affirmed by the new
 basic law. The new basic law provides that Islamic law (Shari'a) is the basis for leg-
 islation and preserves the freedom to practice religious rites, in accordance with tra-
 dition, provided that does not breach public order. Discrimination against individ-
 uals on the basis of religion or sect is prohibited. Implementing decrees for the new
 basic law have not yet been established.
 Most Omanis are Tbadhi or Sunni Muslims, but there is also a minority of Shi'a
 Muslims. Non-Muslims are free to worship at churches and temples built on land
 donated by the Sultan. There are many Christian denominations which utilize two
 plots of donated land on which two Catholic and two Protestant churches have been
 built. Hindu temples also exist on government provided land. Other land has been
 made available to Catholic and Protestant missions in Sohar and Salalah.
 The Government prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing Muslims. It also pro-
 hibits non-Muslim groups from publishing religious material, although material
 printed abroad may be brought into the country. Members of all religions and sects
 are free to maintain links with coreligionists abroad and undertake foreign travel
 
 
 1358
 for religious purposes. Due to government restrictions on public gatherings, there
 has been a substantial curtailment of non-Muslim religious celebrations in recent
 years.
 The police monitor mosque sermons to ensure that the preachers do not discuss
 political topics and stay within the state-approved orthodoxy of Islam. The Govern-
 ment expects all imams to preach sermons within the parameters of standardized
 texts distributed monthly by the Ministry of Justice, Awqaf, and Islamic Affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel by citizens within the country
 except to military areas. Foreigners, other than diplomats, must obtain a govern-
 ment pass to cross border points. While a man may travel abroad freely, a woman
 must have authorization from her husband, father, or nearest male relative to ob-
 tain a passport.
 Until the promulgation of the basic law, the Government did not have a policy
 on refugees, or a tradition of harboring stateless or undocumented aliens. The new
 basic law prohibits the extradition of political refugees. The issue of the provision
 of first asylum did not arise in 1996. Oman offered temporary refuge to several
 thousand Yemenis in 1994 displaced by a civil war. They returned to Yemen follow-
 ing the war's end. Tight control over the entry of foreigners into the country has
 effectively screened out would-be refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Oman is an autocracy in which the Sultan retains the ultimate authority on all
 important foreign and domestic issues. The country has no formal democratic politi-
 cal institutions, and its citizens do not have the ability peacefully to change their
 leaders or the political system.
 The Sultan promulgated Oman's first defacto written constitution, known as the
 basic law, in November. Although it has immediate force of law, laws and regula-
 tions to implement its provisions are to be phased in over a 2-year period. The law
 does not provide for political parties or direct elections. Citizens have indirect access
 to senior officials through the traditional practice of petitioning their patrons, usu-
 ally the local governor, or wali, for redress of grievances. Successful redress depends
 on the effectiveness of the patron's access to appropriate decisionmakers. The Sultan
 appoints the governors. The Sultan makes an annual 3-week tour of the country,
 accompanied by his ministers. The tour allows the Sultan to listen directly to his
 subjects' problems.
 In 1991 Sultan Qaboos established a Consultative Council, or Majlis Ash-Shura.
 In 1994 he expanded the number of council seats to 80 from the original 59, a move
 which allocated 2 members for districts with a higher population. The Government
 selected the council members from several nominees elected in caucuses of promi-
 nent persons in each district. Caucus participants are also subject to government
 approval. In some cases, nominees with the most votes did not win appointment to
 the Council. The Council has no formal legislative powers, which remain con-
 centrated in the Sultan's hands. However, it serves as a conduit of information be-
 tween the people and the government ministries. No serving government official is
 eligible to be a Council member. The Council may question government ministers
 in public or in private, review all draft laws on social and economic policy, and rec-
 onimend legislative changes to the Sultan, who makes the final decision. The new
 basic law p-ovides for a Majlis Oman (Council of Oman), which is to consist of the
 Majlis Ash-Shura (Consultative Council), and a new body, the Majlis A-Dawla
 (Council of State). The Sultan announced that the members of the new Council are
 to be directly appointed, that the franchise in the 1997 Majlis Ash-Shura elections
 would be expanded, and that female candidates would be permitted in all districts
 for the first time.
 The Sultan has publicly advocated a greater role for women in both the public
 and private sectors. In 1994 the Government selected two women to serve on the
 Consultative Council.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government prohibits the establishment of human rights groups. The exist-
 ing restrictions on the freedom of speech and association do not permit any activity
 or speech critical of the Government. There were no known requests by inter-
 national human rights organizations to visit Oman.
 
 
 1359
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The announced new basic law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, ethnic
 origin, race, religion, language, sect, place of residence, and social class. However,
 decrees to implement its provisions have not been promulgated. Institutional and
 cultural discrimination based on gender, race, religion, social status, and disability
 exists.
 Women.-There is no evidence of a pattern of spousal abuse although observers
 say that allegations of such abuse in the Shari'a Courts are not uncommon. Defini-
 tive information is scant and difficult to collect. Doctors do not have a legal respon-
 sibility to report either spouse or child abuse cases to the courts. Battered women
 may file a complaint with the police but more often seek family intervention to pro-
 tect them from violent domestic situations. Likewise, families seek to intervene to
 keep such problems out of public view. There have been reports that employers or
 male coworkers have sexually harassed foreign females employed in such positions
 as domestic servants and hospital nurses. Foreign women employed as domestic
 servants and garment workers have complained that their employers have withheld
 their salaries and that government officials have been unresponsive to their griev-
 ances. Individuals known to be abusing domestics are not always brought to account
 for their actions. A few foreign women have had to ask their government's embassy
 for shelter to escape abuse.                  I
 Most women live within the confines of their homes. They continue to face many
 forms of discrimination. Illiteracy among older women hampers their ability to own
 property, participate in the modern sector of the economy, or even inform them-
 selves of their own rights. Government officials frequently deny women land grants
 or housing loans and prefer to conduct business with a woman's husband or other
 male relative.
 Some aspects of Islamic tradition also discriminate against women. Islamic law
 favors male heirs in adjudicating inheritance claims. Many women are reluctant to
 take an inheritance dispute to court for fear of alienating the family.
 However, since 1970 conditions for women have improved dramatically in several
 areas. Whereas in 1970 no schools existed for girls, the most recent figures available
 from the Ministry of Education report an enrolment rate of 86.7 percent for all girls
 eligible for elementary school. In the 1995-96 school year, female students con-
 stituted 50 percent of the total number of students attending public schools. Women
 constitute roughly half of the 4,500 students at Sultan Qaboos University. In No-
 vember, 453 women and 282 men received bachelors degrees as members of the sev-
 enth graduating class while 8 women and 2 men received masters degrees. The Uni-
 versity has a quota system with the apparent goal of increasing the number of men
 studying certain specialities. Reportediy, women are being limited to 50 percent of
 the seats in the medical department and are not permitted to take degrees in engi-
 neering and archeology. The quotas will allow women to constitute a majority in
 some other departments.
 Women have also made gains in the work force. Some educated women have at-
 tained positions of authority in government, business, and the media. Approximately
 20 percent of all civil servants are women. In both the public and private sectors,
 women are entitled to maternity leave and equal pay for equal work. The bureauc-
 racy, the country's largest employer of women, observes such regulations, as do
 many private sector employers. Still, many educated women face job discrimination
 because prospective employers fear they might resign to marry or raise families.
 Several women employees in the Government have complained that they have been
 denied promotion in favor of less capable men. Government grants for study abroad
 are limited almost exclusively to males.
 Children.-The Government has made the health, education, and general welfare
 of children a budgetary priority. The infant mortality rate continues to decline, and
 comprehensive immunization rates have risen. There is no pattern of familial or
 other child abuse. A few communities in the interior and in the Dhofar region still
 practice female genital mutilation (FMG). FMG is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological heath. Ex-
 perts believe that the number of such cases is small and declining annually. Oman
 ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1996 with reservations
 relating to freedom of children to choose a religion and government spending limits.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has mandated parking spaces and
 some ramps for wheelchair access in private and government office buildings and
 shopping centers. Compliance is voluntary. Students in wheelchairs have easy ac-
 cess to Sultan Qaboos University. The Government has established several rehabili-
 tation centers for disabled children. Disabled persons, including the blind, work in

 government offices. Free government medical assistance to all citizens includes
 physical therapy and prosthetics support for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Some members of the Shi'a Muslim minority claim they
 face discrimination in employment and educational opportunities. Some members of
 this same community, however, occupy prominent positions in both the private and
 public sectors.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Citizens of east African origin complain that
 they frequently face job discrimination in both the public and private sectors. Some
 public institutions reportedly favor hiring members of one or another regional, trib-
 al, or religious group. However, no rup is banned from employment.
 Members of the Shihuh tribe in the strategic province of Musandam have charged
 that security authorities have harassed and detained tribe members who complain
 about alleged inattention or mistreatment by the central Government.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government has not yet promulgated a new
 labor law first drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor in 1994. The Con-
 sultative Council later recommended some changes, and at year's end the Govern-
 ment continued to review these additional changes to the proposed law. Government
 officials have said that the new labor code will be consistent with international labor
 standards. The current law stipulates that "it is absolutely forbidden to provoke a
 strike for any reason."
 Labor unrest is rare. Although strikes are technically illegal, workers sometimes
 stage job actions. In general these disputes are settled without police intervention.
 In L994 the Government joined the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The current law does not pro-
 vide for the right to collective bargaining. It requires, however, that employers of
 more than 50 workers form a joint labor-management committee as a communica-
 tion forum between the two groups. The implementation of this provision is uneven,
 and the effectiveness of these committees is questionable. In general the committees
 discuss such questions as living conditions at company-provided housing. They are
 not authorized to discuss wages, hours, or conditions of employment. Such issues
 are specified in the work contracts signed individually by workers and employers
 and must be consistent with the guidelines of the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Labor.
 The current law defines conditions of employment for some Omanis and foreign
 workers. It covers domestic servants and construction workers but not temporary
 workers or those with work contracts that expire within 3 months. Foreign workers
 constitute at least 50 percent of the work force and as much as 80 percent of the
 modern-sector work force.
 Work rules must be approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and
 posted conspicuously in the workplace by employers of 10 or more workers. Simi-
 larly, any employer with 50 or more workers must establish a grievance procedure.
 Regardless of the size of the company, any employee, including foreign workers, may
 file a grievance with the Labor Welfare Board. Sometimes worker representatives
 file collective grievances, but most grievances are filed by individual workers. Lower
 paid workers use the procedure regularly. Plaintiffs and defendants in such cases
 my be represented by legal counsel.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits compulsory
 labor but investigative and enforcement mechanisms are lacking. Foreign workers
 sometimes find themselves in situations amounting to forced labor. In such cases,
 employers withhold letters of release, a document releasing the worker from his em-
 ployment contract, which allow him to switch jobs. Without the letter, a foreign
 worker must continue to work for his current employer or become technically unem-
 ployed-which is sufficient grounds for deportation. Many foreign workers are not
 aware of their right to take such disputes before the Labor Welfare Board. Others
 are reluctant to file complaints for fear of retribution from unscrupulous employers.
 In most cases, the Board releases the grievant from service and awards compensa-
 tion for time worked under compulsion. Employers face no other penalty than to re-
 imburse the worker's back wages.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 13 from working. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor enforces this
 prohibition. In practice, however, the enforcement often does not extend to some
 small family businesses which employ underage children, particularly in the agricul-
 tural and fisheries sectors. Children between 13 and 16 years of age may be em-
 ployed but must obtain the Ministry's permission to work overtime, at night, on
 weekends or holidays, or perform strenuous labor.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor issues
 minimum wage guidelines for various categories of workers. The minimum wage for
 nonprofessional workers is about $156 (60 rials) per month. Minimum wage guide-
 lines do not cover domestic servants, farmers, government employees, or workers in
 small businesses. Many foreigners work in fields exempt from the minimum wage
 statute. The Government is lax in enforcing minimum wage guidelines for foreign
 workers employed in menial jobs. However, foreign workers with high skills are fre-
 quently paid more than their Omani counterparts.
 The minimum wage is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family. The compensation for foreign manual laborers and clerks is sufficient
 to cover living expenses and to permit savings to be sent home.
 The private sector workweek is 40 to 45 hours and includes a rest period from
 Thursday afternoon through Friday. Government officials have a 35-hour workweek.
 While the law does not designate the number of days in a workweek, it requires
 at least one 24-hour rest period per week and mandates overtime pay for hours in
 excess of 48 per week. Government regulations on hours of employment are not al-
 ways enforced. Employees who have worked extra hours without compensation may
 file a complaint before the Labor Welfare Board, but the Board's rulings are not
 binding.
 Every worker has the right to 15 days of annual leave during the first 3 years
 of employment and 30 days per year thereafter. Employers provide many foreign na-
 tionals, including maids, with annual or biannual round-trip tickets to their coun-
 tries of origin.
 All employers are required by law toprovide first aid facilities. Work sites with
 over 100 employees must have a nurse. Employees covered under the labor law may
 recover compensation for injury or illness sustained on the job through employer-
 provided medical insurance. The health and safety standard codes are enforced by
 inspectors from the Department of Health and Safety of the Directorate of Labor.
 As required by law, they make on-site inspections.
 The law states that employers must not place their employees in situations in-
 volving dangerous work. However, the law does not specifically grant a worker the
 right to remove himself from dangerous work without jeopardy to his continued em-
 ployment.
