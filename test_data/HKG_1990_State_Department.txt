 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a
 free society with legally protected rights but without a broad
 democratic base. Its constitutional arrangements are defined
 by letters patent and royal instructions. Executive powers
 are vested in a British crown-appointed governor who holds
 extensive authority; ultimate control over the territory,
 however, rests with the United Kingdom Government. The
 Governor, by convention, rarely exercises the full extent of
 his powers. The Government is advised by an Executive
 Council, the equivalent of a cabinet. The Legislative Council
 enacts legislation and approves the budget. The Judiciary is
 an independent body adhering to English common law with
 certain variations. Fundamental rights ultimately rest on
 oversight by the British Parliament. In practice, however,
 Hong Kong largely controls its own internal affairs.
 A well-organized civilian police force maintains public order
 and respects human rights of the populace. There have been,
 however, reports of harsh treatment of Vietnamese refugees by
 police forces during raids at refugee camps (see Section 2.d.).
 Hong Kong's free market economy has developed into a center of
 light manufacturing and international finance. It serves as
 an investment center for trade with China and as a
 communication and transportation hub for Asia. The 1990
 growth rate of 2.5 percent was considerably less than the 10-
 percent growth rate of previous years.
 The June 1989 Beijing massacre severely shook local confidence
 in the territory's future prospects when it reverts to control
 by China in 1997. In response to these concerns, the
 Government in July formally introduced into the legislature a
 bill of rights, modeled on the International Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights. Dealing with such matters as equal
 protection under the law and freedom of opinion and
 expression, the bill would override existing common law or
 statutory enactments. After the enactment of the bill of
 rights, there would be at least a 1-year "freeze" to enable
 preexisting laws to be made compatible with the bill. In
 another move to strengthen the territory's democratic
 foundation, the Government in March also agreed to calls from
 the public to improve representative government by increasing
 the number of members to be elected in the territory's first
 direct legislative elections, scheduled for 1991. Problem
 areas remained the inability of the people to change their
 government, questions about some powers of arrest and search,
 potential film censorship, and treatment of refugees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.

 HONG KONG
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other extreme forms bf abuse are forbidden by law
 and subject to punishment. In July a bill to repeal the
 imposition of corporal punishment (flogging) was introduced in
 the Legislative Council. Authorities indicated that the
 decision had been reached on the basis of a review of Hong
 Kong's obligations under the U.N. Convention against Torture
 and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, and the
 territory's proposed bill of rights.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 British legal protections and common law traditions govern the
 process of arrest and detention. However, Hong Kong's
 loitering law has been criticized by human rights groups.
 Under the law, loitering can be considered a criminal act. In
 July the law reform commission, an organization appointed by
 the Governor, recommended that parts of the loitering law be
 repealed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Hong Kong's judicial and legal systems are organized according
 to principles of British constitutional law and legal
 precedents and feature, inter alia, an independent judiciary
 and trial by jury. The right to a fair trial is guaranteed
 and practiced.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is generally respected and provided for
 by law. However, the extraordinary powers of the Independent
 Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) have been criticized by
 some human rights groups. The ICAC has independent authority
 to search premises and bank records, and it operates on the
 assumption that any excessive, unexplainabie assets held by a
 civil servant are considered to be ill gotten until proved
 contrary. The ICAC's extensive powers are expected to be
 modified or changed as a result of the enactment of the bill
 of rights.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is a tradition of free speech and press as practiced in
 Great Britain--numerous views and opinions, including those
 independent or critical of the British and Hong Kong
 Governments, are aired in the mass media, public forums, and
 by political groups. However, in July five political
 activists were convicted and fined by a magistrate's court for
 an incident in February during which they used megaphones
 without permits to protest the Basic Law being drafted by
 China. The court dismissed charges against a sixth person.
 The decision of the Government to prosecute the six persons,
 whom the Chinese Government branded as "subversives," was
 criticized by some local observers as political harassment and
 cited as evidence of the Government's intention to curb the
 prodemocracy message at the behest of the Chinese Government.
 The five who were convicted are appealing their case.
 
 
 1335
 
 HONG KONG
 International media organizations operate freely in Hong Kong
 but restrictions may be placed on the press under several
 ordinances of Hong Kong law. Such restrictions have rarely
 been imposed by the Government, however, which over the last
 few years has introduced legislation effectively eliminating
 earlier stricter provisions. Hong Kong media representatives
 have expressed concern over the provision of the 1988 film
 censorship ordinance that permits the censoring of a film if
 the film would seriously damage good relations with other
 territorial units. There was no repetition of the incident
 last year when the authorities ordered cuts in a documentary
 film about events in China during 1989 for fear of seriously
 damaging relations with the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).
 Nevertheless, some persons may well practice self-censorship
 when dealing with the subject of China.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are practiced without hindrance. At times the
 Government, on the grounds of maintaining public order and
 security, has imposed limits on the size of groups presenting
 formal petitions to government authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion in Hong Kong.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel documents are obtainable freely and easily, subject to
 neither arbitrary nor discriminatory practices. There is
 freedom of movement within Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong
 citizens, though citizens of a British dependent territory, do
 not enjoy the right of abode in the United Kingdom. In the
 wake of the heightened concern over the future of the
 territory after the Chinese Government's June 4, 1989,
 crackdown in Beijing, the British Parliament passed the
 British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act of 1990 in July to grant
 full U.K. citizenship--including U.K. passports with the right
 of abode in Britain--to 50,000 heads of family and their
 dependents up to a total of 225,000 persons. The aim of the
 legislation is to convince selected Hong Kong people that with
 their new full British citizenship as an insurance policy,
 they should remain in Hong Kong to contribute to its future
 rather than emigrate. Many in Hong Kong, however, criticized
 the number of persons granted full British citizenship as
 insufficient. The Chinese Government has warned it may not
 recognize British passports granted under the nationality
 package and may restrict the provision of British consular
 protection to persons granted citizenship under the 1990 act.
 In response to the large outflow of boat people from Vietnam
 to Hong Kong, the Government implemented a screening program
 for all Vietnamese arriving in Hong Kong after June 16, 1988.
 All new arrivals are detained. Those who are determined not
 to be refugees are held in prison-like camps until their
 repatriation to Vietnam can be arranged in cooperation with
 the .United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 The United Kingdom has also accepted responsibility, on behalf
 of Hong Kong, to implement all provisions of the multilateral
 Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) adopted by the June 1989
 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees. Amnesty
 International and other human rights organizations have
 
 
 1336
 
 HONG KONG
 criticized the refugee status determination procedures. Among
 the deficiencies cited are inadequate access to legal advice
 and representation, adjudicator prejudgment, and inadequate
 statement of reasons for denials; The UNHCR, which is
 actively involved in monitoring the procedures, stated that
 the Hong Kong authorities have crrected many deficiencies,
 and evaluated the system overall as fair.
 In February a lawsuit was filed in Hong Kong by 10
 unsuccessful asylum seekers seeking to overturn the decision
 that they did not qualify for refugee status. The matter is
 not expected to be resolved until mid-1991. The potential
 ramifications of the lawsuit are significant in that--if the
 plaintitfs prevail and the courts find that the procedures
 were seriously flawed--the Government would have to consider
 whether to reprocess the 15,000 cases already decided under
 the existing system.
 The Vietnamese boat people situation stabilized in 1990 with
 approximately 6,000 new arrivals, compared to 34,000 in 1989
 and 18,000 in 1988. As a result of continued resettlement
 efforts and the expanding voluntary repatriation program, at
 the end of the year there were fewer Vietnamese asylum seekers
 in Hong Kong (52,000) than there had been at the end of 1989.
 The Government built 20,000 more spaces for asylum seekers to
 reduce overcrowding and to prepare for additional arrivals.
 At the same time, the Government closed some of the less
 suitable facilities such as the San Yick and Sham Shui Po
 detention .centers. Sporadic, internecine violence plagued the
 largest of the detention centers, Whitehead (25-,000
 residents), during the first part of 1990. On May 4, the
 Government launched a major raid of the center, searching
 every resident, regardless of age, and searching everyone's
 possessions for contraband. The UNHCR protested the use of
 force and tear gas during the operation. Over 2,500 homemade
 knives and swords were seized in the raid. Shortly afterward,
 the Government transferred 168 male detainees, largely from
 Whitehead, to a separate, more secure detention center. Some
 of the men transferred were identified as having been involved
 in thefts and extortion. Others were selected because they
 were "troublemakers." The UNHCR is monitoring the selection
 process and the conditions in this center to prevent abuse by
 government authorities.
 In November a Hong Kong judge ordered the release- of 111 boat
 people who had stopped in Hong Kong when their boat developed
 engine trouble while enroute to Japan. The Hong Kong
 Government .determined it was not cost effective to repair or
 replace their boat, and put them in detention. They had been
 detained 18 months at the time of their release. However, the
 HKG immediately rearrested them, only to release them on token
 bail the next day after a storm of criticism both in Hong Kong
 and abroad.that the authorities had undermined the rule of
 law.
 No forcible repatriation of Vietnamese boat people took place
 in 1990. From January to mid-December 1990, 5,221 people
 returned to Vietnam voluntarily, bringing the total number of
 voluntary returns since Hong Kong began screening to 6,095.
 On September 21 the U.K., Vietnam, and the UNHCR reached an
 agreement to increase the repatriation of Vietnamese asylum
 seekers who fail to qualify for refugee status in Hong Kong.
 The accord pledged to accelerate voluntary Depatriations to
 1,00 per month, and to expand repatriation to include a new
 "nonobjector" category--those who do not-volunteer, but do not
 
 
 1337
 
 HONG KONG
 object to being returned to Vietnam. According to an
 aide-memoire annexed to the agreement, Vietnam will provide
 the same guarantees of fair treatment, reintegration
 procedures, and assistance as volunteers. Since 1980 the
 Government ha; routinely deported Chinese illegal immigrants
 back to China. In 1989 an average of 43 illegal immigrants
 were arrested each day.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 While Hong Kong is a free society with most individual
 freedoms and rights protected by law and custom, citizens of
 the territory do not have the right to change their
 government. The Governor is appointed by, and serves at the
 pleasure of, the Crown. He is advised on policy by an
 appointed Executive Council. Legislation is enacted and funds
 provided by the Legislative Council (Legco), which also
 debates policy and questions the administration. Though the
 Governor has the ultimate control of the administration of
 Hong Kong, by convention he rarely exercises the full extent
 of his powers. In practice, decisions are arrived at by
 consensus. At present, representative government employing
 universal franchise does not exist.
 Universal direct elections are employed to fill a majority of
 seats on grassroots advisory district boards but less- than
 half the seats in the municipal councils. There are indirect
 elections every 3 years to- fill 26 of 57 seats in the Legco.
 Ex-officio members or official or appointed members chosen by
 the Governor occupy the remaining seats.
 In April China's National People's Congress formally passed
 the Basic Law, which is to serve as a type of constitution for
 Hong Kong when it becomes a special administrative region of
 China in 1997. The Basi& Law provides for a strong executive
 to be chosen or recommended through indirect elections and
 appointed by Beijing and a legislature elected partly through
 direct elections and partly through indirect elections. The
 Legco passed a motion expressing its disappointment with the
 formulation of the future political structure; and in April it
 passed a stronger motion calling for amendments to the Basic
 Law.
 Citing the need to maintain a politically stable environment
 for continued economic growth, the Government opted to
 democratize through an "evolutionary" approach. In response
 to popular demands, the Government agreed to a somewhat faster
 timetable of political reform in the transition period leading
 up to 1997. In March it announced that, of the 60 Legco seats
 at stake in 1991, 18, rather than the original 10, would be
 directly elected in the first such direct Legco elections in
 Hong Kong's history. A number of political parties,
 representing a broad spectrum of political opinion, have been
 formed or are in the process of forming to contest these
 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has consistently cooperated with international
 and nongovernmental organizations on human rights issues. The
 UNHCR and nongovernmental human rights organizations have full
 access to Hong Kong's centers for Vietnamese boat people.
 
 
 1338
 
 HONG KONG
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Chinese language has equal status with English in many
 government operations. Enabling legislation passed in March
 1987 provides for principal legislation to be enacted on a
 bilingual basis. The Attorney General's chambers, moreover,
 is responsible for translating existing laws into Chinese.
 Legco proceedings are also bilingual. The Government is
 moving ahead quickly in its efforts to "localize" the civil
 service by increasing the number of Hong Kong Chinese in top
 administrative and policymaking positions.
 In 1987 the Government passed a domestic violence ordinance
 covering violence inflicted on a legal spouse, cohabitant, or
 children under 21 years of age. In addition, domestic
 violence may be prosecuted as common assault under existing
 criminal'statutes. The Government enforces these laws and
 prosecutes violators. Beginning in 1984, procedures were
 established with police, hospitals, doctors, and voluntary
 agencies to report instances of domestic violence and abuse to
 the Social Welfare Department. Reports are investigated by a
 case worker. If hospital treatment is required, a resident
 medical social worker offers the victim counseling and
 information about shelter, child care, separation, and
 divorce, as necessary. Government officials say that violence
 against women is generally not widespread. Figures for cases
 of battered spouses known to the Government have been dropping
 over the past 3 years from 685 in 1987/88 to 433 in 1988/89
 and 252 in 1989/90. Admissions to two women's refuges, one
 operated by the Social Welfare Department and the other by
 Harmony House, a private voluntary agency, have not shown a
 dramatic increase. The number of women admitted to Harmony
 House ranged from 166 in 1988, 105 in 1989, and 141 as of late
 1990. Figures for the government-run refuge showed a similar
 trend: 126, 97, and 139. However, a local women's rights
 group says that the problem of domestic violence has not been
 significantly alleviated. Harmony House reports a fourfold
 increase in calls to its 24-hour telephone hot line, installed
 early in 1990. All sources say that many instances of
 domestic violence are not reported, owing partly to cultural
 factors, but also to a lack of well-publicized information
 about assistance and resources available.
 The Bill of Rights, if enacted in its present form, is
 expected to end traditional male succession rights in the
 rural New Territories.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right-of association and the right of workers to establish
 and join organizations of their own choosing are guaranteed
 under local law. Trade unions must be registered under the
 Trade Union Ordinance. The basic precondition for
 registration is that at least seven persons must serve in the
 same occupation. Once registered, unions become corporate
 bodies and enjoy immunity from certain civil suits involving
 breaking of contingent contracts or interference with trade
 owing to work stoppages by their members. Unions also have
 the right to elect their own representatives, publicize their
 views, and determine their own bylaws and pblicies in
 representing members' interests. The Government does not
 discourage or impede union formation. An amendment to the
 
 
 1339
 HONG KONG
 Trade Union Ordinance in 1988 permits unions to maintain
 political action funds which are restricted to local elections.
 Nonetheless, only about 437,000 workers (or 15.6 percent) out
 of a total labor force of 2.8 million belong to one of the 481
 registered unions. Apathy toward unionism on the part of
 workers, reinforced by the Confucian cultural heritage and its
 emphasis on family responsibility, is the principal reason for
 this phenomenon.
 The principal governmental and nongovernmental institutions
 that interact with the trade unions are the Legislative
 Council, the Department of Labor, the Labor Advisory Board,
 and the Labor Tribunal. Currently, two seats in the
 Legislative Council are set aside for labor representatives
 indirectly elected by the constituency. The Department of
 Labor (DOL) initiates labor legislation, monitors the
 territory's compliance with international conventions,
 enforces local regulations, and mediates or arbitrates in
 labor-management disputes. The Labor Advisory Board (LAB)
 advises the Commissioner for Labor on matters of interest to
 the local work force; trade unions and employer organizations
 elect eight of the representatives, while the remaining four
 are appointed by the commissioner. In May the six labor
 representatives of the LAB threatened a general strike to
 protest a government plan to import labor. However, the labor
 unions did not carry through on their threat.
 Work stoppages from January to November resulted in the loss
 of 3,495 workdays. Work stoppages and strikes are permitted.
 However, there are some restrictions on this right for civil
 servants. Employees hired on a contract basis can be fired
 for breach of contract if they walk off the job.
 Hong Kong labor unions may form federations, confederations,
 or affiliate with international bodies. Any affiliation with
 outside labor unions needs the consent of the Government; no
 request has been turned down. The three major federations are
 the pro-PRC Federation of Trade Unions (81 affiliated unions
 with about 174,000 members), the Independent Confederation of
 Trade Unions (21 affiliated unions with a membership of
 97,000) and the pro-Taiwan Trades Union Council (70 affiliated
 unions with a membership of about 18,000).
 As a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong is
 not a member in its own right of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The United Kingdom makes declarations on
 behalf of Hong Kong concerning the latter's obligations
 regarding the various ILO Conventions. To date Hong Kong has
 implemented provisions applying 29 conventions in full and 18
 others with modifications. In the-Basic Law, China has
 undertaken to continue to adhere to these conventions after
 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 under local law. Hong Kong laws pertaining to collective
 bargaining cover mainly the shipping, textile, public
 transport, public utility, and carpentry trades, and the
 catering, construction, public service, and teaching
 professions. Wages are usually set by employers on the basis
 of market factors. While collective bargaining does take
 place, it is not widely practiced, and in general there are no
 mechanisms specifically to encourage it. Hong Kong law does,
 
 
 1340
 HONG KONG
 however, provide for a system to handle settlement of
 disputes. Free conciliation service is afforded by the DOL's
 labor relations division to employers and employees involved
 in labor disputes or grievances. It also carries out
 promotional activities through visits to employers' and
 employees' organizations; organizes training courses, talks
 and seminars; and assists employers in setting up, jointly
 with labor, consultation machinery. In the case of disputes,
 if initial conciliation efforts are unsuccessful, the dispute
 may be referred to arbitration with the consent of the
 parties, or a board of inquiry may be established to
 investigate and make suitable recommendations. Use of this
 system is widespread. Workers are protected against antiunion
 discrimination under Hong Kong legislation. Employees who
 allege such discrimination have the right to have their cases
 heard by the DOL's labor relations division. Employers who
 attempt to prevent or deter an employee from joining a labor
 union, or who terminate an employee for joining a labor union,
 are liable to a fine of approximately $650. There are no
 export processing zones in Hong Kong. Export-oriented firms
 operate under the same labor laws as other firms.
 Individual labor claims are adjudicated by the Labor Tribunal,
 a part of the judicial branch, which provides quick,
 inexpensive machinery for resolving disputes arising between
 workers and management over breach of contract, wages in lieu
 of notice or termination of service, arrears of wages, and
 other claims relating to pay. The tribunal complements the
 conciliation service provided by the DOL's labor relations
 division.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Existing labor legislation prohibits forced labor, and it does
 not appear to be practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the Women and Young Persons Regulations and Employment
 for Children Regulations, minors are allowed to do limited
 part-time work in nonindustrial establishments beginning at
 age 13, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9
 years' education. They are allowed to engage in full-time
 work at age 15. Employment of females under age 18 in
 establishments subject to liquor regulations is prohibited.
 The Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to
 ensure that working hours conform to the law and that no
 persons under the age of 15 are employed full-time. During
 1989, the Inspectorate carried out 219,217 inspections of more
 than 11,000 establishments in industrial and nonindustrial
 sectors, which resulted in 159 cases of child employment
 brought before the courts. Some labor observers maintain,
 however, that successful prosecution against employers who
 hire underaged workers are rare, partly because of the
 inadequate number of inspectors and partly because of the
 reluctance of workers to testify against their employers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage. Wage rates are
 determined by supply and demand. The overall average daily
 wage rate for workers is about $23 a day, with men receiving
 about $28 and women $20. The average wage for unskilled male
 workers ranges from about $20 a day in the manufacturing
 sector to about $38 a day in construction; women make roughly
 
 
 1341
 
 HONG KONG
 20 to 25 percent less than men. In view of continued
 tightness in Hong Kong's labor market (an average annual
 unemployment rate of 1.3 percent in 1989Y, higher wages were
 offered to workers, particularly in the construction industry
 and service sectors. Many employees also enjoy a year-end
 bonus of 1 month's pay or more. Some employers in the
 manufacturing sector provide workers with various kinds of
 fringe benefits, including subsidized meals or food
 allowances, free medical treatment, and free or subsidized
 transport. The Women and Young Persons Regulations under the
 employment ordinance control hours and conditions of work for
 women and young people in industry. Hours of work are limited
 to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. for
 women and 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. for young persons under 18. There
 are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. Overtime
 is restricted to 2 hours per day and 200 hours per year for
 women; it is prohibited for all persons under 18.
 There were a series of well publicized complaints about
 working conditions for foreign workers, the majority of whom
 are employed as domestics and are primarily from the
 Philippines and Thailand. After the DOL failed to resolve
 their problems, the domestics formed an organization to
 petition their respective consulates. Some illegal immigrants
 complained that their employers turned them in to the Hong
 Kong authorities just before payday, causing them to be
 deported before receiving their salaries.
 The Labor Department's Factory Inspectorate promotes workers'
 safety and health in industry through education, publicity,
 and inspection in accordance with the Factories and Industrial
 Undertakings Ordinance and subsidiary regulations. The
 Inspectorate pays particular attention to safety in high-risk
 areas on construction sites. From April to October 1989,
 inspectors visted 781 construction sites and issued 417
 -summons. As part of a complementary effort, the Department's
 Occupational Health Division investigates claims of
 occupational diseases, conducts environmental testing in the
 workplace, and provides medical examinations to employees in
 occupations which involve the handling of hazardous
 materials. Independent labor unions maintain that the lack of
 qualified factory inspectors, who number about 230, is a
 longstanding problem.
