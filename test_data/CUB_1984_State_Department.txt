 CUBA
 Cuba is a Communist state ruled by one man and a handful of
 close collaborators, most of whom fought with him in the
 revolution that brought them to power 26 years ago. Together
 with tne state, the Cuban Communist Party dominates all
 aspects of daily life, controlling the means of production and
 tae distribution of all goods, as well as internal security,
 public communication, health and education. Internal security
 is under the direction of the Ministry of Interior, which
 operates border guards and several other police forces,
 regulates immigration, and maintains a system of neighborhood
 informers and block wardens known as the Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution.
 Cuba had an expanding, modernizing economy with a strong
 private sector and a growing middle class prior to the
 revolution; today scarcity is the hallmark of the Cuban
 economy and most basic necessities are rationed. Some
 consumer items are sold at extremely high prices in the
 government-run 'parallel market' to absorb excess currency and
 inhibit black marketeering. There is no private sector, and
 inefficiency, absenteeism and low productivity characterize
 the state sector of Cuba's economy. As a result, people must
 wait in long lines for insufficient quantities of low quality
 foodstuffs and manufactured goods.
 The capricious release of a number of political prisoners
 during 1984 brought confirmation of continued abuses of basic
 human rights by the Cuban Government, as well as the denial of
 fair public trial, the use of torture and other inhuman
 practices. Arrests continue, many political prisoners have
 been kept in jail after the expiration of their sentences, and
 defense lawyers have been arrested and sentenced to lengthy
 jail terms merely tor having tried to defend Cubans accused of
 political offenses. There is no freedom of speech or press in
 Cuba, the practice of religion is highly restricted, and some
 Cubans are so desperate to leave the country that they have
 risked being shot to death by Cuban security personnel while
 trying to enter foreign embassies in Havana. Cuba has refused
 to allow representatives of outside human rights organizations
 to visit the country, and it continues to deny the flagrant
 violations of the most basic human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 After the Castro Government seized power in 1959, it promptly
 began a series of staged trials and summary executions of the
 regime's opponents. There are credible reports that the use
 of executions, as a way of discouraging political dissent,
 continues to tnis day. In 1983, a group of would-be trade
 union organizers were initially sentenced to death for trying
 to form a free trade union, while members of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses were executed for alleged crimes related to
 religious practices.
 According to credible information sent out of Cuba in the
 summer of 1984 by the unofficial ,Cuban Committee on Human
 Rights,* 37 persons were executed by firing squads bitween
 
 
 485
 CUBA
 October, 1983 and May, 1984. The Committee also asserted that
 131 individuals were condemned to death during the same
 period. Former political prisoner Jorge Valls Arango, who was
 released in 1984, has stated that he saw many executions
 during his more than 20 years in prison.
 b. Disappearance
 When individuals are arrested by the Cuban secret police, the
 detainees' friends, neighbors and family members risk
 retribution if they dare to inquire about them. Rarely are
 persons accused and tried publicly; more common is a secret
 trial followed by unacknowledged sentencing. Sometimes the
 individual may be interrogated and released, often returning
 too frigntened to tell anyone about the experience. A special
 category of Cubans--those who have emigrated, have become
 citizens of another country and then return to Cuba--are
 subject to a highly irregular type of disappearance. These
 dual nationals are not acknowledged as nationals of the second
 country by the Cuban Government, and if they are arrested when
 they visit Cuba, consular access to them is denied. If they
 disappear, the Cuban Government refuses to provide any
 information about them to authorities of their new homeland.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report on Cuba highlights the
 cases of long-term political prisoners Silvino Rodriguez
 Barrientos and Guillermo Casasus Toledo who were removed from
 tneir cells in Boniato Prison in 1983 by agents of state
 security and have not been seen or heard from since.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A aumber of political prisoners released in June, 1984,
 provided first hand descriptions of the continuing Cuban use
 of physical and psychological torture, such as playing of high
 decibel tapes, continuous threats of death, and withholding of
 food, water and medical assistance. Basilio Guzman Marrero,
 who as a young man was active in the revolution against the
 Batista regime in the late 1950's, had spent 21 years as a
 political prisoner in Cuban jails. He described his ordeal to
 members of the University of Maryland student chapter of
 Amnesty International, describing the plight of a political
 prisoner arrested at the age of 12, who is now 32, and telling
 them that forced labor is common, as are beatings at the hands
 of sadistic guards. Another former political prisoner, Andres
 Vargas Gomez, has stated that brutality by guards resulted in
 broken arms and cracked skulls among political prisoners.
 Freed political prisoner Jorge Valls Arango described "all
 sorts of physical, psychological and moral violence exerted
 upon" political prisoners, including the putting out of a
 prisoner's eye with a bayonet. The Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission has repeatedly denounced the degrading
 treatment of political prisoners in violation of the American
 Declaration, deficient medical treatment, and the deplorable
 condition of the Cuban prisons.
 In some Cuban prisons, prisoners are held in tiny cells or
 small drawer-like spaces. Fellow inmates disappear without
 explanation, and many are thought to have been executed.
 Political prisoners who refuse to agree to political
 indoctrination or to be classified as common criminals are
 known as *plantados," and are particularly abused within
 Cuba's prison system. They spend their days dressed only in
 pajamas or underwear, or naked. Visits are limited to one or
 
 
 CUBA
 two per year or less, and letters to one per month. Political
 prisoners are not routinely released at the end of their terms;
 instead they are freed at the whim of Fidel Castro, often to
 gain favor with an influential foreign visitor to Cuba. It is
 quite common for political prisoners to remain jailed after
 the expiration of lengthy (e.g., twenty years) sentences. Of
 the 26 political prisoners released in June, 1984, 21 had been
 incarcerated more than one year beyond the expiration of their
 sentences. The 1984 Amnesty International Report expressed
 that organization's main concern about the Cuban Government's
 .practice of not releasing long-term political prisoners who
 had completed their sentences.'
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 As noted above, arrests are sometimes made secretly, and
 people arrested for vandalism, practicing religion, or
 criticizing the regime are often charged with serious crimes
 such as sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities. In
 1984, five youths ranging in age from 16 to 19 were sentenced
 to terms of up to five years in jail for writing 'Viva Reagan'
 and "Viva U.S.A.' on school walls. An American residing in
 Cuba, who expressed a personal opinion in a non-violent manner
 to a group of Cubans regarding Cuban activities in Grenada,
 was arrested, tried, found guilty, and sentenced to six years
 in prison for spreading "enemy propaganda." When the U.S.
 Government protested this harsh and unreasonable sentence, the
 Cuban Government rejected the protest and charged that the
 U.S. was attempting to interfere in the administration of
 Cuban justice.
 Ricardo Bofill, a former political prisoner who was
 re-arrested in September, 1983, for attempting to discuss
 Cuban human rights abuses with visiting foreign journalists,
 was still in jail at the end of 1984. He has continued his
 human rights activities on behalf of fellow prisoners inside
 prison and he was able to smuggle letters out of jail to
 international human rights organizations detailing further
 examples of human rights abuses by Cuban authorities. At one
 time he was held in solitary confinement for 63 days in a
 dark, small cell after letters written by him were discovered
 by prison authorities. Bofill reportedly has been in ill
 health.
 Once political prisoners are freed, sometimes they are
 forbidden from departing Cuba. For example, writer-diplomat
 Andres Vargas Gomez was forbidden to leave Cuba for one and
 one-half years following his release from prison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although courts are constitutionally described as
 "independent," in practice they are subordinated to the
 National Assembly of the People's Power and to the Council of
 State. All civil courts are presided over by a five-person
 panel of judges. Three are professionally qualified, and the
 other two are 'workers representatives" who are there to see
 that the "interests of the revolution' are protected. People
 accused of certain counterrevolutionary activities are not
 given a public trial; rather, they are tried and sentenced
 secretly by military tribunals. Although defense lawyers are
 theoretically available to all defendants, their zeal is
 likely to be affected by the knowledge that some defense
 attorneys have been arrested and jailed simply for having
 
 
 487
 CUBA
 defended those charged with political offenses. One of the
 lawyers who defended the labor organizers who were arrested in
 1983 was sentenced to 19 years in prison in August, 1984.
 There are no definitive figures as to the number of political
 prisoners in Cuba; groups such as Americas Watch and Amnesty
 International have put the number at between 250 and 1,000,
 while political prisoners released in June, 1984, contend that
 there are 144 long term political prisoners ("plantados') and
 that the total number of political prisoners could be as high
 as 10,000. The unofficial "Cuban Committee on Human Rights'
 has asserted that as of May, 1984, there were 390 prisoners of
 conscience and 800 persons held under the general charge of
 'dangerousness' (peligrosidad). There are indications that
 these figures are limited only to the prisoner population at
 Combinado del Este prison in Havana. One of the reasons that
 it is difficult to obtain precise figures on political
 prisoners is that Cuban law no longer distinguishes between
 criminal and political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Few aspelcts of an ordinary Cuban's private life are free from
 state surveillance. Telephones are monitored, mail is opened,
 and one's comings and goings are monitored by block wardens
 who form part of the neighborhood Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution (CDR). Members of these committees carry
 out night-time neighborhood guard service on a "voluntary'
 basis, and in addition to observing the movement of people in
 the neighborhood, they also watch out for conspicuous
 consumption or other signs which might suggest involvement in
 black market activities. Meetings, parties, and other
 gatherings are subject to particularly intense scrutiny.
 Listening to foreign radio and television broadcasts is
 discouraged. A shrill hum is transmitted to interfere with
 Voice of America broadcasts in the Havana area, and some Miami
 radio stations are also jammed. CDR members are effective in
 monitoring neighborhood listening and viewing habits.
 Non-communist foreign periodicals are rarely permitted to
 circulate in Cuba.
 Family life is complicated in Cuba, with severe housing
 shortages, rationing, and strong pressures to participate in
 'voluntary* Communist party-related activities. Parents
 believe that teaching their children religious practices, even
 in the privacy of their homes, will inhibit the child's
 ability to attain the type of schooling or work he may
 desire. Nearly all families are coerced into sending their
 teen-aged children on 45-day stints of 'voluntary work' in
 rurdl areas. The children are kept in camps, where they are
 indoctrinated with Party ideology and encouraged to inform on
 their parents and friends.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech and press in Cuba; all means of
 communication are owned and controlled by the state. The
 newspapers are published by the Cuban Communist Party, the
 goyernment-run labor federation, and other state entities.
 Intellectual freedom in Cuba is limited to creative
 expressions that are consonant with what the Government deems
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 32
 
 
 488
 CU BA
 to be the best interests of the state. Foreign news from
 non-Communist sources is not available, and foreign embassies
 are forbidden to circulate any materials critical of Cuba or
 any other socialist state. Released political prisoners such
 as poet Armando Valladares and Jorge Valls Arango have
 provided eloquent commentary on the lack of intellectual,
 artistic and academic freedom in Cuba.
 o. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are not guaranteed by the
 Constitution. Any group meeting is likely to be monitored by
 the CDR or representatives of state security. Nearly all
 associations are government-controlled; the few private ones
 wnich exist are allowed to do so only at the sufferance of the
 Government. All labor unions are controlled by the state and
 the Cuban Communist Party. There is no collective bargaining
 and tne right to strike is not recognized.
 In its 1984 report, the International Labor Organization's
 Committee of Experts noted that under Cuba's penal code
 habitual vagrants may be interned in specialized work
 establisaments or workshop schools or sent to labor
 collectives for periods of up to four years as a
 "predelinquency security measure.' The Committee observed
 that the law, which might be used as a means of direct or
 indirect compulsion to work, should be amended so as to bring
 it into conformity with tne Convention on Forced Labor.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Altnough the Constitution asserts that there is freedom of
 religion in Cuba, the practice of religion is actively
 discouraged. CDR members monitor activity at the few
 neighborhood churches which are still open, forcing
 cnurcngoers to attend large downtown churches where they can
 be more anonymous. Children who admit going to church are
 ridiculed by their peers, and participation in Communist youth
 activities is strongly encouraged as an alternative to
 organized religion. Church-sponsored day schools are not
 permitted.
 Religious groups must register with the Cuban Government and
 all requests for foreign travel by clerics must be approved by
 tnle Ministry o. Interior; membership in the Jehovah's
 Witnesses is prohibited and persons identified with the
 denomination are denied permission to travel abroad. Some
 foreign-born priests and missionary nuns are reluctant to
 leave Cuua for holiday or medical treatment for fear that they
 will not be permitted to re-enter the country. Religious
 belief is not compatible with membership in the ruling Cuban
 Communist Party.
 d. Freedom ot Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 While movement within the country is unrestricted by law, in
 practice it is limited by inadequate transportation and
 lodging facilities. It is difficult to change one's place of
 work, owing to housing shortages and the need to transfer
 ration books, which are usually issued on the basis of a
 family *nucleus" living together. There is no freedom to
 travel abroad; permission is required both to exit Cuba and to
 re-enter the country. Permission for tourist travel is rarely
 
 
 489
 CUBA
 granted to those under the age of 60. Permission must also be
 sought to emigrate, and while waiting for an exit visa, an
 applicant is likely to lose his job, and may well lose his
 housing and even his ration book, and find his children
 refused schooling. Persons who leave Cuba permanently must
 leave behind almost all their personal and household
 possessions and are forced to pay discriminatorily high air
 fares; tneir relatives abroad are charged excessive fees for
 documents in order to obtain permission for them to depart.
 As an example of how desperate people become to leave Cuba, at
 least two young Cubans were shot to death and a third clubbed
 and arrested by Cuban police guarding the Venezuelan Embassy
 in separate instances in early 1984 when the youths attempted
 to gain entry to the embassy for the purpose of seeking
 political asylum and the opportunity to leave the country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuba is a Communist state controlled by the hierarchy of the
 Cuban Communist Party. Members of the Central Committee and
 the Politburo are selected by party rulers; 'elections' are
 meaningless exercises which simply ratify choices already
 made. The National Assembly of People's Power meets briefly
 twice a year but simply rubber stamps its approval of
 decisions already made by the party rulers. No opposition is
 permitted in Cuba; dissidents are either in jail or outside
 the country. There is no way for citizens to act to change
 the Government, which is one reason why so many Cubans have
 already fled their country and many others would do so if they
 had the chance.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cuban Government routinely denies that any violations of
 human rights occur in the country, and it refuses permission
 for any outside organization to investigate human rights
 violations in Cuba. The Cuban Government refused to permit
 investigators from the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 to visit Cuba, and it told the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) that "no one in Cuba is under arrest for
 trade union or labor activities.* Unable to obtain further
 information from the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU), the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association
 was obliged in 1984 to drop further consideration of an ICFTU
 complaint alleging the arrest and imprisonment of striking
 Cuban workers, and workers trying to organize an independent
 trade union. Although the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) was helpful to Cuba in arranging the repatriation
 of Cuban nationals from Grenada in November, 1983, the ICRC
 has been refused access to Cuban jails or permission to visit
 political prisoners in Cuba, as has Americas Watch and Amnesty
 International. The few human rights activists in Cuba who are
 not in jail are forced to carry out their activities
 clandestinely, and they must rely upon international non-
 governmental organizations outside of Cuba for support and
 publicity.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cuba was one of the relatively more developed countries in
 
 
 490
 CUBA
 Latin America in the 1950's, and thus the Castro regime had a
 rather well-developed infrastructure to build upon. Cuba's
 population of 9,985,000 is growing at an annual rate of 1.1
 percent, life expectancy at birth is now 74.7 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is 20.5 per thousand. The adult
 literacy rate in 1979 was 95.7 percent for males and 95.1
 percent for females. In 1975, 96 percent of the urban
 population had access to safe water, while in 1970 only 10.9
 percent of the rural population had enjoyed the same
 conditions. Reflecting the emphasis given by the Government
 to education, which includes a massive campaign to have all
 adults attain a nintn grade education, the adjusted primary
 school enrollment (1981) as a percentage of children of
 primary school age (i.e. of children between 6 and 11 years
 old) is 113.66 percent for males and 108.97 percent for
 females.
 Cuua's econoay is centrally planned in the Marxist-Leninist
 style, and it receives a vast amount of economic assistance
 from tne Soviet Union, estimated at over $4 billion annually.
 Notwithstanding such assistance, there are scarcities of many
 basic necessities, and items such as rice, beans, meat,
 clothing and shoes are rationed. Some rationed items and
 other consumer goods are available at very high prices (e.g.,
 $110 for a pair of tennis shoes) on the government-operated
 .parallel market* which absorbs excess currency and
 counteracts black market activities. Minimum needs seem to be
 met, however, since the caloric supply as a percentage of
 average requirements in 1977 was 114.07 percent.
 Althougn Cuba has constitutionally outlawed discrimination
 against women and minorities, few women hold high positions in
 government, despite publicly-proclaimed efforts of the Cuban
 Communist Party to promote them. Of the 225 full and
 alternate members of the Central Committee selected in
 December, 1980, 18 are women. One politburo member, an
 alternate, is a woman (a sister-in-law of Cuban President
 Fidel Castro). One woman has reached the rank of colonel in
 tte Cuoan Armed Forces (she is the wife of a key member of the
 Secretariat of the Communist Party). Although women make up
 35 percent of tie work force, there is no woman on the
 National Committee of the Cuban Labor Confederation.
 Blacks and other minorities are poorly represented in the top
 levels of government. While they comprise more than one
 quarter of the population (a greater percentage if mulattoes
 are included), their representation on the Central Committee
 (full and alternate members) is about 10 to 15 percent. Only
 one of the members (full and alternate) of the Politburo is
 blacK.
