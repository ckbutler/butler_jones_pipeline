 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a free society with
 legally protected rights. Its constitutional arrangements are defined by the Letters
 Patent and Royal Instructions. Executive powers are vested in a British Crown-ap-
 pointed Governor who holds extensive authority. The judiciary is an independent
 body adhering to English common law with certain variations. Fundamental rights
 ultimately rest on oversight by the British Parliament. In practice, however, Hong
 Kong largely controls its own internal affairs.
 All 60 seats in the Hong Kong Legislative Council were open to direct or indirect
 balloting for the first time in Septmber 1995, and the elections were widely consid-
 ered to be fair and open.
 The resulting Legislative Council has served as a forum for vigorous debate and
 planning for the period after July 1, 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong will
 revert from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China and-it becomes
 the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. However, China has stated its inten-
 tion to dsolve the 1995 Legislative Council, district beards, and municipal councils
 in July 1997, noting that it did not agree to the electoral rules adopted by the Hong
 Kong Government in 1994 for election to these bodies.
 On December 28, 1995, China apointed a Preparatory Committee, composed of
 57 mainland Chinese and 93 Hong Kong residents, to establish the post-1997 Spe-
 cial Administrative Region Government. Democratic Party members of the Legisla-
 tive Council respondd on March 13, voting to ondemn the Preparatory Commit-
 tee's "unrepresentative omposeition," particularly the lack of democracy advocates.
 In March the Preparatory Comite announced that a provisional legislature will
 be formed before July 1, 1997, to "examine and approve laws and other measures
 that take effect at midnight June 30, 1997. In early November, the Preparatory
 Committee members established the Selection Committee, composed of 400 Honj
 Kong residents. The Selection Committee in turn, chose the Chief Executive and
 provisional legislature in December. Thirty-three of the current Legislative Council
 members were selected to join the provisional legislature. However, none of those
 chosen were Democratic Party members, who opposed and therefore chose not to
 seek seats on the provisional legislature even though their party that had drawn
 the most popular support in the Legislative Council elections in 1995. There has
 been public concern that the selection of the provisional legislature was unneces-
 sary, lacked transparency, was not based on open elections, and excluded groups or
 individuals critical of China.
 A well-organized police force maintains public order and is under the firm control
 of civilian authorities. There were reports that some members of the police used ex-
 cessive force.
 Hong Kong is a major regional and international trade and financial center. It is
 the principal gateway for trade and investment with China. The territory's free mar-
 ket economy operates on the basis of minimal government interference and a thriv-
 ing private sector. Per capita gross domestic product surpassed $23,200 in 1995 and
 continued to grow in 1996.

 Human rights activists, journalists, and legislators continued to criticize the Gov-
 ernment for opposing human rights initiatives such as the establishment of a
 human rights commission; laws against discrimination based on age, race, and sex-
 ual orientation; and freedom of information legislation. Human rights problems con-
 tinued to include some instances of excessive use of force by the police, media self-
 censorship, limitations on citizens' ability to change their government, and violence
 and discrimination against women, and discrimination against the disabled.
 The Government actively maintains a high degree of egal and * dicial protection
 of fundamental rights and freedoms. The scrupulous protection of human rights, as
 pledged in Chinese commitments, is seen as a key element in the transition to Chi-
 nese sovereignty.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were eight instances of death in police custody. The authorities determined
 that three were deaths by natural causes and four were suicides; the eighth remains
 under investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other extreme forms of abuse by the police and stipu-
 lates punishment for those who break the law. Disciplinary action can range from
 dismissal to warnings. Criminal proceedings may be undertaken independently of
 the disciplinary process of the police force. Allegations of excessive use of force are
 investigated by the Complaints Agint Police Office, whose work is in turn mon-
 itored and reviewed by the Police Complaints Council, a body composed of members
 of the public appointed by the Governor. The Government, however, continued to
 resist public calls for the creation of an independent body to investigate allegations
 of abuse by police.
 Although excessive use of force by police is not widespread, there are occasional
 complaints of force being used to coerce information or confessions during police in-
 terrogations. Human rights monitors in Hong Kong are concerned that this maybe
 a growing problem and have documented victims' complaints of beatings during in-
 terrogation. In 1995 government officials reported 1,581 complaints against police,
 of which only 1 was substantiated by the Police Complaints Council. From January
 to June, there were 704 complaints, all for "assault by police officers," but none were
 substantiated. Human rights groups contrast the relatively large number of com-
 plaints with the very small number of cases substantiated by the Government to
 argue the need for revamping a system where the review process appears to favor
 the police
 Although conditions vary among facilities, prison conditions generally cnforni to
 international standards. The Government permits prison visits by human rights
 monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-British legal protections and common law
 traditions govern the process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and ef-
 fective legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial and legal systems are organized ac-
 cording to principles of British constitutional law and legal precedent and provide
 for an independent judiciary, which the Government respects in practice. According
 to the agreement signed by the United Kingdom and China in June 1995, Hong
 Kon$'s Court of Final Appeal will be established formally on July 1, 1997. Incoming
 officials of the post-1997 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are to be respon-
 sible for setting up the Court and eeting judges. The agreement thus grants a
 principal role in the Court's establishment and membership to the Hong Kong Spe-
 cial Administrative Region Government. After reversion, the Court of Final Appeal
 is to have power of final judgment over Hong Kong law. The Special Administrative
 Region courts, however, are to have "no jurisdiction over acts of State such as de-
 fense and foreign affairs." The Basic Law also vests the Standing Committee of Chi-
 na's National Peole's Congress with the power to interpret the Basic Law in mat-
 ters that are the responsibility of the Central People's Government or concern the
 relationship between the Central authorities and the Special Administrative Re-
 gin. If broadly applied and loosely interpreted, these exceptions to the Court of
 Final Appeal's power of final jurisdiction could be used to limit the independence
 of the judiciary after 1997.
 
 
 1203
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and this is respected in prac-
 tice. Trial is by jury.
 There were no reports of  litical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right of rivacy, and the Government generally respects this right
 in practice. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is vested with powers
 that are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordinances
 goverin the Independent Commission Against Corruption have deprived it of the
 independent authority to issue arrest or search warrants (it must now go to the
 courts) but it still operates on the assumption that any excessive, unexplainable as-
 sets held by civil servants are ill-gotten until proven otherwise.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Hong Kong has a tradition of free speech and
 free press. Political debate is vigorous. Numerous views and opinions, including
 those independent or critical of the British, Hong Kong, and Chinese governments
 are aired in the mass media, in public forums, and by political groups. International
 media organizations operate freely. Several ordinances permit restrictions on the
 press, but they are rarely imposed. The Hong Kong Journalists Association has con-
 tinued to criticize the Government for not taking swift action to repeal these ordi-
 nances before 1997, warning that the post-1997 Government might be more prone
 to invoke them.
 Residents of the territory continue to speak freely to the press, and there are no
 taboo subjects in the media. Although there are reports of self-censorship, it is dif-
 ficult to verify specific instances in which self-censorship has killed a story. How-
 ever, according to poll results published in February 1995 by Hong Kong Univer-
 sity's Social Science Research Center, most journalists believe that self-censorship
 remains a problem. The pressures on journalists are subtle-there are no direct or-
 ders to refrain from writing-but a need for special care toward topics of particular
 sensitivity in China, such as leadership dynamics, corruption, or military activity
 is nonetheless perceived. Journalists in the Chinese-language press report a perva-
 sive if tacit understanding that editors expect those reporting on China to be espe-
 cially certain of their facts and careful in their wording. A few newspaper articles
 have reported self-censorship among Hong Kong publishers on such sensitive issues
 as Taiwan and Tibet. Another source of pressure comes from the belief of some pub-
 lishers and editors that their advertising revenues would suffer if they were per-
 ceived to be too antagonistic to China in their editorial judgments.
 Hong Kong press coverage of China continues to be extensive and is frequently
 critical For example, there was strong criticism in the press of Chinese Foreign
 Minister Qian Qien in October after he indicated that in post-July 1997 Hong
 Kong reporting of "rumors or lies," personal criticism of Chinese leaders in the
 p~ress, and any demonstrations to commemorate the Tiananmen Square events of
 June 4, 1989, would not be allowed. Although overall there has been neither a sharp
 increase nor decrease of critical coverage over the past year, Hong Kong journalists
 based in or traveling to China face certain risks. Chna requires journalists to apply
 for permission to do any reprting in China. Those who byass official channels--
 which many feel they must do to get the stories they want--run a risk of violating
 regulations. For example, according to a press report three Hong Kong journalists
 were detained and then deported by China after being accused of illegally entering
 a military zone in Fujian province to collect information during the Chinese military
 exercises near Taiwan in March. The New China (Xinhua) News Agency reported
 that they were detained because they did not follow rules and regulations for Hong
 Kong journalists working on the mainland. Hong Kong reporters continue, however,
 to enter China to cover sensitive stories related to Hong Kong, Taiwan, or China
 itself.
 Commemorations of journalist Xi Yang's imprisonment in 1994 continue to take
 place, with a massive march on the offices of the New China News Agency (Xinhua)
 this year. A PRC national Xi Yang was working for Hong Kong's Ming Pao Daily
 when taken into custody ?or reporting economic data China considered to be state
 secrets. His arrest was widely cited as having had a chilling effect on Hong Kong
 media.
 Xinhua's treatment of one commentary from a university journalism program sug-
 gests an insensitivity to press freedom, reinforcing concerns in Hong Kong about the
 prospects on this score following reversion. In a recent issue of a Journalism maga-
 zine published at the Chinese University, the "Editor's Note" column reported on
 the Chinese authorities' method of dealing with the press, gleaned from an inter-
 view with the Xinhua Deputy Director in Hong Kong. Xinhua, which had been
 shown an advance copy of the issue, tried without success to change the story. After
 
 
 1204
 the story was published Xinhua contacted the student who conducted the interview
 and hinted that it wouid be "hard for the reporter to stay in the journalism field
 in the future if that attitude did not change."
 Early in the year, the Hong Kong media were still reacting to a newspaper price
 war set off when the Oriental Daily News, the most popular daily in Hong Kong
 for the past 20 years, lowered its retail price in an attempt to woo readers away
 from Apple Daily, a tabloid-style daily newspaper that has captured a larger share
 of the market from other papers. The price war led to closure of four daily news-
 papers, a weekly entertainment periodical, and a newspaper supplement magine.
 Another casualty was Eastern Express, the English-language dairy publishedby the
 Oriental Group, which closed during the summer. Some commentators fear that the
 closings might lead to less diversity of opinion in the media but there has been no
 visible affect on the range of opinions expressed.
 Media mid general public access to government information is strictly controlled.
 The Government opposed freedom of information legislation proposed by Legislative
 Council members    1995 and decided instead to develop an       rat   code of
 practice on access to government information. Under the code, civil servants ar rer-
 quired to provide information held by the Government, unless there are valid rea-
 sons not to do so. A pilot scheme to test the legal, practical, and resource implica-
 tions arising from the code began in March 1995. By December 23, the code had
 been extended to the entire Government. The Government's efficiency unit reports
 a rejection rate of five percent for information reqests from the public.
 The Government respect academic freedom. Therea aea wide range of opinions
 represented in lively  a  on Ha ng Kong campuses, and the issue of academic
 freedom has not generally caused much public comment. In June the Hong Kong
 University vice-chancellor ordered the removal of Tiananmen-era slogans criticizing
 China from university pavement. This order sparked strong student protests, and
 the slogans were repainted.
 b. Fieedom   gf Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is prac-
 ticed without significant hindrance. Following a march by 3,000 people prtesting
 the sentencing of Chinese dissident Wang Dan in November, police ordered protest-
 ers to remove banners from outside Xinhua News Agency headquarters. The police
 claimed that the banners were hazardous to motorists; demonstrators claimed that
 the order stemmed from pressure from People's Republic of China authorities.
 Freedom of association is also practiced without significant hindrance, although
 the amended Societies Ordinance requires people to notify the Societies Officer of
 the formation of a society. The Societies Officer may recommend to the Secretary
 for Security prohibition of the operation or continued operation of a society if he rea-
 sonably believes that it may be prejudicial to the security of Hong Kong or to public
 safety or public order. The provision in the ordinance allowing the Government to
 refuse to register an organization "incompatible with peace, welfare, or good order,"
 or affiliated with a political organization abroad was repealed in 1992. The Basic
 Law provides, however, that the Special Administrative Region "shall enact laws on
 its own" regarding subversion and overseas political affilations of Hong Kong orga-
 nizations. This could lead, after July 1, 1997, to reinstatement of certain restrictions
 on societies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Hong Kong Bill of Rights includes a provision pro-
 hibiting discrimination on the basis of religion. Government policy and general prac-
 tice ensure freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within Hong Kong, and travel docu-
 ments are freely and easily obtained. The number of applicants for British Depend-
 ent Territories travel documents was more than five times the total for all of 1995.
 The last day of eligibility was in March.
 Two Democratic Party members were denied entry to China in November, raising
 questions in Hong Kong about the existence of a "blacklist" of Hong Kong politi-
 cians. The two had planned to submit petitions in Beijing against the Selection
 Committee and the provisional legislature.
 Hong Kong has never refused first asylum to Vietnamese boat people. Prior to
 June 1988, refugee status was automatically accorded them. Since then asylum
 seekers have been screened to determine their status and held in prison-like deten-
 tion centers awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to Vietnam.
 From October 1995 to September 1996, 5,660 persons were voluntarily repatriated
 to Vietnam through the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees. On May 12, 1992, the Hong Kong Government reached agreement with Viet-
 namese authorities on mandatory (involuntary) repatriation (the "Orderly Return
 Program") of those who were determined not to be refugees. There were 4,267 peo-
 ple repatriated under the Orderly Return Program from October 1995 to September
 
 
 1205
 1996. Under the program, people ar randomly chosen from the nonrefugee camp
 pOpulation and moved to a separate location several days before a flight's scheduled
 eparture. Government security officers then escort forcibly if necessary, all those
 being involuntarily returned on to the airplane and accompany the flight to Viet-
 nam.
 A total of 12,815 Vietnamese remained in the Hong Kong camps as of October 18,
 of whom 1,335 were screened-in as refugees but who, mostly for reasons of health
 or criminal acts, have not been resettled.
 Hong Kong authorities continue to encounter physical resistance in the camps
 when attempting to remove those chosen for the Orderly Return Program flights.
 In May during a transfer of northern Vietnamese from the Whitehead Detention
 Center to the igh Island Detention Center, a massive riot occurred in which many
 buildings and veucles and records were burned by Vietnamese detainees. Hong
 Kong authorities used tear gas.to restore order. All but 28 of the 119 Vietnamese
 who escaped from detention during the riot were found and returned to camp.
 Voluntary Repatriation and the involuntary Orderly Return Program were regu-
 larly returning about 1,400 people a month during calendar year 1996. If continued,
 this rate of return is expected to leave the Hong Kong camps empty by the July
 1, 1997, reversion to China. However, as of October 18, aproximately 6,000 Viet-
 namese in camps had not been cleared for return by the Vietnamese Government.
 The number of illegal Chinese immigrants has been estimated by knowledgeable
 observers to be at least 15,000. During 1996 the Government returned illegal Chi-
 nese immigrants to China at the rate of 68 per day. Only in those rare instances
 in which a person qualifies as a refugee under the terms of the international age-
 ment on the status of refugees is permission to remain in Hon Kong granted. There
 are currently 289 ex-China Vietnamese illegal immigrants in ong Kong. The repa-
 triation of these people, who fled from China to ong Kong, was stayed in 1996
 pending the outcome of litigation in the Privy Council in London to free them from
 detention.
 A well-Ikown Chinese labor organizer and political dissident, Han Donfang, re-
 mains in Hong Kong. Chinese government authorities continued to refuse him entry
 into China as they have ever since his expulsion from China in August 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hong Kong is a free society with most individual freedoms and rights protected
 by law and custom. Although te Government has moved to democratize district and
 municipal boards and the Legislative Council, Hong Kong residents do not have the
 right to change the Government. The Governor is appointed by and serves at the
 pleasure of the Crown. He is advised on policy by the Executive Council, which he
 appoints.
 e   Legislative Council enacts and funds legislation and also debates policy and
 questions the administration. Although the Legislative Council's power to initiate
 legisation is limited (all bills with budgetary implications, for example, must be ap-
 proved by the Government before introduction), it has become increasingly assertive.
 TheGovernor has ultimat control of the administration f Hong Kong but, by con-
 vention, rarely exercises his full pwers. In practice, decisions are reached through
 nsensus. Politcal partes and idependnt candidates are free to contest seats in
 free anair elections. Representative government employing universal franchise ex-
 ists at the lOCal district board level.
 All district and municipal board members were chosen by direct elections in 1994
 and.195, respectively. In 995 the. Governmentimplemented legislation abolishing
 allappointed seats~ inthe.Legiative.Council. In September 1995, 920,000 voters,
 by dirct or indirect ballotig, selected meers to   these seats in generally free
 ad fair elections. Out of 60 seats, t.ere were 20 geographic seats directly elected,
 10 seats ChOSen by an election ommittee comprised of 283 locally elected officials,
 9seats selected by brad functonal (occupational) onstituencies, and 21 seats elect-
 e by more narrow functional gAl                the 1995 elections did not result
 wer     .eb     th   , emocraU d    ected government-a point on which they
 we   cnc     _     .      Nations uman Rights Committee-they significantly
 increased voters ability to inuence government decisionmaking through a greater
 number of elected representatives.
 China opposed the Hong iKon Government's election reforms. It stated that it
 does not recognize the validity of the 1995 legislative council elections, and that the
 present Legislative Council would have no mandate to serve past reversion and thus
 would "terminate" on June 30, 1997, along with elected district boards and munici-
 pal councils. China insisted that the crux of its disagreement was not the pace of
 mocratization but Britain's failure to reach a mutually acceptable accord on the
 
 
 1206
 
 electoral changes before unilaterally announcing the reform package. Seventeen
 rounds of negotiations were held before the Hong Kong Government made its an-
 nouncement. In March China's appointed Preparatory Committee announced that a
 provisional legislature would be formed to serve for not more than 1 year after re-
 version until the "rst" Special Administrative Region legislature could be elected.
 According to the Preparatory Committee, a provisional legislature would "examine
 and approve" laws to take effect on July 1, 1997. One Preparatory Committee mem-
 ber who voted against the provisional legislature was initially declared by Beijing
 as disqualified to serve on the Selection Committee or the provisional legislature,
 but was later chosen for the provisional legislature.
 The Preparatory Committee's Selection Committee panel held public consultations
 in April on forming a 400-member Selection Committee to choose the first Special
 Administrative Region chief executive and the provisional legislature. More than
 1,000 people representing 362 organizations presented their views. Participation
 was controlled through selective invitations but some dissenting views on the provi-
 sional legislature were voiced by the Hong Kong Bar Association and prodemocracy
 clitical figures. The Preparatory Committee received over 5,000 nominees for the
 election Coymmte
 There is public concern that the process of selecting a provisional legislature
 lacked transparency, was not based on a free and fair election, and excluded grup,
 political parties, and individuals critical of China. There is also concern that the
 provisional legislature may begin functioning before June 30, 1997, and thereby un-
 dermine the authority of the present Hong Kong Government. Finally, many rep-
 resentative groups see the process of selecting a provisional legislature as unneces-
 sary and unjustified. On December 11, the Selection Committee chose Hong Kong's
 first postreversion Chief Executive, C. H. Tung. On December 21, it selected the 60-
 member provisional legislature. Those selected included 33 of the 34 current legisla-
 tive councilors who sought inclusion. In addition, 10 persons who had been defeated
 in the 1995 legislative council elections were chosen. The 19 Democratic Party mem-
 bers in the current Legislative Council regarded the disbanding of that body as ille-
 gitimate and chose not to seek seats on the provisional legislature.
 The Government is continuing efforts to place Hong Kong Chinese in senior gov-
 ernment positions and has pubicly committed to fil all principal official" posts
 with local officers before 1997. At present 22 of 23 existing posts equivalent to fu-
 ture principal officer posts (Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary, 15 Branch Sec-
 retaries, Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Direc-
 tor of Audit, Commissioner of Police, Director of Immigration, and Commissioner of
 Customs and Excise) are filled by local officers. The remaining expatriate principal
 officer (Attorney General) is due to be replaced by a local officer before reversion
 to China. As of April 70 percent of the Government's top directorate-level jobs and
 almost 85 percent of administrative and other senior management positions were
 filled by local staff.
 Expatriates remain in key positions in the legal department and the judiciary- at
 the same time, 70 percent of the Crown counsel positions and 76 percent of police
 positions (police inspector and above) are currently filled by local officers.
 The Government's efforts to add ethnic Chinese to the Government were opposed
 by a group of expatriate government workers who undertook legal action against the
 Government, claiming that they were being discriminated against under the provi-
 sions of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The Hong Kong High Court on October 31
 1995, ruled that most of the Government's arrangements to fill positions with locai
 officers were lawful. The expatriates subsequently appealed the judgments and the
 Government cross-a ppealed on one judgment. At the substantive hearing of the ap-
 peal in November, the Court of Appeal ruled crucial parts of the localization policy
 unlawful. According to December 23 news reports, the Government decided not to
 appeal to the Privy Council given the slim chances of success but reiterated its de-
 termination to continue its localization policy.
 In 1995 the Chinese authorities' public demands for personnel records of senior
 civil servants caused anxiety among some Hong Kong Government officials. Later
 that year, the Chinese authorities scaled back their demands and initiated a series
 of successful "informal" exchanges with Hong Kong civil servants, which continued
 throughout 1996.
 In March a Chinese official told reporters that Hong Kong civil servants who op-
 posed the idea of a provisional legislature would be barred from serving after rever-
 sion. Although Chinese authorities thereafter qualified this position, calling it only
 "personal opinions," civil service confidence was shaken. China has said no cadres
 would come to Hong Kong from Beijing to work in the civil service.
 Women are playing a larger role in politics, with larger numbers running for pub-
 lic office in 1995 and 1996 than ever before. In 1996 women comprised 12 percent
 
 
 1207
 of the Legislative Council, 13 percent of the top government directorate-level posts,
 and 37 percent of government administrative officers.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social,
 and cultural rights currently apply to Hong Kong through the United Kingdom.
 China has agreed to extend these agreements to Hong Kong beyond 1997, but stated
 in October that it does not consider itself obligated to file reports to the United Na-
 tions on implementation of the agreements in Hong Kong because China is not a
 signatory. The Chinese Government's statement caused concern in Hong Kong, as
 well as in the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Hong Kong section of
 the International Commission of Jurists, and among others in the international
 human rights community.
 In October 1995, the China-appointed Preliminary Working Committee's legal
 subgroup issued a statement that called for striking key sections from Hong Kong's
 Bill of Rights Ordinance, including articles that require all past and future legisla-
 tion to conform to the ordinance. The subgroup also recommended that six colonial-
 era public security ordinances relating to registration of societies, media licensing,
 broadcast authority, and police control of public meetings and processions, which
 were amended in 199lto onform tothe Bill of Rights Ordinance, be changed to
 restore the Government's original prerogatives under these laws. The Preliminary
 Working Committee's recommendation generated a strnjg negative public reaction
 in Hong Kong abeut the potential erosion of civil liberties and famental free-
 doms. By year's end, however, the Preparatory Committee had taken no action on
 any section of the Bill of Rights Ordinance.
 Article 23 of China's Basic Law provides that the Hong Kong Special Administra-
 tive Region will enact laws to prohibit subversion secession, treason, and sedition
 against the PRC Government. In late November, the Hong Kong Government intro-
 duced a draft amendment to the crime ordinance defining the implementation of
 these laws. China objected to this action because the Hong Kong Government did
 not secure its a         despite consultations, before presenting the legislation.
 Beijing also insists the Q1pecia Administrative Government, and not the current
 Hong Kong Government, should consider such laws. By the end of the year, it was
 unclear what, if any, action would be taken by the current Legislative Council on
 the draft legislation.
 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and nongovermental human rights
 organizations have full access to Hong Kong's camps for Vietnamese boat people.
 Although the present Government has interposed no official barriers to the forma-
 tion of local human rights groups, some human rights activists believe that provi-
 sions of the Societies Ordinance provide the legal means whereby a future govern-
 ment could do so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government opposed measures supported by some Legislative Council mem-
 bers in 1994-95 addressing problems of sex, race, and age discrimination, and intro-
 duced instead its own bills both adopted in 1995, banning discrimination on the
 basis of sex and disability. With the establishment of an Equal Opportunities Com-
 mission in September, to oversee the implementation of sex and disability discrimi-
 nation laws all nonemployment related provisions of the sex discrimination law
 took effect. Employment related provisions cannot come into force until the Legisla-
 tive Council approves a code of practice on employment that is currently being de-
 veloped.
 The Chinese language has equal status with English in many government oper-
 ations except in judicial proceedings. To help remedy the situation in judicial pro-
 ceedings, the Government has increased the number of officers in the Legal AidDe-
 partment proficient in Chinese from three (of nine) to seven and initiated a pilot
 scheme for simultaneous interpretation in some court proceedings. The Government
 extended the use of bilingual prosecution documents to magistracies and district and
 high courts in 1995 and 1996. Bilingual charge sheets have been introduced in all
 magistrates courts, and bilingual indictments are used in the district and high
 courts. According to the Basic Law English may be used as an official language by
 the executive authorities, legislature, and judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Ad-
 ministrative Regon
 Women.-Viofence and discrimination against women remain significant problems
 in society. The only legislation to protect the rights of battered women is the 1987
 Domestic Violence Ordinance, which enables a woman to seek a 3-month injunction
 
 
 1208
 
 against her husband, and which may be extended to 6 months. Domestic violence
 may also be prosecuted as comon assault under existing criminal statutes. The
 Government enforces these laws and prosecutes violators. It also funds programs to
 stem domestic violence such as family life education counseling, a hot line service
 operated by the Social Welfare Department and nongovernmental organizations,
 temporary housing, legal aid, and child protective services. In 1995 the Government
 expanded the number of family service centers from 53 to 65; in 1996 it opened a
 third shelter for bttered women and their children. Many women, however, do not
 seek help when they have been victims of violence, and many cases of domestic vio-
 lence have not been reported because of cultural factors and inadequate information
 about the availability of assistance and resources. To address this, the Government
 set up a Working Group on Battered Spouses in April 1995; issued multidisciplinary
 procedural guidelines on handling battered spouse cases in March; and initiated
 public education and mass media programs. Women's action groups continue to
 press for better legal and government protection for battered wives.
 Women have faced significant discrimination in the areas of employment, salary,
 welfare, inheritance, and promotion (see Section 6.e.). Discrimination on the basis
 of age, particularly in hiring practices, is openly practiced and is not prohibited by
 law. According to government statistics for early 1996, unemployment in all age
 groups among female workers was lower than for male workers. Women have suf-
 fered discrimination in the area of inheritance in the New Territories portion of
 Hong Kong, but a 1994 ordinance removed the inhibition against women inheriting
 land in the New Territories. Women now have equal rights with men to inherit land
 in the New Territories, as is the case elsewhere in Hong Kong.
 For the years 1991-95, the number of female secondary school student candidates
 who took university advanced-level examinations accounted for between 51 to 55
 percent of the total, and the number of female candidates who matriculated at uni-
 versities during those years accounted for between 52 to 56 percent of all candidates
 who matriculated.
 Children.-The Government displays a firm commitment to children's rights and
 welfare through a well-funded systems of public education, medical care, and protec-
 tive services. It supports child welfare programs including custody, protection, day
 care, foster care, shelters, small group homes, and assistance to families. Child
 abuse and exploitation have not been considered widespread. However, the Sec-
 retary for Health told the Legislative Council in March that the number of child
 abuse cases had almost doubled in 2 years; 116 cases of child sexual abuse had been
 handled by the Social Welfare Department and NGO's in 1995, compared to 77 in
 1994 and 61 in 1993. In 1995 the police set up a Child Abuse Investigation Unit
 to improve treatment of child abuse victims, and the egslative Council adopted
 amendments to the law making it easier for abused chiren to give evidence in
 court. Legal penalties for ill-treatment or neglect of minors were also substantially
 increased. In 1996 the Government setup a video interviewing suite in a residential
 building for recording statements in a child-friendly environment, and initiated mul-
 tidisciplinary procedures for handling child sexual abuse cases.
 People With Disabilities.--Oranizations and persons representing the interests of
 the disabled claim that discrimination against the physically and mentally disabled
 exists in employment, education, and the provision of some state services. Access to
 public buildings and transportation remain significant problems for the physically
 disabled. Advocacy groups have urged the Government to do more to encourage
 greater public acceptance of the physically and mentally disabled. The Government
 as been responsive, undertaking programs to foster greater public awareness and
 acceptance in this area. In 1995 the Legislative Council passed the Antidiscrimina-
 tion Law to protect the rights of the disabled. This law calls for changes to the
 building ordinance to improve building access for the disabled and sanctions for
 those who discriminate against the disabled. In 1995 and 1996, the Government
 took additional actions to assist the disabled, introducing an integrated work exten-
 sion program in sheltered workshops, increasing expenditures for the mentally dis-
 abled, expanding vocational assessment and training services, and conducting public
 education programs on rehabilitation. There are 4,231 disabled persons employed as
 civil servants out of a total civil service work force of 180,313-just over 2 percent,
 and there are 8,476 disabledpersons in school-just under 1 percent.
 National/Racial /Ethnic  Minoities.-Racial  discrimination  against Filipino
 women, 140,000 of whom work under contract in Hong Kong, has been the focus
 of news reports. Also, despite official reassurance that Philippine workers would be
 welcome after 1997, reports indicate that employers of large numbers of Filipinos-
 hotels and the airport authority-are beginning to employ Chinese from the main-
 land instead.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Asmociation.-The right of association and the right of workers to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing are provided for by law. Trade
 unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic pre-
 condition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same oc-
 cupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1995,21 new trade unions (including one mixed union of employers and em-
 ploys) were registered. By the end of 1995, there were 522 registered employees'
 umona with a declared membership of 591,181, which represents 21.11 percent of
 a total of 2.8 million salaried employees and wage earners. Most registered unions
 belong to one of t e major trade union federations.
 Woik stoppages and stries are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. Even though employees have the freedom to strike
 and there is no legislative prohibition of s es, in practice most workers must sign
 employment contracts that typically state that walking off the job is a breach of con-
 tract and can lead to summary dismissal. The Employment Ordinance permits firms
 to discharge or deduct wages from staff who are absent due to a labor dispute. In
 1995 there were nine strikes involving 1,018 workdays.
 Labor unions may form federations and confederations, although such affiliation
 cannot be ross-indulstry in scope. The two leading labor federations, the Hong Kong
 Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions,
 were active participants in the territory's 1995 Legislative Council elections.
 As a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong is not a member in
 its own right of the International Labor Organization (ILO). TheUnited Kingdom
 makes declarations on behalf of Hong Kong concerning the latter's obligations re-
 garding the various international labor conventions. To date Hong Kong has amend-
 ed labor legislation and taken administrative measures to aply 49 conventions. In
 the Basic Law, China committed to adhere to these conventions after reversion in
 1997.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. Any affiliation with foreign labor
 unions requirs the consent of the Government. No application for such affiliation
 has thus far been refused.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The ILO Convention on the
 Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively has been applied to Hong Kong without
 modification since 1975. This convention does not obligate the Government to im-
 pose collective bargaining by statute. There are no laws that stipulate collective bar-
 gaining on a man tory basis. Wage rates in a few trades like tailoring and car-
 pentry are new determined collectively in accordance with established trade prac-
 tices and customs rather than as a statutory mechanism.
 In practice, collective bargaining is not widely practicd. Unions generally are not
 powerful enough to force management to engage in collective bargaining. The Gov-
 ernment does not encourage it, since the Government does not engage in collective
 bargaining with civil servants' unions but merely "consults" with them. Free concil-
 iation services are afforded by the Labor Relations Division of the Department of
 Labor to employers and employees involved in disputes that may involve statutory
 benefits and protection in employment as well as arrears of wages, wages instead
 of notice, or severance pay. The Deparment of Labor asit employers and employ-
 ees in a dispute to reach amicable settlement but does not have the authority to
 impose a slution. The Department of Labor is not required by law to allow unions
 to represent employees in these proceedings, although it takes a postive attitude
 towards the participation by trade unions in dispute negotiations. The Labor Tribu-
 nal Ordinance provides that an officer of a registered trade union, who is authorized
 in writing by a claimant or defendant to appear as his representative, has the right
 of audience in the Labor Tribunal.
 The law protects workers against antiunion discrimination. Employ ees who allege
 such discrimination have the right to have their cases heard by the- Department of
 Labor's Labor Relations Division. Violation of the antiunion discrimination provi-
 sions under the Employment Ordinance is a criminal offense carrying a maximum
 ie of $2,564. However, employers are not required to reinstate or compensate an
 em loyee.
 he International Confederation of Free Trade Unions is highly critical of Hong
 Kong labor legislation's failure to protect the right to strike and its prvisions allow-
 ing dismissals and disiplinary action against s  g trade unionists. Individual
 labor claims are ajudicated by the Labor Tribunal, apart of the judiial branch,
 which is supposed to provide quick and inexpensive machinery for resolving certain
 types of disputes. The Tribunal complements the conciliation service of the Labor
 Relations Division. Union leaders complain, however, that the Tribunal takes too
 long-an average of 130 days- t hear workers' cases. Labor unions and legislators
 
 
 1210
 
 are concerned about government plans to allow increases in imported labor fearing
 downward pressure on wages. There are few protections for almost 152,000 Filipino,
 Thai, and Indonesian domestic workers who face deportation if dismissed by their
 employers and are thus vulnerable to abuse.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Existing labor legislation prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment of Children Reg-
 ulations prohibit employment of children under the age of 15 in any industrial es-
 tablishment. Children 13 and 14 years of age may be employed in certain nonindus-
 trial establishments, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9 years'
 education and protecting their safety, health, and welfare. The Government con-
 ducts inspections to safeguard against the employment of children. Few violations
 were found, and child labor is not a problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage except for foreign
 domestic workers. In  1996 the minimum     wage for such workers was $480
 (HK$3,750) a month. Because the law also requires employers of domestic labor to
 provide foreign domestic workers with housing, worker's compensation insurance,
 travel allowances, and meals or a meal allowance in addition to the minimum wage,
 foreign domestics have a decent standard of living.
 Aside from a small number of trades and industries where a uniform wage struc-
 ture exists, wage levels are customarily fixed by individual agreement between em-
 ployer and employee and are determined by supply and demand. Many employees
 receive a year-end bonus of a month's pay or mere. Some employers provide workers
 with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment, and free subsidized trans-
 port.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. The Women and Young
 Persons (Industry) Regulations under the Employment Ordinance control hours and
 conditions of work for women and for young people 15 to 17 years of age in the man-
 ufacturing sector. Work hours for young people are limited to 8 per day and 48 per
 week between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. Women are permitted to work only between 7 a.m.
 and 7 p.m.; however, this provision is very loosely enforced for persons at age 16
 or over. For women, overtime is restricted to 2 hours per day with a maximum of
 200 days per year, and overtime is prohibited for all persons under the age of 18
 in industrial establishments. The regulations also prohibit women and young per-
 sons from working underground or, with the exception of males 16 and 17 years of
 ageo, in dangerous trades. The Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to
 enforce compliance with these regulations. During 1995 there were 8,978 prosecu-
 tions for breaches of various ordinances and regulations. Fines totaling $6.2 million
 were imposed. From January to September, there were 6,106prosecutions, and fines
 for this period totaled $4.4 million. The employment of underage workers is gen-
 erally not a serious problem.
 The Department of Labor's Factory Inspectorate Department sets basic occupa-
 tional safety and health standards, provides education andpublicity, and follows up
 with enforcement and inspection in accordance with the Factories and Industrial
 Undertakings Ordinance and subsidiary regulations. The Inspectorate pays particu-
 lar attention to safety in high-risk areas of factories and construction sites, with
 routine visits to such sites. During 1995, 89,138 enforcement visits including 82,746
 inspections and 6,392 accident investigations were conducted. Department of Labor
 officials acknowledged that accidents in construction and service sectors remain very
 high. Apart from routine inspection, the Inspectorate also expanded special inspec-
 tions targeting high-risk areas. The inspection campaigns incuded machine safety,
 fire and chemical safety, and summer job safety. During these campaigns, 21,859
 manufacturing and catering establishments and 1,196 construction sites were in-
 spected, and 1,234 summonses were issued. Fines were varied, depending on the se-
 riousness of the violation. The Government also conducted a review of industrial
 safety in Hong Kong in 1995 and is implementing a range of measures and propos-
 als recommended in the review for improving safety standards. The continued need
 for stronger government enforcement and inspection efforts, however, was dem-
 onstrated when the collapse in June of a bridge construction platform caused six
 deaths, prompting legislators to introduce several new safety bills.
 As part of a complementary effort, the Department of Labor's Occupational Health
 Division investigates claims of occupational diseases and injuries at work, conducts
 environmental testing in the workplace, and provides medical examinations to em-
 ployees in occupations that involve handling of hazardous materials. The small
 number of inspectors-about 200-and the inability of workers to elect their own
 safety representatives weaken the enforcement of workplace safety and health
 
 
 1211
 standards. There is no specific legal provision allowing workers to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
