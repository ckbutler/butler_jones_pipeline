 SOUTH AFRICA
 The human rights situation in South Africa in 1981 saw
 the continued existence of the apartheid system but also
 some movement toward modification of that system, in re-
 sponse to actions by the Government and to economic, social
 and political pressures from within South African society.
 Apartheid, the system of racial differentiation, discrimi-
 nation and separation, sometimes called "Separate Develop-
 ment," "Parallel Development," "Separate Freedoms," "Differ-
 entiation," or "Multi-National Development," institution-
 alizes political and economic control by the 16.2 percent
 white minority. The 83.8 percent of South Africa's popula-
 tion which is black suffers pervasive discrimination which
 severely limits political, social and economic life. (This
 report refers to the four major South African population
 groups as African, Colored - the South African legal term
 for people of mixed race - Asian (Indian) and white. The
 term black is used in the broad sense, embracing all those
 of color in South Africa - Africans, Coloreds and Asians.)
 Apartheid evolved from and is dependent upon a white
 monopoly of national political power. The Constitution
 of South Africa, as amended since the National Party came
 to power in 1948, denies all persons who are not white the
 right to vote in Parliamentary elections or to be a member
 of the Parliament. The Constitution, derived from the
 Westminister model, contains no bill of rights and provides
 complete parliamentary sovereignty. Moreover, the courts'
 power to construe or apply legislation has been limited by
 successive grants of virtually unreviewable discretion to
 the executive in many important areas, including individ-
 ual rights.
 South African Government policy holds that, because of South
 Africa's ethnic and cultural diversity and the present eco-
 nomic and educational disparities among its constitutent
 groups, an orderly society can best be achieved through
 separation of the races. A web of discriminatory laws and
 practices has thus been implemented throughout South Afri-
 can society. Important examples include: (a) the Consti-
 tution itself; (b) legislation which seeks to limit the
 citizenship and political rights of South Africa's 19.8
 million African citizens (71.5 percent of the population)
 to resource-poor homelands comprising 13 percent of the
 country's land area; (c) influx control or "pass" laws,
 which prescribe and limit the conditions under which Afri-
 can workers and their families may remain outside the
 homelands; (d) separate and unequal educational systems
 for the various race groups; (e) labor laws and practices
 that effectively limit the proportion of black workers
 as a percentage of a company's labor force in an urban
 area and tighten controls on the activities of free trade
 unions; (f) the Race Classification Act, which requires
 the categorization of every South African into a racial
 group through arbitrary physical characterizations; (g)
 the Group Areas Act, which mandates separate residential
 areas for whites, Coloreds, and Asians and which has
 resulted in the forced relocation of several hundred thou-
 sand people; (h) the Immorality and Mixed Marriage Acts,
 which make sexual relations or marriage between whites and
 (232)
 
 
 233
 persons of other races illegal; and (i) the Separate Ameni-
 ties Act, which authorizes the exclusive use of public fa-
 cilities by persons of a particular race without requiring
 equivalent facilities for other racial groups.
 South Africa has through the years also enacted legisla-
 tion that, in the name of security, curtails the civil
 liberties of those persons (of all races) whose statements,
 actions, or associations are viewed as seriously challeng-
 ing the established order. Security laws are used not
 only to convict the perpetrators of violence or intended
 violence against the State, but also to detain and/or con-
 vict persons involved in particular political organiza-
 tions, school boycotts, demonstrations, labor strikes and
 other peaceful forms of protest. Over 100 laws impose re-
 strictions on press reporting of internal security and
 other matters, and enforcement has been tightened in re-
 cent years. Legislation that would further restrict the
 press is currently being considered by a special commission.
 The Government holds firm to its commitment to preserve
 separate residential areas* schools, churches and social
 institutions. It continues to reject egalitarian politi-
 cal structures and insists that the national political
 aspirations of Africans--involving those living and work-
 Lng in the urban areas--should be achieved only through
 elected township councils and homeland government institu-
 tions. The operation of these lawD, although they are
 not always uniformly enforced, not only has deprived the
 black majority of South Africans of any voice in the na-
 tional Government, but also has severely limited geographic
 mobility and education and access to employment opportuni-
 ties, and denied them acceptance as equal members of South
 African society.
 Wile the South African Government defends its measures to
 preserve "white self-determination" as a necessary re-
 sponse to unique circumstances, it has acknowledged that
 apartheid, as originally envisioned by Prime Minister
 Verwoerd, has failed. The Government, thus, has committed
 itself to a process of political change. Agencies of the
 South African Government have indicated that separating
 South Africa into eleven separate economies is unworkable.
 While recognizing the indivisible character of South Africa
 as an economic unit and accepting economic integration, the
 South African Government continues to look for a political
 alternative to a unitary, non-racially divided South Africa.
 Slow movement toward a political concept called a *Constel-
 lation' of States is being promoted by the Government.
 Under this framework whites, Coloreds and Asians could exer-
 cise national political rights in common, Africans would
 exercise national political rights through their respective
 homelands, and the four groups could jointly exercise
 control at the local government level over areas of common
 concern.
 Consideration is being given by the ruling National Party
 to national political representation for the 800,000 Asian
 and 2.6 million Colored population, although no recommenda-
 tions have yet been submitted to the white Parliament by
 the South African Government (SAG). The questions involve
 whether there should be one Parliament with three cham-
 bers (for whites, Coloreds, and Asians) based on separate
 
 
 234
 voter rolls based on race, or whether there should be
 limited direct representation in a single-chamber Parliament
 based on separate voter rolls based on race.  National
 political participation for Africans is not being considered
 except in the homelands/apartheid context.
 The replacement of the all-white Senate by the white-
 Colored-Asian President's Council and the consideration
 of similar representation in a national assembly is seen
 by some observers as the primary objective of a reform pro-
 cess leading to a new political order. Because of the con-
 tinued relegation of blacks to the homelands in terms of
 national political participation, other observers believe
 that the current reform process is aimed at modernizing
 apartheid and not at fundamental political reform.
 The political structures provided for blacks greatly limit
 their political expression. Furthermore, free expression
 and political organizing outside those designated structures
 is severely curbed by punitive action by the SAG. Re-
 newed efforts to organize politically are continually
 hampered by detention and/or banning of black leaders.
 The absence of a political forum for expressing black views
 at the national level has had detrimental consequences for
 South Africa's labor reform policy. In recent years the
 SAG has implemented important changes in this area which
 improve black workers' rights, including collective bar-
 gaining. However, trade unions are seen by the SAG as be-
 coming increasingly politicized and thus in confrontation
 with South African security laws. Arrests of black trade.
 union leaders increased markedly in 1981 leading some ob-
 servers to conclude that as long as political structures
 provided for blacks limit their political expression,
 there will be a fundamental conflict between South Af-
 rica's labor reforms and security practices. It is ar-
 gued that this conflict characterizes the reform versus
 security dilemma now confronting South Africa and that
 the problem can only be resolved by addressing the basic
 question of national political rights for black South
 Africans.
 Many earlier major black political movements that advo-
 cated peaceful change--including the African National
 Congress (ANC), the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), the
 South African Students' Organization (SASO), the Black
 Peoples Convention (BPC)--have been banned. Some, like
 the ANC, now believe that peaceful change is no longer
 possible and are attempting to transform the present
 white-dominated structure of society by any means, in-
 cluding the use of violence.
 The two major black political organizations, the African
 National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress
 (PAC)--both of which were banned by the SAG and went
 into exile in the early 1960's--receive the bulk of their
 material support from the Soviet Union, China, and the
 Eastern Bloc countries. However, they also receive support
 from some Western and non-aligned countries, the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity (OAU) and most African states, and
 have been accorded observer status at the UN. The ANC
 maintains headquarters or operational bases in Zambia,
 Tanzania, and Mozambique and has offices in many Western
 nations, including the US.
 
 
 235
 The political conflict in South Africa has had ser-
 ious consequences for peace and regional stability in
 southern Africa and has taken on global implications.
 Because of the support for the ANC and PAC by the Soviet
 Union and its allies, the South African Government has
 concluded that it is the object of a 'total onslaught"
 of psychological, economic, political and even military
 pressure by the Soviet anion aimed at gaining control
 over the southern Africa region.
 Recent years have witnessed a rise in attacks on police,
 military and hard economic targets by the ANC and PAC.
 The first six months of 1981 saw an increase in violent
 activities, which Defense Minister Malan told Parliament
 represented a 200 percent increase over the previous six-
 month period. There were explosions in late May cutting
 rail lines in several places and damaging a South African
 Defense Force recruiting office in Durban. On August 12,
 1981 rockets damaged the SADF base at Voortrekkerhoogte
 outside Pretoria. Other attacks have been directed against
 homeland authorities, particularly those which have been
 made independent. On September 2, 1981 an armed group
 attacked a police station-in asopane, Bophuthatswana,
 killing three people. In June 1981 police arrested eight
 alleged members of a group named the South African Youth
 Revolutionary Council in Soweto.
 Use of neighboring states by the AMC and PAC for raids
 into South Africa has resulted in raids by South African
 Defense Forces against ANC and PAC targets in these states.
 The SAG has also sometimes supported dissident movements
 in some of these states. The situation is further aggravated
 by the conflict between SWAPO and South Africa over Namibia,
 resulting in South African incursions into Angola and SWAPO
 attacks against the South African Defense Force and other
 targets in Namibia.
 Right-wing violence inside South Africa has also risen
 during recent years. In September 1981 two members of
 the Wit Kommando were convicted under the Terrorism Act
 for bombing several institutions associated by the per-
 petrators with racial integration. In sentencing them to
 prison terms, the judge made a clear distinction between
 the Wit Kommando bombers and other groups such as the ANC
 whose violence is aimed at the SAG itself.
 The conflict between the-process of slow political change
 in South Africa and growing political pressures is a salient
 factor of South African life today. This has resulted in a
 growing conflict between the need for change and the need
 for domestic and regional security. While critics of the
 Government at home and abroad tend to view repression as a
 negation of the existence of change, there is also reason to
 believe that the SAG regards tight security as a necessary
 condition for its reform efforts.
 In 1981 the basic structures of apartheid continued to
 operate much as before, but with a suggestion of limited
 change in the basic pattern of political disenfranchise-
 ment of some black South Africans and some actual change
 in the pattern of institutionalized discrimination. What
 appears evident from these conflicting trends is that
 political change as an organic process is underway in
 
 
 236
 South Africa. Some observers believe that the increase
 in votes of extreme right-wing white political candi-
 dates in the April 29, 1981 Parliamentary election was
 a reaction to and thus validation of the existence of this
 process of change and the difficulties confronting the South
 African Government in this regard. How the need for secur-
 ity and the need for change will be addressed, and thus,
 where the process of change will lead, is as yet unclear.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned, but provisions of South African
 security laws allow police considerable latitude in
 arresting suspects and questioning detainees and abuses
 have occurred. For example, Section 6 of the Terrorism
 Act of 1967 permits detention for the purposes of interro-
 gation until a detainee has "satisfactorily replied to all
 questions" or until it is decided that further detention
 serves no purpose. Other statutes are interpreted to allow
 such interrogation of the detainees as seems "reasonable
 to the Government." Although there were no known deaths
 of security detainees between mid-July 1978 through
 November 1981, (contrasting with 52 deaths between 1963
 and 1978), police in the "independent" homeland of Venda
 have confirmed that Tshifhiwa Muofhe, a former member of
 the banned Black People's Convention (BPC), had died in
 detention shortly after he was arrested on November 10,
 1981. Although authorities in Venda denied rumors that
 others have died in detention there, there have been
 unconfirmed reports that at least two other individuals,
 Shoni Tshiuhase and Dickson Ralushia, have also died in
 police custody. Defendants and witnesses in a number of
 political trials in South Africa testified in court that
 they had been assaulted or abused by police during interro-
 gation. The Minister of Justice acknowledged in August
 1981 that 16 complaints of ill treatment had been received
 by the Ministry between February 1980 and June 1981. Of
 these, seven were found groundless, five were referred to
 the Attorney General, who declined to prosecute, three
 could not be substantiated, and one was still under
 investigation.
 In 1981 the SAG paid about $7,000 in damages to a prisoner
 who claimed that he was assaulted by a warden in a Trans-
 vaal prison in 1977. Others have charged that they have
 been beaten, kicked, subjected to electric shocks, and
 deprived of food, water and sleep.  In three instances
 during 1980, detainees or their families applied for court
 orders to restrain police from assaulting the detainees.
 Masabata (Mary) Loate, arraigned under the Terrorism Act
 December 1, 1981, charged that she had been tortured,
 raped, and sexually assaulted during her months of deten-
 tion under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act. Minister of
 Police Louis Le Grange denied the charges, and granted
 Miss Loate a hearing to contest them.
 Following the death in detention of black consciousness
 leader Steve Biko in 1977, the SAG began a practice of
 appointing two retired justices, designated by the Minister
 of Justice, to visit security detainees and file regular
 
 
 237
 confidential reports of their findings to the Minister
 of Justice. In September 1980 several released detainees
 charged that complaints they had made to their visiting
 inspectors resulted in no changes in the conditions of
 their detention.
 The most recent annual report for the Department of
 Prisons, which covers the year from July 1979- July
 1980, indicates that 276 prisoners died in jail. Of these
 the report said 222 died of natural causes; 28 died in
 assaults by fellow prisoners; 6 died trying to escape; 11
 committed suicidel 10 died in accidents the rest died of
 miscellaneous causes.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in South Africa have been criticized in
 the past for being unduly harsh for political prisoners,
 particularly those incarcerated on Robben Island. Reports
 indicate, however, a marked improvement in conditions at
 this prison since 1973. On December 3, 1981 the Commis-
 sioner of-Prisons announced that he was suspending family-
 visiting rights to those incarcerated on Robben Island be-
 cause of an alleged hunger strike by some of the prisoners.
 On December 15, 1981, the Commissioner announced that he
 was lifting the ban. Relatives of seven Robben Island
 prisoners had brought suit against the Minister of Police
 and Prisons, challenging the legality of the ban. Al-
 though the issue subsequently became moot, the Cape Town
 Supreme Court ruled that the Government should pay all
 costs of the suit, which indicates that the court found
 that the Commissioner had acted illegally in banning
 visits to Robben Island by families of prisoners.
 The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC)
 is permitted access to convicted security prisoners,
 including those on Robben Island. The ICRC is not per-
 mitted access to security detainees (those being held
 without charge for interrogation or those awaiting trial)
 with one exception: the ICRC is permitted annual visits
 to all detainees held under Section 10 of the Internal
 Security Act, which authorizes the Minister of Justice
 to order the detention for up to one year of any person
 believed to be engaging in activities which could en-
 danger the security of the State or maintenance of pub-
 lic order. Detainees held under Section 6 of the Terror-
 ism Act, (which provides for indefinite detention),
 Section 22 of the General Law Amendment Act, (which
 provides for detention of up to 14 days), and Section
 12(B) of the Internal Security Act (which provides for
 detention of up to 6 months for prospective State wit-
 nesses), are not accessible to the ICRC or any other
 outside body.
 The total daily average number of prisoners in South
 Africa during 1980 was 100,677 - 73,911 Africans, 21,950
 Coloreds, 551 Asians, and 4,225 whites.
 The Minister of Police indicated in August 1981 that in
 in the first six months of that year, a total of 76
 police officers were convicted of common assault, 12 were
 convicted of assault with intent to do grievous bodily
 harm, 4 of culpable homicide, I of murder. Six of the
 officers involved were discharged from the police force.
 
 
 238
 In December 1981 the South African press reported that
 three Durban policemen, two white detectives and a black
 patrolman had been arrested for the murder of four Africans
 jailed for a series of brutal muggings. A murder docket
 was opened and a police brigadier was assigned to carry
 out the investigation. The three policemen were reported
 to be held without bail in a Durban jail.
 South Africa has a parole system for short-term prisoners
 under which such prisoners are employed by private indivi-
 duals and companies, mostly on farms, as an alternative
 to incarceration. The Department of Prisons states that
 prisoners are not coerced to accept such employment, and
 that those who accept are allowed to choose their employers.
 A number of black prisoners employed under the parole
 labor system, including many Africans convicted under
 influx control laws, have charged mistreatment by their
 white employers.
 Many crimes carry the dealth penalty in South Africa,
 including murder, treason, rape, robbery and/or house-
 breaking with aggravating circumstances, sabotage, under-
 going training and obtaining information that could
 further an objective of Communism, and participating
 in terrorist activities. A person can be found guilty of
 the offense of participating in terroristic activities if
 he commits any act whatsoever with the intention of
 endangering the maintenance of law and order. The Terror-
 ism Act covers a range of offenses well beyond that as
 ordinarily regarded as treason. For example, the Act
 prohibits activities that are likely "to cause substantial
 financial loss to any person or the State." While the
 annual number of executions declined in the mid-1970's to
 below 60, there has been a marked increase in recent years
 - 132, 133, and 130 in 1978, 1979 and 1980 respectively.
 Of the 130 people (all male) executed in 1980, 85 were
 African, 43 Colored, I Indian and I white. By mid-June 69
 people had been executed by the State in 1981.
 Historically, the courts have not applied the death sen-
 tence to those copvicted of political crimes in which no
 one was killed. However, in August 1981 three persons
 supposedly affiliated with the ANC were convicted of high
 treason in connection with various charges of terrorism
 and sabotage in which no persons were killed. They were
 sentenced to death by the Pretoria Supreme Court. The
 case is currently under appeal. It has been alleged that
 sentences, particularly death sentences, have been racially
 skewed. A South African law professor found that statis-
 tically, more blacks have been raped by whites than vice
 versa; yet historically, 150 black men have been executed
 for raping white women, while no white man has ever been
 executed or even sentenced to death for raping a black
 woman.
 Under the Internal Security Act, the Minister of Justice
 may invoke a banning order against any person he or
 she finds to be engaging in activities considered dangerous
 to the security of the State or the maintenance of public
 order. A banning order usually restricts a person to
 a particular area, prohibits visiting certain facilities
 or attending gatherings (defined as any group consisting
 of the banned person and more than one other individual,)
 and may prohibit the banned person from pursuing his
 
 
 239
 or her livlihood. When the banning order restricts
 an individual to a remote part of the country or to an
 area other than the individual's domicile at the time of
 the banning, it is commonly referred to as banishment.
 Banning orders are usually imposed for periods ranging
 from two to five years and may be renewed. Because the
 imposition of a banning order may be challenged in court
 only if it can be shown that the Minister acted in bad
 faith or did not consider the matter carefully, a banned
 person is without legal recourse, as the Minister is not
 required to disclose reasons for issuing a banning order.
 In August 1981 the appeal court in Bloemfontein in effect
 upheld the interpretation of banning orders which pro-
 scribes a banned individual from attending social gather-
 ings. The court ruled "if the safety of the State or
 the maintenance of the public order demanded that a
 potentially dangerous person (as contemplated in the Act)
 must be kept harmless, then sound sense required that such
 a person must be prohibited from attending any form of
 social gathering." According to the Government Gazette
 there were 157 outstanding banning orders as of June 30,
 1981. In July 24 of these were withdrawn. During the
 first six months of 1981 a total of 16 people were charged
 under the Internal Security Act, including executive -
 members of the Media Workers' Association of South Africa
 and the president of the Student Representative Council at
 the University of Witwatersrand. South African Institute
 of Race Relations statistics show that approximately 1,400
 people were served with banning orders between 1950 and
 June 1981. Of these, approximately 370 have left the
 country.
 c. Disappearances
 South African laws do not require notification of a de-
 tainee's family, lawyer, or any other person when the in-
 dividual is detained or released. in fact, the Second
 Police Amendment Act of 1980 prohibits unauthorized pub-
 lication of the name of any person detained during a
 police action "for the prevention or combatting of ter-
 roristic activities." Police spokesmen usually do not
 volunteer information on detainees, although they respond
 to written inquiries about their status.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In its 1981 report, Amnesty International cited detention
 without trial as among its main concerns in South Africa..
 Other Amnesty International concerns were imprisonment of
 persons Amnesty regards as "prisoners of conscience, bann-
 ings, torture and the death penalty.*
 In general, South Africa's security legislation permits
 broad interpretation and severe punishment. Several
 South African statutes provide for arrest and detention
 for varying lengths of time without legal recourse and
 provide for unlimited detention. The General Laws
 Amendment Act of 1966, Terrorism Act, Internal Security
 Act, and Criminal Procedures Act of 1977 all provide for
 arrest without a warrant under certain circumstances. A
 person may be detained for 14 days without charge before
 being brought to court under Section 22 of the General
 Laws Amendment Act of 1966, for 180 days (which may be
 
 
 240
 renewed) under Section 12(b) of the Internal Security Act,
 and for an indefinite period of time under Section 6 of
 the Terrorism Act. While detained under these provisions
 a person does not have access to legal counsel until
 charged or brought to court as a witness, and a Section 6
 detainee can be held in solitary confinement without
 access to anyone, including family and legal counsel for
 unlimited detention. No court can order release of the
 detainee. In addition to these laws, preventive detention
 for up to 12 months at a time is authorized by Section 10
 of the Internal Security Act, although a committee consist-
 ing of a judge or magistrate and two other persons may
 recommend (but not require) a detainee's release. Section
 10 detainees are entitled to and normally receive privi-
 leges accorded ordinary prisoners awaiting trial.
 According to South African Institute of Race Relations
 statistics, 965 people were detained in 1980 and ap-
 proximately 218 people were detained from November 1,
 1980 to July 31, 1981.
 In August 1981 the Minister of Police indicated that
 75 people were being held under Section 6 of the Terror-
 ism Act, 4 under Section 10 of the Internal Security
 Act, and 7 under Section 22 of the General Law Amendment
 Act. Twenty-five persons under the age of 18 were held
 under security legislation in the first half of 1982,
 while 127 minors were held under these laws in 1980. The
 total number of convicted security prisoners in South
 Africa as of September 1981 was 505, including 10 women
 and 10 whites. As of September 1981 there were 473
 security prisoners on Robben Island. Robben Island
 accommodates almost all convicted black male security
 prisoners in addition to certain criminal prisoners who
 occupy separate facilities on the island.
 The number of people charged under the Immorality Act
 has dropped in recent years -- from 355 in 1978/ 79 to 199
 in 1980/81 -- and most convictions have ended with sus-
 pended sentences.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the principle of habeas corpus is affirmed in South
 African common law, it is circumscribed in practice by
 various security law provisions as noted above. In gen-
 eral, all persons except those detained under Section 22
 of the General Laws Amendment Act of 1966 and Section 6
 of the Terrorism Act have the right to counsel. If a per-
 son cannot pay for his or her own defense, the publicly
 financed legal aid boards or various private organizations
 have limited funds for legal assistance, but these sources
 do not accept all cases, nor do they meet more than a
 small fraction of the total need. Only in cases involving
 capital offenses, the court may appoint counsel without
 charge. The Hoexter Commission report released to Parlia-
 ment on September 1981 revealed such a severe staff
 shortage at the Department of Justice that the administra-
 tion of justice had been prejudiced. There is a drastic
 shortage of qualified magistrates and state attorneys.
 Once legal assistance is obtained and paid for, a defendant
 has access to counsel throughout the course of proceedings.
 
 
 241
 While convicted prisoners are generally allowed access to
 their attorneys, the timing and frequency of such visits
 are at the discretion of local prison authorities. Many
 lawyers who defend persons accused under security laws
 have alleged harassment by the security police and govern-
 ment agencies. Several attorneys who defended persons
 accused in political trials have been banned or have fled
 the country. Black attorney K. Griffiths Mxenge was bru-
 tally murdered in Durban in November 1961 by persons un-
 known.
 Because an individual detained under security law may be
 interrogated without access to counsel, that person may
 admit to actions or charges the implications of which he
 or she may not fully understand. Such statements are
 usually admissible in court. The Terrorism Act provides
 for unlimited detention until *no useful purpose will be
 served by further detention.*   No court can order release
 of the detainee. Long periods of detention in solitary
 confinement, and reported assaults and/or inducements to
 make statements may also jeopardize a detainees's ability
 to be effectively represented and obtain a fair trial.
 Sometimes an individual may not be aware that legal
 assistance has been obtained. In several instances
 attorneys retained by families of detained persons have
 found out through newspaper articles shortly before the
 fact that their client was about to be brought to trial.
 In addition, many trials are held Oin camera" and some
 trials are held in distant parts of the country making it
 difficult or impossible for family and others to attend.
 Witnesses may give testimony without being publicly
 identified if the court deems it necessary.
 South African law acknowledges the right to bail, but in
 cases involving certain crimes or security laws a magis-
 trate may withhold bail. No court is permitted to grant
 trial to a person charged under the Terrorism Act without
 the consent of the Attorney General. Trial by jury was
 abolished by Parliament in 1969. (Jury trials, when these
 existed, were always before all-white juries, and blacks
 were never permitted to be impaneled irrespective of
 whether the defendent in a case was black or white.)
 Protection against double jeopardy, recognized in the
 Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 (the comprehensive statute
 governing South African criminal law), is undermined by
 the Sabotage Act and the Terrorism Act, which provide that
 a person may be tried for another offense deriving from
 the same action.
 In addition, charges under Section 2 of the Terrorism Act
 and Section 11 of the Internal Security Act reverse the
 presumption that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
 Under Section 2 of the Terrorism Act, a person must prove
 beyond a reasonable doubt that an act which he or she is
 proved to have committed was not undertaken with the
 intent to endanger the maintenance of law and order. This
 Act prohibits activities that are likely 'to cause sub-
 stantial financial loss to any person or the State,* also
 actions *calculated to create feelings of hostility
 between whites and blacks*. Under Section 11, a person
 must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she did
 not undergo training or obtain information which could
 further the objects of Communism or any unlawful organiza-
 tion.
 
 
 242
 Security as well as criminal trials are held before
 regular courts, which have been generally regarded as
 being independent of executive or military control.
 However, in August 1980 it was revealed that a code of
 conduct for magistrates issued by the Department of
 Justice requested magistrates not to criticize Government
 departments in judgments unless such criticism was felt
 absolutely essential to a judgment. In addition, the
 appointment of several civil servants as judges has led to
 charges that the Government is attempting to influence the
 courts in this manner. There have been no recent cases of
 civilians being tried by military courts and no known
 summary executions.
 In addition to the three ANC members who were sentenced
 under the terms of the Terrorism Act, four more alleged
 ANC guerrillas were convicted of multiple counts under the
 Terrorism Act in September 1981 on charges of undergoing
 military training abroad and plotting sabotage and assassi-
 nation. They were sentenced to ten years in prison.
 f. Invasion of the.Home
 The Black (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act allows police
 entry to homes without a warrant if they suspect any black
 person may be illegally residing or employed therein. In
 addition, black persons have been forcibly removed from
 their homes in connection with Government-ordered reloca-
 tion to other areas designed for different racial groups
 or homeland areas.
 Section 25 of the Criminal Procedures Act of 1977 authori-
 zes a judge or magistrate to issue a search warrant if
 there are reasonable grounds to believe that "the internal
 security of the Republic or the maintenance of law and
 order is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of
 any meeting" being held in a given place. Under Section
 25 a police officer may enter, search, and question anyone
 in a place without a warrant if the officer has reason to
 believe that a warrant for such purposes would be issued
 but that the delay caused by first obtaining the warrant
 would defeat the purpose of the search.
 African home ownership outside the homelands is virtually
 nonexistant due to SAG laws and restrictions. Rather,
 homes are rented from the SAG which owns and subsidizes
 them. In 1978 the 99-year leasehold was introduced whereby
 qualified township residents may apply to the Government
 for a 99-year lease on their home or place of business.
 However, by mid-1981, fewer than 1,100 99-year leaseholds
 had been granted throughout the Republic.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Preedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The press, particularly the opposition press in South Af-
 rica, continues to be a vigorous critic of the Government
 and carries extensive reporting and commentary on basic
 government policies, especially in regard to the Govern-
 ment's constitutional proposals, separate development in
 general, and the condition of the various racial communi-
 ties. Despite its progressive curtailment by a complex
 web of restraints justified by the SAG in the name of
 
 
 243
 security, the press nonetheless remains a vital channel
 of communication within South African society.
 The number and scope of laws which restrict the press have
 increased in recent years. During the 1980 Parliamentary
 session, in particular, three laws were enacted which
 further limited the press' ability to fully report matters
 affecting internal security and human rights. The Na-
 tional Key Points Act, which provides for the security of
 installations regarded as being strategic, prohibits the
 publication of "any information relating to the security
 measures applicable at or in respect of any national key
 points or in respect of any incident that occurred there"
 without the approval of the Minister of Defense. Failure
 to comply with the law is punishable by a fine up to
 RIO,000 (RI.00 equals $1.08) or three years imprisonment
 or both. Significant press curbs were also contained in
 the Second Police Amendment Act, which prohibits the
 publication of information on the "constitution, move-
 ments, deployment, or methods of any member or part of the
 South African police" involved in preventing "terrorist"
 activity, or of names of those detained under Section 6 of
 the Terrorism Act, without permission of the Minister or
 Commissioner of Police. Violation of the Act may be
 punished by a R15,000 fine and/or eight years imprisonment.
 A third law, the Armaments Development and Production
 Amendment Act of 1980, prohibits the disclosure of any
 information relating to the acquisition, trade, manufac-
 ture, or research on armaments in connection with the
 South African Arms Corporation or subsidiary companies.
 These three Acts supplement a formidable array of laws
 restricting the press: the Internal Security Act of
 1950, the Criminal-Procedure Act of 1955, the Defense
 Act of 1957, the Prisons Act of 1959 and 1965, the
 General Law Amendment Act of 1962, the Atomic Energy
 Act of 1967, and the Advocate-General Act introduced
 in 1979. In the 1981 Parliamentary session the SAG
 introduced another bill, the South African Transport
 Services Bill, which bans unauthorized reports of rail-
 way police security activity or the disclosure of names
 and details o  people detained in the course of such
 action. The   11l passed its second reading in August
 1961.
 In addition to restrictive legislation, the SAG occasion-
 ally takes direct action to suppress press activities.
 The largest circulation black newspaper - "The Post -
 which replaced the "World" after its banning in 1977 -
 was closed early in 1981 under a technicality in the
 law. Several South African journalists - including
 Zwelakhe Sisulu, Murimutha Subramoney, and Mathatha Tsedu
 were issued banning orders in late 1980-early 1981.
 American journalist Nat Gibson, bureau chief for UPI in
 South Africa, was charged in August 1981 under the De-
 fense Act, which prohibits the unauthorized publication
 of potentially embarrassing or alarming statements re-
 lating to the South Africa Defense Force (SADF). The
 charges stem from a report which Gibson filed from the
 scene of a labor strike in the Eastern Cape in June 1980
 revealing that SADP troops were protecting factories
 against strikers. His case was subsequently dropped
 
 
 244
 by the Government. The work permit of AP correspondent
 Cynthia Stevens was not renewed in late 1981 without ex-
 planation forcing her to leave South Africa.
 Direct Government censorship of all other publications,
 films, and public entertainment is authorized by the
 Publications Act of 1974, which does not apply to newspa-
 pers. The Government-appointed publications committees
 established by the Act may prohibit the distribution or
 possession of publications, films, or other public en-
 tertainment that are considered obscene or blasphemous,
 that bring any section of the public into ridicule,
 that harm relations between sections of the public, or
 that are prejudicial to the safety of the state. Of a
 total 2,177 publications submitted for committee review
 in 1980, 1,313 (60.25 percent-) were found to be undesir-
 able. The committees may allow distribution of a pub-
 lication or the holding of an event subject to certain
 restrictions, such as age limits for attendance at pub-
 lic events. Decisions of the publications committees
 may be appealed to the Government-appointed Publications
 Appeal Board but not to the courts. Recent statistics
 show that the ratio of material banned for being "pre-
 judicial to the state" has risen vis-a-vis the banning
 of material deemed pornographic or immoral. Out of
 a total of 606 full-length films reviewed in 1980, 347
 were approved unconditionally, 198 were approved sub-
 ject to certain age and/or excision restrictions, and
 53 were rejected.
 The South African Government has in the past taken ac-
 tions which attempt to limit the performance of certain
 normal diplomatic or consular activities. Through its
 restrictive visa and passport policies, the South African
 Government has exercised a degree of control over parti-
 cipants in U.S. International Communication Agency pro-
 grams, including official speakers and international
 visitor grantees. In 1981, the Department of Foreign
 Affairs and Information served notice to all diplomatic
 missions that all Embassy films shown off of Embassy
 premises were subject to official censorship.
 The Riotous Assemblies Act as amended authorizes the SAG
 to prohibit any public or private gatherings of 12 or
 or more people. In response to the widespread unrest
 in 1976, the Minister of Justice banned any outdoor gather-
 ings except sports 'or specially authorized meetings.
 Though originally invoked for a one-year period, the
 ban has been renewed each successive year and is still
 in effect. A separate, two-month ban on all gatherings
 of a political nature involving more than ten persons
 was allowed to expire on August 31, 1980, but the Minister
 of Justice warned that he would reimpose the ban if he
 deemed it necessary. On February 13 Chief Magistrates in
 many districts invoked the Riotous Assemblies Act to ban
 memorial services over the February 14-15 weekend for
 the 12 ANC exiles killed in the South African .raid into
 Matola, Mozambique the previous month.
 Freedom of association is regulated by the complex of
 laws prescribing separate residential areas and public
 facilities for different racial groups. The Popula-
 tion Registration Act requires that each person by as-
 signed a particular racial category (white, Asian, Cape
 
 
 245
 Colored, etc.). In the case of Africans, their ethno-
 linguistic affiliation must also be designated (Zulu,
 Xhosa, Northern Sotho, etc.). Such racial categoriza-
 tion largely determines from the outset one's position,
 rights, and opportunities in the society. It is possi-
 ble to appeal the ruling on one's classification. In
 this context, 221 people applied in 1980 to change
 their race classification, including 133 former Cape
 Coloreds who were re-designated white, one white and
 four Indians who became Cape Coloreds, three Malays
 and six Cape Coloreds who became Indians, three whites
 who became Chinese, and one white and one Indian who
 became Malay. There are no set guidelines on determin-
 ing what race a person belongs to.
 In recent years the Government has expanded the scope
 of administrative exemptions from apartheid laws, allow-
 ing some restaurants, drive-in theaters, private hospi-
 tals, libraries, and other public amenities to admit
 persons of all races upon application. As of February
 20, 1981 a total of 69 hotels enjoyed "international"
 status, thereby permitting use by all races. In addi-
 tion Minister Viljoen announced on May 22, 1981 the
 SAG's intention to amend those portions of the Liquor
 Act, the Group Areas Act, the Black (Urban Areas) Con-
 solidation Act which create immediate barriers to mixed
 sport. On September 8, 1981, the SAG announced that
 it was still Government policy to disallow joint at-
 tendance of cinemas by members of different racial
 groups. In the 1981 session of Parliament the SAG in-
 troduced the Financial Relations Amendment Bill which
 would enpower provincial councils to permit "the ad-
 mission of persons who are not white .... to schools in
 the province registered .... as private schools."
 There has been some improvement in the right of assembly
 as regards labor, as the Government has continued to
 implement a substantial number of the reforms proposed by
 the Wiehahn Commission. The sixth and final of the
 Commission's reports was published in late 1981. Among
 the Wiehahn recommendations accepted have been the removal
 of all reference to race in labor legislation, an agreement
 in principle to remove the last vestiges of job reservation
 which denied blacks certain jobs in the mining industry, and
 the extension of trade union rights to foreign workers. Key
 issues under active study include the controversial question
 of union registration procedures and the extension of trade
 union rights to the large numbers of agricultural and
 domestic workers.
 The South African worker is still denied the right to
 picket, however, and the inability of the Government to
 date to create an industrial relations framework which
 the newer black unions will join results in the vast ma-
 jority of strikes occurring in violation of the law.
 The South African Government, often in coordination with
 homelands security officials, continues to apply strictly
 security laws and to detain black unionists as well as their
 white academic and youth group allies.
 Over 200 trade unionists were detained under security
 laws in South Africa in 1981, most of whom were held in
 the Ciskei homeland. Leaders of the South African Allied
 
 
 246
 Workers' Union (SAAWU) were repeatedly jailed under the
 General Laws Amendment and Terrorism Acts. In addition to
 the security laws, the terms of the 1979 Fund Raising
 Act, which is administered by the Ministry of Health,
 were imposed on one of the largest black confederations to
 shut off its overseas funding sources.
 Freedom of religion is generally respected, and religious
 organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other ac-
 tivities without interference so long as they do not chal-
 lenge Government policies or otherwise venture into the
 political realm. Government Minister Andries Treurnicht
 told a National Party Provincial Congress on November 3
 that, while the Government recognized their authority in
 their own sphere, the "churches should not overplay their
 ecclesiastical hand." Conscientious objector status on
 religious grounds is generally denied except in certain
 cases involving members of "peace churches," e.g., the
 Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Government ministers often criticize the South African
 Council of Churches (SACC) and its General Secretary,
 Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu. On September 12, 1981 in
 Parliament, for example, the Minister of Police accused
 the SACC and Bishop Tutu of launching and supporting
 activities which were "nowhere different from those of the
 ANC," and implied that Bishop Tutu supported violent
 change in South Africa. Earlier in 1981 the Government
 revoked Bishop Tutu's passport (the second time in as many
 years) following a trip to North America and Europe during
 which he made comments urging diplomatic, political and
 economic pressure on the SAG to institute internal reforms.
 Certain Protestant and Roman Catholic organizations
 received severe criticism from the SAG during the removal
 of squatters at Nyanga (see below) and were accused
 of instigating civil disobedience and supporting the
 squatters. Some clergymen who have actively opposed
 Government policy remain banned. Rev. Sol Jacob, a
 Methodist minister, was released in August 1981 without
 explanation after six weeks' detention under Section
 6 of the Terrorism Act.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except that they must obtain permits to visit African
 townships and homelands, white South Africans, other
 than banned persons, are generally free to move about
 the country. Whites must also possess valid travel
 documents in'order to travel abroad and emigrate legally.
 Other South Africans are subject to severe restrictions
 contained in laws implementing the Government's policy of
 separate development. Persons designated as Colored or
 Asian are required by the Group Areas act to reside in
 areas set aside for these groups and, like Africans, may
 not legally enter facilities reserved for whites, unless
 these facilities have received governmental permission to
 admit them. The Minister of Community Development an-
 nounced in Parliament on September 6, 1981 that the SAG
 would introduce new legislation next year to enable the
 authorities to evict more expeditiously Coloreds and
 Asians living illegally in "white" areas. No Asians can
 reside nor legally stay overnight in the Orange Free
 
 
 247
 State, one of South Africa's four provinces, and in
 certain parts of Natal Province without special permis-
 sion. Africans' residences-and travel are currently
 regulated by a system of influx control or pass laws which
 .severely restrict the number of Africans entitled to stay
 in a given-urban area for-more than 72 hours at a time.
 Africans entitled to reside outside the homelands do not
 have the .legal right to have even the immediate family
 join them. Untold numbers of African families are forced
 to separate under these conditions, although two recent
 court rulings have invalidated regulations which further
 .circumscribed a black worker's "right" to remain in an
 urban area and be accompanied by his family. Whereas only
 -Africans were traditionally-required to carry reference
 books - which contained data relating to their entitlement
 to be outside the homelands and could be checked on demand
 by police-officers - the SAG has begun issuing new,
 -uniform identity- documents to South Africans of all races.
 These identity-documents are, nonetheless, number-coded by
 racial category-and the-pass laws themselves remain for
 the most part unchanged.
 Periodically, the:police will conduct raids or sweeps
 during which all passes are checked and people ille-
 gally resident are arrested and/or transported to
 their assigned homeland.. For example, on May 21, 1981
 210-police officers and-8 police dogs raided a men's
 hostel .in Soweto in which 287 Africans were arrested, 15
 of whom required hospital treatment for dog bites. A
 total of 74,360 people-vere arrested for pass law offenses
 in the first half of 1981 - an average of 17 an hour.
 Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and removal has not
 .-deterred many Africans-from.seeking the greater economic
 opportunities available in urban areas. In fact, the
 MHinister of Cooperation.and-Development estimated in
 August 1981 that nearly 43 percent of the Africans in.
 greater Cape Town alone were there illegally. In an
 incident which received worldwide publicity and was
 -witnessed by a U.S. Congressional delegation, SAG author-
 ities arrested over 1,000 Africans illegally squatting in
 Nyanga outside Cape Town and transported most of them to
 the Transkei and the Ciskei which the authorities consider
 their homelands. While many of the Africans were working
 -illegally,.others were family members of those legally
 _working in the, area for whom-there was no family housing.
 The threat of removal is not limited to undocumented
 Africans in urban areas. It is estimated that over
 two million blacks have been resettled from one area
 to another since 1960 as a.result of the Government's
 efforts to implement its-ethnic blueprint for South
 Africa. In addition to consolidating the homeland terri-
 tories, the Government also has a policy of resettling in
 - the -homelands residents of so-called "black spots" in
 white rural areas. In most cases, the resettlement has
 been under direct duress, by means of forcibly transport-
 ing individuals and their belongings to the areas in.which
 they are to be resettled; in others, the pressure has been
 more.subtle.
 ..In the-wake of the Nyanga incident,the Minister of
 Cooperation and Development retracted a public commitment
 -that there would be no more "forced" removals and announced
 that resettling and border changes were responsible for
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 17
 
 
 248
 the fact that more than half of the country's Africans now
 reside in the homelands. This represents a 44.7 percent
 increase in the African population living in the homelands
 since 1970, as compared to an 11.6 percent population
 increase of Africans outside the homelands.
 In 1981 Prime Minister P. W. Botha publicly declared
 that a citizen's access to a South African passport was a
 privilege, not a right. Meanwhile, the Minister of
 Internal Affairs acknowledged that 85 people (22 white, 29
 Africans, 26 Asians, and 7 Coloreds) either had their
 passports withdrawn or refused or had their passport
 renewals refused during 1980. In addition to Bishop
 Tutu's passport withdrawal, 1981 saw Hassan Bowa, former
 President of the South African Council of Sport and
 journalist Leslie Xinwa denied passports for travel to the
 United States to accept official U.S. Government leader
 grants. Normally, the SAG requires that those individuals
 assigned to an "independent" homeland must travel abroad
 on the homeland travel document. No country beyond South
 Africa, however, recognizes the "indepedent" homelands as
 sovereign nations. Many Africans have refused invitations
 to travel abroad to avoid acknowledging a non-South Afri-
 can citizenship by accepting a homeland passport. Passport
 applicants are often required to deposit R400 in the event
 of destitution abroad.
 Emigration, which is discouraged by SAG currency regula-
 tions, is down considerably in 1980 from the previous
 year. Nevertheless, an average of 17,440 people have
 emigrated each year since 1976, as compared to an average
 of 8,883 per year for the decade prior to 1976. The SAG
 promotes immigration, particularly of skilled whites, and
 immigration figures are on the rise again.
 The Aliens Act No. 1 of 1937 contains the following
 language concerning ground rules for the boards which act
 on applications for permanent residence in South Africa:
 "(3) The Board may authorize the issue of a permit to
 enter the Union for the purpose of permanent residence
 therein, to an alien who has applied therefore as aforesaid
 and who is, in its opinion, a desirable immigrant. The
 granting or withholding of such authority shall be entirely
 in the discretion of the Board: provided that the Board
 shall not authorize the issue of such a permit unless
 the applicant therefore:
 (A) is of good character; and
 (B) is likely to become readily assimilated with the
 European inhabitants of the Union and to become
 a desirable inhabitant of the Union within a rea-
 sonable period after his entry into the Union."
 The South African Government has confirmed that this
 law still stands and that subparagraph (B) would seem to
 exclude immigration of so-called non-whites into South
 Africa. Nevertheless, it appears that some prospective
 brides of South Africans of Indian descent are allowed to
 immigrate to South Africa on an exceptional basis to
 undertake marriages which have been pre-arranged by their
 families.
 The net loss of South African residents which was experi-
 enced in 1977 and 1978 has now been reversed. Under
 
 
 249
 Section 10 of the South African Citizenship Act of 1949,
 any white immigrant regardless of language, may automati-
 cally gain citizenship after five years. For example,
 many white Portuguese born in Angola and Mozambique have
 become South African citizens. By contrast, African
 persons born in South Africa are not considered South
 African citizens. Only those Africans assigned to
 as-yet non-independent homelands have both homeland and
 South African citizenship.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Apartheid remains the foundation of a white-controlled
 political system. Political participation at the na-
 tional level is available to whites through a democratic
 multi-party system but is denied to persons of other races.
 White South Africans may participate in a parliamentary
 system similar to the British model. While the ruling
 National Party has a substantial majority, two small
 opposition parties, which operate as freely as the ruling
 party, are represented in Parliament.
 In the April 1981 elections the National Party was re-
 turned to power based on 777,558 votes received out of
 1,389,957 votes cast by the white electorate. The Na-
 tional Party vote represents 55.9 percent of total votes
 cast and 36.9 percent of potential eligible white voters.
 The-figure also represents approximately 5 percent of
 all persons of voting age irrespective of race or 2.8
 percent of South Africa's total population of 27.7 million.
 Through this racially-based electoral system South Af-
 rica's 4.5 million whites (16.2 percent of the popula-
 tion) perpetuate their domination over and disenfran-
 chisement of South Africa's 23.2 million black citizens.
 The Political Interference Act of 1968 makes it unlawful
 for a person of one racial group to join a political
 party which has members from other racial groups; to
 participate in an election campaign for a person of
 another racial group; or to address a group of people, all
 or most of whom belong to another racial group, in order
 to promote a political party. Thus, each racial group
 must pursue its political aspirations in distinct struc-
 tures, each of which provides a different degree of poli-
 tical disenfranchisement.
 Political structures assigned to South Africans designat-
 ed as Colored or Asian are considerably limited in scope.
 The Colored Persons Representative Council, which had a
 measure of legislative and budgetary authority over Colored
 affairs but was opposed by the Labor Party (which had a
 majority of seats on the Council), as an unacceptable
 apartheid structure, was allowed to lapse in 1980.
 Legislation providing for a Colored Person's Council was
 passed in the 1980 Parliamentary session but not imple-
 mented, probably because of opposition from the Colored
 community and the creation of the President's Council.
 The South African Indian Council (SAIC), the corresponding
 advisory organization for Asians, was dissolved on October
 31, 1980. Elections for a new body were held on November
 4, 1981. Most observers feel that the 10% voter turnout for
 these elections is indicative of the Indian community's
 rejection, as voiced by many of its leaders, of the SAIC
 
 
 250
 as a legitimate vehicle for political expression.
 In 1980 the Government appointed 60 whites, Coloreds, and
 Asians to serve on the President's Council, a body created
 by constitutional amendment to advise the executive on
 matters of state, particularly those relating to the politi-
 cal dispensation of blacks. The members appointed included
 45 whites, 10 Coloreds, and 5 Asians. while Africans are
 not represented, the President's Council is the first
 multiracial consultative body at the national level. The
 President's Council convened for the first time in 1981 and
 solicited opinions from many sectors of South African
 society. The Council is scheduled to present to the all-
 white Parliament its major proposals in the coming two-three
 years. One of the Asian members of the Council resigned in
 late 1981 to protest the Government's continued refusal to
 include Africans in it. The limited nature of the Presi-
 dent's Council is underscored by the exclusion of Africans
 and the apparent failure by the Government to act on some
 of the Council's initial recommendations.
 The white political system has arbitrarily politically
 aggregated black linguistic groups into nine so-called
 ethnic groups. Claims are made that 10 resulting home-
 lands are nations in a political sense deserving of the
 right to self-determination.  While English, Portuguese
 and Afrikaans are spoken by the white community, no such
 linkage between language, race and nationhood are made for
 whites. Whites are considered whites and are accorded
 political rights regardless of the langagues spoken.
 Africans are divided into separate nations based on the
 languages spoken and the supposed ethnic/separate national
 differences derived from this distinction. Since 1970,
 all Africans have been considered to be citizens of their
 own homelands or "national states." Each African from
 birth is assigned citizenship in one of the ten homelands
 (there are two Xhosa homelands - the Transkei and Ciskei)
 on the basis of his or her tribal heritage, language,
 etc., regardless of whether the individual was born, or
 has lived, or ever been in his or her "place of origin."
 As long as their homeland has not been made "independent"
 - as have the the Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and
 Ciskei - the individuals remain nationals of South Africa
 affiliated on an ethnic basis to their assigned homeland.
 However, when the homeland is made "independent," South
 African nationality is withdrawn, leaving the individual
 simply a citizen of the homeland, with rights in South
 Africa based on "international" agreements with the new
 "states." In this manner over six million Africans have
 already been divested of their former South African
 citizenship. The Ciskei received independence December 4,
 1981 on the same legislative basis as the previous three
 homelands, although an agreement with the SAG may provide
 for reciprocal use of travel documents by South Africans
 and Ciskeian "citizens" under certain circumstances.
 In theory, all citizens of the homelands are entitled
 to participate in the homeland political process. In
 practice, at least half of the legislatures' membership is
 appointed from among the ranks of the traditional authori-
 ties. A number of opposition leaders have been restricted
 or imprisoned, and white civil servants seconded from the
 SAG still wield considerable decision-making power. Such
 rights as the people of the nonindependent homelands have
 
 
 251
 are conferred - and may be withdrawn - by the white Parlia-
 ment, which establishes systems for governance of all South
 Africans.
 To a great extent, "independent" homelands have adopted
 security legislation modeled on South Africa's, although
 Bophuthatswana's constitution does contain a bill of
 rights. In the Transkei, Venda, and the Ciskei, security
 laws have been used against political opponents of the
 government. For example, the Transkeian government banned
 34 political and religious organizations in 1979. The
 Ciskeian Government continues to exercise extraordinary
 security powers in terms of a state of emergency declared
 in September 1977, and it is estimated that about 15 percent
 of the Republic's political prisoners are detained in the
 Ciskei. On September 6, 1981 Ciskeian police used security
 legislation (R252) which permits indefinite detention
 without recourse to legal counsel to detain 205 members of
 three independent trade unions which are active in the East
 London area. At one point earlier in 1981 a total of 57
 trade unionists were being held under Ciskei's security
 legislation.
 Although all Africans are technically homeland citizens,
 approximately ten million live in so-called white areas;
 the majority of these persons reside in urban areas. The
 right which a limited number of Africans have to stay
 permanently in urban areas is not inheritable, and any
 child born after the "independence" of the homeland to
 which he is assigned is considered a foreigner in South
 Africa.
 The SAG has appointed committees to look into the problems
 of Africans, including territorial consolidation of the
 homelands and the role of the urban African within the
 context of separate development, but their reports are
 still considered confidential and tentative. At present,
 political participation by urban Africans is limited to
 electing community councils for their townships. During
 1980 the limited responsibilities of certain community
 councils were expanded to include the authority to levy
 rent increases, allocate housing, and oversee the admin-
 �istration of projects such as township electrification.
 Nevertheless, their role remains circumscribed by their
 continuing financial and administrative dependence on the
 Department of Cooperation and Development and the Admin-
 istration Boards which oversee them. Three draft bills
 concerning changes in urban black administration and
 influx control, were released for public comment in
 1980, but were withdrawn in the face of opposition from
 many sides and are being revised for re-introduction in
 the future.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The SAG has been critical of complaints about its human
 rights record by United Nations organizations and groups
 such as Amnesty International. The Government objections
 are based on questions of factual accuracy, political
 content and intent of the reports, bias, and fairness in
 terms of whether or not similar standards are applied
 
 
 252
 elsewhere, particularly in black Africa.  Note is also made
 of whether such reports fully and factually account for
 changes which may be underway or underlying security reasons
 which may motivate police and/or judicial actions.
 South Africa extends little or no cooperation to various
 United Nations bodies investigating its human rights
 record because the Government contends the organization is
 biased. It does permit representatives of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross to visit on an annual basis
 Section 10 detainees and the Robben Island maximum secur-
 ity prison where political prisoners are held. The ICRC's
 findings are not made public, but its discussions with the
 SAG have reportedly led to improved conditions at Robben
 Island. The SAG continues to refuse ICRC access to those
 detained under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act.
 Freedom House, an American civil liberties organization,
 reviewed South Africa in 1980. On a scale from 1 to 7
 (with 7 indicating the lowest level) South Africa was rated
 5 and 6 on political rights and civil liberties, respec-
 tively. Freedom House for the first time designated South
 Africa as "not free." This designation was based not
 on a deterioration of conditions in South Africa, as Freedom
 House feels that there have been significant relaxations
 in apartheid which are expected to continue. Rather, it
 is based on an added emphasis on the existing constraints
 in South Afriaca regarding the freedom to live where one
 wishes and move as one wishes.
 Foreign journalists have on occasion been allowed to visit
 South African prisons. In April 1977 a group of 25 reporters,
 including a number of foreign correspondents were invited to
 tour the Robben Island facility. Helen Suzman, the opposi-
 tion spokesman for human rights, was permitted to visit
 Robben Island in May 1980 and had discussions with many of
 the prisoners, including Nelson Mandela,the former leader of
 the banned Anrican National Congress (ANC). The Prisons
 Act, however, has tightly limited journalists' investiga-
 tions into prison conditions. Over the years, legal and
 human rights groups have frequently attended important
 trials.
 A number of South African organizations observe, report,
 and contest human rights violations in the country. Black
 political organizations have been particularly vocal in
 calling for a society based on internationally accepted
 principles of human rights, and have borne the brunt of
 the SAG displeasure. A number of other organizations have
 also been active. In June 1980, a "Lawyers for Human
 Rights" association was formed to monitor and suggest
 changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.
 The Black Sash organization, which was formed to protest
 the means by which Colored citizens were removed from the
 common voting roles in 1955, reports extensively on the
 abuses of the influx control system based on its exper-
 ience in assisting Africans who have fallen afoul of the
 pass laws. The South African Council of Churches has
 spoken out on a wide range of human rights issues, and is
 active in assisting persons incarcerated under security
 laws and other groups which are systematically deprived of
 their human rights. The South Africa Institute for Race
 Relations is also very active in this sphere, numbering
 among its activities the compilation of lists and statis-
 
 
 253
 tical material on security detainees and banned persons.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Economic growth is an important motivating force for change
 in South Africa. The SAG is committed to the vigorous
 encouragement of economic growth. It has indicated that
 a 5-percent growth rate is a necessary condition to fur-
 ther close the wage gap between black and white. This
 gap has been narrowing over the past few years. In its
 overall approach to economic policy the SAG has embraced
 the creation of development corridors and economic decen-
 tralization programs which would increase employment op-
 portunities for rural and homeland blacks. The business
 community has been supportive of the Government's commit-
 ment to growth, but has been critical of those apartheid
 laws which tend to inhibit full economic development.
 South Africa has a dual economy that includes a highly
 developed industrial sector. All of the white and most of
 the economically active black population participate in
 and benefit from the Western-type capitalist part of the
 economy, although generally in different capacities and at
 different rates of remuneration. Approximately half of
 South Africa's 19.8 million Africans live in "white"
 areas, either on white-owned farms or in specially designa-
 ted townships, and find their employment in the white
 industries. The other half reside in the homelands. A
 large percentage of the economically active homeland
 residents (some 1.7 million in the late 1970's) work in
 the modern economy as commuters and contract migrant
 laborers. -Their wages and remittances form the major
 share of homeland cash income. Economic activity within
 the homelands consists primarily of subsistence agricul-
 ture.with limited industrial opportunities and a small but
 growing public service sector.
 The World Bank's economic and social indicators show
 that South Africa is a land of plenty. According to
 its figures, GNP per capita in 1979 was $1,720 and
 the figure has risen since then; the percentage of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements in 1977 was 116. However, calculations
 derived by dividing total population into available resour-
 ces can be misleading in the South African context. Despite
 the gradual elimination of some barriers to full black
 participation in the developed sector of the economy, the
 distribution of resources among South Africa's racial groups
 remains unequal, although there is no definitive statistical
 breakdown of national income by race. The standard of
 living for whites is generally comparable to and frequently
 higher than that experienced in the OECD countries.
 The African community is divided between those who partici-
 pate in the modern sector and reap a disproportionately
 small fraction of its benefits and those who are tied to
 subsistence farming in the homelands. The average standard
 of living for Coloreds and Asians falls somewhere between
 that of whites and Africans.
 The 1980 South African census revealed that the average
 annual population growth rate between 1970 and 1980 for
 whites was 1.7 percent; for Coloreds 2.2 percent; for
 ts ans 2.4 oercent; and for Africans, 2.7 percent. The
 nRant mortdlity rate per 1,000 live births in 1978,
 
 
 254
 according to official statistics was 14.9 for whites, 80.6
 for Coloreds, and 25.3 for Asians. Because of incomplete
 records for Africans, the infant mortality rate is not
 known, although estimates range as high as 220 per 1,000
 live births. One researcher found that half of the Afri-
 can children born in one homeland area die before their
 .fifth birthday with a high percentage of the deaths
 attributable to malnutrition, gastroenteritis, and other
 diseases stemming from poor living conditions. A uni-
 versity professor found that in the period 1967-71, life
 expectancy for whites was 65 years; for Coloreds, 49
 years; for Asians, 59 years; and for Africans, 52 years.
 Due to compulsory education for whites, Coloreds, and
 Asians, these population groups are almost completely
 literate. By contrast, 49.4 percent of the African
 population surveyed in the 1978 census was literate;
 this figure is reportedly over 57 percent today. In
 early 1981, the SAG introduced a phased program of com-
 pulsory education for Africans. At the present time
 compulsory education for Africans affects only 40,000
 students of a total black school-going population of
 4.5 million. The Minister of Education and Training,
 whose department is responsible for African education
 outside the homelands, claimed that 80 percent of the
 potential African school-going population was enrolled
 in 1980. However, by 1980 less than 35 percent of
 school starters reached high school and only 5 percent
 graduated.
 The SAG, in its response to the Human Sciences Research
 Council report on education, has emphasized its continu-
 ing commitment to separatb education. However, within
 the context of the structure of separate education in
 South Africa the South African Government appears to be
 taking a first step toward greater equality in education.
 In 1981, free compulsory education through the seventh grade
 is being phased in for black Africans in selected areas.
 However, this program is not expected to be in place nation-
 wide until 1992. Black enrollment at "white" universities
 in subject areas not available in the segregated black
 schools has grown substantially. Spending on black education
 has increased from R13.2 million in 1952-53 to R27 million
 in 1972, to R369 million in 1981-82. The 1981-82 budget for
 black education is itself 51 percent higher than the compar-
 able budget for the preceding year. Still, the disparities
 remain enormous, with per capita expenditures for black
 students estimated at R113 against R1071 for whites.
 The housing shortage for Africans outside the homelands
 is serious, with the backlog generally estimated at.
 150,000 units for Coloreds and Asians and 350,000 for
 Africans. The housing shortage for Africans in the
 homelands is considered equally severe. A private survey
 calculated that white South Africans live at about 0.7
 people per room; Coloreds and Asians at about 2.11 and
 Africans at over 3. For the average township resident,
 this translates to 12 people in a 2-bedroom home.
 Whites hold the majority of managerial, supervisory, and
 highly-skilled labor. Blacks are generally engaged in
 unskilled and semi-skilled labor, although a growing number
 are classified as professional and white-collar. Of these,
 
 
 255
 ..:the majorityvare teachers aM nurses who, although state
 employees,-are paid.less than their white counterparts.
 The distribution of .personal incomeLhas shifted margin-
 ally from the whites to the- other raciaL groups so that
 by .1980i whites had an estimated 59.9 percent of personal
 income; Coloreds.and Asians 11.0. percent; and Africans
 29.1 percent. This represents a significant increase from
 the estimated -19 percent income earned by Africans in 1970.
 .For the employed sector of the.urban African population;,
 it appears that the standard of living rose over the last
 -decade and-could have risen in the l-ast five years since
 pay increases have more than compensated for inflation.
 However,: as additional employment opportunities have not
 kept pace with-population growth, dependency ratios for
 blacks have risen. While the paucity of reliable statis-
 tics make .it impossible to state. with certainty that black
 incomes have been dissipated by the need to support more
 dependents both in the city and in the hinterlands, it is
 unlikely thatan average urban black family has enjoyed a
 substantial improvement in its standard of living.
 ,Living standards of the poorer urban Africans and
 rural.Africans have almost certainly suffered further
 .erosion.
 Because .a large.percentage of economically active Afri-
 can.males seek employment in the modern sector, a dis-
 ,-proportinate-number of women, children, and elderly
 .persons: are left in the homelands,'where .they engage for
 .the most part in-.subsistence.farming. Many rural homeland
 households can-muster only R25  or.less in cash per month.
 The-homelands-can produce enough food to feed only about
 one-third of.their populations; homeland agricultural
 conditions continue to decline because of over-population
 .and antiquated farming-techniques.
 The extent of African unemployment in unknown. A Govern-
 .ment survey indicated that 430,000 people or 7.6 percent
 of-Africans economically active in 'white* South Africa
 :and the homelands-were unemployed as of April 1981.
 Rowever, private estimates range as high as two million
 if:underemployed agricultural workers are included. In
 .addition, approximately half of the African population is
 under.the age of- 18 which means. that over 200,000 Africans
 are projected to enter the job market annually. The
 SAG's -economic development program hopes for a real
 annual-growth rate of 5 percent in order to provide
 employment for the majority of new entrants. The rate in
 1980 was 8,percent but slowed down to 4-5 percent in
 1981 as South Africa entered an economic downswing. A
 growing shortage of.skilled manpower has contributed
 to this-economic downswing.
 .In 1981.the Government issued a white paper in which it
 stated that:.the development of skills among the Colored,
 -Asian.and African population groups must be promoted.
 ..Africans may now serve as apprentices in private companies
 .and in government-owned.-undertakings such as the railways.
 The SAG has begun to establish training centers and has
 offered pos-itive incentives to companies to institute
 their own-,training programs and to enroll employees in
 courses._In the meantime, skilled blacks are profiting
 from ,the shortage as firms compete for the services with
 
 
 256
 escalating wage and benefit offers. The majority of
 black workers, however, remain unskilled or only semi-
 skilled and will continue to form a glut in that sector of
 the labor market.
 Women in South Africa are discriminated against through
 legislation that circumscribes their civil, political, and
 economic rights and opportunities. While women form an
 increasing percentage of the white labor force (up from 29
 percent in 1965 to a approximately 37 percent in 1981),
 they are not protected from wage discrimination. A
 recent study claims that women earn half the wages of men
 with the same qualifications. Moreover, South African tax
 laws do not permit separate taxation of a working couple's
 income; the women's earnings are added to those of her
 husband's for tax purposes. White males have three times
 as many bachelor's degrees, five times as many master's
 degrees, and ten times as many doctorates as white women.
 In addition to such economic limitations, married women are
 regarded as virtual minors before the law unlesS they
 make special contractual arrangements with their husbands
 to retain certain financial and legal powers which normally
 fall to the husbands at marriage. White women were
 granted the vote in 1929, and make up an estimated 52
 percent of the registered voters. Two women are currently
 serving in the 177-member Parliament.
 Black women encounter far greater difficulties than their
 white counterparts. They are regarded as perpetual minors
 before the law which severely limits their ability to own
 property and to rent accommodation in urban areas. In
 urban areas, African women earn only one-half as much as
 African men; many women work in the low wage services
 sector (e.g., as domestic workers). A 1980 survey found
 that in the eastern Cape almost three quarters of the full
 time domestic servants interviewed earned less than R30
 ($31.50) per month. There is no legal protection govern-
 ing hours, wages, or conditions of service in the major
 employment areas for black women - domestic service and
 agriculture. A study cited "influx control" as the major
 constraint on black women and claimed it trapped them in
 homelands and deprived them of employment alternatives.
 Wives of African migrant workers, numbering several
 hundred thousand, are left alone up to eleven months a
 year to bring up their families through subsistence
 farming and remittances from their spouses.
