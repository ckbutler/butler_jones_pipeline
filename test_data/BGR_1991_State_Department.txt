 BULGARIA
 Two years after the overthrow in November 1989 of Communist
 dictator Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria is a constitutional republic
 ruled by a democratically elected government. Formed after
 free multiparty elections in October, the Government of Filip
 Dimitrov succeeded a transitional coalition regime led by
 former nonparty judge Dimitur Popov, which had replaced the
 all-Socialist (ex-Communist) government brought down by a
 general strike in November 1990. In these second post-
 Communist parliamentary elections, the Union of Democratic
 Forces (UDF) won 110 seats to 106 for the Bulgarian Socialist
 Party (BSP) and 24 for the Movement for Rights and Freedoms
 (MRF), which largely represents the Turkish minority. In the
 first direct presidential elections in January 1992, President
 Zhelyu Zhelev, former UDF Chairman, was elected to a 5-year
 term with about 53 percent of the vote.
 Reforms of the security apparatus continued in 1991. The
 Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, national security
 service, internal security troops, border guards, and special
 forces, sought to modernize its anticrime services and bring
 its practices into line with European human rights standards.
 The Ministry established a new service to combat organized
 crime and drug trafficking. Although both the intelligence
 service, under control of the President, and the Interior
 Ministry claimed that all monitoring of opposition and other
 political figures had ceased, an apparent listening device was
 discovered in the office floor of UDF Deputy Prime Minister
 Dimitur Ludzhev in September.
 The economy underwent enormous turmoil in 1991 as "shock
 therapy" reforms were implemented to move it from a command
 system toward a free market. Most prices were freed on
 February 1, leading to price rises of up to 10 times in many
 basic consumer items. Chronic fuel and energy shortages led to
 frequent blackouts through the winter and interrupted
 deliveries of many goods. Overall production fell dramatically
 in 1991. However, the economic transition also progressed.
 Privatization of state enterprises was begun, a new land law
 provided for the return of agricultural land to its prewar
 owners beginning in the autumn of 1991, and foreign investment
 was encouraged by new laws allowing full foreign ownership of
 firms and full repatriation of profits. Many small businesses
 began to appear, especially in the service sector.
 Bulgaria's overall human rights performance continued to
 improve in 1991. Freedom of press, assembly, religion, speech,
 association, and travel were generally respected. Particularly
 in rural areas, however, many people continued to fear that the
 former state security persisted in monitoring citizens'
 activities, although there was little precise evidence. The
 Grand National Assembly, elected in 1990, adopted a new
 Constitution in July 1991. Treatment of ethnic minorities
 improved, although discrimination and inequities remain. The
 issue of Turkish-language instruction in the schools sparked
 nationalist protest and counterprotest by ethnic Turks (see
 Section 5). Also controversial was an attempt to use legal
 bans on ethnic- and religious-based political parties to
 prevent the MRF, with a predominantly ethnic Turkish
 membership, from running a list of candidates. The
 Constitution prohibits registration as a political party of any
 organization formed on "ethnic, racial, or religious lines."

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings in 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of disappearance in 1991.
 .c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishmont
 There were no reports of such practices.
 The new Constitution expressly prohibits torture; cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment; forcible assimilation; and
 subjection to medical, scientific, or other experimentation
 without consent. There were unconfirmed charges, generally
 from patients, that psychiatric treatment is still used as a
 form of punishment. These charges appear to stem from residual
 fear of former practices, and there was no concrete evidence
 that such practices continued in 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution guarantees access to legal counsel from the
 time of.detention. Judicial authorities must rule on the
 legality of a detention within 24 hours. There were no reports
 of arbitrary detentions. Neither internal nor external exile
 has been employed as a form of punishment since 1990. A new
 penal code has not yet been compIeted by Parliament.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution ratified in July, the judiciary has
 independent and coequal status with the legislature and the
 executive. The Constitution stipulates that "all courts shall
 conduct their hearings in public, unless provided otherwise by
 a law." Closed trials may be held in cases involving state
 security or to preserve state secrets. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty, may not be compelled
 to confess, and may not be judged guilty solely on the basis of
 a confession.
 Due process was generally observed during 1991, although some
 human rights groups expressed concern about the unfair
 treatment of former dictator Todor Zhivkov during his trial on
 charges of fraud and misappropriation. Zhivkov was placed
 under house arrest in 1990 and was not allowed access to the
 foreign press until shortly before the commencement of the
 trial. The trial itself initially attracted significant media
 attention, provoking concerns about anti-Zhivkov bias in the
 proceedings. Temporarily adjourned in May due to the poor
 health of the defendant, the trial was resumed in late October.
 The Constitution established the Constitutional Court, based on
 Western European models, to decide matters of constitutional
 import. Military courts handle all cases involving military
 personnel and some cases involving national security matters.
 The Constitutional Court does not have specific jurisdiction in
 matters of military justice. While there has been no major
 
 
 1066
 BULGARIA
 structural reform in the military courts, there have been major
 personnel changes effected by the President as Commander in
 Chief.
 Bulgaria's remaining political prisoners were released in
 January. There remain five prisoners whose cases are
 questioned by some human rights groups but who are not
 generally considered political prisoners. These include three
 ethnic Turks sentenced for terrorist acts and a former
 government minister imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement.
 There is no internal or foreign exile.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution stipulates the inviolability of the home,
 protects the freedom and confidentiality of correspondence, and
 provides the right to choose one's place of work and
 residence. Police may not legally conauct a search without the
 permission of a judge or prosecutor. There were no reported
 violations of this requirement.
 Charges persisted in 1991 that the intelligence services
 continued in some instances to monitor correspondence and
 telephone communications, as was common before the fall of the
 Zhivkov regime. Such allegations were strengthened in
 September when a listening device was reportedly discovered in
 the office of Deputy Prime Minister Dimitur Ludzhev, a member
 of the opposition UDF. According to experts, the device was
 not operational at the time but was fully capable of
 operation. It has not been determined when the device was
 planted. Opposition leaders alleged, without specific
 evidence, that conversations were also being monitored in the
 headquarters of the UDF and the Podkrepa trade union.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and a free and independent press flourished
 in 1991. Nearly every political party and many smaller, local
 organizations published newspapers representing the full
 spectrum of political opinion. The MRF and the Chief Mufti's
 office both regularly published papers with editions in both
 Turkish and Bulgarian, and one national weekly is published
 half in Bulgarian and half in Turkish. Censorship of the press
 and mass media is prohibited by the Constitution. Newsprint,
 which was previously available only from the Government or with
 hard currency, was sold for local currency to any organization
 with sufficient funds. However, it proved prohibitively
 expensive for many smaller opposition organizations, which thus
 had difficulty publishing their own papers.
 Bulgarian radio and television remained state monopolies under
 the supervision of the National Assembly but were generally
 operated independently. The news directors of both radio and
 television came under fire from the BSP for allegedly being
 biased in favor of the opposing parties. Both radio and
 television expanded news and public interest programming during
 1991 and introduced a much greater variety of programming. The
 Assembly has not yet passsed legislation concerning the media.
 Two private radio stations that attempted to broadcast early in
 1991 were shut down on the grounds that no legal provisions yet
 existed for their licensing.
 
 
 1067
 BULGARIA
 Private book publishers proliferated during 1991, numbering
 aver 50 by late in the year. Academic freedom continued to
 increase as university rectors and other academic leaders were
 replaced by persons less closely associated with previous
 Communist policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful and unarmed assembly is provided for by
 the Constitution. No permit or notification is required for
 meetings held indoors. Permits are required for rallies and
 assemblies held outdoors. Except in rare instances when public
 order was thought to be threatened, legally registered
 organizations were routinely granted permission to assemble.
 Political rallies and protest demonstrations were a common
 occurrence in 1991.
 The Constitution protects the right to ftee association in
 general terms but forbids the formation of political parties
 defined along religious, ethnic, or racial lines. An
 additional clause in the electoral law prohibits any
 organization.that is not legally registered as a political
 party from running an independent list of candidates in
 parliamentary or local elections. These restrictions were
 challenged when Ahmed Dogan, the leader of the MRF, which is
 largely composed of ethnic Turks and which won 23 parliamentary
 seats in the 1990 elections, attempted to register the party
 for the October elections. The courts rejected the
 registration, but the Central Electoral Commission ruled that
 the registration of the MRF for the parliamentary elections in
 1990 was a permanent registration, thus permitting it to
 participate. The constitutional ban on ethnic- and
 religious-based political parties seems to conflict with
 Bulgaria's commitments-within the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe.
 The "Roma" union, an organization dedicated to protecting the
 rights of Gypsies, was denied registration as a political
 party, and the Supreme Court upheld the decision in July. The
 courts determined that, because it sought to protect the rights
 of a specific ethnic group even though its membership was open,
 the organization qualified as an ethnic-based party and could
 not be registered. It became an observer in the UDF in
 September but was not offered any places on the UDF candidate
 lists for the elections. Participating in a coalition with a
 smaller party, it failed to get any representatives elected to
 Parliament.
 The Constitution also prohibits "citizens' associations,"
 including trade unions, from pursuing political objectives or
 engaging in political'activities. This restriction has not yet
 been tested to determine the extent of limitations it will
 place upon organizations' activities.
 c. .Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom continued to expand throughout 1991. The
 Constitution states that Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the
 "traditional" religion of Bulgaria, but all of the major
 religious bodies receive some degree of governmental financial
 support. The Government is committed to restore a number of
 churches and mosques, and the Ministry of Finance allocated a
 sizable sum to the restoration of Sofia's synagogue, which is
 reportedly the largest in Europe.
 
 
 1068
 BULGARIA
 The former committee on religious affairs in the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs was replaced by the Directorate for Religious
 Affairs within the Council of Ministers. The Directorate's
 mandate included reforming the Government's policies toward
 religious institutions and its relations with them. Many
 churches applied for and were granted registration, including
 the Hare Krishna Society, the Church of Jesus Christ of
 Latter-day Saints, and a number of other Protestant groups.
 The return of church property confiscated by the State under
 the Zhivkov regime began in January with the return of Rila
 Monastery, one of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church's most revered
 monuments. Former church property will also be affected by the
 new land law, which limits the amount of agricultural land that
 churches may own. One contentious issue was the Directorate's
 refusal summarily to remove church leaders appointed by the
 Communist regime, including members of the Orthodox Church's
 Holy Synod, the Chief Mufti, and the pastor of at least one
 Protestant church. These persons were considered compromised,
 and many reformers sought their removal. The Directorate
 refused to intervene, however, insisting that such matters were
 internal church affairs and should no longer be decided by the
 Government.
 Although the question of allowing voluntary religious
 instruction in the schools has not yet been decided, there are
 no restrictions on private instruction. There is now a school
 for imams and a Muslim cultural center, two universities have
 theological faculties, and religious primary schools opened in
 September. There 'are no restrictions on attendance at
 religious services.
 Bibles and other religious materials in the Bulgarian language
 were both freely imported and printed in Bulgaria. Mosques
 still suffer from a severe shortage of Korans and other printed
 religious materials in Bulgarian, although the difficulty
 appears to stem from administrative and financial shortcomings
 rather than governmental interference. The Chief Mufti
 published a newspaper in both Bulgarian and Turkish, and the
 Faith and Culture publishing house began publication of a
 Catholic newspaper. A newspaper directed at Bulgaria's small
 Jewish community was regularly released in both Bulgarian and
 Hebrew. Missionaries of various faiths appear to operate
 unhindered throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right to leave
 the country are constitutionally enshrined and not limited in
 practice, except in rare cases determined to affect national
 security. The only such reported instance in 1991 was the
 withholding of the international passports of several members
 of the Macedonian rights group Ilinden. In 1990 the
 organization was judged to be separatist, and therefore
 illegal, and several of its members had their passports
 confiscated while attempting to cross the border into Yugoslav
 Macedonia. At least three of them were reportedly unable to
 obtain new passports in 1991.
 The requirement for exit visas was abolished in January.
 Thousands of Bulgarians left throughout the year in search of
 economic opportunities in the West. Every citizen has the
 right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expatriated,
 and may not be deprived of citizenship acquired by birth. An
 
 
 1069.
 BULGARIA
 increasing.number of former political emigrants were granted
 passports and returned to visit or live in Bulgaria.
 Bulgaria receives few applicati6ns for asylum, more often
 serving as a temporary refuge for third country nationals
 seeking to enter Western Europe. New procedures were
 established for.handling asylum applications, limiting the
 length of time in which the Government must respond to all
 requests. Bulgarian law provides for the granting of asylum to
 persons persecuted for their opinions or-activities in defense
 of internationally recognized rights.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bulgarian citizens have the right to change their government
 through the election of members of the National Assembly and
 the President. That right was exercised on October 13 when,
 after several postponements, multiparty elections were held for
 the Assembly and for local government bodies. Over 40
 individual parties and coalitions and a number of independent
 candidatesparticipated. Only three parties gained more than
 the minimum 4 percent of the national vote required.to win
 parliamentary seats. The UDF won a plurality with 110 seats,
 while the BSP won 106 and the MRF.24.. The election was
 generally observed to have been free and fair, despite some
 administrative problems, including those affecting the
 electoral rolls in ethnic Turkish areas. The first direct
 election of.a president, which is for a 5-year term, must be
 held within 3 months of the National Assembly elections.
 Parliamentary elections are to be held by secret ballot every 4
 years, and 240 deputies are elected by a proportional system
 from party lists.. Suffrage is universal over the age of 18. A
 distinct separation of powers exists between the Government
 (Prime Minister and Cabinet) and the President, who is the
 Chief of State. A continuous 5-year residency requirement
 prevented former Tsar Simeon from returning from exile to run
 as a presidential candidate.
 While opposition-groups operated freely, they remained
 disadvantaged.by a lack of resources, while the Socialists
 (former Communists) retained the majority of their property
 from 45 years of single-party rule. However, in mid-December
 the BSP minority in Parliament was unable to prevent-the-
 passage of a bill confiscating all property-obtained from the
 state by Communist organizations between 1945 and 1989.
 Opposition leaders also complained of persistent fear of old
 party structures in rural areas which may have given the BSP a
 campaign advantage in those regions. (For the challenge to the
 electoral participation of the MRF, see Section 2.b.)
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women in
 government or politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Both local and international human rights groups were active in
 Bulgaria in 1991. The Independent Society for the Defense of
 Human Rights and the Bulgarian Association for Free Elections
 and Human Rights issued reports, hosted international
 observers, and held a number of seminars. Both organizations
 have worked to become truly independent monitors of human
 
 
 1070
 BULGARIA
 rights developments in Bulgaria. Members of international
 human rights organizations consulted with Bulgarian
 parliamentarians on drafting the new Constitution and were
 active in monitoring the Zhivkov trial and the rights of ethnic
 minorities. Bulgaria hosted a visit by the chairman of the
 U.N. Human Rights Commission and was an active participant in
 both U.N. and European human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While the Constitution guarantees individual rights and
 equality, representatives of Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish and
 Gypsy minorities did not believe it went far enough in
 protecting their rights. In particular, they sought specific
 recognition of ethnic and national minorities and their group
 rights. Parliamentarians from the MR' and Manush Romanov, a
 UDF deputy representing the Gypsy union "Roma," joined the
 opposition walk-out of Parliament in late spring due to what
 they saw as insufficient guarantees of minority rights.
 The Government made progress in redressing the grievances of
 ethnic minorities, particularly those acts of discrimination
 perpetrated during the forced assimilation campaign of
 1984-89. All official restraints have been removed from the
 practice of Muslim religious traditions, the speaking of
 Turkish in public, and the use of non-Slavic names.
 The Government took initial steps to redress longstanding
 complaints of ethnic Turkish families who were forced to sell
 their homes when they fled to Turkey in 1989 and later returned
 to find they were unable to recover their property. Over a
 thousand families are reportedly still without housing. A
 group of women representing the affected families staged a
 relay hunger strike in a central Sofia square for several
 months until the Council of Ministers issued a decree in August
 requiring all government bodies still in possession of such
 property to return it to its original owners. The decree also
 provided opportunities for families to purchase housing at the
 former prices and obtain credits at reduced interest rates to
 build or purchase new apartments. The decree, which is not yet
 in effect, is considered by many ethnic Turkish activists to
 provide insufficient relief.
 Some nongovernmental discrimination persisted. The
 Constitution guarantees the right of all citizens to study
 their mother tongue in addition to the obligation to study
 Bulgarian. In March a Government plan to introduce 2 hours per
 week of voluntary, extracurricular Turkish-language classes in
 public schools sparked strikes and protests throughout those
 regions with a mixed Turkish and Bulgarian population.
 Nationalist groups stridently objected to any teaching of
 Turkish, while ethnic Turks led strikes against the schools,
 protesting the "experimental" and limited nature of the
 classes. On November 8, the Ministry of Education, acceding to
 the demands of the ethnic Turks, reinstituted voluntary
 Turkish-language classes, -and most ethnic Turkish boycotts
 ended. Some Bulgarians accused the MRF of attempting to
 "turkify" parts of the Bulgarian.population, that is the Pomaks
 (ethnic Bulgarian Muslims), by forcing them to learn Turkish
 although Bulgarian is in fact their mother tongue.
 Discrimination against minorities became an important issue as
 Bulgaria began to suffer massive unemployment for the first
 time. Ethnic Turks, Gypsies, and Pomaks claimed they were
 
 
 1071
 BULGARIA
 usually among the first to be laid off in any factory
 closures. They suffer widely from exclusion from positions of
 responsibility. Supervisory jobs are-generally given only to
 ethnic Bulgarian employees. Muslims and Gypsies were
 reportedly offered only the most inferior housing in many
 cities. During their periods of compulsory military service,
 male Muslims and Gypsies are generally given the worst
 assignments. Construction troops, which undertake a variety of
 civilian as well as military building and maintenance projects,
 are largely composed of minority- conscripts of ethnic Turkish
 or Gypsy descent. However, ethnic Bulgarians claimed to face
 similar discriminatory treatment regarding dismissal from
 employment in areas where they formed the minority ethnic
 group.
 The large community of Vietnamese guest workers also came under
 increasing pressure as unemployment rose. A riot sparked by an
 argument between a Vietnamese man and a taxi driver brought a
 massive response from the police and resulted in the deaths of
 two Vietnamese men from police fire as well as several
 injuries. There were also several minor conflicts between
 Gypsy and Vietnamese communities involved in black market
 activities. After the first incident, the Government undertook
 to return to Vietnam the majority of some 13,000 Vietnamese
 workers before the expiration of their contracts.
 Several organizations purport to defend women's rights and
 interests, including a number of small political parties .
 supporting both the UDF and the BSP. The Constitution forbids
 the granting of privileges or the restriction of rights on the
 basis of sex. Women are not generally discriminated against in
 education or employment. No statistics are available on
 violence directed against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 According to the Constitution, all workers may form or join
 trade unions of their own choosing. Many members of the civil
 service have organized themselves into trade unions. Bulgaria
 has two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of
 Independent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (KNSB), and Podkrepa. The
 KNSB is the successor to the trade union integrated with the
 former Communist Party and is ostensibly independent of the
 BSP. Podkrepa, the independent confederation created in 1989
 and one of the first opposition forces,- has continued to
 strengthen and broaden its base. There are few restrictions on
 trade union activities, and both confederations operated freely
 in 1991. While the new Constitution prohibits trade unions
 from undertaking political activity, Podkrepa, through its
 chairman Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, continued to play an active
 role in the UDF. Both confederations supported candidates in
 the parliamentary elections and were active critics of various
 government policies.
 The law recognizes the right to strike, as does the
 Constitution, when other means of conflict resolution have been
 exhausted, but political strikes are forbidden. There were
 numerous strikes throughout the year, including symbolic
 strikes, rotating or "relay" strikes, and sit-ins. Some of
 these were called to protest the new Constitution and delays in
 the elections, but those accused of engaging in a politically
 motivated strike were not prosecuted. The largest and most
 disruptive action was a 2-week nationwide miners' strike called
 
 
 1072
 BULGARIA
 by Podkrepa in August. The dispute was eventually settled when
 the Government agreed to concessions on wages and job security.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation or contact with
 international labor organizations, and Bulgarian unions now
 actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 During the first half of 1991, wages were set by the Trilateral
 Commission involving the Government, employers, and trade
 unions. Collective bargaining was to have been instituted in
 July, but as privatization and demonopolization of state
 enterprises had not progressed significantly, negotiating
 partners were not always clearly identifiable, and the
 Commission is still involved in negotiating wage agreements at
 the national level,
 Bulgaria's Labor Code, which at present does not address
 antiunion discrimination, is expected to be amended in 1992.
 Some newly established export processing zones exist on a small
 scale. There do not appear to be any special restrictions on
 worker rights in these zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 there were no reported violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Constitution, school attendance is compulsory
 up to the age of 16. The Labor Code also sets the minimum age
 for employment at 16, and at 18 for dangerous work. Employers
 and the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare enforce these
 provisions. There is an increasing incidence of children
 engaged in street trading in central Sofia where a number of
 informal bazaars have become fixtures.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 A national minimum wage was set by the Trilateral Commission
 and periodically adjusted as inflation and devaluation of the
 currency dramatically increased the cost of living. The
 minimum wage is not sufficient for a single wage earner to
 provide a decent standard of living for a family. The
 Constitution stipulates the right to social security, welfare
 aid, and assistance for the temporarily unemployed.
 The legal code provides for a standard workweek of 42 1/2
 hours. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Ministry of
 Employment and Social Welfare. The Trilateral Commission also
 actively oversaw enforcement of most provisions relating to
 working conditions.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program with standards
 established by the Labor Code, and the Constitution states that
 workers and employees are entitled to healthy and nonhazardous
 working conditions. The generally poor state of much
 industrial equipment, which is often outdated and lacking spare
 parts, complicated enforcement of safety regulations.
