 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal
 parliamentary form of government. Representatives in the
 multiparty political system are elected by universal suffrage
 at local, provincial, and federal levels. Government
 responsibilities are defined by a national Constitution
 subject to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Federal and provincial election mandates last a maximum of 5
 years. Elections are completely free and often result in a
 changeover of power to opposition parties.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 National and local law enforcement are carried out by Federal,
 Provincial, and municipal police forces. Canada's armed forces
 are under the authority of the elected civilian government and
 have no role in domestic law enforcement except in extreme
 circumstances under the War Measures Act (last invoked in 1970
 during the terrorist kidnapings in Quebec).
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised
 Constitution in 1982, provides for fundamental rights and
 freedoms to everyone. Government and private organizations
 work actively to try to ensure that these rights are respected
 in practice at all levels of society. Canada is a leader in
 promoting respect for human rights around the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.''Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings in 1987.
 However, four Canadian Sikhs were convicted for the 1986
 attempted murder of an Indian official'in British Columbia.
 Canadian authorities and the general public are concerned
 about the potential for increased levels of terrorist activity
 in Canada. These concerns focus largely on Sikh and other
 resident ethnic groups with active ties to troubled homelands.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically
 motivated disappearances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 -Treatment or Punishment
 These abuses are prohibited by law, and none was reported.
 Prison conditions are generally good. A proposal to restore
 the death penalty was considered by Parliament in 1987 and
 decisively defeated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected in practice. However, some
 civil rights and refugee assistance groups have criticized the
 prolonged detention of a group of 174 undocumented Sikhs who
 landed in Nova Scotia in July 1987 and claimed refugee status.

 CANADA
 Parliament is currently considering bills which would
 strengthen the authority of the Government to detain refugee
 claimants and swiftly deport those found inadmissible.
 opposition political parties and civil rights groups have
 vigorously criticized portions of the bills, particularly those
 prescribing stiff penalties for persons and organizations
 --including churches and other humanitarian groups7--which
 assist refugees to reach Canada without proper documentation.
 The Federal Government may enforce the War Measures Act and
 the Official Secrets Act in exceptional circumstances to
 override certain constitutional guarantees. In the event of
 war or peacetime crisis, the War Measures Act of 1914,
 augmented by a 1981 Federal Cabitiet order, permits the Federal
 Parliament to declare a state of national emergency with
 suspension of certain basic civil liberties. In June 1987, a
 bill was proposed to introduce an Emergencies Act which would
 replace the War Measures Act. The proposed bill attempts to
 define the kinds of emergencies under which the Government
 would have extraordinary powers. The 1939 Official Secrets
 Act prohibits the private possession, distribution, and
 publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests
 of the State and provides that persons under suspicion may be
 arrested without a warrant.
 Canada prohibits the use of any form of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In criminal trials Canadian law provides for a presumption of
 innocence of the defendant until proven guilty, as well as the
 right to a public trial and to counsel. Free counsel is
 provided to indigents. The Official Secrets Act allows for
 trials under its provisions to be held in secret with certain
 presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecutions under this
 statute are extremely rare, and convictions hard to sustain on
 appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Federal and Provincial Governments do not interfere with a
 persopn's basic rights except when there is a reasonable basis
 for presuming that the persons is involved in criminal
 activity. Police officials face judicial penalties if they
 abuse a person's privacy without first obtaining a search
 warrant. In 1987, however, civil rights groups and opposition
 parties complained that the Canadian Security and Intelligence
 Service (CSIS) maintained files on and performed unwarranted
 investigations into the activities of an unacceptably large
 number of Canadians, many of whom--it was claimed by CSIS
 critics--werImbers of peace groups and other organizations
 posing no reilthreat to the national security. In a separate
 development, the director of the CSIS resigned following
 allegations that CSIS agents used false and misleading
 informatiod to obtain authorization to perform a wiretap on
 suspected Sikh terrorists.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Laws prohibiting certain forms of
 hate literature and pornography, restrictive decisions by
 
 
 873
 CANADA
 Provincial film censorship boards, and legislation which
 specifically protects language and cultural rights are the
 sole exceptions to these freedoms. The Ontario Provincial
 Government initiated proceedings in 1987 to try for the second
 time a pro-Nazi publisher who was convicted in 1985 for
 publishing a statement alleged to be false and likely to cause
 social and racial unrest in Canada. The publisher was
 sentenced to 15 months in prison in the 1985 trial, but the
 original conviction was overturned on technical grounds. The
 publisher is free on bail pending the anticipated commencement
 of the retrial in January 1988.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed.
 Wcrkers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to organize, associate freely, bargain collectively, and
 strike. All labor unions have full access to mediation,
 arbitration, and the judicial system.
 In practice, certain groups of essential public sector
 employees have limited collective bargaining rights and are
 not allowed to strike. In 1985 and 1986 the International
 Labor Organization censured four provinces for restricting the
 bargaining rights of public sector workers. The offending
 legislation was removed in the province of Ontario in 1986,
 but no action has yet been taken to change legislation in
 Alberta, British Columbia, and Newfoundland.
 The Solicitor General admitted that the CSIS has used paid
 informers and CSIS agents within some labor unions. One paid
 informer was charged separately with conspiracy to bomb four
 Quebec hotels involved in a labor dispute--an action that led
 some union leaders to suggest the individual was acting as an
 agent provocateur for the CSIS. Although the CSIS acknowledged
 that the individual was a paid informer, it denied he was an
 agent acting on the CSIS' behalf in the bombing conspiracy.
 The Security Intelligence Review Committee, an intelligence
 service oversight organization, commenced an investigation
 into the affair.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside
 Canada, including the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 Canada continues to be a haven for many refugees and displaced
 persons. There is, nevertheless, widespread concern that many
 have taken advantage of Canada's generous refugee law and made
 spurious requests for asylum. The public's increasing
 irritation is reflected in the Government's efforts in 1987 to
 introduce more stringent refugee legislation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by Federal and Provincial Governments that
 are freely elected by the Canadian people through universal
 suffrage. Legislative elections must be held at least every
 5 years, and voter participation rates are high. The Governor
 
 
 874-
 CANADA
 General is Queen Elizabeth II's representative as Head of
 State. Power is exercised in practice by the Prime Minister
 and the Cabinet, who.usually are elected members of the
 282-seat House of Commons. Three politically diverse parties
 are represented in the Commons, and several others function at
 the Provincial level. All Provinces and Territories have
 similar freely elected legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada actively promotes human rights in inteinational forums,
 and the Federal Government encourages nongovernmental
 organi'zations to pursue investigations of human rights abuses
 throughout the world. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
 ard its Provincial counterparts investigate and resolve
 complaints of discrimination in public and private sector
 activities under governmental jurisdiction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 b:ckground, or political opinion.
 Article 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees
 equal benefits and protection of the law regardless of race,
 national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, or
 mental or physical disability. These rights are respected in
 practice. However, a variety of women's groups and minority
 rights groups have expressed concern that the adoption by
 Canada of a constitutional accord bringing Quebec into the
 Constitution and granting it special status as a "distinct
 society" could endanger the rights of women and of linguistic
 and cultural minorities throughout Canada. The accord, signed
 by the Prime Minister and the Provincial Premiers and approved
 by Commons in 1987 but not yet approved by all the Provincial
 legislatures, is seen by some groups as threatening the promise
 of equal rights for women and minorities set forth by the
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Women participate freely in Canadian society. Women's rights
 are overseen by a Federal Cabinet minister responsible for the
 status of women and by the Federal and Provincial human rights
 commissions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all
 guarantee a sufficient minimum wage and limit the standard
 workweek to 40 or 48 hours. Federal and Provincial legislation
 protects employees from hazardous working conditions. Child
 labor legislation also differs among the provinces. The
 Federal Gbvernment generally prohibits those under 17 years of
 age from working for the Federal Government while school is in
 session. Provinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or
 16 from working without parental consent, working in any
 hazardous employment, or working at night.
