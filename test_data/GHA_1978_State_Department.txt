 GHANA
 Ghana is ruled by the Supreme Military Council (SMC),
 a military government with seven members including
 the Head of State and Chairman of the Supreme Military
 Council. The present Head of State and Chairman,
 Lieutenant General Frederick W. K. Akuffo, assumed his
 duties on July 5, 1978, following a bloodless coup
 which ousted former Head of State General Acheampong.
 By all accounts this coup was engineered from within
 the armed forces, although agitation and unrest by
 elements outside the military undoubtedly contributed
 to the atmosphere which led Acheampong's colleagues to
 remove him from power.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although there have been reports of torture in the
 past, the present Government of Ghana refrains from the
 use of torture. Conversations with interested persons
 such as lawyers, professors and others revealed no
 torture cases in recent years.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Punishment remains within the bounds of accepted law.
 The Department of State has had no reports of activity
 outside this norm. While the death penalty is still a
 part of the judicial code, it is very rarely used.
 Conditions in prisons are generally good. There are no
 recorded incidents of brutality or mistreatment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Persons have been detained from time to time under
 the provisions of a preventive detention law adopted in
 
 
 the early days of Ghana's independence. However,
 on September 12, 1978 the reconstituted (i.e., post-
 coup) SMC released 209 detainees and the United States
 Embassy has been informed that with the exception of
 General Acheampong there are no longer any political
 detainees in Ghana.
 On August 29, 1978 a writ of habeas corpus was entered
 on behalf of General Acheampong, argu--ngthat he had
 not been formally charged with violations of law and
 should be released. The High Court refused to approve
 the application, but ordered the Attorney General to
 show cause why the General was being held. General
 Acheampong's lawyer then filed an appeal with the
 Appeals Court asking it to set aside the High Court
 ruling. At the time this reports was drafted, no date
 had been set for the new hearing. No legal restraints
 were introduced in 1978.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 When the 1969 Constitution was suspended in 1972,
 formal guarantees of due process ceased to exist.
 Since that time, as reliably reported by the Ghana Bar
 Association, due process has been provided through
 established judicial procedures and the case law.
 Persons arrested can generally expect a speedy trial.
 The new draft Constitution contains formal guarantees
 of due process which, if adopted, will strengthen the
 well established informal system.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 On November 6, 1978 the Supreme Military Council
 declared a state of emergency throughout the country.
 The SMC stated this action was taken on a temporary
 basis to counter the deteriorating labor situation
 and to maintain economic reform threatened by
 execssive wage demands. It authorized the SMC to
 suspend habeas corpus, to detain persons without
 trial or restrict their movement and to enter and
 search premises without a warrant. The state of
 emergency was lifted December 31, 1978. During the
 weeks it was in effect, there were reports that
 
 
 68
 authorities searched private homes and businesses
 in an effort to stop hoarding and overpricing, but
 there were no formal complaints of excessive
 abuses under the decree.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The SMC as reconstituted after the 1978 coup seeks to
 meet these needs by reviving Ghana's economy, and has
 accorded budgetary priority to agriculture, particularly
 cocoa and other export products. Problems include
 shortages of essential imports for consumers and
 producers, runaway inflation and low domestic production.
 The economic situation has forced a relative reduction
 of development spending. It is estimated that such
 expenditures made up nineteen percent of total budget
 expenditures in fiscal year 1977-78, down from thirty
 percent in 1975-76.
 Though the tax system is theoretically designed to be
 progressive, in practice it often works to the disadvan-
 tage of the small wage earner and salaried employee.
 Influential Ghanians in Government and in the private
 sector frequently manage to avoid paying their full,
 tax and tax evasion is believed to be common. However,
 the reconstituted SMC has taken steps to tighten tax
 laws, to cancel special privilege licenses (which
 authorized non-payment of taxes) and generally to
 increase revenues. Corruption remains endemic in Ghana
 and has diverted funds from national development
 efforts, but the SMC has acted against it, prosecuting
 several prominent citizens.
 There is a long-standing housing shortage, especially
 for low-income families in urban areas. Government
 policy holds that every citizen should have adequate
 medical care. Health delivery services in urban areas
 are generally fair to good; in rural communities health
 
 
 69
 services vary. Education is generally good, but although
 it is theoretically compulsory from ages six through
 fifteen, dropouts are common. The Government has
 organized labor counselling programs designed to
 encourage youth to enter skilled labor trades.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The Ghanaians are free to express themselves openly and
 without fear of reprisal. Under the reconstituted SMC,
 the Ghanaian elite and students are openly debating
 national issues, particularly the form of government
 that Ghana should now adopt. Three public discussion
 symposia have been held in Accra since the SMC announced
 that Ghana would have a national (interim) government
 for four years. At these discussions there was
 considerable criticism of governmental policies. The
 SMC announced in August 1978 that the press was free to
 print whatever it wanted but that it should exercise
 self-restraint in matters of national security. Since
 that time the press, both Government-controlled and
 private, has published more independent views. A
 private news magazine, formerly banned, has reappeared
 and regularly carries strong criticism of the Government.
 There is freedom of religion in Ghana. The SMC prohibited
 political parties, but on November 30 the Head of State
 announced that the ban would be lifted effective
 January 1, 1979. The basis for the establishment of
 political parties was published, and they are to
 participate in elections for a civilian Government
 which is to take over in mid-1979. Widespread political
 discussions were tolerated in spite of the temporary
 ban on parties.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the
 country, although there are frequent roadblocks at
 
 
 which identification papers may be inspected as part of
 an anti-smuggling campaign and seizure of contraband
 goods occurs. Many Ghanaians travel abroad frequently.
 They generally experience no difficulty in obtaining
 passports, but sometimes have difficulty in obtaining
 hard currency for foreign travel.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The reconstituted SMC has promised to turn over control
 of the Government to a transition (interim) national
 government on July 1, 1979. A constitutional drafting
 commission submitted a draft Constitution to the SMC
 November 17, 1978. A constituent assembly is considering
 the draft constitution but the precise form which the
 civilian government will take remains uncertain.
 Trade unions in Ghana enjoy limited freedom. Labor
 sometimes calls for Government change and has recently
 started pressing actively for political and social
 change. The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the central
 labor organization, recently decided to assist those
 political parties which support their objectives.
 Recently the TUC initiated studies through its political
 education section on social needs of the nation.
 There appears to be general harmony among the several
 tribes in the country. The Government tends to be
 balanced along tribal lines, and there is no serious
 discrimination based on tribal or ethnic differences.
 The National Council on Women and Development, the most
 important government-sponsored organization concerned
 primarily with women's affairs, operates under the
 Commissioner for Foreign Affairs. The Commissioner has
 stated that the Government intends to work more forcefully
 to improve the status of women and has urged women to
 involve themselves in political life.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 
 
 71
 To the knowledge of the Department of State there were
 no requests in 1978 for international or non-governmental
 investigations of the human rights situation in Ghana.
 The previous Supreme Military Council Government twice
 refused requests by Amnesty International to send a
 legal observer to trials in Accra. The current Government's
 reaction to a request for a non-governmental investiga-
 tion into the human rights situation would depend on the
 nature of the accusation, the reputation of the inquiring
 organization, and whether or not the Government perceived
 that a challenge to Ghanaian national sovereignty was
 involved.
