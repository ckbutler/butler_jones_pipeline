 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of government. The Queen is Head of
 State and is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Owen
 Arthur is the Head of Government and governs with an appointed Cabinet.
 The lRoyal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order. The
 small volunteer Barbados Defence Force (BDF), responsible for national security,
 can be employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other spe-
 cific need. The BDF continues to assist the police by patrolling certain tourist areas
 in response to an increase of crime. On the whole, the police respected constitutional
 and legal prvisions protecting human rights, but there continued to be infrequent
 reports of incidents ofuse of excessive force by police.
 The economy is based on tourism, servies, ight manufacturin&  and agriculture,
 which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) exceeds $5,000 per year. In order to stimulate demand and
 reverse a 3-year decline in GDP and employment, the Government decided in May
 1993 to abandon attempts to meet economic targets set in consultation with the
 International Monetary Fund. Barbados experienced a very moderate recovery in
 1995.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms, and the Government respects
 constitutional provisions regarding human rights. Principal human rights problems
 continued to be societal violence against women and children and occasional in-
 stances of excessive use of force by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kdling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the Jaribbean Human Rights Network and the
 local press reported numerous allegations of coerced confessions. There continued to
 be credible reports that law enforcement officials sometimes used force during de-
 tention to extract confessions from detainees.
 Police procedures piovide that the police may question suspects and other persons
 they hold only at a police station, except when expressly permitted by a senior divi-
 sional officer. An officer must visit detainees at least once every 3 hours to inquire
 about the detainees' condition. After 24 hours, the detaining authority must submit
 
 
 325
 a written report to the deputy commissioner. The authorities must approve and
 record all movements of detainees between stations. The Caribbean Human Rights
 Network is satisfied that the authorities generally adhere to these basic principles,
 although officials occasionally used excessive force.
 Barbados is in the forefront of an initiative to standardize police procedures
 throughout the English-speaking Caribbean region. The authorities issued fni-earms
 to special units and some foot patrols in high-crime areas in response to the 1993
 shooting death of a policeman and a rise in gun- and drug-related crime. Aside from
 this, the police force is still mainly unarmed, in keeping with its British traditions.
 The only prison is overcrowded, with over 700 prisoners in a structure built for
 350 inmates, and has very antiquated equipment. There is no separation of violent
 from nonviolent offenders. Although discipline and security are generally strict,
 there were allegations that guards ignored the brutal gang-rape of a young prisoner
 by other convicts. The Government has not investigated this case.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients. The authorities do not use exile as a punishment or means
 of political control.
 There is no formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status;
 however, government practice remains undefined.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides that persons charged
 with criminal offenses be given a fair public hearingwithin a reasonable time by
 an independent and impartial court, and the Government respects this in practice.
 The judicial system provides for the right of due process at each level. The law pre-
 sumes defendants innocent until proven guilty. The Government provides free legal
 aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts independently and is free of intervention from
 other branches of government. Criticizing the Government is not a political offense.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires war-
 rants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.
 The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased
 drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighbor-
 hoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government neither censors mail nor re-
 stricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities respect these rights in practice. There are two
 independent daily newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The
 Government regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in
 radio progsins. There are five radio stations, two of whichare owned by the Gov-
 eCaribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television service (the only
 television source, excluding direct satellite reception) is government owned. Though
 CBC is a state enterprise, it regularly reported views opposing government policies.
 Although critics allege that the Government sometimes uses its influence to discour-
 age media reporting on sensitive issues, the press remained vigorously critical of the
 Government on a broad span of issues.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government observes the
 constitutional provisions for peaceful assembly and private association in practice.
 Political parties, trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings
 and rallies without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Moveent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. In the most recent
 election in September 1994, the Barbados Labour Party won a decisive victory, gain-
 
 
 326
 ing a 19-to-8 majority over the Democratic Labour Party. The New Democratic
 Party won one seat, its first ever in Parliament. There are no impediments to par-
 ticipation in the political process, and all citizens over age 18 may vote. The Prime
 Minister exercises executive power along with the Cabinet of Ministers he appoints,
 balanced by the bicameral Parliament and the judicial system.
 Women are well represented at all levels of government and politics, including the
 Head of State Governor General Dame Nita Barrow. After the September 1994 elec-
 tions, Prime Minister Arthur appointed women to several cabinet-level portfolios.
 For the first time the Deputy Prime Minister is a woman (she also serves concur-
 rently as Foreign Minister). The Ministries of Health and Education are also headed
 by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights matters operate freely and without Gov-
 ernment hindrance. The Caribbean Human Rights Network, a Caribbean-wide
 human rights organization which has its headquarters and a small staff in Bar-
 bados, investigates and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout
 the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Women.-Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-
 represented at all levels of both the public and private sectors. They form a large
 percentage of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public hous-
 mng or other social welfare programs. However, violene against women and children
 continued to be a significant social problem. Women's rghts groups reported that
 the incidence of sexual assaults, domestic violence, incest, and rape increased, de-
 spite the fact that there is still some reluctance on the part of victims to report such
 incidents. There are public and private counseling services for domestic violence,
 rape, suicide, and child abuse.
 The 1992 Aomestic violence law specifies the appropriate police response to domes-
 tic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and chil-
 dren. It applies equally to marriages and to common law relationships. Criminal
 penalties for violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender or
 the victim. The courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women
 involving assault or wounding. Victims may request restraining orders, which the
 courts often issue. The courts can sentence an offender to jail for breaching such
 an order. Human rights monitors continued to criticize the inconsistency in sentenc-
 i   for rape, incest and statutoiy rape, which is often left to the discretion of the
 judge. They noted tat the lack of sentencing guidelines resulted in longer sentences
 being handed down for persons accused of petty theft than for incest; and lesser sen-
 tences for incest than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare
 although violence against children remains a serious problem. The Child Care Boad
 is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding to the critical welfare
 needs, interests and rights of children.
 People With bisabilities.-The law does not prohibit discrimination against the
 physically disabled in employment, education, or the provision of other state serv-
 ices. The Labour Department, which is responsible for finding jobs for the disabled,
 unsuccessfully advocated the introduction of such legislation in the 1980's. Simi-
 larly, there is no legislation mandating provision of accessibility to public thorough-
 fares or public or private buildings. Interest groups have lobbied for this type of leg-
 islation from time to time, but without success.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers freely exercise their right to form and be-
 long to trade unions and to strike. There are two major unions and several smaller
 ones, representing various sectors of labor. The civil service union, the National
 Union oF Public Workers, is completely independent of any political party or the
 Government. The largest union, the Barbados Workers' Union, was historically
 closely associated with the opposition Democratic Labour Party.
 The law accords full protection to trade unionists' personal and property rights.
 Another law prohibits strikes against public utilities. All other private and public
 sector employees are permitted to strike. There were no major strikes or long-term
 work stoppages, although there were two minor industrial actions. Transport work-
 ers called a 2-day wildcat mini-bus strike to protest operating fee increases included
 
 
 327
 in the 1995 budget. Barbados Light and Power workers worked slowly for a couple
 of days until the Prime Minister stepped in to negotiate restructuring and salary
 issues.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are in fact affiliated with a variety
 of regional and international labor oganizations. The Caribbean Congress of Labor
 (CCL) has its headquarters in Barbados. On August 11, a new umbrella Congress
 of Trade Unions and Staff Associations was inaugurated. All unions belong to this
 og   iztion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and authorities respected it in practice. Recent
 losses of jobs in the economy resulted in a reduction in union membership to about
 20 percent of the working population. Normally, wages and working conditions are
 negotiated through the collective bargaining process, but a tripartite wage policy ac-
 cord signed in the summer of 1993 established a 2-year wage freeze. During the
 year, unions bargained for wage and benefit increases to be incorporated into a re-
 placement wage and price policy accord for 1995-97, which Parliament approved on
 January 16, 1996. Unions representing public sector workers had yet to agree to it,
 however, by the end of that month.
 Employers have no legal obligation to renize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a majority of their employees signify a desire to be
 represented by a registered union. While there is no specific law prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redress for employees al-
 leging unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but
 rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no reports of its use.
 d. Minimum Age for Empoment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 of 16 is generally observed. Compulsory primary and secondary education policies,
 which require school attendance until age 16, reinforce minimum age requirements.
 Occasionally, especially among migrant worker families, children assist in agricul-
 tural production during peak season. The Labour Department has a small cadre of
 labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check records to
 verify compliance with the law. These inspectors may take legal action against an
 employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets and the authorities establish min-
 imum wages for specified categories of workers. Only two categories of workers have
 a formally regulated minimum   wage-household domestics and shop assistants
 (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a minimum wage of
 about $32.50 (bds $65.00) per week, although in actual labor market conditions, the
 prevailing wage is almost double that amount. There are two age-related minimum
 wage catories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop assistants
 is $1.87 (bds $3.75) per hour, the juvenile minimum wage or sho   assists is
 $1.62 (Uds $3.25) per hour. Agricultural workers (for example, sugar plantation
 workers) receive a minimum wage as a matter of practice but not of law.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados for not adhering tothe
 ILO conventioon n equal remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admonished the Government to ensure the application of the principle
 of equal remuneration for work of equal value to male and female workers in the
 sugar industry or to provide further information on job descriptions which might
 justify such wage distinction. This case was not resolved byyear's end.
 The tandard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess. Barbados accepts ILO conventions, standards,
 and other seetoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. However, there
 is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Employers must provide work-
 ers a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. Unemployment benefits and national in-
 surance (social security) cover all workers. A comprehensive, government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 Undr a Fatries Act of 1983, which sets out the officially recognized occupa-
 tional safety and health standards, the Labour Department enforces health and
 safety standards and follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by man-
 agement. Workers have a limited right to remove themselves from dangerous or
 hazardous job situations without jeopardizing their continued employment. The Fac-
 tories Act requires that in certain sectors firms employingmore than 50 workers
 set up a safety committee. This committee can challenge the decisions of manage-
 
 
 328
 
 ment concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Trade unions
 have called on the Government to increase the number of factory inspectors in order
 to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more effectively, and
 to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. Govern-
 ment-operated corporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor job" in
 health and safety. The Government has promised to undertake inspections of gov-
 ernment-operated corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority.
