 KIRIBATI
 Kiribati comprises some 78,400 people occupying 33 small islands widely scattered
 across 1.365 million square miles of the central Pacific. The population is primarily
 Micronesian, with a significant component of Polynesian origin. Kiribati gained full
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a republic within the
 Commonwealth of Nations. It has a popularly elected president and a legislative as-
 sembly with 40 members elected by universal adult suffrage, and 2 who are mem-
 bers by virtue of their office. The judiciary is independent.
 A police force of about 250 personnel is controlled effectively by civilian authority.
 Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The is-
 lands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and limited arable land,
 severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There were no
 reports of specific human rights abuses, but in the traditional culture, women oc-
 cupy a subordinate role and have limited job opportunities.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are forbidden
 by the Constitution, corporal punishment is permitted under traditional mores for
 criminal acts and other transgressions. On some outer islands, the island councils
 occasionally order strokes with palm fronds to be administered for public drunken-
 ness and other minor offenses such as petty thievery.
 The authorities strive to meet minimum international standards for prisons but
 have limited financial resources. Food and sanitation are limited. Family members
 and church representatives are allowed access to prisoners. The question of monitor-
 ing prison conditions by local human rights groups has not arisen, and -no policy
 concerning such monitoring has been formulated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is provided by law
 and observed in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person be in-
 formed of the nature of the offense for which he is charged and be provided ade-
 quate time and facilities to prepare a defense. The judiciary is independent and free
 of governmental interference. The right to confront witnesses, present evidence, and
 appeal convictions is provided for in law. Procedural safeguards are based on
 English common law.
 The judiciary consists of a high court, magistrate courts, a court of appeal, and
 land courts. Litigants also have the right of appeal to the Privy Council in London.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities respect these provisions, and viola-
 tions are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects this right in practice. The radio sta-
 tion and the only newspaper are government owned but offer a variety of views.
 Churches publish newsletters and other periodicals.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group's interests, and the Govern-
 ment does not impose any significant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion prevails. There is no state or pre-
 ferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The lw provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. There were no reports of refugees. The Government has not formulated
 a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens choose the Government in periodic free and open elections. The Presi-
 dent, who is elected for a 4-year term, exercises executive authority. No less than
 three and no more than four presidential candidates are nominated by the elected
 Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the Constitution, the Presi-
 dent is limited to three terms.
 On November 27, voters reelected President Teburoro Tito to a second term with
 52.3 percent of the votes. On December 4, President Tito announced the names of
 his cabinet ministers,- most of whom served in the previous cabinet.
 Women are underrepresented in politics and government. No women hold ministe-
 rial or permanent secretary positions, and none hold national elective office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to date none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 
 
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and the Government generally observed this prohibition in practice.
 Kiribati society, fundamentally egalitarian, has no privileged chiefly class.
 Women.-Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem in this
 isolated, rural society. Rape is a crime under the law, and the law is enforced when
 charges are brought to court. To the extent that it exists, wife beating is dealt with
 informally and in a traditional way; frequently, communal pressure is brought to
 bear.
 The traditional culture in which men are dominant has been an impediment to
 women taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly changing, and more
 women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. There are also
 signs of increased government hiring and promotions of women. Women have full
 and equal access to education.
 Statistics on the participation of women in the work force and on comparative
 wages are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of
 property.
 Children.-Within its limited financial resources, the Government makes ade-
 quate expenditures for child welfare. If child abuse exists, it is rare and has not be-
 come a source of societal concern.
 Primary education is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 12 years.
 Following a national examination, about 40 percent of primary school graduates
 qualify to attend secondary school.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence or complaint of discrimination in
 employment, education, or provision of other state services. Accessibility for the dis-
 abled has not been mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. Over 90 percent of the work
 force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but the small. wage sector has
 a relatively strong and effective trade union movement. In 1982 the seven registered
 trade unions merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). It has ap-
 proximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector. The KTUC is af-
 filiated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The law pro-
 vides for the right to strike. However, strikes are rare, the last one having taken
 place in 1980.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for under the Industrial Relations Code. The Government sets wages in the
 large public sector. However, in a few statutory bodies and government-owned com-
 panies, employees may negotiate wages and other conditions. In the private sector,
 individual employees may also negotiate wages with employers. Negotiations are
 generally nonconfrontational, in keeping with Kiribati tradition. There have been no
 reports of antiunion discrimination. However, mechanisms exist for resolving any
 such complaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced. The prohibition does not specifically
 mention children, but the practice of forced and bonded labor by children does not
 occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14. Primary education is com-
 pulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 12. Children through the age of 15
 are prohibited from industrial employment and employment aboard ships. Labor of-
 ficers from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Employment normally enforce
 these laws effectively, given the rudimentary conditions of the economy and its in-
 dustrial relations system. Children are rarely employed outside the traditional econ-
 omy. Forced and bonded labor by children does not occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement longstanding legislation authorizing establishment of minimum wages.
 There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. The Government is the major em-
 ployer in the cash economy.
 
 
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers must, for example, provide an adequate supply of clean water for
 workers and ensure the existence of sanitary.toilet facilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified personnel. Women may not
 work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in service jobs such
 as hotel clerks).
