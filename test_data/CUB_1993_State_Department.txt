 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state dominated by President Fidel Castro who is Chief of
 State, Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and Com-
 mander in Chief of the armed forces. President Castro has sought to control all as-
 pects of Cuban life through a network of directorates ultimately answerable to him
 through the Communist Party, the bureaucracy, and the state security apparatus.
 The Party is the only legal political entity and is headed by an elite group whose
 membership is ultimately determined by Fidel Castro. The Party controls all gov-
 ernment positions, including judicial offices. Though not a formal requirement, party
 membership is a de facto prerequisite for high-level official positions and profes-
 sional advancement.
 The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. It operates border and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations, de-
 termines whether to recognize nongovernmental associations, investigates non-
 conformity, regulates migration, and maintains pervasive vigilance through a series
 of mass organizations and informants. It is charged with suppressing opposition and
 dissent of any kind. The Ministry is under the de facto control of the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces, which in turn are directed by Fidel Castro's brother Raul. The mass
 
 
 organizations attempt to extend government and Communist Party control over
 each citizen's daily activities at home work and school. Neighborhood Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's) m obilize citizens, impose ideological con-
 formity, and report suspicious behavior.
 The economy remained highly centralized despite some changes during the year,
 most notably decriminalization of hard currency possession andlegalization of some
 types of self-employment. The Government, however, continued to control the means
 of production and remained virtually the sole employer. The economy continued to
 decline dramatically, reflecting the collapse in Cuba's relationship with the former
 Soviet Union. An annual $4-S billion in Soviet aid has ended. Total foreign trade
 was one-fourth the 1989 level. The Government continued its austerity measures
 known as "the special period in peacetime," which call for draconian efforts toward
 economic self-sufficiency.
 The Government sharply restricts basic political and civil rights, including free-
 dom of expression, association, assembly, and movement, as well as the right to pri-
 vacy, the right of citizens to change their government, and worker rights. Authori-
 ties neutralize dissent through a variety of tactics designed to keep activists off bal-
 ance, divided, and discredited by labeling them mentally disturbed social misfits or
 hostile agents of foreign nations. To a lesser extent than in the past, the Govern-
 ment used "acts of repudiation," which are attacks by mobs organized by the Gov-
 ernment but portrayed as spontaneous public rebukes of dissident activity. The Gov-
 ernment also metes out exceptionally harsh prison sentences to activists whom it
 considers a threat to its control.
 In March the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) passed a resolution en-
 dorsing the report of the UNHRC's Special Rapporteur, which made a strong and
 detailed criticism of Cuba's systematic violations of human rights. The report con-
 cluded with seven steps Cuba must take to bring its human rights practices ur to
 minimum international standards. The Government for its part continued to refuse
 the new Special Rapporteur, like his predecessor, permission to visit Cuba. While
 there were no systemic changes improving human rights, the Government did re-
 lease several imprisoned human rights activists and reduced the number of acts of
 repudiation. The overall human rights situation remained poor, almost as oppres-
 sive as in 1992.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Law enforcement officers were re-
 sponsible for several extrajudicial killings. Five policemen arrested and handcuffed
 Jesus Acosta Ramos of Manicaragua in Villa Clara province on February 5 and bru-
 tally beat him in front of eyewitnesses. Acosta died later that day; his autopsy cer-
 tified that he had died of a heart attack, failing to mention the injuries sustained.
 Rogelio Carbenel Buevara died on March 7 in a police holding cell after being beat-
 en near his home by three policemen from the Malecon unit in Havana's Vedado
 district. Carbonel's widow was told days later that his death was due to natural
 causes. Police officer Cariel Gonzalez shot and killed 13-year-old Simon Heredia Al-
 varez in Cespedes in Camaguey province during a May 1 celebration, reportedly
 after Heredia complained to Gonzalez that he should not mistreat people who were
 waiting in line. This led to disturbances involving a few hundred of the town's in-
 habitants, who chased Gonzalez to the police station. They were finally dispersed
 upon a show of force by police. In addition, there were several confirmed incidents
 in which border patrols killed people trying to leave the country (see Section 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradinq Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners. However,
 police and prison officials frequently employed beatings, neglect, isolation, and other
 abuse in dealing with detainees and prisoners convicted of political crimes (includ-
 ing human rights advocates) or those who persist in expressing their views. State
 security officials often subjected dissidents to systematic psychological intimidation
 in an attempt to coerce them to sign incriminating documents or to collaborate. The
 UNHRC Special Rapporteur found prison conditions, especially habitual beatings,
 severe overcrowding, and the lack of food and medical care, in violation of Cuban
 law. Dissidents are often placed in cells with common criminals.
 The Government claims that prisoners have guaranteed rights, such as family vis-
 itation, adequate nutrition, pay for work, the right to request parole, and the right
 to petition the prison director. However, according to human rights activists, these
 purported rights are often and capriciously withdrawn, especially from political pris-
 oners. There has been no indication that authorities investigated reports of abuse
 
 
 410
 or took disciplinary action against the agents responsible. Among the many reported
 cases of brutality by prison guards and police was that of human rights activist Luis
 Alberto Pita Santos, whose arm was broken during a severe beating by prison
 guards in Boniato prison in January after refusing to wear a prison uniform. Ten
 guards handcuffed and severely beat activist Juan Carlos Aguiar Beaton in front of
 other prisoners at Guanajay prison in July.
 Human rights activists and political dissidents are systematically harassed, beat-
 en, and otherwise abused in public and private by police and state security officials
 as a means of intimidation and control. Three plainclothes policemen in December
 1992 accosted Nelson Eduardo Cruz Cabeza, an activist with the group Edad de
 Oro and told him to stop his activities; they then beat him, causing an injury to
 his head which required six stitches.
 Authorities continued to use acts of repudiation to intimidate activists and as a
 pretext for their arrest, though to a lesser extent than in 1992. Crowds of people
 are amassed outside homes of activists to harass them, yell insults, and vandalize
 property. At times, the targeted activist is forced through the crowd by police and
 physically beaten or abused. During such acts, police often arrest activists "for their
 own protection," and later charge them with counterrevolutionary activity, resulting
 in prison terms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are com-
 monplace. The Law of Penal Procedures requires police to file charges and either
 release a detainee or place him before a prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest. Au-
 thorities are also legally required to provide suspects access to a lawyer within 10
 days of arrest. These procedures are routinely denied to those detained on state se-
 curity grounds. The Constitution states that all civil liberties can be denied anyone
 o posing the "decision of the Cuban people to build socialism." Authorities invoke
 tisopen-ended article to justify lengthy detentions of activists on the grounds they-
 constitute "counterrevolutionary elements." The UNHRC Special Rapporteur found
 that the legal system lacks laws and institutions needed to afford due process.
 According to human rights activists, there were between 1,500 and 2,000 Cubans
 incarcerated for illegal exit and at least another 2,000 imprisoned for various politi-
 cal   crimes.  The    Penal    Code   contains   several   articles  prohibiting
 "counterrevolutionary" activity. Activists are often imprisoned for "enemy propa-
 ganda," "illicit association," contempt for authority" (usually for criticizing Fidel
 Castro), "clandestine printing," or the broad charge of "rebellion." The latter is
 brought against advocates of peaceful democratic change.
 The Penal Code also includes the concept of "dangerousness," defined as 'the spe-
 cial proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in mani-
 fest contradiction of socialist norms." Government authorities continue to intimidate
 activists by threatening prosecution under this article. If the police decide a person
 exhibits such behavior, the offender may be brought before a court or subjected to
 "therapy" or "political reeducation" for 1 to 4 years. In late 1993, there was a sharp
 increase in the number of convictions for dangerousness as several hundred people,
 possibly more in the Havana area alone, were sentenced to prison. Some were
 human rights activists such as Felipe Lorens, head of the Marti Youth Organization,
 who was sentenced to 4 years in prison in October.
 Reports of arbitrary arrests of human rights monitors continued unabated. On
 June 22, plainclothes police picked up Maria Celina Rodriguez, president of the op-
 position group "Liberty and Faith," and her 6-year-old son and took them to a near-
 by house, where they were interrogated for 7 hours regarding her human rights ac-
 tivism. Police detained Roberto Pintado of the "Marti Youth Organization" in June
 and told him to stop his dissident activities or be tried on charges of "illicit associa-
 tion" and sentenced to 2 or 3 years in prison. The Government also preempts dis-
 sident activity by arbitrarily prolonging prison sentences by bringing new charges
 against detainees for human rights activities allegedly committed during imprison-
 ment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Cuban law and trial practices do not meet inter-
 national standards for fair and impartial public trials. Almost all cases are tried in
 less than 1 day. Although the Constitution provides for independent courts, it ex-
 plicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly and the Council of State, which
 is headed by Fidel Castro. Judges are elected by the rubberstamp National Assem-
 bly and its lower level counterparts. The judiciary's independence is also com-
 promised by the subordination of the courts to the Communist Party. There is no
 known case in which a court has ruled against the Government on any political or
 security matter.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. All are pre-
 sided over by panels composed of a mix of professionally qualified and lay judges.
 Military tribunals assume jurisdiction for certain "counterrevolutionary" cases. Most
 
 
 411
 trials are public; however, trials are closed when state security is allegedly involved.
 Testimony from a CDR member may be introduced on behalf of a defendant and
 may contribute to either a shorter or longer sentence. The law recognizes the right
 of appeal in municipal courts. In provincial courts, some cases are appealable, such
 as those involving maximum prison terms or the death penalty. The law requires
 that an appeal be filed within 5 days of the verdict.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights activists, are
 arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in politi-
 cal cases, is the defendant's confession. It is usually obtained under duress and
 without legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. Defense lawyers often are
 not allowed to meet with defendants until the day of the trial. Several activists who
 have served prison terms say they were tried and sentenced without counsel and
 were not allowed to speak on their own behalf.
 The law provides an accused the right to an attorney, but the latter's impartiality
 and independence are compromised by the absence of an independent bar associa-
 tion and by ideological controls exerted over members of the state-controlled law-
 yers' collectives, especially when defending persons accused of state security crimes.
 Observers have reported reluctance among attorneys to defend those charged in po-
 litical cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondenc.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for inviolability of one's home and correspondence,
 official intrusion into private and family affairs remain one of the most repressive
 and pervasive features of Cuban life. Party-controlled mass organizations permeate
 society. The State has assumed a virtual right of interference into the lives of citi-
 zens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government. These intrusions aim
 ostensibly at "improving" the citizenr but are calculated to encourage ideological
 conformity.
 Authorities possess a wide range of social controls. The educational system teach-
 es that the State's interests have precedence over all other ties and commitments.
 Teachers, selected in part for their ideological commitment, emphasize Communist
 doctrine in the classroom and may penalize students whose famlies question ortho-
 dox opinion. Teachers are required to evaluate students' ideological character, which
 is noted in records carried by students throughout their education and which affect
 their future prospects.
 The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and neighbor-
 hood security committees (Cd R's) to monitor and control public opinion. Guardians
 of social conformity, the 80,000 CDR's are tasked with closely monitoring the daily
 lives of residents. Participation in them is described as voluntary;  in fact, oblig-
 atory. CDR's report suspicious activity, such as reception of foreign radio or tele-
 vision broadcasts in the home, conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings, in-
 cluding with foreigners, and attitudes toward the Government. Activist Sergio Seco
 Cordero, for example, was denounced in a report by his CDR as "disaffected" be-
 cause of his Tactive participation against our Socialist system." Such people are
 often harassed and fired from their jobs (see Section 2.a.).
 Cubans do not have the right to receive publications from abroad. Their inter-
 national correspondence is often read by state security. Overseass  are difficult
 to make and are monitored; conversations with foreigners are reported. Activists,
 diplomats, and foreign journalists report surveillance by security agents, though this
 seems to have decreased.
 Authorities regularly search people's homes without probable cause for purposes
 of intimidation and harassment. Police broke into the home of activist Carlos Negrin
 on February 3 and seized three pairs of foreign-made shoes. They told Negrin that
 his mother-in-law had accused him of illicit econoic activity. Negin and his wife
 were arrested, taken to the police station, and placed in a holding cell. Negrin's wife
 had a miscamage and was taken to a hospital; though doctors ordered bed rest, she
 was returned to the station, where she and Negrin were held for 5 days. They were
 both released after paying a fine equal to 1 month's salary.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Seech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws are enforced against antigovernment propaganda,
 mraffiti, and insults against officials. The penalty is 3 months to 1 year i prisn
 for contempt. If Fidel Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of
 State are the object, the sentence is 1 to 3 years. Rosa Cam pos Hernandez, for ex-
 ample, was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment because she abe a use md  defama -
 tory statements about Castro and other ministers while standing in the door of her
 Havana home. ical CDR's inhibit freedom of speech by monitoring and reporting
 dissent or criticism (see Section l if.).
 
 
 The Constitution states that electronic and print media are state property and
 "cannot become, in any case, private property." The media are controlled by the
 Communist Party and operate under its guidelines. They faithfully reflect govern-
 ment views and are used to indoctrinate the public. No other pub ic forum exists.
 TV Marti and Radio Marti, which broadcast from the United States, are often
 jammed; however, other foreign broadcasts are not. Police and Interior Ministry offi-
 cials frequently confiscate foreign newspapers from members of the Independent
 Journalists' Association (APIC) and human rights activists. The Government also
 circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms. Education is the exclusive
 prerogative of the State. Schools follow Marxist-Leninist precepts as interpreted by
 the Government.
 Beyond the Government's tight control over media, other forms of expression are
 rigidly monitored. The Government often arrests people for the crimes of "enemy
 propaganda" and "clandestine printing." Dissidents are physically attacked and in-
 timidated if they try to report on incidents. APIC head Nestor Baguer called one
 of his contacts abroad in uly with news about a large-scale disturbance near Ha-
 vana. The next day two men posing as telephone company employees beat him in
 his home and destroyed his telephone. On August 6, three men severely beat APIC
 member Jorge Casanovas Crespo just outside the offices of the Communist Party's
 Central Committee as he was heading to an APIC meeting. Casanovas required six
 stitches; vision in one eye was severely affected.
 Academic publications and research may not conflict with government or party
 policy. On January 26, Leonardo Jose Rodriguez Perez, a researcher at the Center
 for Metallurgc Research, became the latest of several fired from their jobs after
 signing the open letter from Cuban professionals to the second (1992) Ibero-Amer-
 ican summit."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution does not pro-
 vide for freedom of assembly or association, nor are these freedoms permitted. Any
 assembly of more than three persons, even in a private home, is punishable by up
 to 3 months in prison and a fine. Though not universally enforced, this is often used
 as a legal pretext to harass and imprison human rights advocates. Even activists
 who act respectfully towards authority are subject to continuous harassment and
 persecution. Organiers of "illicit or unrecognized gups" may be sentenced to up
 to 9 months. The authorities have never approved a public meeting of a human
 rights group.
 The Penal Code forbids "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Justice Ministry, in
 consultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to recognize organizations.
 Apart from "recognized" churches and a few carefully monitored groups such as the
 Masonic Order, small human rights groups represent the only associations outside
 the State and party. Authorities continued to ignore numerous applications for legal
 recognition byhuman rights groups, whose members were often jailed for "illicit as-
 sociation" or became the targets of reprisals. Human rights activists were fired from
 their jobs for such reasons as being "connected to counterrevolutionary groups" or
 being a "focal point for political deviation" with "ideas very contrary to those of our
 revolution."
 Because of such restrictions, public demonstrations by opposition groups are ex-
 tremely difficult to organize. Activists Juan Guarino and Paula Valiente were ar-
 rested on April 30 by state security after planning a May Day march outside a Ha-
 vana church. The following day, 150-200 persons gathered for the march; when ac-
 tivists unfurled the Cuban flag, the police moved in and began beating people with
 blunt instruments. Several were arrested. Guarino and Valiente were convicted of
 "inciting public unrest" on May 18 and released on parole, an uncharacteristically
 lenient sentence. Since their release, however, both have been harassed by state se-
 curity and kept under tight surveillance (see Section 2.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In recent years, the Government has made legal changes
 which eased somewhat the harsher aspects of its suppression of religious freedom.
 In 1991 it allowed religious adherents to join the Communist Party, while in 1992
 it amended the Constitution to prohibit religious discrimination and remove ref-
 erences to "scientific materialism," i.e., atheism, as the basis for the Cuban State.
 Such actions were praised by the Protestant Ecumenical Council, but the Catholic
 Church stated its concern over the gap between the Government's rhetoric and ac-
 tions. The Catholic Bishops issued a pastoral letter calling for national reconciliation
 and dialog. Although harshly critical of the letter, the Government did not directly
 retaliate against the Church.
 Despite these changes, religious persecution continues. Members of the armed
 forces are prohibited from allowing anyone in their household to observe religious
 practices. Elderly relatives are exempted if their beliefs do not influence their
 spouses or children and are not "damaging to the revolution." The Government con-
 
 
 413
 tinued to use the Penal Code to persecute Jehovah's Witnesses and, to a lesser ex-
 tent, Seventh-Day Adventists. Jehovah's Witnesses were often convicted of clandes-
 tine printing if a search of their home revealed religious materials or illicit associa-
 tion for having religious meetings. They have also been found guilty of contributing
 to the delinquency of a minor, of "not complying with duties related to respect and
 love of country," and of "abuse of the freedom o religion" when, out of religious con-
 viction, they refuse to honor symbols of the Cuban State. Because the Government
 considers them "active religious enemies of the revolution," Jehovah's Witnesses and
 Adventists are watched and often harassed by the CDR's, who also maintain surveil-
 lance over "spiritualists who give consultations," in addition to such categories as
 "counterrevolutionary ex-convict" and "common criminal."
 Church attendance has grown rapidly in recent years, despite government and
 party efforts to restrict and control church activities. Churches and other religious
 groups must register with the Government and be officially recognized. Authorized
 religious organizations may hold activities only at designated places of worship.
 Construction of new churches is prohibited, forcing many churches to meet in indi-
 viduals' homes. Religious holidays were eliminated in 1961. No religious processions
 outside of church grounds are permitted, and churches are denied any access to
 mass media.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--There are no legal restrictions on domestic travel, other than a re-
 stricted zone near the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo. Persons who are found to
 be HIV-positive are restricted to sanatorium communities and allowed to leave thnse
 communities only on highly restricted conditions. The Government now allows per-
 sons over 20 years of age to apply for permission to travel abroad. The vast majority
 of persons who qualify for immigrant visas or refugee status are allowed to leave;
 however, the Government continues to delay or deny exit permits in certain cases,
 often without explanation. These often include professionals who have tried to leave
 and who have since been banned from working in their occupational field. Others
 are refused permission because the Government considers their cases sensitive. Dis-
 sident scientist Rolando Roque Malherbe, for example, had been refused an exit visa
 since 1990 and had been unable to attend conferences abroad. The Government fi-
 nally permitted Roque to leave in December for a teaching position in Spain. Presi-
 dent  astro's daughter, Alina Fernandez, slipped out of the country in disguise,
 after being refused an exit visa for years. The Government also has coercedsome
 p eople, mostly activists, into leaving the country. Paula Valiente, head of Mothers
 for Dignity, was constantly harassed by state security officials to emigrate. Threats
 were made thather 17-year-old son would be imprisoned on trumped-up charges. To
 avoid that, Valiente left Cuba with her son in November.
 The Government also permitted hundreds of former political prisoners to emi-
 grate, including several prominent activists who had previously been denied exit
 visas. Most notable was Mario Canes de Armas, a former Castro comrade, who was
 allowed to emigrate in July. Chanes was released in 1991 after serving a 30-year
 prison sentence; he had been the longest serving political prisoner in the Western
 Hemisphere. Nydia Cartaya, wife of Joaquin Movrino Perez, an ex-army officer who
 defected in the mid-1980s, was also granted an exit visa after having been denied
 one since 1985. Activist Jose Luis Pujol, who had originally applied in 1986, was
 allowed to depart. Activists Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz and Rolando Prats were
 granted exit visas to make extensive trips abroad during the summer and were al-
 oedto return to Cuba, even though Sanchez is out on bnd pending trial on
 charges of contempt for resisting a beating by police in December 1992.
 The Government continues to use aggressive, often violent, means to prevent citi-
 zens from emigrating without its permission. For example, on July 1,border guards
 in Cojimar opened fire on a boat carrying at least 16 unarmed Cubans who were
 trying to flee to the United States. Three were killed  a at least 10 injured. Guards
 and police reportedly refused to assist those wounded in the water or allow others
 to do so. According to numerous accounts, this led to rioting by several hundred in-
 habitants. In October border guards killed Luis Quevedo Remolino after he tried to
 leave in a raft. Though the Government stated that he had been shot trying to de-
 eart illegally, Quevedo's family and friends assert he was beaten to death.
 evedo's ousins, who were involved in the escape attempt, were also beaten,
 though not as seriously. The incident led several thousand people to march in a fu-
 neral procession on October 14 in Rela near Havana; Quevedo's family reportedly
 diverted the hearse to the police station and removed the body from the coffin, to
 show that it was covered with deep bruises and had no bullet wounds. Despite the
 dangers involved, a record 3 656 Cubans made it to the United States in rafts. It
 is not known how many perishmed en route.
 
 
 In five incidents witnessed by U.S. military personnel in late June, border guards
 used hand grenades and rifle fire against unarmed swimmers trying to escape to
 the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo in southeast Cuba. In response to U.S. protests
 over the use of excessive force, the Government denied the reports, calling them
 "slanderous." Over 30 Cubans are known to have died while attempting to seek asy-
 lum at the Base, either shot by Cuban soldiers or killed by Cuban mines, while 821
 made it safely.
 There is no right of repatriation. Exit permits for temporary travel specify that
 the person must return within 30 days, although extensions are available. Cubans
 who live abroad must apply for permission to return for visits. A quota of 10,000
 visits per year by those who left between 1959 and 1980, as well as a general ban
 on the return of those who left after 1980, were greatly liberalized in August.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Cubans have no legal right to change their government or to advocate a change.
 The Constitution states that the only political organization allowed is the Com-
 munist Party. A small group of leaders select members of its highest governing bod-
 ies--the Politburo and Central Committee.
 In February the Government permitted direct elections to the national legislature
 for the first time since it was created in 1976. Before nomination, however, every
 candidate had to be screened by a "candidacy commission" composed of members of
 party-controlled "mass organizations." Only one candidate per seat was allowed; vot-
 ers could either vote "yes" or leave the ballot blank; there was no space even to
 check "no." These procedures were designed to ensure that only those who follow
 the government line would be on the ballot. Formation of political parties, cam-
 paigning, and the making of campain promises was forbidden.
 Leadership positions in Castro's Government have been dominated by white males
 since its inception; there are very few women or minorities in positions with policy
 responsibility in the Party or the Government. There are 3 women on the 25-mem-
 ber Politburo; the country's first female provincial party secretary was not chosen
 until 1993. Though blacks and mulattoes make up over half the population, they
 comprise only 4 of the 25 Politburo members and only 15 percent of over 200 mem-
 bers of the Central Committee.
 The Government has ignored calls for democratic reform and labeled activists who
 proposed them "worms" and traitors working to undermine it. Any change judged
 not compatible with the revolution is rejected, as are proposals by Cubans who seek
 nonviolent political change or open debate about the political system. The Govern-
 ment retaliates against those who have peacefully sought political change.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No domestic or international human rights group is recognized by the Govern-
 ment or permitted to function legally. As noted above, domestic human rights mon-
 itors are subject to intense intimidation and repression. In violation of its own stat-
 utes the Government refuses to consider applications for legal recognition submit-
 ted by human rights grouts. The main domestic human rights monitoring groups
 are the Cuban Human Rights Committee, the Cuban Pro-Human Ri ts Party, the
 National Council for +Civil Rights, and the Cuban Commission for  uman Rights
 and National Reconciliation. In addition, the Cuban Democratic Convergence, the
 Cuban Coalition, and the Civic Democratic Alliance are umbrella organizations in-
 cluding a number of smaller human rights groups.
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights criticism. In
 1991 Cuba's U.N. Representative stated it would not recognize the UNHRC man-
 date on Cuba and would not cooperate with its Special Rapporteur, even though
 Cuba is a UNHRC member. In March, after the UNHRC passed a resolution con-
 demning human rights violations in Cuba by the largest margin ever, Cuban Am-
 bassador Jose Perez Novoa said the resolution was the result of a "political ven-
 detta" and maintained that "there are no large-scale and flagrant human rights vio-
 lations in Cuba." Cuba continues to ignore repeated requests by the UNHRC's Spe-
 cial Rapporteur to visit Cuba to meet officials and citizens.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a majority of black and mixed racial ancestry.
 The Constitution forbids discrimination basedon race, sex, or national origin, al-
 though evidence suggests that racial and sexual discrimination occurs.
 Women.-The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and re-
 sponsibilities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home,
 
 
 415
 and pursuing a career. The Maternity Law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave
 and grants working women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 per-
 cent of all women work. They are well represented in the professions, although few
 are in positions with policy responsibility.
 Information from human rights groups and other sources indicates that domestic
 violence and sexual assaults occur, but no statistics are available. Violent crime is
 rarely reported in the press and, due to cultural traditions, victims of mistreatment
 are reluctant to press charges. However, the law establishes strict penalties for
 rape, and it appears to be enforced. Prostitution has increased greatly in the last
 fewyears, especially around tourist areas.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government will protect "family, ma-
 ternity, and matrimony." It also states that children, legitimate or not have the
 same rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Edu-
 cation is free and is based on the ideology of Marx and Jose Marti, and state organi-
 zations and schools are charged with the "integral formation of childhood and
 youth."
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Information about racial discrimination is
 not readil, available. Many blacks have benefited from the social changes of the rev-
 olution. Nevertheless, there have been numerous instances of police harassment
 against blacks, including black foreigners and diplomats who were mistaken for
 being Cuban. Many black activists report being singled out for harassment. Officials
 have told them during interrogations that they are "ungrateful" for not appreciating
 what the revolution did for them and insulted them with racial epithets.
 People with Disabilities.-There have been few known cases of discrimination
 based on disability. There are laws to provide for the disabled, but no laws mandat-
 ing accessibility.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 Decisions and choices of workers are subordinate to the "demands of the economy
 and society." The law does not permit strikes, nor are any known to have occurred
 in 1993. Established labor organizations are not trade unions in any real sense and
 do not act as a voice for worker rights, including the right to strike. Labor is orga-
 nized under the control of the State and party through one umbrella group, the Con-
 federation of Cuban Workers (CTC).
 Although a constitutional amendment removed reference to the CTC and its Sec-
 retary General's participation in the Council of Ministers, the CTC's union monopoly
 is reflected in the explicit reference to it that remains in the Labor Code. The CTC
 serves primarily as a state instrument to enforce political and labor discipline, to
 encourage productivity and extended hours of "voluntary" labor, to hold down labor
 costs, and to conserve raw materials. However, some CTC organizations have served
 as debating forums for a narrow range of labor issues, such as safety or working
 conditions.
 Despite Cuban disclaimers in international forums, independent unions are ex-
 plicitly prohibited. In 1992 the International Labor Organization (ILO) concluded
 that independent unions "do not appear to exist" and ruled that Cuba violated ILO
 norms on freedom of association and the right to organize. In May the ILO Govern-
 ing Body rejected the arguments of the Justice Ministry for failing to reply to the
 General Union of Cuban Workers' (UGTC) request for registration and legal recogni-
 tion and requested the Government to make an immediate pronouncement on reg-
 istration.
 Those who attempt to engage in union activities face government persecution and
 harassment. In February state security officials again arrested Rafael Gutierrez
 Santos, president of the fledgling independent trade union USTC, and detained him
 without making formal charges. He was released in August, pending trial. In Feb-
 ruary police raided the home of independent unionist Juan Guarino during a meet-
 ing of the National Council of Independent Unions. After searching the house for
 7 hours, police confiscated union materials and newspapers and then arrested eight
 union members, telling them they would be "crushed like cockroaches" if they con-
 tinued their union activities. They were released several hours later. In March po-
 lice arrested UGTC executive member Roberto Trobajo and detained him for a week
 due to his union activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. Because the CTC is a government instrument, antiunion dis-
 crimination is only relevant as it applies to government repression of attempts to
 form independent unions. There are no known export processing zones in Cuba.
 
 
 The Government in September relegalized self-employment which had been abol-
 ished in 1968, by allowing people to apply for licenses to work in over 100 different
 occupations, from hairdresser to muleteer. However, the regulations exclude univer-
 sity graduates, employees in sectors determined to be government priorities, or any
 state employee whose work is ruled necessary. They also exclude those who do not
 show proper 'labor discipline" (a category which inc udes dissidents), among others.
 Furthermore, permission to work outside the state sector can be revoked if the State
 decides the worker's services are again needed.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains "correctional centers"
 where people are sent for crimes such as illegal departure. They are forced to work
 on farms or buil dininadequate food. Internees who
 do not cooperate are ofen imprisoned.
 Special groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan from other jobs, are
 employed on special building projects. They have increased importance in the Gov-
 ernment's efforts to complete tourist and other facilities that have priority attention.
 Workers who refuse to volunteer for these often risk discrimination or loss of their
 jobs. Microbrigade workers, however, are reportedly rewarded with priority listing
 for apartments, a strong incentive for such work.
 The ILO's Committee of Experts criticized Cuba for violating ILO Convention 29
 (Forced Labor) based on allegations in a report by the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) that "voluntary labor is, in practice, forced labor
 under the terms of the Convention, since refusal to do such labor results in the loss
 of certain rights, benefits, and privileges." In response, the State Labor Committee
 in January repealed a 1980 resolution, thereby eliminating merits and demerits
 from workers' labor records. In June the ILO conference committee expressed hope
 that this marked the first step toward complete elimination of any form of coercion
 involved in voluntary labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 17. The Labor Code exempts 15- and 16-year-olds to let them obtain training or
 fill labor shortages. However, students over age 11 are expected to devote 30-45
 days of their summer holiday to farm work up to 8 hours per day. "Voluntary labor"
 by student work brigades is still used extensively in the farming sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is supplemented by free
 medical care and education and subsidized housing and food. Even with these sub-
 sidies, however, a worker must earn far more than the average wage to support a
 family. The minimum wage is less than $200 (200 pesos) per month (which is about
 $3 at the black market rate). Moreover, most basic necessities, like food, medicine,
 clothing, and cooking gas, are rationed and in very short supply, if available at all.
 This has worsened dramatically in the past 3 years.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions such as mining. To save energy, the Government reduced workdays to 5 hours
 in many institutions. Worker safety and pollution control provisions are usually in-
 adequate. Effective control and enforcement mechanisms to ensure worker safety
 are lacking. Industrial accidents apparently are frequent.
