 BULGARIA
 Human rights in Bulgaria are decisively and profoundly
 influenced by the country's communist political system with
 its almost total control in the social, economic, and
 cultural as well as political fields. A relatively small
 communist party elite holds political power, claiming to be
 a 'dictatorship of the proletariat" according to the tenets
 of Marxism-Leninism. The post-war economy has
 traditionally been patterned on the Soviet Union's highly
 centralized command economy, although in the last few years
 Bulgaria's leadership has been experimenting with some
 decentralization of economic decision-making. While still
 a large producer of agricultural goods, Bulgaria has also
 made strides in industrial development.
 While there does not seem to be any widespread pattern of
 physical oppression and brutality by the Government, the
 rulers have not given the population any measure of civil
 or political liberties. Because of the lack of an
 organized dissident movement or openly expressed
 disagreement with the party line, the Government generally
 has not needed to exercise its control in any obvious tests
 of power. Instead, in order to maintain social control,
 the Government has been able to rely on the people's
 memories stretching back 20 or 25 years to a time when the
 Government was more openly repressive than it is now. The
 Government's present style of keeping the population in
 line affects the life of every Bulgarian citizen directly
 every day.
 There have been no changes in the state of human rights in
 Bulgaria during the last five to ten years. Although the
 Government has tried to show a more liberal face to its
 population and the West in recent years, especially by
 allowing expanded, though carefully controlled, access to
 Western cultural life through films and books, as well as
 cultural agreements such as the two-year program document
 recently agreed upon with the US, the human rights
 situation in Bulgaria has basically remained unchanged.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no known incidents within Bulgaria of
 politically motivated killing by the Goverment. There are
 no known organized opposition groups in Bulgaria. Although
 Bulgarians are generally not the victims of terrorists, the
 Bulgarian Government reportedly aids some international
 terrorist organizations. Bulgaria makes no secret of its
 support of "National Liberation Movements', including the
 provision of training and arms. Despite continued press
 reporting regarding Bulgarian involvement in terrorism,
 there was no conclusive demonstration of Bulgarian
 Government involvement in any individual terrorist act
 during 1982.
 
 
 853
 b. Disappearance
 There have been repeated reports over the years that
 persons have been held clandestinely for limited periods by
 the Bulgarian state security organs. However, few details
 are available regarding individual cases, and there are no
 recent reports of disappeared persons.
 c. Torture
 The use of torture and 'coercive measures' are forbidden by
 of the Bulgarian Penal Procedures Code. A number of
 ex-prisoners have indicated that while conditions are often
 primitive, there is no pattern of deliberate mistreatment
 or torture. (See d. below.) Amnesty International has
 expressed concern about reports it has received concerning
 the treatment of political prisoners in Sofia. According
 to these reports, prisoners have been subjected to severe
 psychological and sometimes physical pressure while
 detained for preliminary investigation.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been reports of severe prison conditions in
 Bulgaria, particularly for those persons sentenced to hard
 labor. Prisons are said to be crowded, and appear drafty
 and shabby. Visits by family and friends are allowed on a
 monthly basis for all but political prisoners, i.e. those
 sentenced for espionage or anti-government activity. It is
 not known whether international organizations interested in
 prisoner welfare have received access to detainees,
 although several are reported to have made inquires
 regarding such access.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Pulgarian Government does not officially recognize the
 existence of political prisoners in the Bulgarian penal
 system. However, Amnesty International has in recent years
 expressed concern about Bulgarians whom it believes to be
 political prisoners. The principle of habeas corpus exists
 under the Bulgarian criminal code. It is followed in
 practice in all but a few cases the Governmbnt considers
 politically sensitive. The law provides for "preliminary
 detention' in cases where evidence indicates some
 justification for a later indictment, although the law
 states that there will be a 10 day limit on such
 detentions. The accused can wait for formal indictment for
 up to six months, provided charges have been made.  In all
 cases, the accused must be informed of the charges pending
 against him. However, these procedural safeguards are
 often violated substantively, if not technically, by the
 Bulgarian authorities. (See f. below.)
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public
 trials in criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel, but only after a preliminary investigation,
 
 
 854
 sometimes lasting many weeks, has been completed and an
 indictment prepared. In the meantime, the accused may be
 detained without access to counsel. When legal counsel is
 finally available to the accused, it is usually chosen and
 most probably influenced by the Government. There are
 special court procedures for cases involving what the
 Government regards as state security.  A trial may be held
 in camera to preserve a state secret or to protect
 *socialist morality.'
 Generally, the Bulgarian Penal System follows the letter of
 the law. A basic problem, however, is that while the laws
 themselves are codified and published, numerous procedural
 and administrative regulations are not. Frequently, such
 regulations, most of which are not published, are invoked
 seemingly arbitrarily. The defendant and his counsel have
 little recourse, since the validity or applicability of the
 regulation in question cannot easily be verified. These
 procedural regulations play a central role in the judicial
 system and enable the Government and its prosecutors to
 manipulate the circumstances and outcome of trials.
 Therefore, total party and executive branch control over
 the legal process rather than an independent judicial
 system is the rule.
 g. Invasion of the Rome
 By law the sanctity of the home is safeguarded. Police
 authorities may search property legally only with prior
 permission from a responsible court or prosecutor. Such
 searches may, however, be legally undertaken in urgent
 cases prior to approval by judical authorities. Some
 Bulgarian citizens who have attracted the government's
 attention because of frequent unauthorized contacts with
 foreigners or applications for emigration or travel abroad
 assume that their homes or telephones are *bugged'.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Bulgarian Constitution of 1971 guarantees certain basic
 rights including speech, press, association and
 demonstration, and privacy of correspondence and
 communication, except in cases of national emergency. In
 practice, these freedoms are circumscribed to varying
 degrees, and they are not'permitted to be exercised in any
 way that might weaken communist party control.
 Consequently, genuine political freedom does not exist.
 The state controls the press, decides which political
 organizations may exist, and determines which political
 demonstrations may take place. Laws severely punish anyone
 accused of "founding an illegal anti-state organization'
 and criticizing the state (articles 108,109, 113 of the
 Bulgarian Penal Code.) Article.273 proscribes the
 dissemination of 'untruthful remarks which might increase
 mistrust of state power or cause confusion in society'.
 The divulging of economic information, such as the size of
 the foreign debt, is illegal and subject to severe
 penalties.
 
 
 855
 Domestic opposition to the state or party is not tolerated;
 if found, it is dealt-with promptly and severely with
 prison sentences. The state security (Durzhavna Sigurnost)
 authorities are instrumental in uncovering and overseeing
 the punishment of those citizens accused of such anti-state
 and anti-party activities. The public is permitted to send
 criticism, suggestions, and complaints by letter to
 newspapers and to national assembly representatives on a
 broad range of topics such as inadequate service from
 public agencies and housing shortages. Nonetheless,
 published letters generally do not go beyond criticism of
 specific economic or services shortfalls, or failures of
 individuals in government administration. None deals with
 fundamental questions of how society, the economy, or the
 nation's political life are structured. Thus the state
 allows open, albeit strictly limited, criticism to take
 place, and evidently seeks to investigate complaints and
 respond to them. It also appears to manipulate this
 criticism, for example publicizing more of it before ma or
 events (such as the party congresses), possibly to justify
 shifts in government personnel and to present a liberal,
 responsive image.
 Although censorship does not exist officially, the media
 must operate within well-understood party and state
 guidelines and practices (e.g. international news is
 usually limited to that provided by the government news
 agency or official Soviet sources.) Forbidden topics in
 the Bulgarian press include unauthorized criticism of party
 and state leaders, of socialist ideology, and of the USSR
 and other socialist countries. Opposition views have not
 been aired since 1947, when the last independent newspapers
 were taken over by the state.
 The Bulgarian service of the Federal Republic of Germany's
 Deutsche Welle, of Radio Free Europe, the Voice of America,
 and the DEC are jammed with uneven effect. Bulgaria does
 not permit the open sale of Western periodicals except for
 occasional very small numbers of newspapers sold in hotels
 frequented primarily by foreigners. Mail from Western
 countries is periodically screened, and items found
 offensive to the state and pornographic materials are
 confiscated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In practice freedom of assembly is a right granted only to
 legally-constituted organizations and only for approved
 purposes. Public assemblies are never spontaneous affairs,
 but rather party-or government-organized to achieve a
 particular purpose. There are no independent trade unions
 in Bulgaria, and workers are not free to negotiate or
 strike for better pay or work conditions. An active trade
 union movement exists, but totally within the party/state
 framework. Unions do not have the rights to strike, to
 bargain collectively, to lobby, or to assemble freely.
 Their functions are to look after the social welfare of
 their members and to work to Increase the quantity and
 quality of production. Nearly all trades, industries, and
 professions have government directed union organizations,
 including lawyers, artists, composers, writers, and
 
 
 856
 academics. Many such *labor" organizations, especially in
 the professions, have frequent contact with foreign, even
 Western, counterparts. Foreign travel by professionals is
 usually arranged through these organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion may be practiced, within limits, by believers in
 denominations recognized by the Government, especially the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church. However, being a church member
 or being active in religious affairs has a decidedly
 negative effect on admission to higher government and party
 positions. Amnesty International has reported that Muslim
 believers in Bulgaria, both members of the Turkish minority
 and ethnic Bulgarians (Pomaks), have been persecuted and
 imprisoned because of religious activities or their ethnic
 backgrounds. Reportedly the Government pressures Pomaks to
 renounce at least outwardly Muslim ways by denying official
 documents (records of birth, marriage, diplomas, etc.)
 unless they adopt Slavic names, rather than the Muslim and
 Turkish names they apparently prefer. There have also been
 reports that members of Pentecostal sects have been
 punished by the Government for religous activities.
 Recently new restrictions were placed on Bulgarian Roman
 Catholics. In addition, the Government is quite sensitive
 to unauthorized evangelical missionary activities,
 particularly those undertaken, or supported, by foreign
 religious organizations.
 Although theoretically there is separation of church and
 state, the Government and the party exert very strong
 influences over the Orthodox Church. The state uses the
 overwhelmingly-predominant Orthodox Church to support its
 policies in areas where the objectives of the church
 coincide with those of the state, e.g. propaganda for peace
 and (Western) disarmament. In general, the Government of
 Bulgaria supports the 'historical/cultural' role of the
 Orthodox Church, while discouraging indirectly the practice
 and propagation of the faith. The Government closely
 monitors and circumscribes organized religion in Bulgaria
 through numerous control mechanisms, e.g. the importation
 of Bibles, and the distribution of religious publications
 other than those of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The
 inadequate supply of Bibles and the prohibition on their
 importation have been sources of conflict between the
 Government and believers who have attempted to bring or
 send Bibles to Bulgaria. According to church officials a
 new Bulgarian Orthodox Bible, long planned, and supposedly
 *suitable* for other denominations, including Judaism, will
 soon be published. The state allows the Bulgarian Orthodox
 Church certain privileges in addition to that of publishing
 the authorized Bible. These include the operation of a
 seminary and the sale of authorized publications and
 religious artifacts.
 The Government has also taken some measures to preserve and
 protect the practice of Judaism. Jewish cultural, social,
 and religious institutions receive financial support from
 the state. There are no rabbis, and religious schools are
 not permitted. In general, Jewish organizations stressing
 ethnicity rather than religion are given a freer reign and
 a larger government subsidy than religious assemblies.
 
 
 857
 The Government allows all recognized religions to hold
 church services and to take up collections at these
 services. Religious instruction for youth is extremely
 limited, although children and young adults frequently
 attend services with their parents and grandparents. In
 addition to Bulgarian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Uniate,
 Congregational, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Seventh
 Day Adventist, Armenian, and Islamic religious
 organizations also are represented in Bulgaria within the
 limited scope they are allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, within Bulgaria and in exiting the
 country, is neither guaranteed under law nor respected in
 practice. Within the country, Bulgarians may normally
 visit freely all areas except certain designated border
 zones. Bulgarians must carry internal passports, however,
 and inform police of their destination. In 1961 new laws
 and administrative procedures were put into practice to
 streamline and perfect the internal passport and domestic
 registration systems. The Government strictly controls the
 right to change residence within the country, especially
 restricting residence in Sofia and other major cities.
 Travel by Bulgarian citizens to other East European
 countries is somewhat limited, and travel to the West is
 severely restricted. A citizen's application for an exit
 document may be refused for several reasons, but most often
 because travel is deemed *not in the interests of the
 state.'   Applications to visit the West are processed
 arbitrarily, especially when the applicant wishes to visit
 a relative who left Bulgaria without the permission of the
 Government.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but rarely permitted.
 In such cases, however, citizenship is almost never
 revoked. A few intending emigrants are subjected to overt
 government persecution. Improvements in everyday life,
 duch as promotions, new jobs, and educational
 opportunities, usually are not given to intending
 emigrants, even if the state approves their departure.
 There are reports of loss of jobs by applicants for
 emigration. Those emigrating within five years after
 completion of higher education are often required to pay
 the Government for part of the cost of education. The
 Bulgarian Constitution grants the right of asylum to
 foreigners persecuted for actions, such as *defending the
 interests of the working class," which have a strong
 Marxist flavor. Bulgaria has cooperated in the past 35
 years in the permitting the emigration of Turks and Jews.
 Approximately 150 Bulgarians refugees annually request
 admission to the United states, and the total number of
 Bulgarians fleeing to Western Europe annually is probably
 considerably higher than this number. Bulgaria insists on
 forced repatriation of citizens caught in other communist
 countries attempting to flee to the West. In July 1981 the
 Bulgarian National Assembly passed a new law granting
 amnesty to all those who had fled the country and returning
 before the end of 1983, but few Bulgarians apparently have
 accepted this offer.
 
 
 858
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Bulgarian government and society are organized along
 standard communist lines. The Bulgarian constitution calls
 the communist party the *leading force in the society and
 in the state.' With one of the larger per capita
 memberships of any communist country (over eight percent of
 the population), the party is thoroughly dominated by a
 smaller group which controls policy. Rank and file members
 of the party hold no genuine political power. Political
 pluralism and free participation in the political process
 are essentially non-existent. When Bulgarians are
 confronted with arbitrary, unjust, or illegal actions by
 the state they have no sure means of redress. The
 Bulgarian Constitution and various implementing laws embody
 the Government's intent to achieve for absolute political
 control, while maintaining at least the appearance of
 pluralism. Bulgaria describes its political system as a
 two-party system composed of the Bulgarian communist party
 and the cc-opted rump of the Bulgarian Agrarian union.
 These two parties, together with labor, youth, and other
 organizations, comprise the Fatherland Front, an umbrella
 organization of communist and non-communist 'progressive'
 elements established in IS42. In practice, however, the
 Fatherland Front as well as its various organizations are
 all ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, to which
 Article 1(3) of the Constitution gives clear primacy. The
 Agrarian Party runs separate candidates, and holds about
 one-fourth of the seats in the National Assembly, but
 candidacies are worked out jointly with the Communist Party
 in advance. Candidates of the two parties do not run
 against one another, nor do they face any other
 opposition. Real opposition parties have remained
 effectively outlawed since the 1S40's. From time to time
 the Bulgarian press announces election results in which it
 is claimed that more than 99 percent of the population has
 participated in affirming the position of the party and
 Government by voting in these *elections' without
 opposition candidates. To varying, but always limited
 degrees, organizations such as labor unions, professional
 associations, elements of the Fatherland Front, the
 Communist Party itself, and a new draft law on "referenda',
 are supposed to serve as mechanisms for the transmission of
 citizens' views upwards, and as fora for dialogue.
 However, with total power over these channels of influence,
 and control of the news media, the Party and Government
 have no difficulty controlling the dialogue and using these
 exchanges to maintain the system and improve its everyday
 adminstration.
 Women officially have equal rights with men and their
 status has steadily improved in recent years. A National
 Women's Committee produces a monthly publication and
 otherwise takes an active role in promoting women's
 interests. Women are under-represented in the highest
 decision-making bodies of the Government and party,
 however. Only one of the eleven full Politburo members is
 a woman, and the three candidate-members are all men.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations of
 Human Rights
 
 
 859
 Although Bulgaria has participated in all of the sessions
 of the Madrid Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe follow-up meeting discussing human rights, the
 Government has consistently supported the Soviet position
 of accusing the West of interfering in internal matters by
 attempting to discuss human rights. The Bulgarian human
 rights record has been the subject of Amnesty
 International's repeated investigations and the
 organization has regularly published the results of its
 investigations. Bulgaria has not admitted any independent
 group to investigate questions of human rights violations,
 however, and has not responded.to allegations from
 international human rights groups. Freedom House called
 Pukgaria 'Not Free' in 1982.
 There are no government or private organizations in
 Bulgaria which attempt to protect individual liberties or
 observe and report on human rights violations.
 4. Economic, Social, and.Cultural Situation
 Bulgarian society exists within the framework of a
 socialist economy with the emphasis on state planning and
 control of all significant means of production.
 The Government is experimenting with new and somewhat more
 liberal approaches to~the management of the economy,
 probably more superficial than real. The Bulgarian
 Government claims an economic growth rate of 5.7 percent
 for national.income in 1980. All citizens are guaranteed a
 job, and officially there is no unemployment, although in
 practice under-employment is widespread. The per capita
 GNP in 1981 was $2669 and the average monthly salary of
 about 200 leva ($210 at the official exchange rate) allows
 Bulgarians an adequate, if frugal, existence, particularly
 in light of low rents, inexpensive public transportation,
 and low-priced basic food products.
 Basic economic and social needs are generally met on a
 non-discriminatory basis. Although Bulgaria has poor
 people, there are not great disparities between poverty and
 wealth. Success in the government or party confers
 privileges rather than wealth. Most taxes are included in
 the price of goods, and necessities (basic food items,
 transportation, and housing) are state-subsidized. There
 are limits on private property ownership. A person can own
 his own home, a country villa, a car, a small number of
 livestock, and a small plot of land normally not exceeding
 2.5 acres. In practice, few people can afford most of
 these luxuries. Bulgaria's leaders are concerned about the
 country's low population growth rate of 0.5 percent in 1960
 and have established financial incentives for families to
 have children. Life expectancy at birth is 72.6 years
 (1980) and the infant mortality rate per 1000 live births
 is 19.9 (1980). Medical care is free, and 1978 government
 statistics show one doctor for every 432 citizens, and 86
 hospitals beds per 10,000 citizens. The percent of calorie
 supply available for consumption as a percentage of total
 domestic nutritional requirements is 144 percent (1977),
 one of the highest in the world. Extensive construction of
 new public apartment buildings in the past decade has
 
 
 860
 improved the general housing situation. Shortages
 continue, however, and Bulgarians still wait years for a
 new apartment.
 Education is free through the university level, with a
 general system of merit selection for university
 admission. Certain priorities and privileges go to the
 children of the influential, however. Adult literacy is
 high (90 percent in IS70). The primary school enrollment
 ratio in 1979 was 96 percent. Bulgarian educational and
 professional opportunities are not discriminatory against
 women.  one half of the openings for university students
 available each year are reserved by law for women, who
 consequently are well represented in some of the more
 prestigious professions such as medicine, although only at
 lower levels Women continue to be overrepresented in
 manual occupations in areas such as farming, light
 industry, and cleaning and maintenance, however.
