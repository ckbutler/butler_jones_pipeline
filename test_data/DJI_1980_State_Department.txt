 DJIBOUTI
 The Republic of Djibouti has been independent since
 1977. It has a population of only about 330,000, and is
 underdeveloped economically and administratively.
 Djibouti's legal traditions include the Napoleonic code
 and the (Koran-based) Sharia. Pre-independence laws and
 decrees are still in effect except where amended speci-
 fically. Djibouti's fragile economy depends heavily on
 foreign presence and assistance and has been buffetted
 by regional wars and instability which have stimulated a
 flow of Ethiopians into Djibouti.
 Politically the country is divided among the majority
 ethnic Somalis, who in turn are subdivided into clans
 and fractions thereof; a substantial minority of Afars
 who have lost their previous position of dominance and
 now fear permanent exclusion from power; and Arabs, who
 are mainly Yemenis.
 Nominally, political power is shared by an arrangement
 in which the president is Somali and the premier an
 Afar, with cabinet positions roughly divided. There is
 as yet no constitution, and no consensus on the division
 of power between president and premier, the executive
 and the national assembly, or Somalia, Afars, and Arabs.
 Afar leaders, and some others, feel that real power is
 in the hands of the Somalis of the Issa clan, who
 increasingly control the government, the civil service,
 the armed forces, and the new single party, leaving no
 way for others to be assured of a fair share of power.
 In 1977 through 1979 there were seven terrorist incidents
 led by Afars from Ethiopia, and after each of these the
 rounding-up and questioning of witnesses and suspects
 has given rise to opposition charges of torture and
 other human rights violations. In 1980, however,
 Djibouti was not the subject of allegations of gross
 violations of human rights. But the institutions which
 would protect and advance human rights have not been
 firmly established, making the future uncertain.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No allegations of torture during 1980 have been received,
 although there have been well-documented cases in the
 recent past. An Amnesty International delegate visited
 Djibouti on government invitation to investigate charges
 of torture, and deaths resulting from torture. The
 report notes that the delegate received confirmation
 from victims, witnesses and physicians of the systematic
 pattern of torture in all security or politically-
 motivated incidents as well as in many non-political
 cases. In January 1980, the delegate met with President
 Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who formally assured the delegate
 that he, the president, would undertake to eliminate the
 use of torture.
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 There have been no known allegations of cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment in 1980. Prison
 conditions are said to be adequate: family members and
 counsel are permitted access, and public health and
 medical services supervise health conditions. The Amnesty
 International report for 1980 notes that legal safeguards
 against torture such as access to a doctor or lawyer
 were ineffective.
 c. Disappearances
 No allegations of disappearances are known to have
 been made.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The current system of justice has been carried over from
 the French colonial period, and is a mixture of French
 and Muslim practice. There is no habeas corpus and
 preventive detention is permitted, but prosecutors are
 required to, and generally do, file charges in expedient
 fashion. No allegations of arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment during 1980 are known to have been made, although
 the Amnesty International Report 1980 notes that many
 apparently arbitrary arrests had been made in 1979.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the state security court, which was established
 to deal with crimes against the security of the state,
 and ordinary civil and criminal courts permit family
 members and counsel, though not the general public, to
 be present during trials. The judiciary is independent.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 No allegations of warrantless searches or other official
 violations of the home in 1980 are known to have been
 made.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 At independence Djibouti had a low level of development.
 According to estimates of varying reliability the annual
 per capita gross national product was $363, with
 60 percent (nomads and unemployed) below $200, and the
 bottom 20 percent receiving only 1.5 percent of the gross
 national product (GNP). Foreign nationals, mostly French,
 received about 60 percent of GNP, filled most salaried
 positions and provided most of the government's revenue.
 Only 13.5 percent of the employable population was
 employed full time (of these, 20 percent were women).
 Life expectancy was 50 years and infant mortality
 114 per thousand. Education was free, but the literacy
 
 
 74
 rate was only 13.5 percent and the primary enrollment
 ratio 20 percent (of these students 40 percent were
 girls). The student/teacher ratio was 45/1 and more
 than 90 percent of teachers were foreign nationals.
 There was a major difference in the standard of living
 of Djibouti city and that of the countryside; for
 example, a majority of city people but only 20 percent
 of others had access to clean water, and 22 of Djibouti's
 27 doctors lived in the city. Many rural Djiboutians
 were, however, nomads who were self-supporting.
 Since independence Djibouti has received substantial
 support from the French government which maintains
 forces there to defend the country against external
 attack, and which pays the cost of Djibouti's armed
 forces. Djibouti receives substantial economic assist-
 ance from Arab countries and western Europe. The
 government has sought to use its own funds, as well as
 foreign assistance, to improve health, education,
 and housing and urban development. Primary school
 enrollment has more than doubled since independence, and
 a teacher-traihing college has been established which
 will in time enable Djiboutians to replace foreign
 teachers. Primary health care has been expanded; the
 number of dispensaries has increased, and within these
 dispensaries maternal and child health units are beginning
 to improve health care and education. With a loan from
 the African Development Fund the capital's water and
 sewage system is being improved. With donor assistance,
 food is being provided to refugees, drought victims, and
 other needy people. A fisherman's cooperative is
 providing some employment and improved diets.
 Projects to analyze Djibouti's resources in soils
 and water, energy, and manpower are underway, and
 there are plans for a cement plant, a tannery, and a
 hotel, as well as a renovation of the port which is
 Djibouti's principal economic asset. Nonetheless,
 progress has been minimal and, in per capita terms,
 negative due to the inflow of some 40,000 Ethiopians
 fleeing their country. The cutoff of the Djibouti-
 Addis Ababa railway by the war in 1977-78 greatly
 reduced Djibouti's main economic activities. Since then
 Ethiopia has been developing its own port of Assab, and
 the road between Assab and Addis Ababa, as an alternative
 to reliance on Djibouti. Moreover, a lack of skilled ad-
 ministrators within Djiboutis bureaucracy has
 made it difficult to plan projects to make use of
 offers of foreign assistance, or to coordinate
 such assistance to the country's best advantage.
 In Djibouti the right to own property is respected.
 Those who have employment work in tolerable condi-
 tions, earn wages sufficient to provide a minimal
 standard of living for their families, and enjoy the
 benefits of a government-sponsored pension system.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 
 
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Local media are government-owned, support the government
 and its policies, and criticize the shortcomings of
 local institutions. Public meetings require a permit
 which may be denied for security reasons. The right of
 labor to organize is respected and scattered strikes
 have occurred. The government has organized a national
 union under its control. Freedom of religion is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Djiboutians have and exercise the right to travel
 freely within, and leave and return to, Djibouti.
 Passports are available but reportedly bribes are
 required sometimes to expedite paperwork.
 Djibouti is host to some 40,000 Ethiopian refugees
 who have fled their homeland. The government does not
 force these people to return to Ethiopia, but is working
 with the Ethiopian government and the United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) on a program of
 voluntary repatriation. Djibouti permits the UNHCR and
 other donors to feed and shelter these people near the
 frontier, but classifies less than half of them as
 refugees. The government is unwilling, because of its
 limited resources, to permit them to resettle permanently
 or work in Djibouti. Djibouti cooperates fully with
 international relief and resettlement efforts.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In 1977 Djiboutians voted for independence and for a
 single-list territorial assembly which became a national
 assembly upon independence and remains Djibouti's most
 representative institution. New assembly elections and
 a constitution are promised for 1982 but few specifics
 are known. The government has created a single party in
 its own image, but has not banned other parties except
 for the Djibouti Liberation Movement which was charged
 with having a role in terrorist bombings in 1977. The
 minority Afars and certain other critics complain that
 the country is run by and for the Somali Issas, who
 increasingly dominate the government, the civil service,
 the armed forces, and the single party. These critics
 say there is no democratic or non-violent way to assure
 non-Issas a fair share of power and the benefits of
 government.
 Women have the same civil and political rights as
 men, but none are in the cabinet or national assembly,
 and only a few are in high administrative positions.
 Most women have undergone circumcision. The government
 has sponsored a campaign against the practice.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investiga-
 tion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 
 
 76
 On three occasions since independence, most recently in
 the summer of 1979, there have been foreign press reports
 alleging human rights violations by the government in the
 course of roundups and questioning of suspects and wit-
 nesses following terrorist incidents. On each occasion
 the government has complied with outside requests for
 information. The internal critics who have made the
 charges, notably former Prime Minister Ahmed Dini Ahmed,
 have not been arrested or otherwise harassed. In January
 1980 Amnesty International visited Djibouti at the govern-
 ment's invitation to investigate these allegations.
 Amnesty International's delegate met with President Hassan
 Gouled Aptidon and other government officials, raised
 earlier allegations of torture and other human rights
 violations, and interviewed several detainees awaiting
 trial in Gabote and Dikhil prisons. He later submitted a
 report to the government recommending the implementation
 of the articles of the United Nations Declaration on the
 Protection of all Persons from Torture, and calling for
 improvements in the protection of legal rights and an end
 to arbitrary arrests alleged to have taken place before
 1980. The President, as previously noted, formally
 assured the Amnesty International delegate that he would
 undertake to eliminate the practice of torture.
