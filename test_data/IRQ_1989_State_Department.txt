 IMAQ
 Iraq is in effect a one-party state governed by the Arab
 Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) through a Revolutionary Command
 Council (RCC) which has both executive and legislative
 authority under the provisional Constitution of 1968. Saddam
 Hussein holds decisive power as President of the Republic,
 Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary-General of the Regional
 Command of the ABSP. Two other small parties are essentially
 support groups for the Government. In 1989 the Government
 announced its intention to adopt a multiparty system enshrined
 in a new constitution. Elections for the National-Assembly--
 which has few powers--were held April 1. A draft constitution
 which would reportedly allow a multiparty system was completed
 in 1989 and is expected to be put to a referendum in early
 1990. It remains to be seen, however, whether this will
 dilute the monopoly of power held by Saddam Hussein and the
 ABSP. Iraq's population comprises many disparate groups, most
 notably Shila and Sunni Muslim Arabs, Kurds, Turcomans, and
 various Christian sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans.
 Iraq's military is large and well trained, and parts of it,
 notably the Fursan, or Kurdish tribal levies, have
 responsibility for security within the Kurdish autonomous
 region. The National Police is responsible for civil order.
 The Government exerts a high degree of control over the
 economy, dominated by the petroleum sector, and owns all major
 industries. The Government. has been carrying out a program of
 divestiture and privatization in agriculture, tourism,
 services, and light industry, and is trying to attract
 investor capital and expertise in the operation of the
 economy. However, close government regulation of economic
 activity is expected to continue.
 Iraq's human rights record remained abysmal in 1989.
 Effective opposition tq government policy is stifled; the
 intelligence services engage in extensive surveillance and
 utilize extralegal means, including torture and summary
 execution, to deal with antiregime activity. The civil rights
 of Iraqi citizens continue to be sharply limited, and Iraqis
 do not have the right to change theii government. The
 freedoms of speech and press and of assembly and association
 are virtually nonexistent; Other important human rights
 problems include continuing disappearances and arbitrary
 detentions, lack of fair trial, widespread interference with
 privacy, excessive use of force against Kurdish civilians, and
 an almost total lack of worker rights. In addition to the
 repressive~domesti-c controls that predate the war with Iran,-
 tight- wartime controls, including travel restrictions, remain
 in effect despite the August 1988 cease-fire with Iran.
 An armed Kurdish insurgency continued in 1989, but at a
 reduced level. Although there were no allegations that the
 Government used chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians in
 1989, as it did in 1988, in its efforts to crush the
 rebellion, it continued to violate the human rights of
 elements of the Kurdish population. The Government annoVnced
 in June that in its campaign to suppress the rebellion it has
 pursued a program since 1987.of establishing a depopulated
 security zone along the full length of Iraq's borders with
 Iran and Turkey. Under this program, the Government has
 destroyed villages within a 30-kilometer-wide zone and
 relocated approximately 500,000 Kurdish and Assyrian
 inhabitants into more easily controlled and protected towns,

 cities, and newly constructed settlements in traditional
 Kurdish. areas.
 RESPECT FOR HU14AN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 -a. ,Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 For years execution has been an established Iraqi method for
 dealing with perceived political and military opponents of the
 goyvrnment,--including, but not limited to, members of the
 outlawed.Da'wa organization (an Iransupported fundamentalist
 Shi'a Muslim group that has engaged.in acts of international
 terrorism). In some cases,.a family only learns that one of
 its-members has been executed when the, security services
 return the body and require the family to pay a fine.
 Amnesty International (AI), in its presentation before the
 U.N. Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities in August, stated that it had
 received allegations-that some 80 army deserters were executed
 in December,1988 and charged that the Government executed 11
 of its Kurdish opponents in March and April 1989.
 In its February report, "Iraq: Children: Innocent Victims of
 Political Repression," AI stated that itireceives allegatiohs
 of hundreds of.executions in Iraq each year. Al cited the
 case of 29oKurdish children and youths-allegedly executed in
 January 1987., In addition, AI, in its.1989 Report covering
 1988,-cited allegations that hundreds of civilians, including
 women and children, were executed at Tanjaro Military
 Garrison, Sulaimaniya province. Independent information to
 confirm the allegations cited in-AI reports is not available.
 b. Disappearance
 In the February report,-AIasserted that thousands of people
 arrested over the years, by Iraqi security or intelligence
 forces reportedly have "disappeared" while in detention, with
 many feaied executed. In its August presentation to the U.N.
 Subcommission, AI reported- the disappearance in mid-April of
 Mulla Muhammad Dalgayi, described as the imam of Qal~at Diza,
 who was among delegates from Kurdistan who reportedly met with
 government officials to appeal against forced settlement of
 the Kurds-at Qal'at Diza. He was reportedly arrested in
 Baghdad And has since disappeared. An Assyrian organization
 based in the-United States charged in March that the
 whereabouts of 33 Assyrians, who took advantage of the amnesty
 issued by the Government and returned to Iraq from Iran and
 Turkey, were unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes-stiff
 punishment for it, but it-is clear that both physical and
 psychological torture are used by the authorities, especially
 the security police. Given the rigid chain of command within
 the Government and the security services, torture could not be
 practiced without the knowledge or authorization of senior
 officials.
 
 
 1413
 IRAQ
 Emigre groups and former prisoners assert that persons
 detained by the security police for political or
 security-related matters are frequently tortured and
 mistreated. Treatment is reported to be worst immediately
 following arrest and during the period of interrogation and
 investigation, which can last for months. Torture and brutal,
 treatment are not limited to political cases.
 Security-related offenses are broadly defined and include such
 routine criminal matters as currency violations.
 In its 1989 Report, AI stated that the routine torture and
 ill-treatment of prisoners continued to be widely reported.
 It said the victims included detainees below the age of 18 who
 were reportedly beaten, whipped, given electric shocks, and
 deprived of food. The Government categorically denied any use
 of torture against children as an official policy or as a
 practice, and stated its readiness to consider fully any
 individual allegation with a view to bringing perpetrators to
 justice. Impartial observers have so far been unable to look
 into these allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 While the Constitution and legal code provide for the rights
 of citizens and place checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search, these provisions
 have virtually no weight in political or national security
 cases, although they are generally respected in ordinary
 criminal cases. Security police not only make arbitrary
 arrests but also secretly detain suspects, whose fate
 sometimes becomes known only after they have been executed.
 Security charges have included espionage, treason, and
 conspiracy against Iraq, often in collaboration with unnamed
 foreign enemies.
 The relocation of 500,000 Kurdish villagers to other areas of
 Kurdistan since 1987 may be considered a form of internal
 exile. The Government declared in June 1989 that it was
 creating an uninhabited security zone to ensure the safety and
 security of citizens in the border regions (who were subjected
 to shelling and military operations during the war with Iran)
 and to provide better services to the villagers.
 Although the Government has ceased expelling Iraqis of
 supposed Iranian descent, most of the few remaining Iranians
 have been .imprisoned or live under the fear of deportation or
 incarceration. Spouses of Iraqis of Iranian origin are
 required to obtain a divorce or suffer the same consequences.
 Moreover, other Iraqis, whose grandparents are shown not to be.
 of Iraqi origio, are subject to arbitrary detention and
 deportation.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Iraq's legal system provides for investigation by police and
 then by an inquiry judge who may refer a case to the courts or
 dismiss it. Judges try criminal cases; there are no juries.
 Convictions may be appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to
 the Court of Cassation, the supreme court. There are no
 Shari'a courts per se in Iraq; however, family courts
 administer Shari'a law modified by Iraqi custom.
 
 
 1414
 Trials of ordinary cases are held in civil, criminal, and
 religious courts and are open. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel--at government expense if the defendant is indigent.
 Charges and evidence are available for review by the lawyer.
 Appellate courts hear cases not under the jurisdiction of the
 Revolutionary Courts.
 In contrast to ordinary cases, security cases are handled by
 tpe Revolutionary Courts, which usually hold closed trials.
 Security 6ases include espionage, treason, smuggling, currency
 exchange violations and drug trafficking. The right of
 defense in such courts is said to be severely restricted. The
 "special courts" constituted by the RCC for specific
 incidents,' such as the reported conspiracy against the regime
 in.979, 'are also closed. These special tribunals are
 apparently exempt from constitutional safeguards of
 defendants' rights; defendants are held incommunicado, and
 confessions extracted by torture are admissible. Appeals can
 be taken only to the chairman of the RCC. However, the
 utility of this appeal is questionable, since there are
 reports that executions take place shortly after trial.
 Political dissent in Iraq is taken by the authorities to
 encompass a wide range of activities and, in an environment
 where public acknowledgement of arrest or imprisonment is
 rare, it is extremely difficult to estimate the number of
 politica prisoners.  In its 1989 Report, AI stated that
 "thousands" of political prisoners continued to be arbitrarily
 arrested and detained, especially members of prohibited
 political parties, Army deserters, and draft resisters.
 Relatives, including children of suspects, are said to be held
 as hostages to compel confessions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution.provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home,, pnd strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. However, warrants
 are not required for the arrest of security suspects.
 Although most arrests occur outside the home, there hake been
 reports of forced[qztry and arrest by the security police,
 particularly of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa
 organization.
 Although'-the Constitution provides for the confidentiality of
 mail and .telegraphic and telephone correspondence, many Iraqis
 believe that the monitoring of telephones is a common practice
 and that all mail is subject to review by censors. The
 security services and Ba'ath Party maintain pervasive networks
 of informers. The Government maintains a close watch against
 Iranian attempts to exploit dissatisfaction among Iraqi Shila,
 who adhere to the branch of Islam prevalent in Iran.
 g.' Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Elements of Iraq's Kurdish population have engaged in armed
 struggle with all governments of Iraq periodically since the
 1920's. The outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 sparked a
 new antigovernment insurgency by Kurdish elements, many of
 whom fought with or aided Iran during the war. From 1981 to
 1989, the Government's efforts to crush the rebellion
 militarily resulted in approximately 8,000 deaths, many of
 
 
 1415
 IRAO
 them civilians killed indiscriminately by chemical weapons in
 1988.
 Although the fighting was at a reduced level in 1989, Kurdish
 military operations continued, as did government measures to
 contain them. Kurdish rebels continued to announce their
 hostility towards the central Government. On August 29, 1989,
 the leader of one group of insurgents stated to the press in
 Geneva that his group would target foreign interests in Iraq
 supporting the Iraqi regime. At year's end, the cycle of
 Kurdish rebellion and government repression remained
 unresolved.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and press are not respected. The
 Constitution prohibits "any act aimed at undermining the
 national unity of the people, provoking racial, sectarian, and
 regional bigotry, or violating gains and achievements of the
 country." The Government views political dissent as a threat
 to its security and strictly controls speech and all
 information media. All publications are subject to
 censorship. The Government and the Ba'ath Party own and
 operate the press, radii, and television. The media do not
 criticize the Government, and news reporting is strongly
 biased. There is no presentation of opposition viewpoints.
 Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq and those that do may be
 censored. Western newspapers are not sold. Foreign visitors"
 magazines, newspapers, cassettes, cameras, and video cassettes
 may be confiscated at the airport. To control the
 dissemination of political leaflets, word processors and
 computers must be registered. Failure to register is a
 criminal offense. Iraqis no longer need to register their
 typewriters or photocopiers, but foreigners in Iraq must do
 so. Taking photographs of military installations, government
 buildings, or areas near sensitive locations is forbidden and
 punishable by imprisonment. Journalists and photographers
 visiting Iraq at the invitation of the Government are required
 to present film taken in Iraq for inspection by the
 authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are severely limited. Public meetings may only
 be organized under the auspices of the Government or the
 Ba'ath Party. Association for nonreligious purposes and
 demonstrations without government approval have met with
 severe repression. Professional organizations are subject to
 control by the Balath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. Since
 its rise to power in 1968, the Balath Government, while
 carefully controlling religious groups, has enforced tolerance
 of religious diversity, seeking to submerge religious
 differences in the promotion of secular nationalism. A 1981
 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs the
 authority to promulgate laws and regulations governing places
 
 
 1416
 IRAQ
 of worship, appointment of clergy, publication of religious
 literature, and participation in religious councils and
 meetings. Muslim religious leaders operate under close
 government supervision, are considered government employees,
 and receive their salaries through the Government. The
 Government administers the principal Muslim shrines and
 mosques and has provided allotments to them and to churches
 for maintenance and refurbishing. There are no penalties
 under Iraqi law for changing one's religion, although there is
 a social stigma for Muslims who convert to another faith.
 While the Government has assumed much greater authority in
 Islamic religious affairs since 1981, it has been less
 intrusive into the religious affairs of Iraq's Christians, who
 numbier more than 500,000 and constitute nearly 4 percent of
 the population. Their freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist, and some new
 churches have been constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. The Jewish community has decreased from
 150,000 following World War II to under 400. There is no
 evidence of recent persecution. One synagogue in Baghdad
 still functions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off limits. There are police checkpoints
 on highways and outside major towns, but Iraqis and
 nondiplomatic foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas.
 The Government's harsh campaign to suppress Kurdish rebels,
 involving mass relocations of Kurdish villagers, has nullified
 the right of hundreds of thousands of Kurds to choose their
 place of residence. Since the Government began its program of
 forced relocation in 1987, an estimated 500,000 people have
 been uprooted. Since traditional Kurdish culture has been
 deeply embedded in the rural village, the forced removals and
 razing of villages has had a destructive impact on the lives
 of some half a million Kurds.
 Most foreigners who remain in the country for more than 30
 days and all Iraqis must obtain exit permission. Travel has
 been severely limited since September 1986, when the
 Government imposed tight restrictions on currency exchange.
 These restrictions were eased somewhat in 1989, but the most
 an Iraqi may exchange is 1,000 dinars ($3,220). Because of
 the drain on the economy caused by the war and reconstruction,
 permission to travel abroad is restricted to a few categories
 of Iraqis, including officials, businessmen, goverrnment-
 approved students, and persons needing medical treatment. In
 1989 the Government eased restrictions to permit one parent to
 visit his or her offspring who is studying or working abroad.
 While permission for medical treatment abroad may be granted,
 permission to transfer hard currency abroad to pay for it may
 not be. In cases of those desiring medical treatment in the
 United States, the Government now requires a bond to be posted
 by an American friend or relative with the Iraqi embassy in
 
 
 1417
 IRAO
 Washington before exit permission is granted. The minimum
 amount of this bond is $10,000. The Government sometimes
 limits the countries an Iraqi traveler may visit and, should
 the traveler visit a nonauthorized country, a small fine may
 be levied upon his return. Iraqis who have residences abroad
 may depart the country, provided they originally left before
 the war began. A married woman must have the permission of
 her husband to travel abroad.
 The Government can require a prospective traveler to post a
 substantial bond to assure his return. The RCC decreed in
 1987 that Iraqi students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq
 must reimburse the Government for all education received in
 Iraq or abroad at government expense. The decree is
 applicable retroactively to students who have refused to
 return since May 16, 1983, the date the Government began
 requiring employees leaving government jobs before 20 years of
 service to reimburse the State for the cost of their
 education. Amounts due can be recovered by confiscation;
 nonpayment may result in imprisonment. Each student must
 provide a guarantor before traveling abroad. This guarantor
 and the student's parents may be held liable if the student
 fails to return.
 There is no specific ban on emigration or special restrictions
 for members of minority groups; however, emigration is
 discouraged. For the past several years, almost all of those
 given permission to emigrate have been Christian Iraqi wives
 of former Iraqi citizens now living abroad as citizens of
 another country. Prospective emigrants have had travel
 permission delayed and have been harassed. Many emigrants
 leave behind substantial property because of the difficulty of
 exporting assets. Currency exchange violations are considered
 national security offenses, and penalties can be severe.
 Non-Iraqi spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq
 for 5 years are required to take Iraqi nationality or leave
 Iraq. Many people, including several Americans, have thus
 been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and are therefore
 subject to the present travel restrictions. In March 1984, an
 order by the RCC reduced the residency period before
 naturalization to 1 year for the spouses of Iraqi citizens
 employed in government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces
 -penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a fine of
 approximately $10,000, and repayment of the costs of
 education. Iraq does not recognize the concept of dual
 nationality, and many Iraqi "dual nationals," pspecially the
 children of an Iraqi father and a mother of non-Iraqi birth,
 have been denied permission to leave Iraq to visit the country
 of their other nationality.
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special
 programs to encourage repatriation of qualified
 professionals. Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for, a
 document permitting them to enter and exit from Iraq without a
 visa.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin are permitted to return,
 including many persons who were admitted to other countries as
 refugees. A number of such people, especially Assyrian
 Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They are free
 to come and go, within the limits of the present travel
 restrictions, since they are not considered to have violated
 Iraqi laws. However, those who &migrated only after the
 beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, including several U.S.
 
 
 1418
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart from
 Iraq after returning. In September and November 1988 and in
 February and March 1989, the Government announced amnesties
 for Kurds who fled the country for any reason. Approximately
 2,000 have voluntarily returned from refugee camps in Turkey.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iraqi citizens do not have the ability peacefully to change
 their government. President Saddam Hussein and the RCC rule
 Iraq through the Pa'ath Party. It reportedly has some 1.5
 million adherents, representing about 9 percent of the
 population.
 There are two other small legal political parties, both
 Kurdish. They and the Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic
 and Progressive National Front, essentially a vehicle of
 support for the Government. Members of the military or
 security services may engage in political activities only
 within the Balath Party. Association with the party is not
 required for appointment to senior government positions or
 military ranks or election to the National Assembly, but is
 normally necessary to attain political influence. Opposition
 groups, including various Kurdish groups and splinter parties,
 are severely repressed. The Communist Party was removed from
 the National Front and declared illegal in 1979. The Da'wa
 organization, a violent Shi'ite group, is still proscribed,
 and its members are subject to incarceration and execution, as
 are members of other parties believed to be cooperating with
 Iran. Plans the Government announced in 1988 to permit legal
 formation of opposition parties were not implemented in 1989.
 General elections were held for the 250-seat National Assembly
 in April. Though in theory possessing a wide range of
 official duties, the Assembly exercises little real
 authority. The majority of the more than 900 candidates were
 independents, although all supported current government
 policies. The elections by secret ballot were more open than
 in the past, and some high-ranking Baath party officials were
 defeated.
 The biennial elections for the Legislative Assembly of the
 Kurdish Autonomous Region were held in September 1989. All
 174 candidates, from the three legal parties and independents,
 had to satisfy the same requirements as National Assembly
 candidates. The Legislative Assembly does not exercise
 meaningful authority.
 In October 1989, an Experts Commission finished drafting a new
 Constitution to replace the Provisional Constitution of 1970.
 Iraqi officials assert that the new Constitution will provide
 more guarantees of human rights. However, the new
 Constitution has not yet been made public pending approval by
 President Saddam Hussein and the RCC.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government allows one human rights group to operate inside
 Iraq, but this is largely under government control. The
 Government has rarely cooperated with private foreign groups
 
 
 1419
 IEo
 or international organizations in investigating events or
 practices in Iraq.
 The Government denies charges that it violates human rights,
 and claims that the information on which AI and other human
 rights groups base their charges comes from pro-Iranian and
 Kurdish Iraqi exile groups in London and Paris. In its 1989
 report on children in Iraq, AI cited several instances in
 which Iraqi authorities had commented on AI reports or
 responded to AI inquiries, but in each case these authorities
 had defended the Government's actions as justifiable or denied
 the accuracy of AI's information. A resolution before the
 U.N. Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities in August 1989, recommending that the
 U.N. Commission on Human Rights study the human rights
 situation in Iraq, was narrowly defeated.
 Iraq does cooperate with the International Committee of the
 Red Cross in efforts to resettle Iranian civilian refugees in
 third countries, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 has had a permanent representative in Iraq since April 1988
 ,who registers Iranian refugees and works for their
 resettlement.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Ba'ath Party is committed to the equality of the sexes,
 and a series of laws since it came to power in 1968 has
 steadily improved the status of women. There have been laws
 to protect women from exploitation in the workplace; grant
 subsidized maternity leave; permit women to join the regular
 army, popular army, and police forces; and equalize women's
 rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage, and
 election to the National Assembly. In the 19701s, the
 Government imposed legal penalties on families that opposed
 sending their women to literacy schools, and on men who were
 seen harassing women. While the application of these laws has
 resulted in significant tangible improvements for women, a
 number of problems remain. Married women may still travel
 abroad only with the permission of their husbands. School
 enrollment of females has been increasing in recent years,
 reaching 45 percent in elementary schools and 36 percent in
 secondary schools in 1985-86.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. The war accelerated
 the Government's drive to elevate the status of women, and it
 appears to have significantly reduced, if not removed,
 barriers to the acceptance of women in traditional male
 roles. Women are increasingly employed as architects,
 construction engineers, oil engineers, air traffic
 controllers, and factory and farm managers. Their role in the
 armed forces is limited to the medical field.
 Violence against women, such as wife beating and rape, is
 known to occur but little is known about its extent. Such
 abuse is customarily dealt with within the tightly knit Iraqi
 family structure because of the value attached to personal
 privacy in this conservative society. Consequently, there is
 no public discussion of the subject, and there are no official
 statistics. Excessive violence against women would be grounds
 for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on these
 charges in Iraq are believed to be rare.
 
 
 1420
 IRAO
 The use of minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish is an
 official language used in schools and media in Kurdish areas.
 Turcomans publish in their dialect of Turkish, and Christians
 often use Aramaic as well as Arabic.
 The Shila, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 have historically been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged throughout much of the Middle East. The
 Government has a declared policy to raise their living
 standards and equalize opportunities for their economic and
 professional advancement. For four centuries, political power
 in Iraq has been concentrated in the hands of the Sunni
 minority. Sunni Arabs, who comprise 20 to 25 percent of
 Iraq's population, dominate the RCC, the Regional Command of
 the Aa'ath Party, and the Cabinet. However, increasing
 numbers of Shilas hold prominent positions, and the economic
 status of the Shi'a has improved through intensive government
 investment in the economic and educational infrastructure of
 southern Iraq.
 Although Christians sometimes allege discrimination in
 education and jobs, adherence to their religion has not
 prevented many from obtaining wealth and professional
 advancement. The Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister,
 a Chaldean Christian, has represented Iraq at meetings of the
 foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic
 Conference. Other Christians hold important official and
 private positions.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin carry special
 identification. They are often precluded from desirable
 employment and their advancement may be impeded. Many
 "Iranian" families have been in Iraq for generations. The two
 holiest shrines of Shi'a Islam, the prevalent sect in Iran,
 are located in Iraq. For generations Iranians have come to
 Najaf and Karbala on pilgrimage or to study in the seminaries,
 and many settled there. Some "Iranians" say their forebears
 were not from Iran but claimed Iranian nationality to evade
 Ottoman military conscription.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions independent of government control do not exist in
 Iraq. Under the trade union organization law of June 2, 1987,
 a new single trade union structure was prescribed for
 organized. labor. Workers in private and mixed enterprises and
 in cooperatives--but not public employees or workers in state
 enterprises--have the right to join a local union committee.
 The committees form trade unions which in turn are part of
 provincial trade union federations. At the top is an umbrella
 organization, the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions,
 which is organically linked to the Ba'ath Party and required
 to promote party principles and policies among union members.
 The General Federation is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions. It is also active in the
 tripartite Arab Labor Organization, headquartered in Baghdad.
 Although workers legally have the right to strike, after
 providing notice to the Labor Ministry, no such strikes were
 reported in 1989. There was a 1-day wildcat walkout by
 Egyptian workers protesting excessive work hours.
 
 
 1421
 IRAO
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to bargain collectively is not recognized. Salaries
 for public sector workers (i.e. the bulk of the employed) are
 set by the Government. Wages in the private sector are set by
 the employers or negotiated individually with workers.
 Iraq, which has ratified International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 98 on the Right to Organize and Bargain
 Collectively, was criticized by the ILO's Committee of Experts
 (COE) in 1989 for the fact that its new labor code of 1987
 fails to provide workers with protection against antiunion
 discrimination. The COE also expressed regret that the 1987
 Act on trade union organizations did not provide for
 collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although compulsory labor is prohibited by law, during and
 shortly after the war with Iran the Popular Army, the militia
 of the Ba'ath Party, employed press-gang methods to draft
 recruits. However, these activities ceased in November 1988,
 and the Popular Army was for the most part demobilized in 1989.
 ILO supervisory bodies again in 1989 expressed concern that
 the Penal Code permits the punishment of civil servants with
 imprisonment, including compulsory prison labor, for breaches
 of labor discipline, which include resigning from one's job.
 A November cabinet meeting, reported in the government-directed
 press, quoted the remark of a minister that resignation from
 government jobs should be free, confirming that heretofore
 civil servants have had to buy their way out of government
 service.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are frequently encouraged to work as necessary to
 support the family, but the employment of children under age
 14 is forbidden in all enterprises other than small-scale
 family enterprises. Children between the ages of 14 and 18
 who are employed are protected by law: they work fewer hours
 and have more privileges than adult workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek in urban areas is 6 days, 7 to 8 hours a day, for
 workers in the private and mixed sectors. These provisions do
 not apply to agricultural workers whose workweek and hours of
 work per day can vary according to individual employer-employee
 agreements. Hours for government employees are set by the
 head of the ministry for which the employee works. Many
 government employees routinely work longer than 8 hours a day,
 some of them as much as 12 hours per day.
 Occupational safety programs are in effect in state-run
 enterprises, and inspectors make visits irregularly to private
 establishments. Enforcement varies widely. A government
 decree to extend occupational safety and health protection was
 issued and subsequently withdrawn in December 1988, reportedly
 -resulting in the dismissal of the Labor Minister.
 A special problem arose after the-Government decided in June
 to reduce drastically the amount of hard currency foreign

 workers could remit. It is widely believed that the
 Government took this measure to "encourage" foreign workers to
 leave the country, thus freeing jobs for demobilized Iraqi
 soldiers. Workers not on contract were particularly hard
 hit. Most of the over 2 million Egyptian workers in Iraq were
 manual laborers. When they learned they would be able to
 transfer only $32 per month, they began to leave Iraq in
 droves, an estimated 2,000 per day by air alone. Egyptian and
 other foreign workers in Iraq have claimed that some Iraqi
 employers forced them to work 12 to 15 hours a day for 8
 hours, pay or refused to pay wages. The Government has
 admitted that Iraqi banks have-.been slow to Ray remittances.
 Egyptian workers are in fact receiving their savings a year
 after leaving Iraq.
