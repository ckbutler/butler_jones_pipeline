 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in which the Chi-
 nese Communist Party (CCP) monopolizes  _c-isionmaking authority. Almost all top
 civilian, police, and military positions at the national and regional levels are held
 by party members. A 22-memier Politburo and retired senior leaders hold ultimate
 power, but economic decentralization has increased the authority of regional offi-
 cials. Socialism continues to provide the ideological underpinning, but Marxist ideol-
 ogy has given way to pramt- in recent years. The party's authority rests pri-
 marily on the success of economic reform, its ability to maintain stability, and con-
 trol of the security apparatus.
 The security apparatus comprises the Ministries of State Security and Public Se-
 curity, the People s Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army, and the state judi-
 
 
 556
 cial, procuratorial, and penal systems. The Constitution protects fundamental
 human rights, but they are frequently ignored in practice, and challenges to the
 COPs political authority are often dealt with hasy and arbitrarily. ndga safe-
 guards for those detained or imprisoned are inadequate and inconsistently imple-
 mented. The Government attaches higher priority to maintaining public order and
 suppressing political opposition than to enforcing legal norms. As a result, security
 forces are responsible for numerous human rights abuses, including arbitrary deten-
 tion, forced confessions, and torture.
 More than a decade of rapid economic growth has raised living standards and en-
 abled growing numbers of Chinese to assume greater control over their own lives.
 The scope for private economic activity has expanded rapidly, and the degree of gov-
 ernment and party control over the economy has continued to decline. Although
 many details remain to be worked out, and the pace of privatization has been un-
 even, many elements of the old planned economylhave already been dismantled. In-
 come disparities between coastal regions and the interior are sgnificant and grow-
 ing, but overall there has beenasharp drop in the number of Chinese living inab-
 solute poverty. Greater disposable income, looser ideological controls, and freer ac-
 cess to outside sources of information have led to mere diversity in cultural life and
 media reporting. Government control of information media now depends to an In-
 creasing extent on sef-ensorship to regulate political and social content, but the
 authorities also consistntly penalize those who exceed the permissible.
 In 1994 there continued to be widespread and well-documentd human rights
 abuses in China, in violation of internationally  lpted norms, stemming beth m
 the authorities' intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal safeguards for
 freedom of speech, association, and religion. Abuses include arbitrary and lengthy
 incmmunicad detention, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Despite a reduc-
 tion during the year in the number of political detainees from the immediate post-
 Tiananmen period, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other prisoners of conscience
 remain imprisoned or detained. The Government still has not provided a com-
 prehensive, credible public accounting of all those missing or detained in connection
 with the suppression of the 1989 demonstrations. Chinese leaders moved swiftly to
 cut off organized expressions of protest or criticism and detained government critics,
 including those advocating greater worker rights. Citizens have no ability peacefully
 to change their government leaders or the form of government. Criminal defendants
 are dened basic legal safeguards such as due process or adequate defense. The re-
 gime continued severe restrictions on the  adoms of speech, press, assembly and
 association, and tightened controls on the exercise of these rights during 1994. Seri-
 ous human rights abuses persisted in Tibet and other areas populated by ethnic mi-
 norities.
 The human rights situation in 1994 was, however, marked by thesme a diversity
 that characterizes other aspects of Chinese life. In several instances, the Govern-
 ment acted to bring its behavior into conformity with internationally accepted
 human rights norms. These actions included releasing several prominent political
 and religious prisoners, granting passports to some critics of the regime and their
 relatives, and adopting a law, wich c bcam  effective in January 1995, that allows
 citizens to recover damages from the Government for infrinement of their rights.
 The Government continued to acknowledge the need to implement the rule of law
 and build the necessary legal and other institutions, but it has not yet significantly
 mitigated continuing repression of political dissent. In 1994 China also continued
 a human rights dialog with some foreign critics, and reaffirmed its adherence to the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Chinese officials provided limitd informa-
 tion about the status of several hundred specific cases of international concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Earajudicial Kiling.-It is impossible to determine the
 number of extrajudicial killings by government officials in 1994 or the adequacy of
 the government response, since the Government restricts access to such information.
 Therwere individual accounts of such killings including some carried in the Chi-
 nese press. Credible reports from international human rights organizations indicate
 a Tibetan nun died on June 4 in a prison hospital, reportedly as a result of a beat-
 ingby guards. In May Tibetan officials reported that a former public security official
 inTibet was sentenced to 9 years for causing the death of a suspect while torturing
 him to obtain a confession. InFujian, a public security official was also prosecuted
 for tortu    a prisoner to death, but no details on his sentence were provided. In
 December the Chinese press reported that a city police chief in Shanxi province was
 sentenced to 5 years for malpractice after ordering the detention and beating of two
 
 
 557
 Chinese for allegedly complaining about the police chiefs son. One detainee died
 from his injuries. Two other police officials were sentenced to death and life impris-
 onment respectively, for extorting a confession in the same case. Legislators in
 Guangdong province also reported two cases of death by torture, but there were no
 details on the disposition of the cases.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases in 1994 in which individuals
 who disappeared were suspected to have been killed by officials. The Government
 still has not provided a comprehensive, credible public accounting of all those miss-
 ing or detained in connection with the suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen dem-
 onstrations.
 c. Torture and 0her Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police and other elements of the security apparatus continue to employ torture and
 degrading treatment in dealing with detained and imprisoned persons. Both official
 Chinese sources and international human rights groups reported many instances
 torture. Persons detained pending trial were particularlry at risk as a result of gov-
 ernment failure to correct obvious systemic weaknesses m the design and operation
 of the legal system. These weaknesses include a reliance on confessions as a basis
 for convictions and the lack of access to prisoners by legal counsel and family mem-
 bers until after formal charges are brought, a step which often takes months.
 Former detainees have credibly reported that officials used cattle prods, electrodes,
 prolonged periods of solitary confinement and incommunicado detention, beatings,
 shackles, and other forms of abuse against detained men and women. There are
 credible reports that some women detainees in Tibet have been tortured, but female
 prisoners do not appear to have been targeted for rape.
 In March the Supreme People's Procuratorate reported it had investigated 378
 cases where torture was used to extract confessions in 1993, but it provided no in-
 formation on convictions or punishments. The number of actual incidents of torture
 and ill-treatment by government officials is almost certainly far greater than this
 number. In one case, a policeman was given a 1-year suspended sentence for beating
 Yan Zhen[ tue, an artist who was also a municipal people's ongress deputy from
 Jiaojiangin Zhejiang province. In May legslatrs in Guangdng province identified
 838 cases of police corruption and brutality, but Chinese press accounts reported
 that only 50 of the cases had been 'corrected." According to Chinese officials the
 Procuratrate has a total of 748 officials in China's jails, reform through labor,"
 and "reeducation through labor" facilities. Their responsib'_ity is to supervise prison
 management and enforce laws on treatment of prisoners. Proc.uratrial offices or of-
 ic rs are assigned to approximately 94 percent of prisons and labor camps. Another
 7,000 officials are responsible for suprvising China's detention centers.
 In January Justice Minister Xiao-Yang announced plans to modernize 80 percent
 of China's prisons and reform through labor facilities by the year 2000. Conditions
 in Chinese penal institutions are generally harsh and frequently degrading, and nu-
 tritional and health conditions are sometimes grim. Adequate medical care for pris-
 oners continues to be a problem, despite official assurances that prisoners have the
 right to prompt medical treatment if they become ill. In 1994 political prisoners who
 reportedly had difficulties in obtaining timely and adequate medical care included
 Bao Tong, Ran Wanding, and Qin Yongnin. Wang Juntao was allowed togo to the
 United States for medical treatment in April, and gen Ziming wasrleasedon med-
 ical parole in May, although he remains at home under heavy surveillance.
 Conditions of imprisonment for political prisoners vary widely. According to credi-
 ble reports, some detained dissidents continue to be incarcerated in psychiatric in-
 stitutions and treated with drugs. Dissidents such as Wang Wanxing, Wang
 Miaogen (who had chopped off four of his fingers in a protest in 1993 over alleged
 persecution), and Xing Jiandong are reportedly being held in mental hospitals in
 Beijing and Shanghai. However the lack of independent outside access to such per-
 sons made it impossible to verify their diagnoses or medical treatment or the condi-
 tions under whithey are being held.
 Political prisoners are also often incarcerated with common criminals. Chinese
 press reports claimed that Zheng Musheng, a Christian, was beaten to death by fel-
 low inmates, who were then arrested. His widow filed suit against local public secu-
 rity officials after Zheng died in custody in early 1994. Unspecified "action" was
 taken against prison supervisory personnel. There were credible reports that dis-
 sident Qin Yongmin was severely aten twice by fellow inmates in a reeducation
 through labor facility in June. According to these reports, he failed to receive ade-
 quate medical care after the beatings.
 China does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions. The
 Procuratorate, charged with law enforcement in the corrections system, reported
 39,342 law violations in prisons, 17,823 of which were corrected. China held two
 rounds of talks with the International Committee of the Red Cross in January and
 
 
 558
 April to discuss access to prisoners, but no agreement was reached. In February five
 American journalists were permitted to visit a Liaoning labor camp where political
 prisoner Liu Gang is held. The journalists saw Liu through a window but were not
 allowed to interview him. Reports persist that Liu suffers ill health as a result of
 beatings and other mistreatment, although Chinese officials have denied these alle-
 gations. In February a member of the China Human Rights Society, an organization
 established primarily to study and defend China's human rights record, was allowed
 to meet Liu and review his medical records in an attempt to refute reports that he
 had been mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Because the Government tightly controls
 information, it is impossible to estimate accurately the total number of people sub-
 jected to new or continued arbitrary arrest or detention. According to one Chinese
 media report from 1992, authorities have carried out close to 1 million detentions
 annually in recent years under a form of detention known as "shelter for investi a-
 tion." They released some peopl without charge after several days or weeks. In
 some cases, they charged dissidents with "disturbing public order" or "causing social
 turmoil" and sentenced them to 1 to 3 years of detention without independent judi-
 cial review (see Section i.e.).
 Under China's Criminal Procedure Law, officials may hold detainees for up to 10
 days before a formal arrest warrant must be approved by the Procuratorate; they
 must notify the detainee's family or work unit within 24 hours. Exceptions to these
 provisions include the sweeping provision that notification may be withheld if it
 would 'hinder the investigation of a case. On May 12, the Government issued re-
 vised public order regulations setting out penalties for social groups that fail to reg-
 ister with the proper authorities or for persons on parole or deprived of political
 rights who "violate regulations," as well as for several other offenses. With some ex-
 ceptions, violators can be detained for up to 15 days and fined about $23 (RMIB200).
 In 1994 authorities detained dissidents before high-level visits of foreign leaders,
 but it is not clear whether the new public order regulations were the basis for these
 detentions. Most of those detained were released shortly after the visits ended. Oth-
 ers were held for longer periods or detained formally.
 In practice, authorities often disregard or circumvent limits on detention by using
 regulations on "taking in for shelter and investigation " 'supervised residence," and
 other methods not requiring procuratorial approval. bissident Wei Jingsheng has
 been held incommunicado in supervised residence since April 1. Credible reports in-
 dicate that polie detained several other political activists,_ including Dai Xuezhong,
 Xiao Biguang, Zhou Qianbing, and Zhu Fuming, for months without filing charges
 againt them. Wang Dan and others were also detained briefly without charge sev-
 eral times du"ring 1994.
 Local officials and business leaders fr-equently onspire to use detentions as a
 means of exerting pressure in commercial disputes; cases in some areas have report-
 edy increased 50percent over 1993. Authorities held Hong Kong businessman
 Chong Kwee-Sung for 30 months in Henan while his case was being "investigated,"
 then released h    in February without charges being filed. Australian businessman
 James Peng was kidnaped by public security officials in Macao and brought to
 China, where he was held for several months before being tried in November. Chi-
 nese officials said his detention was legal because it was approved by the National
 People's Congress Standing Committee, which has apparently not been the case in
 other commercial dispute cases.
 In March Procurator General Zhang Siying reported on the problem of prisoners
 kept in prison past their release dates, noting that 34,432 of 73,416 such cases had
 been corrected. The legality of detentions can be challenged under the Administra-
 tive Procedure Law, but since detainees de not have access to lawyers, they have
 been unable to use this law to obtain prompt judicial determination of the legality
 of their detentions. The new State Compensation Law, passed in May, clarified the
 right of citizens to recover damages for illegal detentions. Even before the law took
 effect on January 1, 1995, the Chinese press reported a decision by a Beijing lower
 court awarding damages to a law professor who was illegally detained andbeaten
 by public security officials in May. In June a Fujian court awarded damages in a
 case of illegal "taking in for shelter and investigation." There is no judicially super-
 vised system of bail, -but at the discretion of public security officials, some detainees
 are released pending further investigation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-According to the Constitution, the court system
 is equal in authority to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the
 two most important government institutions. All three organs are nominally under
 the supervision of the National People's Congress (NPC). The Supreme People's
 Court stands at the apex of the court system, followed in descending order by the
 higher, intermediate, and basic people's courts. Judges are appointed by the people's
 
 
 559
 
 congresses at the corresponding level There are special courts for handling military,
 maritime, and railway transport cases.
 Officials insist that China's judiciary is independent but acknowledge that it is
 subject to the Communist Partys policy guidance. In practice, party and government
 leaders use a variety of means to influence court verdicts and sentences. Corruption
 and conflicts of interest also affect judicial decisionmaking. In March Supreme
 Court officials acknowledged problems with local protectionism and failure to con-
 duct fair trials, particularly in economic disputes. The Chinese press publicized a
 1993 economic case in which the court told the parties the decision was already
 written before the parties had finished producing their evidence.
 In practice, officials often ignore due process rights granted by the Constitution.
 Both before and after trial, prisoners are subjected to severe psychological pressure
 to confess their 'errors." Defendants who fail to "show the right attitude" by
 confessing their crimes are typically sentenced more harshly. Persons appearing be-
 fore a court are not presumed innocent; despite official denials, trials are essentially
 sentencing hearings. Confessions without corroborating evidence are insufficient for
 a conviction under Chinese law, but coerced confessions are not automatically ex-
 cluded as evidence.
 Accused persons are given virtually no op otunity to prepare an adequate de-
 fense while their cases are being investigated a time when the question of guilt or
 innocence is essentially decided. The law provides that defense lawyers may be re-
 taied 7 days before trial. However, in some cases, even this brief period is short-
 ened under reglations issued in 1983 to accelerate the adjudication of certain seri-
 ous criminal cases. Under Chinese law, there is no requirement that the court ap-
 point a defense attorney for the defendant unless the defendant is hearing impaired
 or a minor, although the court may appoint defense counsel if it feels an attorney
 is necessary. When attorneys do appear, they have little time to prepare a defense
 and rarely contest guilt; their function is generally confined to requesting clemency.
 The conviction rate is over 90 percent. The court's permission is required before the
 accused or his representative can interrogate witnesses, produce new witnesses, or
 review evidence.
 In some regions, experimentation with the trial system is underway. Shanghai
 court officials announced plans in August in some criminal and civil cases to expand
 an experiment with a more adversarial system, which gives attorneys more respon-
 sibility for presenting evidence and arguing the facts during trials.
 Chinese officials state that China has insufficient numbers of lawyers to meet the
 country's growing needs. Knowledgeable observers report that defense attorneys ap-
 pear in only a small number of criminal trials. As a key element in its legal reform
 plans, China plans to increase the number of lawyers to 150,000 by the year 2000.
 As of July, there were 70,515 lawyers working in 5,885 law firms. In many cities,
 private law firms are being organized outside the framework of established govern-
 ment legal offices. These firms are self-regulating and do not have their personnel
 or budgets determined directly by the State. At the end of 1993, there were 502
 such firms. However, many defense lawyers, like other Chinese, still depend on an
 official work unit for emploent, housing, and other benefits. They are therefore
 often reluctant to be viewed as overzealous in defending individuals accused ofpolit-
 ical offenses. In some sensitive cases, relatives of defendants have reportedly found
 it difficult to hire defense lawyers.
 The Criminal Procedure Law requires that all trials be held in public, except
 those involving state secrets, juveniles, or "personal secrets." Details of cases involv-
 ing 'counterrevolutionary" charges, however, have frequently been kept secret, even
 from defendants' relatives, under this provision. The 1988 Law on State Secrets af-
 fords a ready basis for denying a public trial. Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang's trial
 in March on the charge of stealing state secrets was not open to the public (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.). In November journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to 6 years in prison for
 "leaking state secrets," allegedly published in the Hong Kong press. Gao's lawyer
 and her relatives said they had not been notified of the final trial or sentencing
 hearing (the case had been returned twice for insufficient evidence). There is an a
 peals process, but initial decisions are rarely overturned, and appeals generally
 not provide meaningful protection against arbitr  or erroneous verdicts. Under the
 Criminal Procedure Law, persons "exempted from prosecution" by procuratrs may
 still be deemed to have a criminal record, despite the lack of a judicial determina-
 tion of guilt. Such provisions can be applied in counterrevolutionary crimes" as well
 as in ordinary criminal offenses.
 Lack of due process is particularly egregious when defendants receive the death
 sentence. Chinese officials refuse to provide comprehensive statistics on death sen-
 tences or executions, but hundreds of executions are officially reported annually.
 The actual numbers may be much higher. All death sentences are nominally re-
 
 
 560
 viewed by a higher court. Reviews are usually completed within a few days after
 sentencing and consistently result in a perfunctory confirmation of sentence. No exe-
 cutions for political offenses are known to have occurred in 1994.
 During 1994 new reports revived previous allegations that organs from executed
 Chinese prisoners are removed and transplanted to patients without the consent of
 the prisoner or his or her family. These reports have not been verified.
 In January 1995, a Ministry of Justice official said there were a total of 1,285,000
 prisoners in prisons or reform through labor camps at the end of 1994. Prisoners
 can be sentenced to these facilities only by the courts. However, government au-
 thorities can assign persons accused of  mir" public order offenses to "reeducation
 through labor" camps in an extraudicial process. Terms of detention run from a
 normal minimum of-l year to a maximum of 3 years. The labor reeducation commit-
 tee which determines the term of detention may extend an inmate's sentence for an
 additional year. According to Chinese officials, 153,000 detainees were in reeduca-
 tion through labor facilities at the end of 1993, up 16 percent over 1992 figures.
 Other estimates of the number of inmates are considerably higher. Officials said
 75,900 were released from reeducation through labor facilities in 1993. Under a
 State Council regulation issued in early 1991, those sentenced to reeducation
 through labor may ask the committee to reconsider its decision.
 Since 1990 reeducation through labor sentences may also be judicially challenged
 under the Administrative Procedure Law. While some persons have obtained a re-
 duction in or withdrawal of their sentence after reconsideration or appeal, in prac-
 tice these procedures are not widely used, and short appeal times, lack of access to
 lawyers, and other problems weaken their effectiveness in preventing or reversing
 arbitrary decisions.
 Government officials deny that China has any political prisoners, asserting that
 persons are detained not for the political or religious views they hold, but because
 they have taken some action which violates the -riminal Law. Political dissidents,
 however, are often detained or charged for having committed "crimes of counter-
 revolution"  under   Articles  90   through   104   of  the   Criminal   Law.
 Counterrevolutionary offenses range from treason and espionage to spreading
 counterrevolutionary propaganda. The authorities also used these articles to punish
 persons who organized demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official informa-
 tion to foreigners, or formed associations outside state control. In December, 9 of 16
 defendants tried in Beijing in July were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3
 to 20 years for leading or participating in "counterrevolutionary groups" or conduct-
 ing "counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement." One defendant was sen-
 tenced to two years of "supervision," one was excused before trial for medical rea-
 sns, and charges against five others were dropped. All 16 defendants had been held
 in pretrial detention for more than 2 year.. In other cases, the system of reeducation
 through labor is used to deal with political offenders. Qin Yongmin was sentenced
 to 2 years' reeducation through labor in January for 'creating turmoil," apparently
 for his role as founder of the "Peace Charter" group in 1993. Labor activist Zhang
 Lin and lawyer Zhou Guoqiang were reportedly sentenced to 3-year terms of reedu-
 cation through labor in September, as were activists Bao G Yang Zhou, Li Guotao,
 and Yang Qingheng in October. Liu Huanwen was sentenced to 2 years' reeducation
 through labor in August. Shanghai Human Rights Association member Dai
 Xuezhong was sentenced to 3 years for alleged tax evasion in December. Wei
 Jingsheng's secretary, Tong Yi, began serving a 2  year sentence of reeducation
 through labor in late December for allegedly forging an official stamp. Dissidents
 such as Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang are also still being held in reeducation
 through labor facilities and are reportedy in poor health.
 In January an official from the Chinese Ministry of Justie said there were 2,678
 peo ple serving sentenes for ounterrevolutionary crim es at the end of 1994. Chinese
 officials told an American human rights monitor in June that as of the end of March
 there were 2,935 people serving sentences for counterrevolutionary crimes, down
 from 3,172 in December 1993. These figures include people convicted of espionage
 or other internationally recognized criminal offenses but d not include political
 prisoners detained but not chiarged; poitical or religious activists held in reeduca-
 tion through labor camps; and persons detained or convicted for criminal offenses
 due solely to their nonviolent political or religious activities.
 The Government released on parole during 1994 several Chinese prisoners who
 were detained for poitical or religious reasons, including prominent activists Wang
 Juntao, Chen Ziimn g, Ding Junze, Yulo Dawn Tsering, and others. Nevertheless,
 many others, including Wei Jingsheng, Ren Wanding, Bno Tong, and Liu Gang, re-
 mained imprisoned or under other forms of detention in 1994. Some of those re-
 leased in 1994 or earlier, such as Chen Ziming and Wang Dan, remain under close
 police surveillance and suffer from occasional police harassment, making it difficult
 
 
 561
 for them to live a normal life. Wang Dan, for example, was threatened physically
 in December by undercover police officers some of whom continued surveillance out-
 side his home. Fearing physical harm, Wang disappeared from public view for 4
 weeks before returning home.
 Many political prisoners are subject to "deprivation of political rights" even after
 their period of parole has expired. This status further limits their rights of free
 speech and association. With a criminal record, their status in society, ability to be
 employed, freedom to travel, and numerous other aspects of their lives are often se-
 verely restricted, although economic reform and social change have ameliorated
 these problems somewhat. The families of political prisoners are also adversely af-
 fected; sometimes family members encounter difficulty in obtaining or keeping em-
 ployment and housing. For example Zhang Fengying, wife of imprisoned activist
 Rn Wanding, and her teenage daugiter were evicted from their apartment, owned
 by Ren's work unit, in 1992 and remained in poor housing during 1994.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Changes in the economic structure, including the growing diversity of employment
 opportunities and the increasing market orientation of many work units, are under-
 mining the ability of the authorities to monitor and regulate personal and family
 life as closely as in the past, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, however,
 most people still depend on their government-linked work unit for housing, permis-
 sion to have a child, approval to apply for a passport, and other aspects  ordinary
 life. The work unit, a Fng with the neighborhood committee, is charged with mn-
 itoring activities and attitudes.
 Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search prem-
 ises, this provision is often ignored. In addition, both the Public Security Bureau
 and procuracy apparently can issue search warrants on their own authority. The
 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citizens
 are protected by law,* but in practice, authorities record some telephone con-
 versations and some mail is opened and censored. Government security organs mon-
 itor and sometimes restrict contact between foreigners and Chinese citizens, particu-
 larly dissidents. Rules issued in July implementing the State Security Law define
 "activities of individuals outside the country (including non-Chinese citizens resi-
 dent in China) who disregard dissuasion and meet with personnel in the country
 who have endangered state security or who are seriously suspected of endangering
 state security" as a violation of the State Security Law.
 The Government has continued its effort to control citizens' access to outside
 sources of information, selectively jamming Chinese language broadcasts of the
 Voice of America (VOA) and British Broadcasting Corporation. The effectiveness of
 the jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals of VOA and other
 broadcasters reaching most parts of China.
 China's population~nas roughly doubled in the past 40 years to 1.18 billion people.
 In the 1970's and 1980's China adopted a comprehensive and highly intrusive one-
 child family planning policy. This policy most heavily affects Han Chinese in urban
 areas. Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a second child. However, ex-
 ceptions are allowed for the 70 percent of Han who live in rural areas, and ethnic
 minorities are subject to less stringent population controls. Enforcement of the fam-
 ily planning policy is inconsistent, varying widely from place to place and year to
 year.
 The population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic in-
 centives, as well as more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits. Disciplinary measures
 against those who violate the policy include fines, withholding of social services, de-
 motion, and other administrative punishments, such as loss of employment. Unpaid
 fines have sometimes resulted in confiscation or destruction of personal property.
 Because penalties for excess births can be levied against local officials and the
 mothers' work units, many individuals are affected, providing multiple sources of
 pressure.
 Physical compulsion to submit to abortion or sterilization is not authorized, but
 Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there are instances of forced abortions
 and sterilizations. Officials maintain that, when discovered, responsible officials are
 disciplined and undergo retraining. They admit, however, that stronger punishment
 is rare. Individuals can also sue officials who have exceeded their authority in im-
 plementing family planning policy, but government officials have not provided data
 on the number of successful suits on these grounds.
 Regulations forbid sex-selective abortion, but because of the traditional preference
 for male children, particularly in rural areas some families have used ultrasound
 to identify and abort female fetuses. Use of ultrasound for this purpose was specil-
 
 
 562
 cally prohibited by the Maternal and Child Health Law passed in October which
 prescribes penalties for medical practitioners who violate this provision. The Chi-
 nese press has reported that the ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100, based
 on a nationwide average, while the statistical norm is 106 male births to 100 fe-
 male. The ratio excludes many female births, especially the second or third in a
 family, which are unreported to permit the parents to keep trying to conceive a boy,
 but may also reflect the abuse of sonography. Female infaunticide may also be a fac-
 tor in some areas of China.
 At least five provincial governments have implemented regulations seeking to pre-
 vent people with severe mental handicaps from having children. In October China
 passed a national Maternal and Child Care Law calling for premarital and prenatal
 examinations to determine whether couples have acute infectious diseases, certain
 mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are at risk for passing on de-
 bilitating genetic diseases. The law goes into effect on June 1, 1995, and implement-
 ing regulations defining which diseases or conditions will be covered have not yet
 been completed. The law will be implemented by the Ministry of Health, not the
 State Family Planning Commission, and while it includes provisions for abortion or
 sterilization in some cases based on medical advice, it prvdes for obtaining a sec-
 ond opinion and mandates that patients or their guardians give written consent to
 such procedures. (See also Section 5 on People with Disabilities.)
 There were no reported cases of prosecution of parents for teaching their children
 religion in the privacy of their home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution states that freedom
 of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental rights enjoyed by all Chinese
 citizens the Government interprets the Communist Party's "leading role" as cir-
 cumscribing these rights. It does not permit citizens to _publish or broadcast criti-
 cism of senior leaders or opinions that contradict basic Communist Party doctrine,
 which provides for a Socialist state under the party's leadership. The Government
 and party maintained trict contrl over published expression of dissenting views
 in 1994. Public security authorities briefly detained several foreign journalists in
 March, April, and May after they had interviewed or attempted to interview noted
 dissidents or their relatives. Under China's State Security Law, "official secrets" are
 broadly defined, and interpretation is left to the Ministries of State Security and
 Public Security. Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang was convicted of "spig and stealing
 state secrets" after a closed tria in March. He was sentenced to 12 years' imprison-
 ment and 2 years' deprivation of political rights for allegedly obtaining "ancial
 and economic secrets, including information on China's interest rates and plans to
 sell gold. Tian Ye, the bank official who allegedly supplied Xi with the information,
 was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment and 3 years' deprivation of political rights.
 After a closed trial, former journalist Gao Yu was sentenced to 6 years' imprison-
 ment in November for *leaking state secrets abroad." (See Section i.e.)
 The party and the Government continue to control print and broadcast media and
 comel them to propagate the currently acceptable ideological line. In June press
 guidelines called on reporters to protect state secrets, avoid corruption, and not pub-
 licize 'sensitive subjects." Despite these admonitions, the lively tabloid sector contin-
 ued to expand in 1994, while circulation of major propaganda-oriented dailies con-
 tinued to decline. Radio talk shows remained popular, and, while generally avoiding
 politically sensitive subjects, they provided opportunities to air grievances about
 public issues. A small but rapidly growing segment of the population has access to
 satellite television broadcasts. Satellite television dishes are widely available for
 sale, and a licensing scheme begun in October 1993, which controls purchase and
 possession of the equipment, has been implemented at best unevenly.
 The Government's ability to control the production and dissemination of publica-
 tions continued to diminish in 1994. Fierce competition and dwindling government
 subsidies have increased opportunities forprivate publishers and booksellers. Some
 credible estimates hold that, at the end of 1993, as much as one-third of all books
 were being published through these unsanctioned channels. In April officials an-
 nounced the number of licensed publications would be frozen at current levels.
 Shenzhen authorities confiscated a thousand copies of 'Tendency Quarterly" and
 briefly detained its founder in January. In May 45 newspapers and periodicals were
 banned for illegally reselling their publishing licenses. Seven film directors were
 banned in March for entering their works in an overseas film festival without going
 through official channels.
 The Government has continued to impose heavy ideological controls on colleges,
 universities, and research institutes. As a result, many intellectuals and scholars,
 fearing that books or papers on political topics would be deemed too sensitive to be
 
 
 563
 published, feel compelled to exercise self-censorship. In areas such as economic pol-
 icy or legal reform, there was greater official tolerance for comment and criticism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-While the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of peaceful assemfbly and association, the Government severely re-
 stricted these rights in practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that such
 activities may not infringe "upon the interests of the State"; protests against the po-
 litical system or its leaders are prohibited. Although some small-scale demonstra-
 tions on nonpolitical grievances are tolerated in practice, demonstrations involving
 expression of dissident political views are denied permits and suppressed if held. Po-
 lice detained Zhou Guoqiang and Yuan Hongbing in March, reportedly in part due
 to their presentation of a petition on human rights and worker rights to the NPC
 during its annual plenary session. Press reports from a Chinese-controlled service
 also aused Zhou of planning to sell "political" T-shirts while the NPC was in ses-
 sion.
 The Communist Party organizes and controls most professional and other mass
 associations. Regulations promulgated in 1990 require all organizations to be offi-
 cially registered and approved. Ostensibly aimed at secret societies and criminal
 gangs, the regulations~also deter the formation of unauthorized political or labor or-
 gamzations. Authorities in Shanghai refused to allow several individuals to register
 a proposed "human rights association,* and some members of the group were subse-
 quently detained (see Section 4). In March Liu Nianchun was denied permission to
 register the Association for Protection of Labor Rights; Liu himself was detained in
 May but released in October. No charges were filed against him.
 c. Freedom of Relh~n.-The Government subjects religious freedom to restric-
 tions of varying seventy, although the number of believers continues to grow. While
 the Constitution affirms toleration of religious beliefs, government regulations re-
 strict religious practice to government-controlled religious organizations and reg-
 istered places of worship. The Government supervises the publication of religious
 material for distribution. There are persistent complaints that the number of Bibles
 and other religious materials allowed to be printed falls far short of demand. Reli-
 gious affairs bureaus, which are staffed by officials who rarely are religious believ-
 ers, provide "guidance and supervision" over implementation of government regula-
 tions on religion. In a Catholic seminary in Chengdu, all the seminarians walked
 out in April to protest party interference in the operation of the school. Communist
 Party officials state that party membership and religious belief are incompatible.
 This-places a serious limitation on religious believers, since party membership is re-
 quired for almost all high positions in government and state-owned businesses.
 There are no specific bans on particular religious groups, but the treatment of re-
 ligious believers and organizations varies widely. Unregistered or "house" church
 leaders and members are harassed in some regions but tolerated in others.
 Nonmainstream sects are often singled out. Credible reports indicate members of an
 evangelical sect known as "Shouters" continued to be harassed, detained, fined, and
 imprisoned in Henan after the group was deemed "counterrevolutionary" in 1984.
 After forcefully suppress in all religious observances during the 1968-76 Cultural
 Revolution, the Government began in the late 1970's to restore or replace damaged
 or confiscated churches, temples mosques, and monasteries. The official religious
 organizations administer more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries,
 nine institutes to train Imams and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist
 monks. Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliabil-
 ity," and all graduates must pass an examination on their theological and political
 knowledge to qualify for the clergy. The Government permitted some Catholic semi-
 narians, Muslim clerics, and Buddhist clergy to go arad for additional religious
 studies in 1994.
 The authorities permit officially sanctioned religious organizations to maintain
 international contacts as long as these do not entail foreign control. In January
 China promulgated regulations on religious practices by foreigners and on places of
 religious activities. The regulations codified many existing rules, including a ban on
 proselytizing by foreigners, but allow foreign nationals to preach to foreigners, bring
 in religious materials for their own use, and preach to Chinese in churches,
 mosques, and temples at the invitation of registered religious organizations. In prac-
 tice, some discreet proselytizing and distribution of religious texts by foreigners out-
 side official channels is tolerated.
 Buddhists are by far the largest body of religious believers in China. The Govern-
 ment estimates that there are 100 million Chinese Buddhists, most of whom are
 from the dominant Han ethnic group. (A discussion of government restrictions on
 Tibetan Buddhism can be found in the addendum to this report.)
 According to government figures, there are 17 million Muslims in China. In some
 areas with large Muslim populations, officials continue to restrict the building of
 
 
 mosques and the religious education of youths under 18. Following the 1990 unrest
 in Xiniang, the authorities issued reguations further restricting religious activities
 and teaching. Ningxia authorities issued regulations in July forbidding religious
 bodies from interfering in administrative affairs, including education, marriage, and
 family plann.
 China permit Muslim citizens to make the hajj to Mecca, and the number of
 thosemakg the ha has ignificantly increased in recent years About 3,000 offi-
 cially sponsoied Chinese made the haa in 1993; many more traveled at their own
 e x p e ns e .
 xTe number of Christians continues to grow rapidly. Only those Christian church-
 es affiliated with either the Catholic Patriotic Association or the (Protestant) Three
 Self Patriotic Movement, which the Government established in the 1950's to elimi-
 nate perceived foreign domination of Christian groups, may operate openly.
 Active unofficial religious movements pose an alternative to the state-regulated
 churches although in some areas there is tacit cooperation between official and un-
 official churches. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated, Catholic Church claims a mem-
 bership far larger than the 4 million registered with the official Catholic Church,
 though actual figures are unknown. In addition to the 6 million persons who are
 officially counted as followin Protestantism, a large number of Protestants worship
 privately in "house churches that are independent of government control.
 There continued to be credible reports in 1994 of efforts by authorities in some
 areas to rein in activities of the unapproved Catholic and Protestant movements, in-
 cluding raiding and closing a number of unregistered churches. Two Protestant
 house churches in Shenzhen were reportedly closed and their leaders briefly de-
 tained. Several Hong Kong-based Christian missionaries were detained for a few
 days in Henan in February for violating regulations on religious activities by for-
 eigners; several Chinese Christians also detained in connection with the incident
 were released later. In November, in another town in Henan, a preacher from Tai-
 wan and 152 local Christians were reportedly detained on charges of unauthorized
 proselytizing by foreigners (under the January religious regulations, Chinese from
 Hong Kong and Taiwan are covered by the rules governing foreigners). Ten are still
 in custody; the rest reportedly were released after paying fines of a pproximately
 $118 (1,000 RMB). The Guangzhou house church of Pastor Samuel Lamb (Lin
 Xiangao) continued to operate openly but was subject to limited harassment by the
 authorities. Elsewhere, authorities tolerate the existence of unofficial Catholic and
 Protestant churches as long as they remain small and discreet.
 A number of relipous activists remained imprisoned in 1994. There was some evi-
 dence that authorities have increasingly used short-term detentions, rather than
 long prison terms when dealing with unauthorized religious activities. Pan Yiyuan,
 leader of a house church in Fuian, was detained in March and released in Decem-
 ber. Wei Jingyi was redetaned in January in Hebei less than a year after finishing
 a 3-year sentence to reeducation through labor. Two church members from Anhui
 were reportedly sentenced to 2 years' reeducation through labor in September, re-
 portedly for contacting "anti-China overseas organizations." Father Gu Zheng was
 reportedly detained in Xinjiang in October for teaching in an unregistered Catholic
 seminary. Father Vincent Qin Guoliang was sentenced to 3 years' reeducation
 through labor in November in Qinghai province. Bishop Sn Zhiming was detained
 briefly in Januaiy after meeting with a visiting US.  ngressman. Authorities in
 Jiangxi reportedly redetained Bihop Zen  Jingmu in September after holding him
 for a few aa in August. Fater Liao Haiqmg, ao  etaied in Septmer, was re-
 leased in November. Several other religious activists were released in 1994, al-
 though the whereabouts of some reported to have been released could not be con-
 firmed, and others remained under some restrictions. Pei Ronggui and Jia Zhiguo
 were released in late January or early February; Zhang Ruiyu, Chen Zhuman, Cui
 Tai, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe and Zhang Li were released-in May. In April a visiting
 American religious figure was told that Han Dingxiang, Fan Zhongliang, Liu
 Guangdong, and others had been released. In November the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance made a 10-day visit to China, including Tibet,
 at the invitation of the Chinese Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The effectiveness of the Government's identification card system used
 to control and restrict individual residence location within the country continued to
 erode in 1994. The "floating population" migrating to China's urban areas from the
 countryside is estimated at anywhere from 50 to 100 million. In January the Gov-
 ernment announced the household registration system would be revamped to adapt
 to the new situation. However, because this itinerant population lacks official sta-
 tus, access to housing, schooling, and the full range of employment opportunities can
 be restricted.
 
 
 565
 Some former inmates have been denied permission, under the "staying at prison
 employment' system, to return to their homes, a provision applicable to those incar-
 cerated in both the "reform through labor" and the "reeducation through labor" sys-
 tems. For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this constitutes a form
 of internal exile. The number of prisoners subject to this restriction is unknown.
 Others have reportedly been forced to accept jobs in state enterprises where they
 can be more closely supervised after their release from prison or detention.
 The Government routinely permits legal emigration and most foreign travel
 There was progress during 1994 in several cases m  which the Government had de-
 nied passports for political reasons. Legal scholar Yu Haocheng finally obtained a
 passport and exit permit in May, as did several relatives of dissidents currently re-
 siding abroad. Although regulations promulgated in 1990 require college graduates
 to repay the cost of their free postsecondary education by working for 5 years before
 going abroad, students wishing to go abroad still manage to obtain passports. The
 Government continues to use political attitudes as a major criterion in selecting peo-
 ple for government-sponsored study abroad.
 The Government continued its efforts to attract persons who have studied over-
 seas back to China. Official media have said that before returning home, Chinese
 citizens who have joined foreign organizations hostile to China should quit them and
 refrain from activities which violate Chinese law. The authorities continued to
 refuse to allow labor activist Han Dongfang to return to China after revoking his
 passport in 1993 on the grounds that he engaged in activities hostile to China while
 overseas. In November authorities stopped poet Bei Dao at Beijing Airport and re-
 portedly interrogated him overnight about his position as director of Human Rights
 in China, a U.S.-based organization. He was then refused entry into China. Some
 former student leaders who were active in the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations re-
 portedly continue to have difficulty getting permission to return to China.
 The Government accepts the repatriation of citizens who have entered other coun-
 tries or territories illegally. In 1994 in addition to the routine return of Chinese
 illegal immigrants found in Hong long, the Government permitted the return of
 several large groups of illegal immigrants from other countries. Citizens illegally
 smuggled to other countries are often detained for a short time to determine identity
 and any past criminal record or involvement in smuggling activities. As a deterrent
 and to recover local costs incurred during the repatriation, the authorities in some
 areas levy a fine of $1,000 or more on returnees.
 Currently there is no law authorizing the authorities to grant refugee status, and
 they generally repatriate persons oftheher nationalities seeg to be recognized as
 refugees. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Public Security, and Civil Affairs, in col-
 laboration with the U.N. High Comiioner for Refugees, are writing legislation
 that would allow China to honor its obligation as a party since 1982 to the Geneva
 Convention in regard to refugees.
 Although the Government denies having tightened its policy on accepting Viet-
 namese refugees, in recent years very few such refugees have actually een reset-
 tled in China. China has not signed the Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated
 at the Geneva International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in 1989, but it gen-
 erally has abided by its principles.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and cannot freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly only
 for county-level people's congress delegates. People's congress delegates at the pro-
 vincial level are selected by county-level people's congresses, and in turn provincial-
 level people's congresses select delegates to the National People's Congress. Accord-
 ing to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's Congress (NPC) is the highest
 organ of state power. It elects the President and Vice President, decides on the
 choice of the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the Central Military Commission.
 In some elections (but not for the central Government positions chosen by the NPC),
 voters are offered more candidates than positions, allowing a modest degree of
 choice among officially a pproved candidates. There were credible reports that the
 candidates most favored by authorities were defeated in some local elections, par-
 ticularly at the village level.
 There are no restrictions placed on the participation of women or minority groups
 in the political process, and women make up 14 percent of Communist Party mem-
 bership. However, the election and agenda of people's congresses at all levels remain
 under tight control by the Communist Party, the paramount source of political au-
 thority in China. The Constitution was amended in 1993 to ratify the existence of
 small "democratic" parties, but these play only a minor consultative role at most,
 
 
 566
 
 and all pled  allegiance to the Communist Party. Thus, the Communist Party re-
 tains an explicit monopoly on political decisionmaking.
 The requirement that associations register and be approved makes it difficult for
 independent interest goups to form and affect the system. Several persons who pe-
 titioned the NPC calling for greater attention to human rights and workers' rights,
 including Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and others, were detained by authorities
 in March and April. Zhou Guoqiang was sentenced in September to 3 years' reedu-
 cation through labor (see Section i.e.).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent Chinese organizations that publicly monitor or com-
 ment on human rights conditions in China. The Government has made it clear it
 will not tolerate the existence of such groups. In April Shanghai officials denied a
 request for permission to register by the Chinese Human Rights Association, a
 group founded by Yang Zhou and other dissidents. The decison was justified on the
 grounds that the group was not affiliated with an official organization. The authori-
 ties subsequently detained most of the members of the group, but it is not clear
 whether their detentions resulted solely from their involvement in the group. Wang
 Dan, a 1989.student activist, was repeatedly detained for brief periods in 1994 after
 announcing his intention to investigate China's human rights situation. (See also
 Section 1.rf)
 The Government has promoted limited academic study and discussion of concepts
 of human rights since 1991..Researh institutes in Shanghai and Beijing, including
 the Chnes Academy of Social Sciences, have organized symposia on human rights
 issues, established human rights research centers, and visited other countries to
 study human rights practices in those nations. In 1993 the Government formed the
 China Society for Human Rights Studies as a "nongovernmental organization"; its
 efforts have focused largely on improving China's image abroad and responding to
 criticism of China's human rights record. In June the Society issued comments on
 the 1993 US. State Department Human Rights Report which stridently defended
 Chinese practices and glossed over fundamental human rights abuses that the Gov-
 ernment continues to perpetrate.
 The Government reiterated in Apri that China agrees to abide by the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights documents. De-
 spite this public statement, Chinese officials accept only in theory the universality
 of human rights.They ar~ue instead.that a nation's political, economic, and social
 system and its unmque historical, religios, and cultural background determine its
 concept of human rights. To advocate this nonuniversal view, and to deflect at
 iempts to discuss its human rights record, China was active in 1994 in international
 forums, including the annual U. Human Rights Commission meeting.
 The Government remains reluctant to accept criticism of its human rights prac-
 tices by other nations or international organizations and often criticized reports by
 international human rights monitoring groups in 1994. Nevertheless, officials no
 longer dismiss all discussion of human rights as interference in the country's inter-
 nal affairs. Chinese authorities continued their limited dialog with foreign govern-
 ments on human rights issues in talks with a number of visiting delegations from
 other countries, and also during visits abroad by Chinese leaders. At the request
 of the U.S. Government in 1993, the Chinese Government provided limited informa-
 tion about the status of several hundred persons believed to be imprisoned for their
 political or religious beliefs. As noted in ion 2 ce. in November the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance visited China for 10 days at the invitation of
 the Chinese Government. His visit included a trip to Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Au-
 tonomous Region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Laws exist that seek to protect women, children, the disabled, and minorities. In
 practie, social discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, and disability has per-
 sisted and the _concept  of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the gen-
 eral thikin  of the  an majority.
 Women.-The 1982 Constitution states that women enjoy equal rights with men
 in all spheres of life," including ownership of property, inheritance rights, and access
 to education. In 1992 the   C enad legislation on the protection of the rights
 and interests of women which was designed to assist in curbing sex-related diserimi-
 nation. Women continued, however, to report discrimination, sexual harassment, un-
 fair dismissal, demotion, and wage cuts. Women are sometimes the unintended vic-
 tims of economic rforms designed to streamline enterprises and give workers great-
 
 
 567
 er job mobility. A survey of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions found that
 women made up 60 percent of those forced to leave their jobs due to enterprise cut-
 backs or reorganizations in 1993. Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the
 expense of maternity leave and child-care, and some even lowered the retirement
 age for female workers to 40 years of age. Although Chinese law promises equal pay
 for equal work, a 1990 survey found that Women's salaries averaged 77 percent of
 men's. Most women employed in industry work in lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs.
 In June the Government issued a white paper on the situation of Chinese women,
 spurred by plans to host the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beging in 1995.
 According to the white paper, women hold relatively few positions of sigmficant in-
 fluence within the party or government structure (there are no women in the 22-
 member Politburo), although 21 percent of national People's Congress delegates and
 13 percent of members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are
 women. While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men
 continue to constitute the majority of the educated, particularly the highly educated.
 For example, the white paper reported that in 1992, women made up 33.7 percent
 of college students, and 24.8 percent of postgraduates. From 1982 to 1993, 4.9 per-
 cent of doctoral degrees were awarded to women.
 The Government continued in 1994 to condemn strongly and take steps to prevent
 and punish the abduction and sale of women for marriage or prostitution, violence
 against women, and female infanticide. It has severely punished and in some cases
 executed a number of people accused of such crimes. In a case reported in the Chi-
 nese press in December, a gang of 48 people in Anhui province received sentences
 ranging from 19 years to death for abducting, raping, and selling 102 women. The
 case was the most serious which has become known to date. The abduction of
 women remains a serious problem, especially in those areas where local officials
 have resisted efforts of central authorities to stop it. According to figures announced
 by the Ministry of Public Security in January, there were 15,000 cases of abduction
 and trafficking in women and children in 1993.
 One report from Inner Mongolia blamed part of the problem of abduction and sell-
 ing of women on a serious imbalance in sex ratios in one county, where there were
 115 men for every 100 women. The question of male/female birth ratios and tradi-
 tional preferences for boys is discussed in Section 1.f. Although Chinese authorities
 have enacted laws and conducted educational campaigns to eradicate the traditional
 preference for sons, in many areas this preference remains strong, especially in
 rural China. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the perceived higher
 value of boys in providing old- age support for their parents by establishing or im-
 proving pensions and retirement homes.
 Nationwide statistics on the extent of physical violence against women are not
 available, but a survey of 2,100 families by the Beijing Society for Research on Mar-
 riage and the Family published in March, showed that one-fifth of all wives had
 been abused by their spouses. One government study indicated 2 percent of urban
 households and 5 percent of rural ones had serious problems of domestic violence.
 Children.-.  ina does not ondone violene against children, and physical abuse
 can be grounds for criminal prosecution. In 1992 China's Law on the Protection of
 Juveniles was enacted. It forbids infanticide, as well as mistreatment or abandon-
 ment of children. The law also prohibits discrimination against handicapped minors
 emphasizes the importance of safety and morality, and codifies a variety of judicial
 protections for juvenile offenders. The Chinese press continues to report instances
 of child abuse, for example a December case in which a mother beat her daughter
 to death despite several prior warnings to stop abusing the child. In one case pub-
 licized in the Chinese press, a hospital successfully sued a father for abandoning
 his infant twin daughters soon after their birth. He was given a 1-year suspended
 sentence. Female and es pcally handicapped children represent a disproportionate
 percentage of those abandoned. Kidnaping and buying and sellingof children contin-
 ued to be a problem in some rural areas. China's extensive health care delivery sys-
 tem has led to a sharp decline in infant mortality rates and improved child health.
 According to Chinese media, China's infant mortality rate declined to 31 per 1,000
 live births in 1994.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoities.-The 55 designated ethnic minorities con-
 stitute just over 8 percent of China's total population. Most minority groups reside
 in areas they have traditionally inhabited, many of which are in mountainous or re-
 mote parts of China. China's minorities benefit from a policy of preferential treat-
 ment in marriage policy, family planning, university admission, and employment.
 While the standard of living for most minorities has improved in recent years, in-
 comes in these areas are often well below the national average. The Government
 has programs to provide low interest loans, subsidies, and special development
 
 
 568
 funds for minority areas. While these government development policies have helped
 raise minority living standards, they have also disrupted traditional living patterns.
 The central Government has tried to ado t policies responsive to minority sen-
 sitivities, but in doing so has encountered the dilemma of how to respect minority
 cultures without damaging minority educational and economic opportunities. In
 many areas with a significant population of minorities, there are two-track school
 systems using standard Chinese and minority languages. Students can choose which
 system to attend. One acknowledged side effect of this policy to protect and main-
 tain minority cultures has been reinforcement of a segregated society. Under this
 separate education system, those graduating from minority schools are at a dis-
 advantage when competing for jobs in government and business, which require good
 spoken Chinese. These graduates must take Chinese language instruction before at-
 tending universities and colleges.
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government and the party. Many minorities occupy local leadership positions,
 and a few have positions at the national level. However, in most areas, ethnic mi-
 norities are effectively shut out of most positions of real political and decisionmak-
 ing power. Some minorities resent Han officials holding-key positions in minority
 autonomous regions. Ethnic minorities in Tibet, Xinjiang, and elsewhere have at
 times demonstrated against Han Chinese authority. Central authorities have made
 it clear that they will not tolerate opposition to Communist Party rule in minority
 regions.
 eope With Disabilitie.-In 1990 China adopted legislation protecting the rights
 of China's 54.64 million disabled. However, as with many other aspects of Chinese
 society, reality for China's handicapped lags far behind the legal provisions. Mis-
 diagnosis, inadequate medical care, pariah status, and abandonment remain the
 norm for China's disabled population.
 Statistics on education reveal the inequity of resources afforded the handicapped
 in China: only 6 percent of disabled school children receive primary education. The
 illiteracy rate among the disabled is 60 percent, and school attendance averages
 only 20 percent for blind, deaf, or mentally retarded children.
 In May the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, headed by Deng Pufang,
 son of retired senior leader Deng Xiaoping, announced plans to raise the employ-
 ment rate and the education enrollment rate of the disabled to 80 percent by the
 year 2000, increase vocational training, and promote research on disabilities in
 China. All state enterprises are required to hire a certain number of disabled work-
 ers, but Chinese authorities estimate that 40 percent of disabled people are jobless.
 In May China adopted standards for making roads and buildings accessible for
 the handicapped. The 1990 Law on the Handicapped,however    als for "gradual"
 implementation of the standards. A low level of compliance with the regulations to
 date has resulted in limited access to most buildings for China's physically handi-
 cappd.
 T   new Maternal and Child Health Care Law passed in October postpones the
 marriage of persons with certain specified contagious diseases or certain acute men-
 tal illnesses such as schizophrenia. If doctors find that a couple is at risk of trans-
 mitting disabling congenital defects to their children, the couple may marry only if
 they agree to use birth control or undergo sterilization. The law mandates pre-
 marital and prenatal examination for genetic or contagious diseases, and it specifies
 that medically advised abortion or sterilization require the signed consent of the pa-
 tients or their guardians.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-China's 1982 Constitution provides for 'freedom of
 association," but this right is heavily diluted by references to the interest of the
 State and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The country's sole offi-
 cially recognized workers' organization, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 (ACFTU) is controlled by the Communist Party. Independent trade unions are ile-
 gal. Though ACFTU officials recognize that workers' interests may not always coin-
 cide with those of the Communist Party, the trade union law passed by the NPC
 in March 1992 stated that the ACFTU is a party organ, and itsprimaiy purpose
 is to mobilize workers for national development. The 1993 revised Trade Union Law
 required that the establishment of unions at any level be submitted to a higher level
 trade union organization for approval. The ACFTU, the highest level organization,
 has not approved the establishment of independent unions. Attempts to form or reg-
 ister independent unions have been severely repressed (see Section i.e. and 2.b..
 There are no provisions allowing for individual workers or unofficial worker organi-
 zations to affiate with international bodies. The vast majority of workers have no
 contact with any union other than the ACFTU.
 
 
 569
 Credible reports indicate that the Government has attempted to stamp out clan-
 destine union activity. In March a petition calling, among other thin   fr workers
 to have "freedom from exploitation," the right to strike, and the right to organize
 nonofficial trade unions was circulated in Be'ing. Chinese authorities later detained
 Zhou Guoi, (an associate of Han Dongfang, see Section 2.d.) Yuan Hongbing,
 and WangJiaqi after they presented the petition; Zhou was sentenced in September
 to 3 years reeducation through labor, although the charges against him were report-
 edly not linked to the petition. Accurate figures are not available on the number
 of Worker Autonomous Federation detainees still being held after the 1989
 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
 The ACFTUs primary attention remains focused on its traditional constituency,
 state sector workers. The Trade Union Law mandates that workers may decide
 whether to join the union in their enterprise. By official estimate, 10 percent of
 workers in collectively and state-owned enterprises have chosen for their own rea-
 sons not to join. There have been no reports of repercussions for workers who have
 not joined ACFTU unions. Diversification of enterprise types over the last decade
 of reform has vastly increased the number of workers outside the traditional sphere
 of the ACFTU. Over half of China's nonagricultural work force is now largely unor-
 ganized and outside the state industrial structure, in collectives, township and vil-
 lage enterprises, private and individual enterprises, and foreign-invested enter-
 prises. In township and village enterprises, one of the fastest growing sectors of the
 economy, only 0.1 percent of workers are organized in ACFTU affl'iates.
 Workers in companies with foreign investors are guaranteed the right to form
 unions, which must affiliate with the ACFTU. According to ACFTU statistics, 60
 percent of workers in foreign-invested companies had joined unions by December
 1994. Unofficial Embassy surveys suggest a more accurate estimate of unionization
 of employees in foreign-invested enterprises might be closer to 40 percent. According
 to press reports, 14 coastal provinces issued regulations requiring all foreign-in-
 vested enterprises to establish unions by the end of 1994. Enforcement of these reg-
 ulations appears to have been haphazard. Guangdong province, recipient of much
 of China's foreign investment, reported 40-percent unionization of foreign-invested
 enterprises in December 1994.
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975 and 1978 constitu-
 tions, was not retained in the 1982 Constitution. In general, the Union Law assigns
 unions the role of mediators or go-betweens with management in cases of work stop-
 pages or slowdowns. Nonetheless, work stoppages occurred in several locations in
 China during 1994. One of the largest well-ocumented cases occurred when 1,300
 workers in a foreign-invested enterprise in Shekou in Guangdong province struck
 over working conditions. Beginning in 1993, the Ministry of-Labor no longer offi-
 cially deniedthe existence of strikes in China. In 1994Ministry of Labor officials
 provided detailed statistics on the number and type of labor disputes. The statistics,
 based on Nationl        tion Center and Labor Bureau records, reveal a 50-percent
 increase in disputes in 1993. Ministry of Labor arbitration bureaus across China re-
 corded 12,358 disputes involving 34,794 workers. Of these, all hut 1,173 were initi-
 ated by workers. According to the Ministry of Labor, roughiy two-thirds of the dis-
 putes were settled through mediation or arbitration, 334 were taken to court, and
 244 resulted in strikes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The long-awaited National
 Labor Law, passed by the NPC's Standing Committee on July 5, permits workers
 in all types of enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The law, which will take
 effect January 1, 1995, supersedes a 1988 law that allowed collective bargaining
 only by workers in private enterprises. Some high-profile experiments in collective
 bargaining have been carried out at state enterprises, notably the Shanghai Number
 Five Iron and Steel Plant. In the past, the ACF7U has limited its role to consulting
 with management over wages and regulations affecting working conditions and
 serving as a conduit for communicating workers' complaints to management or mu-
 nicipal labor bureaus. The ACFTU has shown concern about protecting workers' liv-
 ng standards in areas such as unemployment insurance and argued in 1993 that
 the traditional definition of workers shouldb expanded to include peasants labor-
 ingin China's township and village enterprises.
 Before wage reform, workers' wages were set according to a uniform national
 scale, based on seniority and skills. Since wage reform, a total wage bill for each
 collective and state-owned enterprise is set by the Ministry of Labor according to
 four criteria: 1) as a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract amount with the local
 labor bureau, 3) for money losing enterprises, according to a state-set amount, or
 4) as an enterprise-set amount subject to Labor Ministry review. Individual enter-
 rises determine how to divide the total among workers, a decision usually made
 Ur the enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise party chief and the
 
 
 570
 ACFTU representative. Worker congresses (see below) have mandated authority to
 review plans for wage reform, though these bodies serve primarily as rubberstamp
 organizations. Wages are generally equal for the same type of work within enter-
 prises. Incentives are provided for increased productiviy. Under the new Labor
 Law, wages may be set according to conditions set out in collective contracts nego-
 tiated between ACFTU representatives and management. In practice, only the small
 number of workers with high technical skills can negotiate effectively on salary and
 fringe benefit issues.
 The old permanent employment system is increasingly giving way to a more flexi-
 ble contract-based system. Most workers in state-owned enterprises hired in the last
 3 years have signed individual contracts-a practice mandated by the new Labor
 Law-and a number of large enterprises have converted all workers to such con-
 tracts. Approximately 40 percent of state sector workers now work under contract,
 but the proportion of contract workers varies widely according to regional economic
 development. In Shanghai, 1.5 million workers, or 97.5 percent of all workers in
 state sector firms, have signed labor contracts. Contract arrangements are mere
 commn in township and village enterprises and many types of joint ventures. In
 collective enterprises below the provincial level, contract workers are a distinct mi-
 nority. China's new Labor Law provides for workers and employers at all types of
 enterprises to sign both collective and individual contracts. The former will be
 worked out between ACFTU or worker representatives and management and will
 specify such matters as working conditions, wage distribution, and hours of work.
 Individual contracts will then be drawn up in line with the terms of the collective
 contract.
 Worker congresses, held periodically in most Chinese enterprises, theoretically
 have the authority to remove incompetent managers and approve major decisions
 affecting the enterprise, notably wage and bonus distribution systems. However,
 worker congresses generally take place only once a year and serve essentially to ap-
 prove agreements worked out among factory managers, party secretaries, and
 ACFTU representatives. In smaller enterprises it is not unusual to find these three
 psts held by the same person.
 A dispute settlement procedure has been in effect since 1987. The procedure pro-
 vides for mediation, two levels of arbitration committees, and a final appeal to the
 courts. Of the 12,358 cases brought for arbitration in 1993, 64 percent were resolved
 at the first or second level. Less than 3 percent reached the courts. Approximately
 40 percent of the cases closed in 1993 were resolved in favor of the worker(s), 20
 percent in favor of management; the rest resulted in a compromise. According to
 Labor Ministry officials, most arbitration cases are fied by contract workers or their
 employers, indicati  they assert, that the new contract system provides a clearer
 set of ground rles witich both sides can attempt to enforce.
 The 1982 Trade Union Law prohibits antiunion discrimination and specifies that
 union representatives may not be transferred or terminated by enterprise manage-
 ment during their term of office. Unionized foreign businesses generally report prag-
 matic relations with ACFTU representatives. At its National Congress in October
 1993, the ACFTU set the goal of establishing unions in 50 percent of all foreign-
 funded enterprises by the end of 1994.
 Laws governing working conditions in China's special economic zones (SEZ's) are
 not significantly different from those in the rest of the country. However, wages in
 the SEZ's, and in southeastern China generally, are significantly higher than in
 other parts of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In addition to prisons and reform
 through labor facilities, which contain inmates sentenced through judicial proce-
 dures (see Section 1.c.), China also maintains a network of "reeducation through
 labor" campa, where inmates are sentenced through nonjudicial procedures (see Sec-
 tion I.e.). Inmates of reeducation through labor facilities are generally required to
 work. Reports from international human rights organizations and the foreign press
 indicate that at least some persons in pretrial detention are also required to work.
 Justice officials have stated that in reeducation through labor facilities there is a
 much heavier emphasis on education than on labor. Most reports conclude that work
 conditions in the penal system's light manufacturing factories are similar to those
 in ordinary factories, but conditions on farms and in mines can be harsh. As is the
 case in most Chinese workplaces, safety is not a high priority. There are no avail-
 able figures for casualties in prison industry.
 Some penal facilities contract with regular industries for prisoners to perform
 light manufacturing and assembly work. In 1991 the Government published a reit-
 eration of its regulations barring the export of prison-made goods. On August 7,
 1992, the US. and Chinese Governments signed a memorandum of understanding
 (MOU) prohibiting trade in prison labor products. A statement of cooperation detail-
 
 
 571
 ing specifc working procedures for implementation of the MOU was agreed to and
 signed on March 14, 1994.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--China's National Labor Law, effec-
 tive January 1, 1995, forbids employers to hire workers under 16 years of age and
 specifies administrative review, fines, and revocation of business licenses of those
 businesses that hire minors. In the interim, regulations promulgated in 1987 pro-
 hibiting the employment of school-age minors who have not completed the compul-
 sory 9 years of education continued in force. Ente ris inpecton and effective en-
 forcement of labor regulations is eanding. Officirals insist that increased diligence
 in monitoring temporary workers has successfully precluded widespread employ-
 ment of minors. Labor officials also report that employers were disciplined in 1994
 for infringement of child labor regulations, but such reports cannot be verified. In
 poorer isolated areas child labor in agriculture is widespread. Most independent ob-
 servers agree with Ciinese officials that, given its vast surplus of adult labor, urban
 child labor is a relatively minor problem in formal sectors of the economy. Rising
 dropout rates at secondaiy schools in some southern provinces and anecdotal reports
 suggest that children may increasingly be entering unregulated sectors of China's
 economy. No specific Chinese industry is identifiable as a significant violator of child
 labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The new Labor Law codifies many of the gen-
 eral principles of China's labor reform, setting out provisions on emplo. ent,labor
 contracts, working hours, wages, skill development and trainin, socmi insurance,
 dispute resolution, legal responsibility, supervision, and inspection. In anticipation
 of the Law's minimum wage requirements, many local governments already enforce
 regulations on minimum wages. Generally the wage levels have been set higher
 than the local poverty relief ceiling but lower than the current wage level of the av-
 erage worker. Minimum wage figures do not include free or heavily subsidized bene-
 fits which employers commonly provide in kind, such as housing, medical care, and
 education. Unemployment insurance schemes now cover a majority of urban work-
 ers (primarily state sector workers). Benefits from these funds are provided to laid
 off workers according to "local conditions," but unemployment subsidies generally
 equal 120 to 150 percent of the local hardship relief standard. Regularization of un-
 employment insurance coverle and administration in 1994 has served to decrease
 the incidence of nonpayment of severance allowances. Workers are eligible to receive
 unemployment relief funds for varying lengths of time, up to 24 months, according
 to length of service.
 In February the State Council reduced the national standard workweek from 48
 hours to 44 hours, excluding overtime, with a mandatory 24-hour rest period. A sys-
 tem of alternating weeks of 6- and 5-day workweeks began in March, with a 6-
 month grace period for implementation. The same regulations specified that cumu-
 lative monthly overtime could not exceed 48 hours. The Chinese press regularly re-
 ported cases of workers forced to work regular 12-and 14-hour days of forced over-
 time at foreign-invested enterprises, particularly in southeast China and the SEZ's.
 Occupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer, and the International
 Labor Organization has established a training program for these officials. The US.
 Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration is participating ac-
 tively in this program. Moreover, while the right to strike is not provided for in the
 1982 Constitution the Trade Union Law explicitly recognizes the right of unions to
 "suggest that staff and workers withdraw from sites of danger" and to participate
 in accident investigations. Labor officials reported that such withdrawals did occur
 in some instances during 1994. Nonetheless, pressures for increased output, lack of
 financial resources to maintain equipment, lack of concern by management, and a
 traditionally poor understanding of safety issues by workers have contributed to a
 continuing high rate of accidents. Statistics provided by the ACFTU indicate that
 11,600 workers were killed in industrial accidents from January to August of 1993,
 up 13 percent over the same period of 1992. One credible report indicates there are
 over 10,000 miners killed in accidents yearly. Fatal factory explosions, fires, and col-
 lapsing dormitories have been covered by both the domestic and foreign press. Offi-
 cials blame 60 percent of accidents on violation of safety regulations, particularly
 in the rapidly expanding rural, private, and foreign-invested enterprise sectors. In
 Guangdong, where 1,300 fires killed 329 people and injured 889 in 1993, the au-
 thorities announced in February new fines for enterprises that neglect safety pre-
 cautions. Negligent units will be fined 1 to 5 percent of the total losses they incur
 in any fire, $3,450 (RMB 30,000) for every worker killed, and $345 to $575 (RMB
 3,000 to 5,000) for each worker injured. Many factories using harmful products, such
 as asbestos, fail not only to protect their workers against the ill effects of such prod-
 ucts, but also fail to inform them about the potential hazards.
