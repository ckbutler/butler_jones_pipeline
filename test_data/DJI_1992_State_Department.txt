 DJIBOUTI
 In 1992 Djibouti remained a do facto one-party state ruled since independence in
 1977 by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Assembly for Progress
 (RPP). Djibouti is comprised of two main ethnic groups, the politically predominant
 Issa (the Somali origin tribe of the President) and the Afar (who are also numerous
 in Ethiopia). The Afars comprise the largest single tribe in Djibouti but are out-
 numbered by the combination of the Issa and other Somali ethnic elements (Issak
 and Gadaboursi). Starting in late 1991, a large-scale Afar insurgency began in the
 northern part of the country, led by the Front for the Restoration of Unity and De-
 mocracy (FRUD), which demands the formation of a transitional government and
 regional autonomy for the Afar in Djibouti. In addition, the FRUD is demanding the
 release of All Aref Bourhan, ex-president of Djibouti prior to independence, who re-
 mA~ni a nnlitieal nri.mnner of the current reinme. The fighting continued intermit-
 
 
 72
 tently throughout 1992, despite a unilateral FRUD cease-fire announced February
 28 which was later terminated.
 Largely in response to the insurgency, the President announced on Djibouti's na-
 tional day, June 27, a series of measures intended to institute "reasonable
 multipartyism" and a new democratic constitution. In a national referendum on Sep-
 tember 4, the proposed constitutional changes were accepted in the three largely So-
 mali districts, but most Afar in Djibouti-vi e and in the two northern districts did
 not parti ite. By late December, the Government had legalized, in addition to the
 ruling RPP, two opposition parties and carried out legislative elections in December
 again without Afar participation. Meaningful dialog between the Government and
 the FRUD did not occur in 1992. French attempts to bring the two sides together
 on November 20 failed when the FRUD refused to release its prisoners of war
 (POW's), a government precondition for talks. At President Gouled's insistence, the
 French army recalled its troops who were performing humanitarian assistance mis-
 sions in territory controlled by-the FRUD. The situation at year's end resulted in
 the de facto partition of Djibouti.
 Also in response to the insurgency, the size of the combined Djiboutian National
 Army (AND) and police agencies tripled, totaling nearly 15,000 men (with 8,000 in
 the AND alone.) The National Security Force (FNS) and the National Police are
 both under the Ministry of the Interior, the Gendarmerie (military police) are under
 the Ministry of Defense. There were no data available from the US. Arms Control
 and Disarmament Agency on Djibouti's total annual military expenditures. How-
 ever, defense spending is likely to increase in the near term as a result of the fight-
 ing with the FRUD. Rough estimates of expenditures for military salaries alone
 amount to over $1 million a month. With the increased buildup of security forces,
 there were numerous credible reports in 1992 of their mistreating civilians includ-
 ing gang-raping of women, often young girls brought in from neighboring Ethiopia.
 Djibouti's arid soil is unproductive, and there is virtually no industry- farmers
 who have not settled in Djibouti-ville eke out a living from animal husbandry. Com-
 merce and services for the 10,000 expatriate residents (mostly French, including
 3,800 military) and operation of the seaport and airport account for most of the
 gross domestic product. Although the State is the largest employer, people are free
 to pursue private business interests and to hold personal and real property.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1992, despite the introduction of the
 new Constitution and a multiparty political system. Many of the new Constitution's
 guarantees of personal liberties are conditioned on subsequent legislation that may
 circumscribe the scope of such freedoms. The Government carefully orchestrated the
 changes to preserve political power and, by forcing the constitutional referendum
 and legislative elections with little Afar participation, further exacerbated ethnic di-
 visions. Both government forces and the armed opposition FRUD committed serious
 human rights abuses during the sporadic fighting in 1992. In addition, the Govern-
 ment used arbitrary detention and unfair trials against political and labor officials,
 while continuing tight restrictions on freedoms of speech and press. Women and
 children are routiney neglected in Djiboutian society where rape is a common oc-
 currence, rarely punished and frequently pardoned. The Government's amnesty in
 June released a number of political detainees and prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killing in Djibouti. However, a grenade attack on the headquarters of
 the United Opposition Front seriously wounded a party official and led to claims of
 government targeting. Also, the fighting between the army and the FRUD produced
 civilian casualties and other violations of humanitarian law (see Section 1.g.).
 The Government did not initiate an investigation in 1992 into the December 18,
 1991; massacre of civilians in the AFAR quarter of Arhiba. A total of 47 civilians
 were killed outright or later died from wounds inflicted during this encounter with
 security forces.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known incidents of permanent disappearances
 in Djibouti during 1992, although government security forces detached along the
 Djibouti/Ethiopia border in the region of Ali Sabieh kidnaped Ethiopian women and
 held them forcibl in their camps where most were raped. According to the AFAR
 spokesman, 12 AAR remain missing following the December 18, 1991 incident.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The new Constitution affirms that "no one shall be subjected to torture, nor to other
 inhuman cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments." However, security forces
 continued to abuse detainees, mainly Afar and criminal suspects. In the past, inter-
 
 
 73
 rogation techniques included use of "the swing," by which victims are tied by their
 wrists and ankles to a horizontal pole and beaten all over the body. No action has
 been taken to pursue or prosecute those accused of torture in the past.
 In Obock, according to a report by the Association for the Respect of Human
 Rights and Liberties 1ADDHL), the security forces first detained, then raped and
 tortured a woman, Mrs. Hasna Mohamed Ali, who returned to her home m early
 March in a state of "mental disorder," according to government military officers.
 One or more members of the security forces sprayed her with gasoline and set her
 afire. She later died in Djibouti's public hospital where witnesses among medical
 personnel affirmed the accusations of torture and immolation, noting in particular
 marks on the hands and feet where she had been tied by her captors. Army Colonel
 Omar Barreh denied the accusations but reported to the press that the sergeant
 charged with monitoring Hasna during her incarceration in Obock was "sanctioned."
 Political prisoners reported mistreatment in 1992. Ali Aref Bourhan, a former prime
 minister and Djibouti's most notable political prisoner, was moved from his remote
 detention site in Ali Adde to the central prison in Djibouti-ville, but 3 months after
 his July 5 trial, the authorities temporarily denied him family visits, and he accused
 the Government of inhuman treatment. Ali Aref and several others of the group of
 12 political prisoners who remain incarcerated in Djibouti's central prison went on
 a hunger strike in early December to protest cruel treatment. According to Ali Aref's
 nephew, Aref Mohamed Aref, a human rights lawyer who was acquitted in July,
 prison guards fired a rifle in the direction of political prisoners while they were
 standing in the prison grounds. Several of those implicated in the Aref affair were
 taken to the hospital as a result of the hunger strike. In an apparent attempt to
 intimidate them, the Government on more than one occasion confined for a period
 FRUD spokesman Dr. Abbatte Ebo and another Afar political prisoner, Hassan Ali
 Mohamed Dalga, either in the central prison's crowded cell for common criminals
 or in cells for political prisoners.
 The Government permitted representatives of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) regular access to all security prisoners, whether civilian or mili-
 t.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Ministry of Interior regularly ignores
 criminal procedures which stipulate that the State may not detain a person for more
 than 48 hours without an examining magistrate's formal charge. In particular,
 ple who express views critical of the Government and the President of the Repurlic
 are frequently subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention. Ultimately, political de-
 tainees, such as in 1992 the President of ADDHL, Mohamed Houmed Souleh, are
 almost always accused of "offending the President of the Republic," a general charge
 used by government authorities to keep political opponents m detention.
 The Government continued in 1992 to detain Aar oppnents. Hssan Mohamed
 Ali Dalga, an Afar intellectual who published regular bulletins as head of a "support
 committee for the civilian victims of the nor," was arrested four times during
 1992. On April 27, he was fined approximately $600 for "defaming the president.
 Dalga wa arrested on June 8 and detained until the end of the month in the "Bri-
 gade Du Nord" for publishing a document on the army's pillaging of the northern
 town of Obock. The Goverent judged Dalga's tract on the incident to be offensive.
 Meanwhile, Mohamed Houmed Suleh was arrested on June 15, along with Abdi
 Moumin Ardeh, the editor of a political tract Le Marginale, following a demonstra-
 tion during which they demanded the release of Hassan Dalga. Dalga was arrested
 again in late July following his release on July 13 at the concluson of the Aref
 Trial.
 On December 20, the FNS dispersed a political rally organized by an opposition
 party, the Democratic Renewal Party (PRD), led by Mohamed Djama Elabe. At least
 10 civilians were wounded severely when the FINS fLred tear gas cannisters directly
 into the crowd. The FNS detained nearly 50 PRD supporters but released them on
 December 23. At year's end, other than the Aref group, there were no known politi-
 cal prisners.
 The Government announced a general amnesty on June 23 for members of the
 FRUD or those otherwise participating in the insurrection (see Section 1.g.). On
 July 9, the President pardoned five political opponents who had been exiled, includ-
 ing Aden Roblh Awaleh, a former minister who left Djibouti in 1986. Aden Robleh
 Awalh returned to Djibouti in September and subsequently received permission to
 form a political part, the National Democratic Party (PND).
 e. Denial of weir Public Trial.-Dwjibouti s legal system is a mixture of Djiboutian
 legislation and executive decrees, French codifed law ado pted at independence,
 Shari'a (Islamic law), traditions of the native nomadic peoples, and the new Con-
 stitution modeled on the French Constittion of the Fifth Republic. Crimes in urban
 areas are dealt with according to French-inspired law and judicial practice in the
 
 
 regular courts. Civil actions may be brought in the regular courts, or in traditional
 court according to tribal customs.
 The new Constitution states that 'all individuals have the right to life, liberty,
 and the security and integrity of person." It also declares that the accused is inno-
 cent until proven guilty, has the right to legal counsel, and the right to be examined
 by a doctor if imprisoned. Imprisonment can occur only if an arrest decree is pre-
 sented by a judicial magistrate. In practice, however, security forces tend to arrest
 people without warrants during demonstrations or other political events.
 The judiciary is not independent of the executive. The State Security Court tries
 those accused of crimes with political implications and whom the President of the
 Republic judges to be a menace to the security of the State. On July 5, one of the
 best known of Djibouti's political prisoners   Ali Aref Bourhan    and his 48
 codefendents were tried in the Security Court. 6nly 15 of the accused were actually
 present for the trial, however. The proceedings were open to the public, and all de-
 fendants were represented by legal counsel. Indeed, Aref was accorded a postpone-
 ment in order to better prepare his defense. There were troubling circumstances re-
 lated to the trial, however. The defense claimed that most of the Government's evi-
 dence was obtained through torture or other forms of coersion, including illegal de-
 tention and nonstop interrogations without legal counsel. Defense attorneys were
 denied access to government evidence and the presiding judge, who is a political ap-
 pointee, ruled corroborating testimony about evidence being extracted under duress
 to be inadmissable. Ali Aref Bourhan was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the
 State and given a 10-year sentence. The Court acquitted Ali Aref's nephew, Aref
 Mohamed Aref, a lawyer and member of the Djiboutian bar, but sentenced nine oth-
 ers to 10 years' imprisonment. The Court's decisions may now be appealed to the
 Supreme Court. In November Ali Arefs brother and a nephew were arrested on
 charges of conspiring to overthrow the Government by force. They had not been
 brought to trial by year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were-no reported incidents of such interference outside areas of conflict. The new
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and
 communications. Telephone service to opponents of the regime , including legal op-
 position parties and Afar leaders, is routinely cut without explanation.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-The conflict between government armed forces and the Afar-led insurgency
 began in the fall of 1991 when the FRUD attacked an army outpost in the northern
 town of Randh. Fighting continued sporadically throughout 1992 despite a unilateral
 cease-fire announced by the FRUD on February 28, 1992, and later retracted. In the
 course of fighting for control of the northern towns of Tadjoura, Obock and Yoboki,
 the National Army maintained the offensive, but in the process killed several per-
 sons and forced the civilian populations to flee from these towns.
 In the conflict, the FRUD cut water supplies to the towns of Obock and Tadjoura
 (where a sizable civilian population remains). The Government, in turn, blockaded
 the north by refusing to allow nomads from the interior to provision themselves
 from coastal ports. Following the FRUD cease-fire, the Government opened Tadjoura
 to camel traffic from the interior and welcomed the French military as cease-fire ob-
 servers and liaison between the two sides. The French military also provided food
 aid and medical assistance to the civilians in the north until December 1992.
 In April the FRUD released some 60 civilians who were being held hostage in the
 north. Later in June the Government announced a general amnesty for those who
 agreed to put down their arms. The Government freed FRUD spokesman Dr. Abatte
 Ebo and 13 other POW's on June 29. Eight of the POW's were deported to the Ethio-
 pian border on the grounds that they did not hold Djiboutian nationality documents.
 The ICRC arranged a reciprocal release of 13 government soldiers held by the
 FRUD on August 9. The FRUD released another 25 on November 15 but continued
 to hold 31 others at year's end. French military officials, the ICRC, and family mem-
 bers had regular access to the POW's in the north and reported no mistreatment
 of those held by the FRUD; however, the FRUD's failure to release the remaining
 POW's stalled French mediation efforts to resolve the conflict in Djibouti.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Pending implementation of Article 15 of the
 newly adopted constitution, these freedoms are seriously restricted. Throughout
 most of 1992, those who exhressed public views critical of the Government or caus-
 ing offense to the President routinely faced arrest and detention for substantial pe-
 riods of time before being tried on charges of defamation. For example, the Govern-
 ment convicted two labor leaders for issuing a bulletin critical of official policies (see
 Section 6.a.). Despite the restrictions on free political expression, critics of the re-
 
 
 75
 gime published clandestine tracts that circulate widely in Djibouti. When appre-
 hendedthe authors of such tracts were routinely jailed. The newspapers of
 Djibouti's two opposition parties circulated freely following the legalization of the
 parties themselves in September.
 Djibouti's radio and television stations and one newspaper La Nation a French-
 language weekly, are all government owned and operated While the official media
 report on social and national development problems in Djibouti, such as AIDS and
 female circumcision, they to not criticize the Government itself. The official press
 is censored. The editor-in-chief of La Nation was reprimanded and reassigned to
 lesser duties in December 1991, reportedly for speaking with Afar opposition-leaders
 and reporting on the Arhiba massacre to 4ence France Presse.
 The Government does not interfere with foreign broadcasts and as far as is
 known, did not prevent in 1992 the distribution of publications from abroad in
 Djibouti-ville nor detain those seen in possession of suchpublications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government effectively
 bans political pretest by selective enforcement of public assembly laws in spite of
 the freedom of assembly provisions of the new Constitution. Periodically the Gov-
 ernment closes public meeting places, such as cafes in which political discussions
 occur. The Government legalized two opposition parties in 1992, the PND and the
 PRD. It did not allow two other opposition parties to participate in the December
 legislative election campaign. Mohamed Moussa 'our-Tour", whose Movement for
 Unity and Democracy (MUD) was not legalized, reported that at least seven of his
 supporters were arrested when they attempted to launch a public protest. The cri-
 teria for legalization of political parties are not publicly known, but Article 6 of the
 Constitution stipulates that political parties may not be based on race, ethnic group,
 sex, religion, region, or language. In practice, the ruling party determines which op-
 position parties can be legaied
 On Febua     13, the Government notified the Association for the Respect of
 Human Rights and Lib)erties that it would not be granted legal status because the
 Minister of Interior judged that its leadership "is not of the high caliber that such
 a mission (defending human rights) demands." The President of ADDHL as well as
 the President of the Movement for Civilian Victims, Hassan Ali Mohamed Dalga,
 were both imprisoned repeatedly in 1992 for criticizing the Government's human
 rights record.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim, but the Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose
 to ignore Islamic teachings on such matters as diet, alcohol consumption, and reli-
 ous fasting. The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant,
 Greek Orthodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries
 may perform charitable works, but proselytizing is a highly sensitive issue and,
 while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Internal travel in Djibouti has been disrupted by civil war, making
 movement between the north and south of Djibouti nearly impossible. Djiboutians
 may emigrate to foreign countries without restriction or interference, except for
 travel to Israel. In 1992 Djibouti lifted restrictions on travel to South Africa. A sig-
 nificant number of Djiboutians have emigrated to Canada, often on the pretext of
 being Somali refugees. In one notable case the Government refused to accept entry
 of a Djiboutian national deported by Canadian immigration authorities as an illegal
 immigrant.
 Djibouti hosts almost 100,000 refugees, according to government sources. This
 amounts to approximately a fifth of the total population of Djibouti. The vast major-
 ity of these refugees come from Somalia, although some are from Ethiopia. The rec-
 ognized refugee camps house 20,000 people, but the majority live in D ibouti-ville,
 where they have no refugee status. The Government regularly deports illegal immi-
 grants and refugees from neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia.
 In October the Government, instead of deporting refugees to Ethiopia and Somalia
 or to refugee camps within Djibouti, forced a number of these refugees to work for
 Djiboutian military forces in northern Djibouti. Delivery of adequate assistance to
 refugee camps has been stymied by corruption. There is thus little incentive for ref-
 ugees to go to the camps rather than eke out an existence in Djibouti-vie.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability peacefully to change the government through
 democratic means. The President and the RPP continued to dominate the political
 process in 1992, forcing political changes which further alienated a large portion of
 the citizenry. The referendum to adopt a new constitution permitting "reasonable
 
 
 76
 multipartyism," and the December legislative elections took place largely without
 Afar voter participation and with some fraud; for example, in the northern districts
 of Obock, the Government claimed that 38 ercent of Obock's 9,800 registered voters
 participated in the referendum when in fact the city was largely devoid of inhab-
 itants.
 Djibouti's Afar and Somali opposition groups boycotted the President's referendum
 on a new constitution on the grounds that it was drafted without consulting those
 outside the current regime. Nonetheless, two Somali opposition leaders formed legal
 parties, but only the PRD contested the December 18 legislative elections. The PRD
 was successful in attracting broad-based support--outside of clan affiliation-and
 for the first time brought women into the leadership of the party. Two women were
 among PRD's candidates in the legislative elections, which was also a first in
 Djiboutian politics. The other opposition party, the PND, declined to participate on
 the grounds that the regime had not created the conditions for a free and fair elec-
 tion. The opposition parties did not have access to the lists of registered voters nor
 access to information on the location and number of polling booths until the eve of
 the election. The official results of the December 18 election gave the ruling party
 75 percent of the popular vote and all 65 parliamentary seats.
 In general, the Afar refused to participate in the December election and held a
 peaceful demonstration to protest the Government's choice of dates: the anniversary
 of the 1991 massacre of Afar civilians in Arhiba.
 The impetus for political change has been the armed insurgency led by the FRD.
 The FRUD boycotted the September referendum and the December elections on the
 grounds that the Constitution and related laws were drafted by the ruling Somali
 elites without the input of Afar opponents. The FRUD, however, in its continued re-
 jection of President Gouled's amnesty and its refusal to participate in party politics,
 hsmarginalized Afar politicians and committed them to further civil war. Neither
 the current regime nor FRUD has demonstrated willingness to negotiate to resolve
 political differences and assure adequate Afar representation in the democratic proc-
 ess. In addition to the FRUD, there is the United Opposition Front, which is com-
 prised of Afar politicians and ex-parliamentarians as well as representatives of the
 other fringe parties representing the Somali Issak and Gadaboursi minorities. The
 leadership of both the PRD and the PND used to belong to the United Opposition
 Fron    t were dropped from the organization when they agreed to participate in
 President Gouled's democratization process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is openly hostile to domestic human rights groups. As noted, it
 refused to recognize the Association for the Respect of Human Rights and Liberties
 and arrested its leaders who had been critical of government policies in the north.
 Ministry of Interior officials view any human rights association as a political body
 and hence treat it as an opposition group.
 The Government has been cooperative with some international organizations and
 nongovernmental organizations, notably the ICRC, which has access to the central
 p risn and interedes on behalf of civilians and POW's in the conflict between the
 overnment and the FRUD. Through ICRC's good offices (accepted by bth the Gov-
 ernent and the FRUD), prisoners of war on both sides were released in 1992.
 The most notable occasion for international human rights organizations to visit
 Djibouti in 1992 was te    the   riat      preindepe ndence leader of Djibouti,
 AliAref Bourhan, an Afar accused of attempting a coup detat in January 1991. The
 State Security Court trial was attended by representatives of international human
 rights organizations and members of the diplomatic corps.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Djibouti is a nation of immigrants from neighboring Somalia and Ethiopia. Most
 of its citizens flocked to thisTormer French enclave in search of economic oiportuni-
 ties following independence in 1977. The new Constitution states in Article 2 that
 the Republic of Djibouti does not discriminate based on language, race, sex, or reli-
 gion." Many government leaders, including the President, were born outside the cur-
 rent borders of the Republic.
 The Government pursued discriminatory policies in 1992. The Issa (the dominant
 Somali clan in Djibouti) control the ruling RPP, the civil service, and the military
 as a result of the President's policy of assigning key positions of authority to mem-
 bers of his tribal group  an  in particular to a powerful cohort of advisers in the
 Presidency and his Cabinet. The Presidents subclan, the Mammasan, is particularly
 strong, wielding disproportionate power in the affairs of the State. Perquisites and
 
 
 77
 corruption have created a class of wealthy bureaucrats of all major tribes who live
 far beyond the means of the ordinary Djiboutian.
 Women in Djibouti legally possess full civil rights but traditionally play a second-
 ary role in public life and do not have the same educational opportunities as men.
 Women are active in small trade, as well as in the clerical and secretarial fields.
 There are only a few women in the professions (civil service, judiciary, teaching, and
 medicine) and security services.
 According to medical personnel, violence against women - including rape and
 wife beating-occurs and appears to be on the increase in Djibouti. Most domestic
 and community violence is considered a family or clan matter, however, the inci-
 dence of gang rape indicates that violence against women is no longer controlled by
 traditional authorities. Very few crimes against women, including rape, are pun-
 ished. Man times the perpetrators are pardoned or serve at most short sentences.
 While the Government has begun to address the crime issue (primarily by deporting
 illegal immigrants and refugees), it has not addressed violence against women or
 children specifically. Child abuse also occurs in Djibouti and is lightly punished. In
 instances m which children are raped or otherwise abused, the perpetrator is fined
 for the cost of medical care given to the injured child.
 The RPP-affiliated Djiboutian National Women's Union (LJNFD) began an edu-
 cational campaign against female genital mutilation (circumcision), particularly
 infibulation, the most dangerous form in 1988. The campaign has had only a mar-
 *nal impact on this pervasive custom. According to an independent expert in the
 Field, the percentage of Djiboutian women who have undergone this procedure may
 be as high as 90 percent.
 Judicial reforms enacted in 1991 stipulate that anyone found responsible for geni-
 tal mutilation of young girls could face 5 years in prison and a heavy frine. To date,
 no one has been convicted of such crimes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided they comply with legally prescribed requirements.
 Less than 20 percent of persons in the wage economy are union members. The orga-
 nized labor movement is still in its infancy. Many unions represent employees of
 only a single private or state-owned enterprise. The Government exerted control
 over individual unions through the state-organized labor central, the General Union
 of Djiboutian Workers (UGTD). In 1992, however, a new union confederation, the
 Democratic Labor Union (UDT), came into being, initially to oppose a 10-percent
 "patriotic tax" (war tax) imposed on all workers by the Government. Its success has
 since forced the UGTD into relative obscurity, but the Government retaliated
 against Ahmed Djama Egueh "Obeley" and Mahamoud Ali Boulaleh, founders of the
 UDT. They were detained and later tried and convicted for having issued a bulletin
 critical of government policies on May 1, 1992.
 A wildcat strike called by a bus drivers' union provoked a government clampdown
 later in May, calling into question workers' freedom to strike.
 The UGTD is affiliated with the pan-African trade union body, the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity. Unions are free to maintain relations and exchange
 programs with unions and labor organizations in other countries. The UDT has ap-
 plied for affiliation with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, but
 the application is still pending.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the law recognizes
 labor's right to organize and bargain collectively, in practice, collective bargaining
 virtually does not exist. Relations between employers and workers are informal and
 paternalistic. Wages are in practice established unilaterally by employers on the
 basis of Ministry of Labor guidelines. When disputes about wages or health and
 safety issues anse, the Ministry of Labor encourages direct, adho resolution by
 labor representatives and employers. Either workers or employers may initiate a
 formal administrative hearing mediated by the labor inspection service of the Min-
 istry of Labor.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-By law, there is neither forced nor
 compulsory labor in Djibouti; however, Djiboutian security forces oblige illegal immi-
 grants to work for them in lieu of deportation (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age of 14
 years is generally respected; the paucity of inspectors from the Ministry of Labor
 makes it unlikely that investigations are ever carried out, according to union
 sources. Children may and do work in family owned businesses, such as restaurants
 anti amaii ahnna. in.ludina at night. Children are not emploved under hazardous
 
 
 conditions. Many of the beggar in Djibouti are young children whose parents forced
 them out onto the street to beg for a living.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage rates are specified by govern-
 ment regulations according to occupational categries and are enforced by the Min-
 istry of Labor. Last increased in 1980, minimum wages cover a broad range of jobs.
 They do not provide adequate compensation necessary to maintain a minimum
 standard of living, however. Many workers also receive housing and transportation
 allowances in addition to mandatory seniority bonuses. Djibouti is one of the world's
 poorest nations. Only a tiny minority are employed, and a fraction of those receive
 a wage adequate to provide a family with a decent standard of living.
 By law the standard workweek is 40 hours, often apread over 6 days. Overtime
 pay regulations are in effect. Workers are guaranteed daf"y and weekly rest periods
 and paid annual vacations. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for occupational
 health and safety standards, wages, andwork hours. Enforcement of these stand-
 ards, however, is ineffective. Workers face hazardous working conditions, particu-
 larly in the port, but rarely protest as they fear being replaced by others willing
 to accept the risks.
