 CAMBODIA
 Cambodia completed its second year under democratic rule after 20 years of un-
 democratic regimes and civil war. The transition to a democratically elected govern-
 ment followed the signing of the Paris Peace Accords by Cambodia's rival factions
 in 1991, which led to free and fair elections administered by the United Nations in
 May 1993, and the promulgation of a constitution in September 1993. The Royal
 Cambodian Government is a coalition composed primarily of the FUNCINPEC
 Party, which won the majority of votes in the 1993 election, and the Cambodian
 People's Party (CPP), which had ruled the country since the ouster of the Khmer
 Rouge by the Vietnamese in 1979. The leader of FUNCINPEC, Prince Norodom
 Ranariddh, and former State of Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen of the CPP are
 first and second Prime Ministers, respectively. King Norodom Sihanouk is the con-
 stitutional monarch and Head of State. Most power lies with the executive branch;
 the judiciary is not independent in practice. The Khmer Rouge, which signed the
 Paris Accords but refused to implement them, continue to wage a mostly low-level
 guerrilla insurgency against the Government.
 The police have primary responsibility for internal security, but the Royal Cam-
 bodian Armed Forces (RCAF), including the military police, also have domestic secu-
 rity responsibilities. In early 1995, the Government started efforts to integrate
 19 000 former FUNCINPEC and Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP) person-
 nel into the police force. The Government also continued to implement an ambitious
 
 
 567
 reform plan to improve RCAF performance. Members of the security forces commit-
 ted human rights violations, for which they were rarely prosecuted.
 Cambodia has a market economyr in which approximately 80 percent of the popu-
 lation engage in subsistene farming, with rice as the principal crop. The country
 has a small, but growing, garment industry; timber and rubber are the principal ex-
 ports. In April, in an attempt to stp illegal timber-cutting activities, the Govern-
 meat imposed a ban on exports of round timber and rough-cut lumber. Foreign aid
 is an important source of national income. Cambodia is a poor country, with a per
 capita gross domestic product of approximately $275 annualy
 The human rights situation worsened in several respects, including tolerance for
 opposition views, but it continued to be better than during previous regimes. There
 continued to be reports of numerous abuses, including political intimidation and in-
 stances of extrajudicial killings. There were also credible reports that members of
 the security forces beat detainees. Prison conditions remained poor, and prolonged
 detention was a problem. The Government lacked the resources or the political will
 to act aggressively against individuals, particularly members of the military, who
 were responsible for such abuses. The Government imposed some restrictions on
 freedom of expression and prosecuted several journalists critical of the Government.
 These cases, as well as the removal of an outspoken member of Parliament by his
 party and a grenade attack at an opposition party headquarters, led to concern that
 the Government was becoming less tolerant of opposing views. Emerging democratic
 institutions, particularly the judiciary, still are weak. The judiciary is subect to in-
 fluence by the executive and marred by inefficiency, lack of training, a shortage of
 resources, and corruption related to low wages. People were effectively denied the
 right to a fair trial. The ethnic Vietnamese minority faced widespread discrimina-
 tion and some violence, and people with disabilities also faced societal discrimina-
 tion. Abuse of children is common. Persons living in Khmer Rouge zones were de-
 nied virtually all political rights and were subject to serious human rights abuses
 by the Khmer Rouge leadership.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--There was no evidence of a govern-
 ment-spnsored campaign of violence, but there was one reported case of a killing
 by government agents for political reasons. In February two local militia members
 from Mong Russey district, Battambang, were arrested for killing two suspected
 Khmer Rouge members. They were released pending trial in May but were never
 tried. There were reports that the military pressured the court to release the sus-
 pects.
 There were a number of credible reports that members of government security
 forces committed extrajudicial killings. The authorities made few arrests in connec-
 tion with these crimes, due to a combination of ineffectiveness of law enforcement,
 intimidation of civilian authorities by the military, and in some cases a lack of prs-
 ecutrial vigour.
 For example, Sath Soeun, an RCAF officer in Kompng Chain province, was impli-
 cated in the killing of a 16-year-old by in July. A warrant was issued for his arrest,
 but he was not apprehended. Sath Soeun was also implicated in a number of other
 crimes, including killing journalist Chan Darn (see 1994 report) for which he was
 imprisoned for several months before being tried and acquitted.
 May fisheries department officials shot and kiled a fisherman in Kompng
 Chnang. Officials claimed that they had intended to fire a warning shot after the
 bat ignored calls to stp. The victim's family did not file charges against the offi-
 cials but received a small cash settlement.
 There was little progress in the investigation of cases of extrajudicial killing in
 1994. For example, there were no further developments in the unsolved 1994 killing
 of journalst Nuon Chan.
 The Khmer Rouge continued to execute summarily civilians in areas under its
 control. The Khmer Rouge also continued to carry out its policy, announced in 1994,
 to execute systematically government officials in the countryside. On May 20, ap
 proximately 30 Khmer Rou      C enred a village in Kompong hom province and ired
 on villagers, killing 4 ethnic Vietnamese and a Khmer policeman. In July a
 Sihanoukville court found a former Khmer Rouge soldier guilty of the November
 1994 murders of three foreign tourists. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison along
 with five other Khmer Rouge members who were tried in absentia.
 In January an American tourist and a Cambodian guide traveling outside the
 Angkor Wat Temple complex were killed in an ambush by a group of bandits which
 may have included Khmer Rouge. Several people were arrested, tried, and sen-
 
 
 568
 tenced to long prison terms in connection with these killings. Other suspects in the
 killings, however, escaped from the Siem Reap prison and were tried and convicted
 in absentia.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, there was one known instance in which RCAF officers abducted a farmer
 from ?ompong Chnang province and then moved him to an unknown location. He
 has not been heard of-since. The military officials acknowledged taking the farmer
 into custody for suspected links to the Khmer Rouge but claimed that he had es-
 caped.
 Te Khmer Rouge often abducted people for periods of 2 weeks to a month, mostly
 to serve as porters. In Koh Kong province, over 40 people disappeared and were as-
 sumed to have been killed by the Khmer Rouge in a revenge attack following at-
 tacks by government troops.
 Beginning in mid-1995, there were several kidnapings of foreign Asian business-
 men; most of whom were subsequently released. An executive at a large casino was
 abducted and held for 2 days before being rescued by the police. Seven people, in-
 cluding a military police officer, were arrested in the case but had not been tried
 byyears end.
 There were no developments in the disappearances of 17 political party activists
 before the May 1993 election, which United Nations personnel attributed to authori-
 ties of the former State of Cambodia.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government does not systematically use torture, but there were credible reports
 that security officials often severely beat criminal detainees, particularly during in-
 terrogation. In one particularly egregious case, police beat severely a 15-year-old
 suspected of theft and his mother. The mother had internal inuries as a result. The
 poice later returned to the home of the 15-year-old, beat and  tortured him, includ-
 ing use of electric shck, and took him into police custody, where he was held for
 3 days without food andi water. Police denied wrongdoing in connection with the
 case and the authorities took no action against the perpetrators.
 A pregnant woman arrested for theft was reportedly slapped, burned with ciga-
 rettes, and denied food by the police in an attempt to extract a confession. She was
 released on bail after she began to hemorrhage, and suffered a miscarriage shortly
 thereafter.
 A human rights worker reported that, following a prison break in Siem Reap in
 May, prison officials severely beat the prisoners who were rearrested. One prisoner
 was reportedly shot twice in the leg after surrendering. The police often use exces-
 sive force in the apprehension of criminal suspects. In August four foreigners were
 shot and injured by police and soldiers while they were riding motorcycles past the
 house of the second Prime Minister. The security personnel claimed that they had
 mistaken the victims for thieves after they ran a roadblock. By the end of the year,
 no action had been taken against the perpetrators. Four men, three of whom worked
 as bodyguards for opposition politician Sam Rainsy, reported that they were taken
 on the night of July 13 to a military facility by 30 to 40 soldiers and beaten and
 interrogated for 16 hours. The men stated that during the interrogation, the soldiers
 tried to extract a statement linking Rainsy with the Khmer Rouge.
 The Government continued efforts to improve prison conditions albeit with limited
 financial resources. Conditions in many prisons remained poor. The U.N. Human
 Rights Center, the U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative for human
 rights, and an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) cited a number
 of serious problems including overcrowding, food and water shortages, and poor se-
 curity. Human rights workers reported that the practice of using shackles and hold-
 ing prisoners in small, dark cells, widespread in the State of Cambodia period but
 virtually eliminated by the U.N. Transition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), had
 resumed in some prisons. However, the Government allowed human rights groups
 to visit prisons and to provide human rights training to prison guards. Although an
 alleged illegal detention facility in Battambang province was closed in 1994, there
 were unconfirmed reports of the existence of small, illegal detention facilities in sev-
 eral provinces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-A Penal Code drafted by UNTAC and ap-
 proved by the interim Supreme National Council remains in effect, as does a Crimi-
 nal Procedure Law dating from the State of Cambodia period. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Law in theory provides adequate protection for criminal suspects, but in prac-
 tice the Government frequently ignored these provisions.
 Although lengthy detention without charge is illegal, suspects are often held for
 long periods before being charged. Accused persons are legally entitled to a lawyer,
 although in practice they often have no access to legal representation. In family
 cases, the parties are denied by law the right to have legal representation. Prisoners
 
 
 are routinely held for several days before gaining access to a lawyer or family mem-
 bers. There is a bail system, although many prisoners, particularly those without
 legal representation, often have no opportunity to seek release on bail. The introduc-
 tion into the legal system of a corps of noawyer pro bono defenders, trained by
 NGO's, resulted in significant improvements for those defendants who were pro-
 vided with counsel, including a reduction in the pretrial detention period and im-
 proved access to bail.
 The Government did not generally use detention without charge as a means of
 political control; however, there was one case in which six persons were detained
 for the paceful expression of political views. On the night of August 5, the Govern-
 ment apprehended six persons who were distributing political leaflets critical of the
 Government, accusing them of "incitement" and imprisoning them for 6 weeks be-
 fore a court released them unconditionally. In October police in Kompong Chain
 province arrested a policeman who was making insulting remarks about First Prime
 Minister Ranariddh in a restaurant while intoxicated. luman rights workers who
 followed up on the case stated that the policeman was imprisoned for several weeks
 and then held under administrative detention before being released in December.
 In November FUNCINPEC Secreta7 General Norodom Sirivudh was arrested for
 alleged involvement in an assassination plot against Second Prime Minister Hun
 Sen. Human rights groups expressed concern about several aspects of his detention,
 including the fact that he was held under house arrest for several days before his
 parliamentary immunity was lifted by the National Assembly. Sirivudh was allowed
 to depart for France in December while investigation of the case still continued.
 Exile is prohibited by the Constitution and not practiced.
 No legal system is known to exist in Khmer Rouge zones. Khmer Rouge forces
 often seize hostages in order to intimidate villagers into cooperating with them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, in practice the Government does not ensure due process and an
 independent judiciary. The courts are subject to influence by the executive, and
 there is widespread corruption among judges who do not receive a living wage. Ci-
 vilian courts are often unable to try members of the military. In a report issued in
 September, Justice Michael Kirby, the U.N. Secretary General's Special Representa-
 tive in Cambodia, highlighted the need for judicial reform, including increased sala-
 ries for judges, as one of the most pressing human rights issues in Cambodia.
 The court system consists of lower courts, an appeals court, and a Supreme Court.
 The Constitution also mandates a Constitutional Council, which is empowered to re-
 view the constitutionality of laws, and a Supreme Council of Magistrates, which ap-
 points and disciplines judges. These two bodies have not yet been established. A se-
 rious lack of resources and poor training contribute to inefficiency in the judicial
 branch. For example, judges often lack copies of the laws on which they are sup-
 posed to hand down rulings. The judiciary as a whole is marred by the lack of a
 clear and consistent set of procedures by which a case makes its way through the
 system. As a result of these weaknesses in the judicial system, people were often
 effectively denied the right to a fair trial.
 There is also a military court system, which suffers from the same deficiencies
 as the civilian court system.
 The courts often pressure victims of crimes to accept small cash settlements from
 the accused. When a case does make its way to court, the verdict is often deter-
 mined by a     e before the case is heard, sometimes on the basis of a bribe by the
 accuser or the defendant. Sworn, written statements from witnesses and the accused
 are usually the extent of evidence presented in trials. Often these statements result
 from beatings or threats by investigating officials, and illiterate defendants are often
 not informed of the content of written confessions they are forced to sign. In cases
 involving the military, military officers often exert pressure on judges to have the
 defendant released.
 Trials are public. Defendants have the right to be present and the right to consult
 with an attorney. The serious shortage of attorneys is somewhat alleviated by the
 provision of nonlawyer defenders by the Government or, more frequently, human
 rights organizations. In June the National Assembly passed a bar statute that al-
 lows NGO-trained defenders to practice through 1997. Defendants are allowed to
 confront and question witnesses against them and to present witnesses and evidence
 on their own behalf. However, trials are typically perfunctory (about an hour on av-
 erage), and extensive cross-examination usually does not take place.
 Defendants are legally entitled to a presumption of innocence and the right of ap-
 eal. However, because of extensive corruption, defendants are often expected to
 ribe the judge for a favorable verdict and therefore are effectively denied the pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 570
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not coerce or forbid membership in political organizations. How-
 ever, membership in the Khmer Rouge, which is conducting an armed insurgency
 against the Government, is illegal. There were unconfirmed reports that the Govern-
 ment arbitrarily monitored private electronic communication including in the case
 of Prince Sirividh (see Section 1.d.). According to human rights observers, the police
 routinely conducted warrantless searches and seizures. Although people are largely
 free to live where they wish, there were reports that the municipali of Phnom
 Penh had forcibly removed over 1,000 indigent and homeless persons from Phnom
 Penh to rural areas in July; many of them subsequently returned to Phnom Penh.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Fighting between government forces and the Khmer Rouge insurgency con-
 tinued. As in previous years, many civilians were killed or wounded by indiscrimi-
 nate shelling and by land mines laid by both sides. Villages were subjected to burn-
 ing and looting by the Khmer Rouge. These attacks escalated following an October
 1994 Khmer Rouge policy decision to harass local officials and terrorize the local
 population. The media reported that more than 40 villagers were killed in Koh Kong
 province in a May campaign against persons suspected of being spies. An NGO re-
 ported in March that since October 1994, the Khmer Rouge forced between 40,000
 and 60,000 villagers to leave their homes, following campaigns to loot, burn, and
 destroy property. On April 20, guerrillas loosely affiliated with the Khmer Rouge at-
 tacked a Chinese-owned rock crushing plant on Phnom Srang Mountain, killing two
 Chinese workers and injuring a third.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, press and publication, but the Government sometimes limits press freedom in
 practice. The Constitution implicitly limits free speech by requiring that speech not
 adversely affect public security. The Constitution also declares that the King is "in-
 violable.* A press law that went into effect in September provided journalists with
 a number of rights, including a prohibition on prepublication censorship and the
 right not to be imprisoned for ex ressing opinion. However, the law included a
 vaguely worded prohibition on publishing articles that affect national security and
 political stability. These provisions were strongly criticized by human rights groups
 and journalists. The Government pledged to issue a new law or subdecree defining
 these terms, but had not done so by year's end.
 Cambodia's news organizations, including approximately 50 newspapers, re-
 mained active. Most newspapers were independent, but the Government, the mili-
 tary, and political parties continued to dominate the broadcast media. Although
 many newspapers remained critical of the Government, throughout the year vio-
 lence against the press and government pressure created a climate of fear among
 members of the press which led to self-censorship by some journalists. There are
 three journalists associations which actively lobbied for a liberal press law and
 against the detention of journalists.
 The Government continued its intimidation of newspapers overtly critical of the
 Government, mostly through legal action. In January the Government filed defama-
 tion suits against two newspapers, the Voice of Khmer Youth and the New Liberty
 News, and confiscated that week's issues of the newspapers, after they ran articles
 and cartoons attacking the co-Prime Ministers. On February 27, the editor of the
 Voice of Khmer Youth, Chan Rotana, was sentenced to a year in prison for
 "disinformation" under the UNTAC-era Press Law. The editor of New Liberty News,
 Hen Vipheak, was sentenced to a year in prison on May 20 for publishing an article
 critical of the two Prime Ministers. Both editors were released pending appeal. After
 their initial appeal was denied at the end of 1995, the two editors remained free
 pending appeal to the Supreme Court. The editor of the newspaper Khmer Ideal
 was convicted of defamation and publishing false information following publication
 of opinion pieces critical of the Government. He was fined $4,000 and told that he
 would have to serve a year in prison if he was unable to a the fine. This convic-
 tion was upheld by the Court of Appeals. The editor appealedto the Supreme Court.
 By the end of 1995, there had been no convictions for the killings of two journal-
 ists in 1994. A powerful soldier in Kompong Chain province, Sath Soeun, was ac-
 quitted of the 1994 killing of journalist Chan Dara (see Section i.e.). No one was
 tried for the 1994 illin of journalist Nuon Chan.
 In September the office and home of journalist Nguon Nonn, editor of the news-
 paper Morning News, was damaged by a hand grenade thrown over his fence by
 a rider on a motorcycle. By the end of the year, there had been no arrest in connec-
 tion with this crime. On October 23, approximately 100 residents of the village of
 Kraingyov, the site of a development project overseen by second Prime Minister Hun
 
 
 571
 Sen, ransacked the office of the New Liberty News, which had criticized the
 Kraingyov project. Fol'owing the attack, Hun Sen told the villagers that the attack
 on the newspaper had been justified. After this incident, the newspaper's printer re-
 fused to continue printing New Liberty News and other opposition papers. The pa-
 pers subsequently made other arrangements and continued printing.
 Also in September the media reported that the Government had issued a directive
 instructing teachers, including private school teachers, not to talk about politics in
 class.
 The KR do not allow freedom of speech or press in zones they control.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. Large, organized political
 demonstrations are rare, although small demonstrations by villagers in front of the
 houses of the two Prime Ministers were tolerated by the Government.
 In October a faction of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party which earlier in
 theyear split into two rival groups, was denied permission to ho1d a party congress
 in the Phniom Penh stadium. Although the Government cited security concerns and
 improper use of the party name, the Government's refusal to allow the congress may
 have been undertaken for political reasons, since the governing coalition supported
 the other BLDP faction. On September 30 unknown persons lobbed 2 or 3 grenades
 at the faction's headquarters and a nearby Buddhist pagoda, injuring at least 30
 faction supporters. First Prime Minister Ranariddh, speakin  on  ehaf of the Gov-
 ernment, condemned the attack. Despite the attack, the BLDP faction proceeded
 with its congress in an abbreviated manner the following day. No one has been ar-
 rested in connection with the incident.
 The Government requires indigenous NGO's to register with the Ministry of Inte-
 rior. The Government delayed the registration of some NGO's in 1995 on the
 grounds that it was in the process of drafting legislation regulating NGO's. How-
 ever, no action has been taken to date against unregistered NGO's.
 In Khmer Rouge-controlled areas, freedom of assembly and association do not
 exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discrimination based on religion. The Government respects this right in
 practice. Buddhism is the state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel outside Cambodia or within
 parts of Cambodia it controls, although the presence of land mines and bandits
 makes travel in some areas perilous. The Khmer Rouge, who refused to comply with
 the Paris Accords by opening the areas they control, continued to restrict access to,
 from, and within these zones.
 Tens of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese fled Cambodia in early 1993 due to racial
 violence directed at Vietnamese. Many returned after the elections. However, the
 Cambodian authorities stopped and forbade reentry to several thousand boats on
 the Mekong River. Although most of these people have been allowed to return and
 others reentered quietly over land, some remain stranded in the border area.
 The Government allows non-Cambodians to apply to the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for refugee status in Cambodia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government,
 and most citizens exercised this right by participating in the 1993 U.N.-adminis-
 tered elections. In those areas of the country controlled by the Khmer Rouge, citi-
 zens cannot exercise this right.
 In the 1993 election, each province elected constituent assembly members through
 proportional representation. Some 20 parties took part; 4 won seats. The United Na-
 tions certified the election as free and fair. After the drafting of a constitution, the
 Constituent Assembly became the National Assembly. Members of all four parties
 that won seats in the Assembly entered a coalition government, which remained in
 p wer through 1995.
 e legislature was weak in comparison with the executive branch. Most legisla-
 tion considered or adopted originated in the ministries rather than in the Assembly.
 However, the Assembly successfully negotiated several important changes to draft
 laws, including the removal of criminal penalties from the Press Law and an
 amendment to the Bar Statute allowing NGO-trained defenders to continue practic-
 ing for several years.
 The executive branch of the Government appointed the provincial governors. Gov-
 ernorships are divided between the two main coalition parties. District and com-
 mune officials are appointed; most of these officials are State of Cambodia ap-
 
 
 pointees. In late 1995, the Interior Ministry announced plans to appoint
 F    CINPEC personnel to roughly half of the district chief positions. The Govern-
 ment pledged in October to hold commune-level elections in early 1997.
 In June outspoken Member of Parliament Sam Rainsy was removed from the leg-
 islature following expulsion from his party, on the grounds that he had been elected
 on a party slate and the party had t e right to decide who occupied his seat. The
 legality of this move was unclear, but the absence of a functioning Constitutional
 Council meant that there was no body competent to make a legal ruling. Some poli-
 ticians and human rights groups expressed concern that the removal of Rainsy was
 an indication that the governing coalition was unwilling to tolerate dissent among
 members of the parties in the coalition.
 Traditional cultural practices inhibit the role of women in government. There are
 7 women among the 120 members of the National Assembly. There are no women
 governors or cabinet ministers. There are a few women at the state secretary and
 deputy governor levels. There are several members of Cambodia's ethnic and reli-
 gious minorities in the Cabinet and the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Cambodia's large international and indigenous human rights community, which
 first began operating under UNTAC, remained active and engaged in diverse activi-
 ties. Numerous indigenous and international human rights organizations and the
 U.N. Human Rights Center conducted highy effective human rights training for
 civil servants, members of the security forces, villagers, and other groups. There are
 40 Cambodian human rights NGO's which carried out investigations of human
 rights abuses. The National Assembly's Human Rights Commission, headed by a
 former NGO leader, served as a liaison between the Assembly and the human rights
 community. According to NGO leaders, communication between human rights
 NGO's and the executive branch of the Government improved in 1995. Most human
 rights NGO's reported little overt intimidation, although many felt that the sen-
 sitive issues they covered required them to exercise caution in carrying out their ac-
 tivities.
 In early 1995, the Government requested that the U.N. Human Rights Center in
 Cambodia depart before the end of its mandate. Following the expression of concern
 from the Cambodian and international human rights communities, from Cambodian
 political figures, and from foreign governments, the Government announced that it
 would allow the Center to complete its mandate.
 The Khmer Rouge do not permit any investigation of human rights violations
 within their zones.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, reli-
 gious beliefs, or political views. Although the Government does not systematically
 engage in discrimination, it often fails to protect these rights in practice.
 Women.-International and Cambodian NGO workers report that violence against
 women, including rape and domestic violence, is common. There have been several
 studies on domestic violence, but there are no reliable statistics on the extent of the
 problem. Authorities normally decline to become involved in domestic disputes.
 GO's reported that prostitution and trafficking in women were becoming increas-
 ingly serious problems. At the end of the year, a bill on trafficking in women had
 been drafted but not enacted.
 The Constitution contains strong language providing for equal rights for women,
 equal pay for equal work, and equal status in marriage. In practice, women have
 equal proprty rights with men, have the same status in bringing divorce proceed-
 ings, and have equal access to education and some jobs. However, cultural traditions
 continued to affect adversely women's ability to reach senior positions in govern-
 ment, business, and other areas. There were a large number of women's NGO's,
 which concentrated on training poor women and widows and addressing social prob-
 lems such as spousal abuse and prostitution. Within the Government, the Secretar-
 iat of State for~omen's Affairs is responsible for women's issues.
 Children.-The Constitution explicitly provides for children's rights, and ensuring
 the welfare of children is a specific goal of the Government's political program. How-
 ever, the Government relies on international aid to fund most social welfare pro-
 grams targeted at children and; therefore, the resources devoted to this are modest.
 Children frequently suffer from the inadequacy of Cambodia's health care system.
 Infant mortality is reported at 123 per thousand and 1 of 5 children does not live
 to see his or her fifth birthday. Child mortality from preventable diseases is high.
 
 
 573
 Children are also the victims of an inadequate educational system. Only about one
 percent of primary school teachers have completed high school. Schools are over-
 crowded and short of equipment. The Government does not deny girls equal access
 to education, but, in practice, families with limited resources often give priority to
 educating boys.
 Child abuse is believed to be common, although there are no statistics on the ex-
 tent of this problem. NGO's believe that child prostitution became an increasingly
 serious problem during the year. A recent report found that one-third of prostitutes
 in Cambodia were under 17. In 1995 several persons were arrested for hiring chil-
 dren as prostitutes, and at least one person was arrested for trafficking in children.
 A U.N. regional forum on trafficking in children was held in Phnom Penh in Decem-
 ber.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. According to inter-
 national human rights groups, 1 in 236 Cambodians is missing at least 1 imb. This
 fignre reflects the continuing impact of land mines on the population. Programs ad-
 ministered by various NGO's have brought about dramatic improvements in the
 treatment and rehabilitation of amputees. However, they face considerable societal
 discrimination, particularly in obtaining skilled employment.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-People of Vietnamese and Chinese back-
 ground have long comprised the largest ethnic minorities in _Cambodia. Ethnic Chi-
 nese are well accepted. However, fear and animosity toward the Vietnamese, who
 are seen as a threat to the Khmer nation and culture, continue. In the absence of
 a nationality law, which is still under consideration by the Government, the legal
 and constitutional rights of ethnic Vietnamese remain unclear. Constitutional pro-
 tections are extended only to "hmer people."
 The Khmer Rouge continued a calculated campaign of inflammatory propaganda
 directed against ethnic Vietnamese, although there were fewer reported racially mo-
 tivated killings of Vietnamese by the Khmer Rouge or others than in previous years
 (see Section 2.d.).
 Several thousand ethnic Vietnamese fled to the Vietnam-Cambodia border follow-
 ing massacres in early 1993: they continued to be denied permission to return to
 their homes, but most had in fact returned home by the end of the year (see Section
 1.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government continued work on a new labor law
 with assistance from the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Asian-
 American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI). At year's end, the bill had not been consid-
 ered by the National Assembly.
 The current Labor Law was passed by the State of Cambodia in 1992. Workers
 have the right to form worker organizations of their own choosing without previous
 authorization. Worker organizations are not required to join a single trade union
 structure.
 There were few, if any, active independent trade unions. The majority of salaried
 workers are employed by the State, although there is a growing service sector. A
 large proportion of the urban population is engaged in low-level commerce or self-
 employed skilled labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law provides for
 collective bargaining, although any agreement reached between workers and em-
 ployees is subject to government approval. In practice, collective bargaining does not
 take place. The Government sets wages for civil servants. Wage rates in other sec-
 tors are set largely by the market. The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion by employers, but there is no mechanism for enforcing this provision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and contains penal sanctions for offenders. However, the Gov-
 ernment does not adequately enforce these provisions. While there were no reports
 of coerced domestic or foreign workers, there were some reports of women being
 forced to work as prostitutes. The Khmer Rouge compel people under their control
 to serve as porters for military and other supplies and to clear land for farming.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Law states that the
 minimum age for employment is 16, except for those workers in family enterprises.
 Although penalties exist for violation of these provisions, the Government has not
 established an apparatus to enforce them. Cambodians under the age of 16 years
 routinely engage in a variety of jobs, including street trading, construction, and
 small-scale manufacturing. According to an NGO study published in 1993, at least
 86 children, most 11 to 14 years of age, worked in the Phnom Penh dump collecting
 
 
 574
 recyclable materials under extremely unhealthful, dangerous, and unsanitary condi-
 tions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law does not provide for a nation-
 wide minimum wage but requires a wage that assures a decent living standard.
 This standard wage varies according to region. The Government, however, dees not
 enforce this requirement. Currently, market-determined wage rates at lower levels
 are not sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and faul y.  a  . o
 The Labor Law provides for a standard egal workweek of 48 hours and a 2-hour
 rest period and requires overtime pay. The Government does not enforce these
 standards, and workers commonly work more than 48 hours per week. The Law
 states that the workplace should have health and safety standards adequate to en-
 sure the workers' well-being. However, the Government has not yet sot specific
 standards. Penalties are specified in the law, but there are no provisions to protect
 workers who complain about unsafe and unhealthful conditions. Conditions in fac-
 tories and small-scale industries are generally poor and often d not meet inter-
 national standards.
