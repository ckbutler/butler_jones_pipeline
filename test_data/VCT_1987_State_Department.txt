 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multiparty
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited upon
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual are
 well established. In July 1984, the New Democratic Party, led
 by James F. Mitchell, defeated the ruling St. Vincent Labor
 Party, led by then Prime Minister Milton Cato, in peaceful,
 democratic elections. By law, elections must be held again by
 October 1989.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police is the only security force in the
 country. A small Special Service Unit (SSU) with some
 paramilitary training has been established within the police
 force, and a coast guard serves under police command. The St.
 Vincent police maintain traditions of professionalism which
 place a high value on respect for human rights.
 A poor country with a very young population, St. Vincent's
 most serious problem is unemployment. The nation's economy,
 led by the vital banana industry, has suffered recent major
 setbacks. A tropical storm in September 1986 severely damaged
 the banana crop and sharply reduced export receipts. A serious
 drought in the first part of 1987, followed by torrential
 rains, damaged the island's rehabilitation efforts and a
 tropical storm in September destroyed about 45 percent of the
 current banana crop.
 The country's human rights record remained good during 1987.

 strike; they represent approximately 7,000 workers.

 Vincent ahd the Grenadines.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Vincent has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have a genuine choice of parties. In the 1984
 general election, the New Democratic Party won 9 of the 13
 seats in Parliament and ousted the St. Vincent Labor Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization maintains offices
 in St. Vincent. Although there is no local body which publicly
 monitors human rights violations, opposition political groups
 occasionally comment on human rights matters. The Government
 is responsive to public and private inquiries on its human
 rights piactices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law, but
 custom dictates that most Vincentian women center their lives
 around the home. As women take greater advantage of public
 education programs, health facilities, and family planning,
 they are expected to participate in larger numbers in the

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 nation's economic, professional, and political life. The
 unemployment rate for women is estimated at about 50 percent,
 as opposed to 20 percent for Vincentian men. This is in part
 a reflection of the increasing entry of women into the labor
 force.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum working age is 15. The work week is 40 hours over
 5 days, and workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation
 of 2 weeks. The Government currently is endeavoring to
 convert loose arrangements covering occupational safety and
 health into statutes. Minimum wages are established by law.
