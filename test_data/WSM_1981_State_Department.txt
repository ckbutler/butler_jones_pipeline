 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa lies in the Pacific Ocean approximately 5000
 miles southwest of the continental United States and
 consists of two main islands with a population of 152,000.
 Western Samoa became independent on January 1, 1962,
 ending more than 40 years of UN trusteeship and League
 mandate rule by New Zealand. Western Samoa's constitution
 is based on the British pattern of parliamentary democracy,
 modified to take into account Samoan customs. Apia, the
 capital and commercial center, is the only major city
 in the country. Samoans have tended to retain their
 traditional ways despite exposure to European influence
 for more than 150 years. Most Samoans live within the
 traditional social system based on the "Aiga," or extended
 family group, headed by a "Matai," or chief. The legis-
 lative assembly ("Fono") has 47 members, 45 of whom are
 elected by Matai suffrage on a territorial basis. There
 are some 10-12,000 Matais who are eligible to vote for
 members of the Fono. The present head of state holds
 his position for life; future heads of state will be elected
 by the legislative assembly for five-year terms. The
 constitution establishing this system was overwhelmingly
 adopted by a universal suffrage plebiscite conducted under
 United Nations supervision in 1961.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Western Samoa. Article 7
 of the constitution of Western Samoa ensures that "no
 person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment." This is observed in
 practice by reason of law and custom.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 All are illegal and not practiced or condoned. Treatment
 of prisoners is fair and humane.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no secret arrests or detentions in Western Samoa.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Western Samoa. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist. Suspects must be charged within
 twenty-four hours following an arrest. Prison conditions
 are not harsh. Persons awaiting sentence are housed in the
 same detention facilities with those already convicted and
 serving time. Most Samoans who are jailed have been convicted
 of relatively minor crimes such as petty theft, and their
 terms of sentence are short. There are, however, at least
 three cases of individuals who have been sentenced to-death
 and who are awaiting word on whether their sentences will be
 commuted. In at least one case, the individual has been
 waiting for this decision since 1978. With this exception,
 there are no lengthy delays between arrest, arraignment, and
 trial. Local custom (ifoga) is taken into account in
 sentencing.

 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants may be represented by
 counsel, and advisors are provided to assist in cases
 involving traditional matters. Charges are filed within
 twenty-four hours following arrests and are formally and
 clearly stated. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive. There are no political, security, or military
 courts.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and search
 warrants are required as a matter of law. The Samoan
 constitution does not specifically refer to illegal entry,
 but article 14 provides for the protection from invasion
 or seizure of property without due process of law. Local
 custom dictates that this law be respected.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 13 of the Samoan constitution guarantees freedom
 of speech, assembly, association, movement and residence.
 iArticle 2 guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and
 religion. These rights are respected in practice. Labor
 unions are free to organize, bargain and strike; indeed a
 three-month strike by public service employees ended in
 August with the government agreeing to wage increases and
 reinstatement of the striking employees.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Western;Samoans are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. Rights of emigration and repatriation are respected.
 There are no refugees in Western Samoa.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The primary basis for suffrage is the Matai system. The
 title of Matai is conferred upon any eligible member of
 an extended family group. Two members of the parliament
 are elected by universal adult suffrage by people lacking
 family group ties. New Matai titles are constantly being
 created, the number having more than doubled since inde-
 pendence. Matais traditionally consult with their Alga
 before making decisions for the group. Most Samoans
 actively support the Matai system. Members of parliament
 serve for three years. Women have equal standing in the
 political process and are particularly active in community
 affairs. There is presently one female member of parliament.
 Females also serve in many other public offices.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for .investigations have been made to the Western
 Samoan government.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Western Samoans enjoy good health with an average life
 expectancy at birth of 68 years, an infant mortality rate
 of 2 per 1,000 live births and a ratio of calorie supply
 
 
 713
 available for consumption relative to nutritional require-
 ments of 82.0. Forty-three percent of the population has
 access to safe drinking water, with that percentage rising
 to 100 in urban areas, as compared to 23 in rural areas.
 Education has been one of the country's traditional
 concerns and 97.8 percent of the adult population is
 literate, while 91 percent of its primary school children
 are enrolled in school. The average number of persons
 housed per room is 1.5 (urban - 1.4; rural - 1.6). The
 most recent available figure for GNP per capita was $450;
 32.8 percent of the population is accounted below the
 absolute poverty level. Western Samoa has a low population
 growth rate of one percent per annum. The short term
 economic outlook for Western Samoa is a difficult one.
 World copra and cocoa prices are low. Imports have increased
 while exports have declined. The government is trying to raise
 funds abroad through loans and development assistance.
