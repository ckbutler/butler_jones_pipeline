 MALAWI
 
 Malawi is a one-party state in which all effective
 political power is held by the Life President, Dr. H.
 Kamuzu Banda. The Malawi constitution provides
 extensive guarantees of civil and political rights.
 However, in 1968 an amendment empowered the government
 to suspend these guarantees if such action is deemed
 necessary "in the interests of defense, public safety,
 public order or the national economy."
 The most serious violation of internationally recogniz-
 ed human rights in Malawi has been the arbitrary
 detention, without trial, of large numbers of Malawi
 citizens and some aliens. Over the last year, how-
 ever, the situation has dramatically improved. While
 there is no sign that the Malawi Government is prepar-
 ed to foreswear the use of its special powers or
 reinstate the suspended constitutional guarantees,
 almost all of those detained have been released in a
 series of presidential amnesties.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Reports received by Amnesty International (AI) allege
 sporadic torture and brutality directed against
 political prisoners, resulting in some deaths in
 detention. We have sought but have not obtained
 independent confirmation of these reports; some have
 been conclusively disproven. There is no evidence to
 suggest that the practice of torture is officially
 condoned by the Malawi Government.
 During the 1972-73 period, AI charges that at least 50
 and perhaps as.many as 100 Malawian Jehovah's Witness-
 es were killed by Malawi Congress Party militants and
 mobs incited by them, often after torture. Harassment
 and beatings of Witnesses at that time were apparently
 widespread. AI and Jehovah's Witness groups have
 charged that such physical persecution was renewed
 following the return of many Witnesses from Mozambique
 in 1975, but these reports appear to have been unfound-
 ed.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Food is poor in Malawi's prisons, cells are crowded
 and medical care is minimal, but it appears that
 prison officials have generally made a conscientious
 effort to maintain humane conditions within the
 limited resources available to them. Political
 prisoners have been segregated from ordinary prison-
 ers, and there have been allegations, which we have
 been unable to substantiate, that in some prisons they
 were subjected to degrading punishments for minor
 infractions of prison rules. Some former political
 prisoners have said, howeveri that boredom was the
 worst aspect of their detention.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under the Public Security Regulations, summary deten-
 tion has been common in Malawi. No arrest warrant is
 needed, no charges need be filed, and no trial is
 normally held. Typically, there has been no public
 notice of an individual's arrest, and many detainees
 have'never- learned why they wereimprisoned. It is
 estimated that in the fall of 1976, 1000-2000 persons
 were in detention for *political" offenses. Detainees
 included former cabinet ministers and party officials,
 civil servants, university professors, students and
 a variety of others.
 In September, 1976, two senior officials identified
 with extensive and capricious use of political deten-
 tion powers were removed from office and charged with
 treason. In December of that year, the first in a
 series of mass amnesties took place. By mid-summer
 1977, all but a handful of those detained without
 charge, including some who had been imprisoned for
 over a decade, had been released.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of accused persons to a fair, impartial and
 speedy public trial is generally observed, insofar as
 their cases come under provisions of ordinary Malawian
 law. The familiar sdfeguards of English Common Law
 
 
 are available to such defendants. However, no due
 process has been available to political detainees.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 In ordinary civil and criminal matters, the sanctity
 of the home and freedom from illegal search and
 seizure are normally protected in Malawi. In matters
 coming under the Public Security Regulations, however,
 such procedural safeguards are often ignored.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Malawi economy has performed well despite great
 poverty ($150 per capita GNP) and a lack of mineral
 resources. Malawi's impressive 6.5 percent real
 average growth since 1964 has been achieved in
 part by paying artificially low prices to the farmer
 for exportable commodities. Nevertheless, given its
 available resources the Malawi Government has made a
 creditable effort to ensure that everyone has enough
 to eat and adequate clothing; has made a promising
 start on public housing; and is earnestly trying to
 bring basic educational and health services to the
 populace.
 President Banda and his close colleagues have profited
 from their political power. Their land holdings are
 impressive, and the President's involvement in diverse
 business activities is common knowledge. Otherwise,
 official venality and corruption are virtually unknown
 in Malawi, and such breaches of the public trust are
 summarily dealt with when discovered.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 .and Assembly
 Freedoms of thought, speech and assembly are sharply
 
 
 circumscribed in Malawi. All forms of expression are
 censored. The press and broadcasting services are
 under total government control, and no criticism of
 the government may occur except as sanctioned by the
 President. In all areas concerned with politics and
 government, unconventional views are held or expressed
 at one's own risk. The Malawi Congress Party apparat-
 us and extensive use of informants serves to enforce
 conformity. No dissent is tolerated; criticism of the
 Life President, however indirect or mild, is punish-
 able by detention. Peaceful assembly is subject to
 careful government scrutiny and prior-approval is
 required.
 Non-governmental organizations in Malawi, including
 trade unions (under the Malawi Trade Union Council)
 are subject to strict government control.
 Freedom of religion is honored in Malawi except in the
 case of the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Watchtower
 Bible and Tract Society, which were banned in 1967 and
 1969 respectively as "unlawful societies ... dangerous
 to good government." In 1972-73, during the period of
 violent persecution referred to above-, 15-20,000
 Witnesses fled to Mozambique and Zambia. InAugust
 1975, those who remained in Mozambique were forcibly
 expelled and returned to Malawi- subsequently, at
 least two thousand were brought to trial under the
 banning law, which provides penalties for membership
 in proscribed organizations, and were sentenced
 to prison terms, typically of two years' duration.
 Recent reports indicate that most, if not all of the
 Witnesses have now completed their prison terms and
 are being allowed to return to their home villages,
 where the Government has made special efforts to
 encourage their successful reintegration into village
 life.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Under the Public Security Regulations, the govern-
 ment has the power to restrict the movement, contacts
 and employment of any citizen. This power has typi-
 cally been used to exercise control over persons
 
 
 released from political detention. Such former
 detainees have usually been required to return to
 their home villages and to report at short intervals
 to the local party branch. Very few of the many
 persons released from detention in the past year have
 been rusticated in this manner, although none are yet
 known to have been permitted to resume their'former
 employment.
 The Government of Malawi has often denied passports to
 former detainees and to other suspected dissidents, a
 practice which restricts both short-term foreign
 travel and emigration. Aliens, whether visiting or
 resident in Malawi, are subject to summary depor-
 tation. In mid-1976, virtually all of Malawi's
 Goan residents, over 200 people, were expelled for
 allegedly failing to give due respect to President
 Banda.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Since putting down an early revolt against his author-
 ity by dissident cabinet ministers in 1964 and 1965,
 President Banda has not had to face another serious
 challenge. He became president for life in July,
 1971.
 Membership in the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) is open
 only to Malawi citizens of indigenous African origin,
 and is compulsory for anyone wishing to hold public
 office. No political activity outside the MCP frame-
 work is permitted, and although the Government asserts
 that there is grass-roots democracy within the MCP,
 access to political office at any level is subject to
 the President's veto. Parliamentary elections are
 constitutionally provided for, with universal adult
 suffrage, but the last such elections were cancelled
 because none of the MCP candidates was opposed.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 President Banda contends that authoritarian control is
 
 
 73
 essential for Malawi's development, that Malawi is
 unique, and that no one outside Malawi has any right
 to criticize his policies. There is little prospect
 that he will permit outside investigation of alleged
 human rights violations. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees has been denied access to
 and information about the status of Malawian Jehovah's
 Witnesses. Amnesty International and similar groups
 have also been denied access to Malawi; President
 Banda at one time explicitly threatened reprisals
 against prisoners "adopted" by AI.
 Foreign journalists have long been persona non grata
 in Malawi; recently, however, the Malawi Government
 has invited several reporters to visit the country.
