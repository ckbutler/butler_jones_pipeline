 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen is the
 nominal Head of State and is represented in The Bahamas by an
 appointed Governor General. The Progressive Liberal Party
 (PLP) has governed since 1967 under Prime Minister Sir Lynden
 0. Pindling and was last reelected in the June 1987 general
 elections.
 The Police and a small Defense Force are answerable to civilian
 authorityand generally respect laws protecting human'rights.
 However, there have been continuing credible reports that
 police have physically abused detainees, both Bahamian citizens
 and foreigners..
 The economy is based on tourism, which accounts for nearly half
 of The Bahamas' gross national product. The second most
 important economic sector is financial services, particularly
 offshore banking.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental
 human rights and freedom from discrimination on the basis of
 sex, race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.
 The principal human rights problems relate to abuse of
 detainees and prisoners by police and prison guards and the-
 miserable condition of the prison system, growing antagonism
 toward the Haitian migrant community, and the Government's
 monopolization of the local media.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person; Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politically motivate& killings are not known to occur, but
 there are occasional killings of detainees in official
 custody. The results of the coroner's inquest into the 1990
 killing of Dwayne Bannister while in police custody (see 1990
 Report)- had not beem made public by- the end of 1991 despite
 requests from the Grand Bahama Human Rights Organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or
 government-sanctioned clandestine detentions during 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or degrading
 treatment or punishment. The police generally respect the
 constitutional safeguards prohibiting such practices, but there
 were credible charges that in some cases police investigators
 and prison guards resorted to intimidation and physical abuse
 of detainees. An American citizen reported that he was beaten
 with a nightstick and a metal-tipped rubber hose by guards at
 Fox Hill prison in August 1991. His allegations were confirmed
 by other prisoners, and the Ministry of National Security
 ordered an investigation. The Police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID) was still conducting its investigation at
 year's end. Charges against the alleged victim were dropped
 and he was released from prison and'deported. The Grand Bahama
 Human Rights Organization is investigating approximately 30
 
 
 488
 THE BAHAMAS
 cases of alleged police brutality during 1991. There are
 charges that Haitians in jail and prison are abused more
 frequently than are Bahamians; a pregnant Haitian woman was
 beaten while being held at Fox Hill prison. Illegal Haitian
 migrants detained in The Bahamas are subject to pressures and
 harassment related to their status.
 Conditions at Fox Hill prison, The Bahamas' only prison
 facility, remain deplorable. The maximum security facility is
 grossly overcrowded and seriously understaffed. The
 Government, citing budgetary constraints, temporarily abandoned
 plans to construct a new $6-million prison facility at Fox
 Hill. Consequently, as many as six male prisoners are housed
 in 6 by 8-foot cells designed to hold no more than two.
 Sanitation facilities are primitive, usually consisting of a
 plastic bucket in each cell. There is no running water
 available in the cells; a jug of drinking water, which is
 supposed to be supplied to each prisoner daily, is often not
 supplied unless the prisoner has paid a trustee. Pzison guards
 generally determine whether a prisoner's illness requires
 medical attention. During 1991 a diabetic prisoner developed
 gangrene and her condition deteriorated due partly to the poor
 prison diet.
 Recognizing the serious problems at Fox Hill, the Government
 took a number of steps in 1991 to attempt to ameliorate the
 situation. A commission was appointed by the Government to
 examine prison conditions and make recommendations for
 improvement. In addition, the Government agreed to a dialog
 with U.S. Department of State and Department of Justice
 officials to discuss prison problems. The Government also
 requested that U.S. medical specialists examine some prisoners
 and has expressed interest in entering into a prisoner exchange
 agreement with the United States. Two U.S. Bureau of Prisons
 doctors visited The Bahamas in October 1991 and examined U.S.
 and Bahamian prisoners. The physicians agreed to submit a
 report of their findings to the U.S. Department of Justice to
 be passed on to the Government of The Bahamas.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Arrests are openly conducted and, when required, judicially
 issued warrants are obtained. Warrants are not required in
 cases of suspected narcotics or firearms possession. Detainees
 are charged within 48 hours and allowed access to an attorney
 of their choice. The right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of an arrest is respected, and there is a system
 permitting bail, except for foreigners. The Government is
 obligated to provide legal representation to destitutes in
 cases involving capital crimes. Illegal migrants, including
 Haitians, Chinese, and a few Cubans have the right to retain
 legal representation but are generally held at Fox Hill prison
 pending deportation unless they can arrange private means for
 their repatriation. As a result, illegal migrants may be held
 at Fox Hill for weeks or months while repatriation arrangements
 are being made.
 e. Denial of-Fair Public Trial
 The Bahamian legal system is based on English common law but
 shares some features of the U.S. legal system. The judiciary
 is independent, appointed by the executive branch on the advice
 of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, and conducts
 fair and public trials. Defendants enjoy a presumption of
 
 
 489
 THE BAHAMAS
 innocence and the right to appeal. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and lawyers have access to their
 clients. Legal representation at public expense is provided
 only in capital cases. An overburdened and archaic judicial
 system often results in execessive pretrial detention and
 prison overcrowding; trials can often take as long as 2 years
 from time of arrest to eventual conviction or acquital.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 As a rule, the Government does not interfere in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure and requires a court order for the
 entry into and search of private property. Aside from
 restrictions on prison mail, the Government neither censors
 mail nor restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or
 publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right of free expression, a
 right that is usually respected in practice. The political
 opposition freely criticizes the Government. Three daily and
 two weekly newspapers are privately owned and express a variety
 of views on matters of public-interest; they are frequently
 critical of the Government and its policies. There has I
 traditionally been a tendency toward self-censorship when it
 comes to identifying by name government officials or private
 individuals who may be involved in controversiarl issues. The
 threat of libel suits under laws unchanged since the 19th
 century results in cautious-treatment of stories about fraud;
 corruption, or moral turpitude. As the 1992 legislative
 elections approached, however, government and opposition
 members become increasingly strident in trading accusations.
 The hotly debated Parliamentary Elections Bill, which was
 passed on December 13, will make it an offense to use "foreign
 radio or television stations to broadcast any material having
 reference to an- election in The Bahamas, with the aim of
 influencing an election, other than pursuant to arrangements
 made with the Broadcasting Corporation of The Bahamas for the
 broadcast to be received and retransmitted by the
 Corporation." Those found-in violatiod of this provision could
 face a fine of $2,000 and/or 2 years in jail-, after which they
 will be ineligible to register or vote for T years. Additional
 provisions in the bill include penalties against persons
 accused- of "heckling" at political rallies and requires that
 all "bills, posters and placards bear the name and address of
 the publisher." On a more positive note, the bill will also
 establish an Electoral Broadcast Council to monitor campaign
 coverage by the Broadcasting Corporation of The Bahamas for
 fairness. Government officials claim that the new law will
 allow the opposition freer access to national television and
 radio.
 The New Providence Human Rights Organization and the Grand
 Bahama Human Rights Organization have protested certain
 provisions of the legislation and have lodged a complaint with
 the Caribbean Human Rights Network.' They also plan to take the
 matter to the Supreme Court and were in the process of lodging
 
 
 490
 THE BAHAMAS
 a formal complaint with the Organization of American States at
 year's end. The government claims that the law is similar to
 current legislation in force in the U.K. and Canada.
 The Government holds a monopoly on local radio and television
 broadcasting, and opposition initiatives to secure private
 ownership of radio stations have been thwarted by the
 Government's majority in Parliament. The radio and television
 network covers the views of the Government and the activities
 of government ministers exhaustively; the lead items on the
 domestic news are usually ministerial speeches. Opposing
 viewpoints and opposition activities received increasing
 coverage in 1991. The Government does not restrict the
 ownership of satellite antennas, and many Bahamians have access
 to international nuws programs on satellite television, as well
 as to direct reception of radio and television from southern
 Florida. Foreign publications enter the country freely.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights to free assembly and
 association. These rights are respected in practice. Private
 associations are permitted, but groups must obtain permits to
 hold public demonstrations. Such permits are freely granted.
 c. Freedom of'Religion
 There is full freedom of religion in The Bahamas. There is no
 favored or official state religion, and the majority of church
 members belong to Protestant denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahamians and residents of The Bahamas enjoy free movement
 within the country, and Bahamians face no impediments to
 foreign travel or emigration. Passports are liberally granted
 to Bahamian citizens.
 The Bahamas is not a party to the 1967 U.N. Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees. In the past, Cuban asylum seekers
 were treated as illegal immigrants, and some were held in
 prison until a third country, usually the United States,
 arranged to admit them. However, during 1991 the treatment of
 Cuban asylum seekers improved as the Bahamian Government issued
 temporary work permits to nine Cuban men and worked with
 private groups to arrange temporary housing for Cuban women and
 children.
 The presence of anestimated 30,000-40,000 Haitian migrants in
 The Bahamas became a volatile social, economic, and political
 problem in 1991. Hundreds of Haitians were repatriated in 1991
 and others were detained at Fox Hill prison (some for 6 months
 or longer) pending repatriation. Deportees are held for
 repatriation until there is a sufficient number to fill a plane
 or boat. There are occasional reports of abuse during roundups
 and deportations. In June 1991 a Haitian illegal migrant was
 apprehended by police and held in Fox Hill prison for 2 months
 pending deportation, at which time he was transferred to the
 Criminal Detention Center of the Prison, accused of committing
 several crimes, and was allegedly beaten by prison guards. The
 man was held in prison for nearly 6 months without being
 charged and was finally deported in December 1991. The
 Government works with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) to determine whether applicants are legitimate
 
 
 491
 THE BAHAMAS
 refugees. According to UNHCR officials, Haitian deportees
 interviewed to date have not been legitimate refugees. The
 Bahamian Government and the Government of Haiti conducted talks
 on a ifiigrant repatriation treaty during 1991. The Government
 of The Bahamas took a hard line during the first round of talks
 in September, declaring that a formula must be devised to
 reduce the Haitian migrant community as soon as possible.
 Further talks on the migrant repatriation treaty were suspended
 due to the September 1991 coup in Haiti.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty
 political system-, governed by an elected Prime Minister and
 Parliament. The political process is open to all elements of
 society, and citizens 18 years of age and older ara eligible to
 register and vote. In the 1987 elections, 92.8 percent of
 those registered actually voted. Registration is on a nonparty
 basis.
 The two principal political parties are the governing
 Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition Free
 National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for 6 1/2
 years of internal self-government from January 1967 until
 independence in July 1973, and has held power under Prime
 Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling since then. The PLP~currently
 holds 32 of 49 seats in Parliament's House of Assembly, while
 the FNM holds 17. The last general election in June 1987
 returned the PLP to power with a clear parliamentary majority.
 Challenges by the opposition based on charges of electoral
 fraud produced no changes in the results. The 1991
 Parliamentary Elections Bill provides for inspectors to conduct
 inquiries to determine the accuracy of the register-of voters .
 and also provides for the use of indelible ink to stamp voters'
 hands in order to prevent multiple voting. The'next general
 elections must take place by June 1992. The political
 opposition continues to allege bias in employment, promotions,
 and the provision of government services, based on political
 party affiliation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are four local human rights groups: The Grand Bahama
 Human Rights Organization, the New Providence Human Rights
 Organization, the Abaco Human Rights Organization, and the
 National Association for the Protection of Human Rights. These
 organizations are allowed to operate freely in The Bahamas
 they report objectively on alleged human rights violations.
 The Government placed no restrictions on their activities
 during 1991.
 No international human rights organization sought to visit The
 Bahamas to investigate human rights conditions during 1991 and
 were turned away. However, Americas Watch claimed in August
 that the Government refused it access to the prison system.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights and freedoms
 regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion, creed,
 or sex of the individual. However, the Constitution does
 
 
 492
 THE BAHAMAS
 distinguish between the sexes in that it does not provide
 Bahamian women the ability to bestow citizenship upon their
 foreign-born spouses. Women participate fully in Bahamian
 society and are well represented-in the business and
 professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and in
 government. There does not appear to be a significant wage gap
 between men and women.
 Domestic violence against women continued to be an issue of
 intense concern in The Bahamas, with independent women's
 support groups reporting that over 120 women per month seek
 shelter at the Women's Crisis Center in Nassau. Women may have
 their cases heard in a closed domestic court and may seek a
 restraining order against an abusive spouse or male companion.
 Women's rights groups speak freely on ways to improve the
 condition of women and children, including safeguarding their
 physical safety, and helped draft a bill which was passed into
 law as the Sexual Offenses and Domestic Violence Act of 1991.
 The Act strengthened measures against abuse by criminalizing
 spousal rape, incest, and sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Many Haitians in The. Bahamas are illegal immigrants and face
 economic and social deprivation and sometimes mistreatment by
 police and members of the Defense Force. One of the major
 topics of debate during 1991 within both government circles and
 Bahamian society at large was how to contend with the growing
 Haitian immigrant population. A substantial number of
 Bahamians view the Haitians as unwelcome guests who are a drain
 on the economy, contribute to the moral decline of the country,
 and have no constitutional rights. The Government adopted a
 hard-line approach during negotiations with the Government of
 Haiti on renewing and/or revising a migrant repatriation
 treaty, stating publicly that the number of illegal Haitian
 migrants in the Bahamas had reached an "intolerable level."
 The Bahamian Government further declared that it could no
 longer allocate its scarce resources to care for Haitian
 migrants, and that native Bahamians were demanding "immediate
 action" to reduce the number of migrants significantly. The
 situation during 1991 showed growing potential for increased
 friction between the native Bahamian and Haitian migrant
 communities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution specifically grants labor unions the rights of
 free assembly and association. Workers may form or join unions
 without prior authorization except for members of the Police
 Force, Defense Force, Fire Brigade, and prison guards, all of
 whom are forbidden to unionize by the Constitution. This right
 is exercised extensively, particularly in the hotel industry
 where approximately 80 percent of the employees are unionized.
 The two major labor organizations in the Bahamas, the
 8,000-member Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union
 and the 12,000-member Trade Union Congress, are basically
 politicized, although both function independently of actual
 government or political party control.
 All Bahamian labor unions are guaranteed the right to maintain
 affiliations with international trade union organizations. The
 right to strike is limited under the Industrial Relations Act,
 which states that union members must vote to strike and the
 motion must be passed by a simple majority before a strike can
 commence. The Ministry of Labor oversees the vote.
 
 
 493
 THE BAHAMAS
 There were no formal strikes during 1990, but there were
 impromptu labor actions, which included slowdowns and
 sick-outs, initiated by construction workers at the-site of the
 new airport terminal. The labor actions originated from the
 workers' demands to form a union. An agreement was reached
 whereby the workers dropped their demand to form a union in
 exchange for increased compensation.
 There were no human rights abuses directly related to unions or
 workers in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to organize, and collective bargaining is
 extensive for the 30,000 workers (25 percent of the work force)
 who are unionized.- Collective bargaining is protected in law
 and freely practiced, and the Department of Labor is
 responsible for mediating disputes. Wages are set in free
 negotiations between unions and employers without government
 involvement.
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by both the
 Industrial Relations Act and the Constitution. The Industrial
 Relations Act mandates that employers recognize trade unions.
 The Industrial Relations Board within the Department of Labor
 mediates and conciliates disputes between individual employees
 or unions and their employers. Two mechanisms exist to resolve
 complaints: filing a trade dispute with the Department of
 Labor, or bringing a civil suit against the employer in a court
 of law. The Industrial Relations Act mandates the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
 Legislation pending before Parliament at year's end, the
 employment protection bill, addresses unfair dismissal and
 places greater burdens of proof for dismissal on the employer.
 Labor laws and regulations are enforced uniformly throughout
 The Bahamas. There are two small and not particularly active
 free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohihited by the- Constitution
 and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 While there are no laws prohibiting the employment of children
 below a certain age, compulsory education for children up to
 the age of 14 years effectively discourages child employment.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regular workweek to 48
 hours and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period.
 Overtime payment (time and a half) is required by law for hours
 in excess of the standard. The Labor Department is responsible
 for enforcing labor laws and has a team of several inspectors
 who make on-site visits to enforce occupational health and
 safety standards and investigate employee concerns and
 complaints. These inspection visits are normally announced
 ahead of time. Employers generally cooperate with inspections
 in implementing safety standards. The National Insurance
 Program provides for compensation for work-related injuries.
 An employer is also required by law to find suitable
 alternative employment for an employee who is injured on the
 job but is still able to work. Laws on working conditions are
 
 
 494
 THE BAHAMAS
 uniform throughout the country, including the export processing
 zones. While the Fair Labor Standards Act has minimum wage
 provisions, there are no legislated minimum wage levels.
