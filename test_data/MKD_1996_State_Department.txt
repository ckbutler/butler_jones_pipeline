 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which became independent following
 the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy. International monitors
 judged its second multiparty elections in 1994 to be generally free and fair despite
 numerous procedural irregularities. The judiciary is independent in practice.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees a security apparatus that includes uniformed po-
 lice, border police, and the state intelligence service. The Ministry is under the con-
 trl of a civilian minister, and a parliamentary commission oversees operations.
 Some members of the police on occasion were responsible for instances of human
 rights abuses.
 Historically, Macedonia was the least prosperous of the Yugoslav republics. Its
 economy was closely tied to the other republics, especially Serbia. Conflict in the re-
 gion and sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, along with the problems of
 transition to a market economy, led to severe economic difficulties. A Greek trade
 embargo imposed in 1994, in a dispute over the country's name, flag, and constitu-
 tion was ifted in October 1995 following the signing of an interim accord between
 the two countries. Trade sanctions against Serbia were suspended following conclu-
 sion of the Dayton Accords the next month. In the circumstances of these two border
 closures, gross domestic product had fallen an estimated 50 percent. Economic
 growth resumed during theyear with a slight increase in industrial production, but
 recovery is expected to be slow. Official unemployment is about a third of the work
 force, and many people who are ostensibly employed are in fact furloughed. Even
 employed workers routinely receive their salaries several months late.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 there were credible reports of occasional police abuse of prisoners, and some
 unconfirmed charges of police harassment of political opponents of the Government.
 Violence and discrimination against women are problems.
 Minorities, including ethnic Albanians, ethnic-Turks, and ethnic Serbs, raised var-
 ious allegations of human rights infringements and discrimination. Ethnic Macedo-
 nians hold a disproportionate number of positions in state institutions. Government
 promises to boost the number of minorities in these institutions have been imple-
 
 
 1029
 mented only slowly, except for the conscript ranks of the armed forces. Ethnic Alba-
 nians continue to demand increased Albanian-language education, greater represen-
 tation in public sector jobs, and      media access. Since a violent demonstra-
 tion in 1995, an unofficial Albanian-laguage university n Tetovo has tacitly been
 allowed to operate but its rector and four other university activists were imprisoned
 in July in connection with the 1995 incident.
 The Government has agreed in principle to many of the ethnic Albanian demands,
 but claims that resure constraints are slowing progress on implementing the
 agrements. A summer campaign by ethnic Albanian opposition parties demanding
 a change in the Constitution that would result in an ethnically based federalism,
 which was denounced by both the Government and its ethnic Albanian coalition
 partner, fueled underlying ethnic tensions. However, no major clashes took place
 during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudcial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were allegations that a Romani woman died in July as a result of being
 hit on the head with a police baton, but the Ministry of Interior announced that
 an autopsy determined she died of a heart attack.
 The investigation continued at year's end into the 1995 car bomb attack on Presi-
 dent Gligorov.
 b. DisEppearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punishment. However, police occa-
 sionally used excessive force during and following the arrest of criminal suspects.
 Prison conditions are generally acceptable. Reports of abuse by prison authorities
 (who are separate from the police) are rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that a person
 must be arraigned in court within 24 hours of arrest and sets the maximum dura-
 tion of detention pending trial at 90 days. The accused is entitled to contact a law-
 yer at the time of arrest and to have a lawyer present during police and court pro-
 ceedings. According to human rights monitors and criminal defense attorneys, police
 sometimes violate the 24-hour requirement and deny immediate access to an attor-
 ney. Although the law requires warrants for arrests, this provision is sometimes ig-
 nored, and the warrant issued only some time after the arrest. There is no system-
 atic use of detention as a form of nonjudicial punishment. Incommunicado detention
 is not practiced. There were no confirmed reports of arbitrary arrest. Opposition po-
 litical parties alleged police harassment of their members, but there were no clear,
 confirmed cases.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides that the courts are au-
 tonomous and independent, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 The court system is three tiered, comprising municipal courts, district courts, and
 a Supreme Court. A Constitutional Court deals with matters of constitutional inter-
 pretation. Few trials appear to be influenced by political considerations, although
 there is a widespread perception that bribery is common in the courts.
 The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect the human rights of citizens,
 but has not taken action in any case in this area. Parliament has yet to pass imple-
 menting legislation to establish a people's ombudsman to defend citizens' constitu-
 tional and legal rights.
 Trials are presided over by government-appointed judge. The judges are assisted
 by two members of the community who serve essentially as consulting jurors, al-
 the judge has the final word. Trials are open to relatives of the accused and
 the public with permission of the judge. The president of the court decides on the
 admission of jouralists. Some trials-notably those of minors--are not open to the
 public.
 Members of the Albanian community have charged that the Government holds
 two persons as political prisoners. They~ claim that the imprisonment of the Tetovo
 University rector and another activist is a violation of their human rhts and that
 they are being punished for acts of apehthatshouldbeprtected. The rector
 called on ethnic Albanians to resist police efforts to close the university 2 days be-
 fore a violent incident in February 1995 and was convicted of inciting to riot on the
 basis of that statement. Another Albanian political leader was convicted of interfer-
 ing with the duties of the police despite a lack of strong evidence that he was doing
 anything more than observing the incident. (The defendants' sentences were sub-
 
 
 1030
 stantially reduced on appeal, and they returned to detention in July to serve out
 their terms.) Government officials say that they had to proceed against the defend-
 ants to prevent further violent incidents.
 f Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Famiy. Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to rivacy of person, home, and correspondence is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion. Althugh no instances of abuses were substantiated, officials of opposition par-
 ties charge that their telephones were tapped and their privacy violated by the state
 security service.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution forbids censorship and pro-
 vides for freedom of speech, public access, public information, and freedom to estab-
 lish private media outlets. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice.
 Several daily newspapers ar published in Skopje, as well as numerous weekly
 political and other publications. Newspapers in albanian and a Turkish are distrib-
 uted nationally and subsidized by the Gvernment. Most newspapers and magazines
 published in the country are government owned and government oriented. Opposi-
 tion parties allege that government control and manipulation of the media prevent
 them from getting their message across.
 The state-owned media report oppositionpress conferences and statements, and
 in general do a reasonably credita le job of covering the major opposition parties.
 The overall balance of coverage, however, is in favor of the Government. The leading
 newspper publisher is a government company that owns the only modern high-
 speed printimg plant in the country, as well as most newspaper kiosks. Opposition
 groups complain that they are charged high prices for the services of the printing
 plant. Newspapers can be imported from Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and Greece only
 with the permission of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Very few copies of Bulgarian
 newspapers are permitted into the country.
 Academic freedom is respected in theory and practice However an attempt to
 open an Albanian-language university was declared illegal by the overnment (see
 Section 5).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights and the Government generally respects them in practice. Advance noti-
 fication of large meetings is required, but the authorities do not appear to abuse
 that requirement, and opposition rallies occur regularly without major incident.
 Political parties and organizations are reqired to register with the Interior Min-
 istry in compliance with a comprehensive political party registration law. More than
 4 plitical parties are registered, including ethnically based parties of Albanians,
 TukSerbs, and Roma. No cases of denial of registration were reported during the
 year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of reli-
 gion for the -Macedonian Orthodox Church and other religious communities and
 groups," and the Government generally does not interfere with the practice of reli-
 gion.
 While only the Macedonian Orthodox Church is mentioned by name in the Con-
 stitution, it does not enjoy official status. However, members of other religious com-
 munities credibly charge that the Government favors it, based on the ease with
 which it can obtain property and building permits for new construction. During 1995
 the authorities destroyed at least two or three houses that did not have such per-
 mits and were being used as mosques.
 The refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church to recognize the independence of the
 Macedonian Orthodox Church has led to difficulties or ethnic Serbs who wish to
 worship in their own church. On a number of occasions the Government has refused
 Serbian Orthodox priests permission to enter the country and apparently plans to
 continue doing so until the Serbian Church recognizes the Macedoman Church.
 Protestant groups have complained about incidents of harassment and vandalism
 to which police have failed to respond. They also complain that they cannot register
 their churches and obtain regular employment status for employees, and that on
 several occasions they have been prevented from holding religious meetings in
 venues outside churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons, but are fully respected in practice.
 The law on citizenship is highly restrictive, requiring, for example, 15 years of
 residence for citizenship. This has left some people who were living legally in the
 country at the time of independence without citizenship. The law particularly affects
 
 
 1031
 ethnic Albanians who had moved to the country from other parts of Yugoslavia be-
 fore independence. As citizens of the predecessor state living legally in the territory
 of the country at the time of independence, they feel they have a right to citizenship.
 Some Albanian political leaders also charge that Ministry of Interior officials re-
 sponsible for making citizenship determinations discriminate against Albanian ap-
 plicants. The officials are said to make more demanding documentary requirements
 and to act on applications slowly. There were also plausible charges that officials
 were demanding bribes in return for a favorable decision. There is some truth to
 these charges, but citizenship problems also affected many ethnic Macedonians and
 others.
 The Government cooperated with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It
 has provided protective status to several thousand refugees from Bosnia and
 Her-egovina but ceased admitting new claimants, except those with close family ties
 to the country, as of mid-1993. There were no reports of persons seeking first asy-
 lum in 1996. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where
 they feared persecution. The Government is concerned about the small flow of eco-
 nomic migrants from neighboring Albania. If caught, they are deported.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens elected a President by popular vote for the first time in 1994, and at the
 same time chose a new Parliament in the second multiparty elections in the coun-
 try's postwar history, the first since independence. Opposition groups charged the
 Government with massive fraud and announced a boycott of the second round.
 International monitors, under the auspices of the Council of Europe and the then-
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, found the elections to he gen-
 eraly free and fair despite widespread irregularities attributed largely to careless
 organization. Local elections on November 17 were a further test of the relative
 strength of government versus opposition parties of of whether the Government
 has put in place internationally recognized electoral practices. Foreign monitors
 found the elections to be a considerable improvement over 1994 and concluded there
 was no need to mount a major mnitoring for the second round on December 1. The
 governing party won a plurality of the vote.
 The unicameral Parliament governs the country. The prime minister, as head of
 government, is selected by the party or coalition that can produce a majority in the
 Parliament. He and the other ministers may not be Members of Parliament. The
 Prime Minister is formaill appointed by the President, who is head of state, chair-
 man of the security council, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
 Although no formal restrictions exist on the participation of women in politics and
 government, they are underrepresented in these areas. Only 1 of 20 ministers is a
 women, and only 4 of 120 Members of Parliament are women.
 Minorities, including ethnic Albanians, ethnic Turks, ethnic Serbs, and Roma,
 have political parties to represent their interests. Minorities nevertheless com-
 plained that the political structures were biased against them. Some ethnic Alba-
 nians claimed that Albanian-majority districts had far more voters than ethnic Mac-
 edonian ones, thus violating the "one-person, one-vote" principle. There is some
 merit to this complaint, but the largest ethnic Albanian party was closely consulted
 by the Government during a redistricting of the country's municipalities in Septem-
 ber, and obtained changes in the law that it sought. Some ethnic Albanians also
 complain that alleged discrimination against them in citizenship decisions effec-
 tively disenfranchises a large portion of their community (see Section 2.d.).
 Ethnic minority Members of Parliament include 19 Albanians, 2 Roma, 1 Serb,
 and 1 Turk. Five Albanian ministers are in the cabinet, one of whom is both a dep-
 uty prime minister and minister of economy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups and ethnic community representatives meet freely with for-
 eign representatives without government interference. A forum for human rights ex-
 ists and operates freely. The Government welcomes independent missions by foreign
 observers but objects to being included in the mandates of human rights observers
 for the former Yugoslavia.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens regardless of race sex,
 national or social origin, political or religious beliefs, property, or social status. Vow-
 
 
 1032
 
 ever, societal discrimination against ethnic minorities and violence against women
 are problems.
 Women.-Women's groups report that there is widespread familial violence
 against women. Cultural norms discourage the reporting of such violence; criminal
 charges on grounds of domestic violence are very rare. A crisis hot line received over
 1,000 calls during 1996.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men. Macedonian society, in both the
 Muslim and Christian communities, remains traditionally patriarchal, and advance-
 ment of women into nontraditional roles is limited. Some prominent professional
 women are now visible in society. Women's advocacy groups include the Union of
 Associations of Macedonian Women and the League of Albanian Women.
 Children.-The country's strong commitment to the rights and welfare of children
 is limited by resource constraints. The Government provides compulsory education
 through the eighth grade. Both family budgets and the Government's ability to pro-
 vide social relief in cases of need are under strain because of poor economic condi-
 tions.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse against children.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The population of 2.2 million is composed of
 a variety of national and ethnic groups, mainly Macedonians, Albanians, Turks,
 Roma, Serbs, and Vlakhs. All citizens are equal under the law. The Constitution
 provides for the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity
 of minorities, including state support for education in minority languages through
 secondary school.
 Ethnic tensions and prejudices are evident within the population. The Govern-
 ment is committed to a policy of peaceful integration of all ethnic groups into society
 but faces political resistance and the persistence of popular prejudices, especially in
 the lower levels of administration. Moreover, the economic crisis makes it difficult
 for the Government to find resources to fulfill minority aspirations, such as more
 education in minority languages. Despite underlying tensions, few incidents oc-
 curred during the year.
 The main political opposition is more nationalistic than the governing coalition
 and objects even to some modest steps to meet the needs of minorities. Popular prej-
 udices can affect the relationships that ethnic minorities have with the Government:
 For example, ethnic Macedonian parents in Kumanovo kept their children from at-
 tending school because the children's teacher, also an ethnic Macedonian, was mar-
 ried to an ethnic Turk, and thus considered of "doubtful religious confession. The
 parents were charged with the misdemeanor offense of not sending their children
 to school.
 Representatives of the ethnic Albanian community, by far the largest minority
 group with 22.9 percent of the population, are the most vocal in charging discrimi-
 nation. Expressing concern about government manipulation of the data, the Alba-
 nian community boycotted a 1990 census. An internationally monitored census held
 during the summer of 1994 to correct the situation was marred by some boycott
 threats. Experts from the Council of Europe monitored the conduct of the census
 and were generally satisfied that it was carried out fairly and accurately and that
 virtually the entire ethnic Albanian community took part. Turks make up about 4
 percent of the population, Roma 2.3 percent, and Serbs 2 percent. About 8,500 citi-
 zens declared themselves Vlakhs.
 Underrepresentation of ethnic Albanians in the military and police is a major
 grievance of the community. Even in areas dominated by ethnic Abanians, the po-
 lce force remains overwhelmingly ethnic Macedonian. The Ministry of Interior says
 that the police force as a whole is only 4 percent ethnic Albanian. The Ministry is
 making efforts to recruit ethnic Albanian police cadets, but complains that it is very
 difficult to attract qualified candidates. Ethnic Albanian leaders allege that there
 is continued discrimination against those who do apply.
 There has been more improvement in the proportion of ethnic Albanians recruited
 into the military. Military service is a universal male obligation, and it appears that
 most young men, whatever their ethnic origin, report for service. The proportion of
 ethnic Albanians in the ranks is now estimated at 25 percent. Fewer ethnic Alba-
 nians are in the officer corps, but some progress is being made in this area as well.
 Few ethnic Albanians serve as Defense Ministry civilian employees; however, the
 Deputy Minister is an ethnic Albanian.
 Albanian-language education is a crucial issue for the ethnic Albanian commu-
 nity, it is seen as vital for preserving Albanian heritage and culture. Almost all eth-
 nic Albanian children receive 8 years of education in Albanian-language schools.
 Less than 40 percent-a slight improvement over 1995-go on to high school, partly
 because of the lack of available classes and partly because the traditional nature
 
 
 1033
 of ethnic Albanian society means that many families in rural areas see no need to
 educate their children, especially #hi, beyond the eighth grade.
 The establishment of an unofficial Albanisn-language university in Tetovo in 1995
 led to a violent clash between demonstrators and police in which one ethnic Alba-
 nian died and about 30 people were injured. Since then the Government has tacitly
 allowed the University, which it still considers to be illegal, to function without giv-
 ig it any official sanction.
 E1thnic Turks, who make up about 4 percent of the population, have also com-
 plained of government    societal, and cultural discrimination. Their main com-
 laints center on Turkish-language education and media. One continuing dispute
 gas been over the desire of parents who consider themselves Turkish to educate
 their children in Turkish despite the fact that they do not speak Turkish at home.
 The Education Ministry refuses to provide Turkish-language education for them,
 noting that the Constitution provides for education in the mother tongue, not a for-
 eign langue. The parents have banded together to hire teachers of their own, but
 this kindf private education is not legally authorized.
 Ethnic Serbs, who comprise about 2 percent of the population, also complained
 about discrimination, alleed censorship of the Serbian press, and their inability to
 worship freely in the Serbian Orthodox church.
 Little tension is evident between the Roma and other citizens of the country.
 There has been some progress in providing supplementary Romani-language edu-
 cation, but no call has been made for a full curriculum. There is some Romani-lan-
 guage broadcasting.
 ere are also a number of Macedonian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims in the
 country.
 The Government established a 13-member Council on Ethnic Relations with rep-
 resentatives of the countrys main ethnic groups. The council has not, however,
 played an active role.
 People With Disabilities--Social programs to meet the needs of the disabled exist
 to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the basis of dis-
 ability is forbidden by law. No laws or regulations mandate accessibility for persons
 with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association-The 1991 Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to form trade unions. There are restrictions in this area for the military, po-
 lice, and the civil service.
 The Council of Trade Unions of Macedonia is the successor organization to the
 old Communist labor confederation. It maintains the assets of the old unions and
 is the Government's main negotiating partner on labor issues. While its officers may
 tend to oppose strikes because of the legacy of the past, they appear to be genuinely
 independent of the Government and committed to the interests of the worers they
 represent. An Association of Independent and Autonomous Unions was formed in
 1992, and independent unions have been allowed to organize without harassment
 by the Government or official unions.
 The disastrous economic situation led to many brief strikes. These were under-
 taken mainly by employees of state-owned companies, many of which were shedding
 workers in the process of privatization and delaying their pay by- up to several
 months. In most cases, the workers and unions understood the difficulties facing
 their companies and showed great restraint.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees! right to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is still in
 its infancy. Legislation in this area has yet to be passed by Parliament.
 There are no export prcesing zones.
 c. Prohibition  f Forced or Compnsory Labor.-Legal prohibitions against forced
 labor are observed in practice.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children.-The constitutional minimum age
 for employment of children is 15 years. Younger children, however, are often seen
 peddling cigarettes or other small items or working in family-owned shops or on
 amily farms. Children may not legally work nights but are permitted to work 42-
 hour weeks. Education is compulsory through grade eight. The Ministries of Interior
 and Labor are responsible for enforcing laws regulating the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The average monthly wage in September was
 about $220 (8,874 denars). The minimum wage is, by law, two-thirds of the average
 wage. The economic crisis meant that few workers could support a family on their
 wages alone and had to do additional work in the informal economy or draw on sav-
 ings.
 
 
 1034
 
 Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning acceptable conditions of work, including
 an official 42-hour workweek with a minimum 24-hour rest period and generous va-
 cation and sick leave benefits. The Former Yugoslav Repubhc of Macedonia adopted
 many of these provisions, including the workweek and rest period. The Constitution
 guarantees safe working conditions, temporary disbility compensation, and leave
 enefits. Although thnere are saws anu re~ tions on worker safety remaining from
 the Yugoslav era, credible reports suggest that they are not strictly enforced. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Work is responsible for enforcing regulations pertain-
 ingto working conditions.
 If workers have safety concerns, employers are supposed to address the dangerous
 situations. Should they fail to do so, employees may leave the dangerous situation
 without forfeiting their job.
