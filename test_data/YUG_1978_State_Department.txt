 YUGOSLAVIA
 In contrast to citizens of other Communist countries,
 Yugoslavs enjoy broad freedom of movement and access
 to foreign publications and radio broadcasts. There
 are few barriers to artistic creativity. The Yugoslav
 Government does, however, enforce significant restric-
 tions on the freedom of political expression and the'
 right to participate in political decision-making. The
 Government does not tolerate public criticism of
 President Tito, the League of Communists (LCY), or the
 principles of "brotherhood and unity" of Yugoslavia's
 diverse peoples. It is not a significant offender with
 respect to violations of the integrity of the person,
 and it has a good record on freedom of emigration and
 the fulfillment of economic needs.
 In recent years challenges from inside and outside the
 Party from nationalist, liberal and pro-Soviet forces
 have made the Yugoslav leadership noticeably more sen-
 sitive to breaches in political discipline. The over-
 all question of individual rights appears to be gaining
 more attention from government authorities and is be-
 coming increasingly a legitimate subject of discussion.
 Recent indications include public questioning of the
 application of a "political suitability" test for
 employment, public discussion of the rights of defen-
 dants in trials involving recorded evidence and approval
 of compensation for an individual falsely arrested.
 In addition, the number of political arrests appears
 to be down from the higher level of several years ago.
 In November 1977 the Government granted amnesty to over
 200 individuals accused of political offenses, includ-
 ing most of the highly-publicized cases. Also in 1977,
 Yugoslavia hosted the first review session of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the
 Helsinki accords), and publicly acknowledged that human
 rights practices were a legitimate subject for inter-
 national discussion.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 (510)
 
 
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned by the authorities nor have
 there been any substantiated reports of its practice.
 The Constitution guarantees the integrity of the person
 and expressly prohibits forced confessions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been occasional allegations of treatment
 which would appear to be cruel, inhuman, or degrading.
 For example, a small number of political prisoners has
 reportedly been held in solitary confinement for ex-
 tended periods and there have been unconfirmed reports
 of beatings of prisoners by police. When persons are
 mistreated, they can often obtain redress, and the
 Government has, in some cases, taken corrective measures.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest,
 although large numbers of suspects have reportedly been
 detained for questioning after terrorist acts. Nor-
 mally, arraignment quickly follows arrest. Indictment
 must be brought within three months,.except that the
 investigating judge can request from the court an ex-
 tension of three months or even longer if justification
 for a deferral is presented.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public except in cases
 involving military or national security questions when
 the judge has the authority to hold proceedings in
 camera. The trial record does not necessarily provide
 a full transcript and all testimony is recorded in the
 words of the presiding judge.. Government controls on
 the media also affect the degree and nature of publicity
 accorded the proceedings. The accused has the right to
 counsel, and Yugoslav lawyers have often vigorously
 defended their clients. The Government, though, has not
 always remained impartial in judicial proceedings. Two
 years ago a defense counsel was convicted of displaying
 an anti-state attitude in arguments on behalf of his
 
 
 client. In other cases there have been reports that
 the authorities influenced the testimony of witnesses.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslav code of criminal procedure contains elab-
 orate provisions for conducting searches, including
 the requirement for a court order except under certain
 limited circumstances. There are no indications of
 widespread violations.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government has a good record in promoting fulfill-
 ment of basic needs for food, shelter, health care,
 and education. There is an extensive system of social
 security and other benefits for those who are old,
 disabled or without employment. While deficiencies
 in these areas exist, they are primarily due to eco-
 nomic constraints rather than insensitivity to basic
 human needs or deliberate policies of neglect. More-
 over the Government has been attempting to correct
 lapses in its program of social services. For example,
 1978 legislation extends social security and health
 benefits to all private farmers, a group that previ-
 ously had only limited access to social welfare
 programs.
 There is evidence that some individuals in privileged
 positions, both in the government and business sectors,
 use their power to acquire perquisites, but there is
 no indication that significant economic resources are
 being diverted for these purposes. The poor are largely
 victims of structural features of the economy, and the
 Government seeks to improve their lot.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 
 
 513
 Freedom of thoughtis honored in principle, but public
 expression of dissident political views is strongly
 discouraged. In particular, the Government does not
 tolerate criticism of the LCY and its leadership, of
 basic domestic and foreign policies, or of the self-
 management system or the "brotherhood and unity" of the
 country's diverse ethnic groups. While this policy is
 enforced mainly by condemnation of dissident views in
 the media and informal pressure exerted by local LCY
 authorities, the Government occasionally resorts to
 arrest, trial and imprisonment. Under Yugoslav law,
 dissidents can be charged with a variety of vaguely
 defined political crimes (e.g., hostile propaganda,
 counter-revolution and association against the state).
 Various private organizations have reported on the
 human rights situation in Yugoslavia and criticized
 Government restrictions on political expression and the
 arrest of persons espousing dissident political views.
 In 1977 Freedom House estimated that there were 500
 political prisoners while the International League for
 Human Rights placed the number at 600. Amnesty Inter-
 national also disclosed in 1977 the names of 100 pris-
 oners in Yugoslavia whom it had included under its
 adoption program. Yugoslav authorities have acknow-
 ledged the existence of political prisoners and at
 various times cited figures ranging from 500 to 700.
 In November, 1977 the Yugoslav Government granted
 amnesty to more than 200 political detainees, including
 many of those whose cases had been widely publicized.
 Such amnesties, while not routine, have been granted
 from time to timer usually on the occasion of Yugoslav
 National day in November. On the basis of official and
 unofficial reports, the number of persons currently
 imprisoned on-political charges is believed to be
 between 400 and 500.
 Freedom of religious practice and assembly is guaran-
 teed by the Constitution and is honored so long as
 religious organizations do not engage in political
 activities. Constraints are imposed on proselytizing
 activities and religious education. Public political
 gatherings are permitted only on the authority of
 official bodies. In practice, the right to political
 assembly is exercised exclusively by groups supporting
 government policy.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Movement within the County. Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed in
 the Constitution and is not infringed upon in practice.
 Yugoslavs travel abroad at will, although a small
 number of "dissidents" have been denied passports on
 national security grounds. Hundreds of thousands of
 Yugoslav workers are currently working in Western Europe.
 There are no restrictions on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in Political Process
 The Constitution has provisions guaranteeing partici-
 pation in the political process, and the "self-management"
 system encourages wide participation in the decision-
 making process on both political and economic issues.
 There is evidence that major policy decisions at every
 level are subject to broad discussion. Nevertheless,
 the LCY's control of political power and restrictions
 against unauthorized political expression set certain
 limits on such participation.
 Under the worker self-management system, there is no
 guarantee of the right to strike; all labor disputes
 are expected to be resolved by the workers' council
 in deliberation with management. Work stoppages,
 though, have occurred over pay levels and working
 conditions, and these have generally resulted in the
 correction of specific grievances. Women are repre-
 sented in most walks of life, including high-level
 governmental positions, and receive equal pay for equal
 work.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Yugoslavia is a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission. Although the Government has shown
 a willingness to raise the overall question of human
 rights in international fora, including meetings of
 the nonaligned countries, it remains sensitive to any
 charges of human rights violations within Yugoslavia.
 
 
 515
 The Government generally views the adjudication of
 poltical crimes as an internal matter and not subject
 to outside investigation on grounds of national sov-
 ereignty. In 1976, however, Yugoslav officials did
 agree to meet with representatives of Amnesty Inter-
 national to discuss charges of political repression
 and individual cases of arrest and imprisonment.
