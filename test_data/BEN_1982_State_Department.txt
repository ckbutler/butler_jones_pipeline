 BENIN
 Benin went through numerous leadership changes
 from independence in 1960 until the assumption of power by
 the present leadership in 1972. Declaring itself
 Marxist-Leninist and revolutionary in 1974-75, the Government
 is very much under the control of its President, Mathieu
 Kerekou, and the sole political party, the Peoples'
 Revolutionary Party of Benin. The party remains highly
 centralized. Although rights are guaranteed on paper,
 the Government's desire for absolute control has translated
 into only limited tolerance for dissent. A failed mercenary
 attack in 1977 created a suspicion of foreign intervention
 which continues to this day. While there is evidence
 the Government is attempting to moderate its policies, it
 remains to be seen whether these attempts will modify its
 basically repressive posture on domestic human rights.
 In a relatively closed political system such as Benin's, data
 on human rights violations are difficult to obtain. Beninese
 often act with some caution in exercising their civil
 rights. Political rights must be exercised within the
 confines of the existing system.
 Some changes are reportedly occurring in Benin's human rights
 situation, but these are difficult to confirm officially.
 The figure:200 is generally accepted as the number of
 political prisoners in country, but rumors regarding the
 release of some these, particularly students, either to full
 freedom or to confinement at home, may indicate that number
 has declined slightly during the past year. Benin still
 holds a number of political prisoners, however, and releases
 under a government amnesty, rumored to be planned for the
 November 30, 1982 National Day, did not take place.
 Benin ranks among the world's poorest countries. At
 a relatively low level of economic development, Benin's
 population lives for the most part on agricultural
 earnings and small trade. Although the present Government
 has created a number of wholly or partially state-owned
 corporations, their contribution to the economy is generally
 minor, and small-scale private agriculture and trade remain
 the means of livelihood for the great mass of the population.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 As far as can be determined, there has been no kili-
 ing for political or related motives during the past
 year in Benin.
 
 
 b. Disappearances
 There were no reports of disappearances or secret arrests in
 1982, and it is unlikely any such incidents occurred.
 c. Torture
 Torture is not specifically prohibited by Beninese law.
 Although there were no official reports of torture in the
 country in 1982, Amnesty International's 1982 report
 reviewing 1981 events cites mistreatment of detainees.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Physical punishment of prisoners undoubtedly occurs in
 Benin, and prison conditions are poor, with inadequate
 sanitary conditions and severe space constraints. There is
 no reported discrimination in the treatment of prisoners by
 sex, religion, or national origin. Amnesty International in
 its 1982 report included inhuman prison conditions among its
 human rights concerns in Benin.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is nothing in the legal system which guarantees
 habeas corpus or which bars arbitrary arrest. Arrests can be
 for as long or as short a period as authorities determine.
 Arbitrary arrest and preventive detention generally occur
 only in periods of high political tension, and there have
 been no reports of such incidents in 1982. Some political
 prisoners have been imprisoned for seven or more years. At
 least some of the students arrested in 1979 remain in prison,
 but many have reportedly been released. There were instances
 in the past year where students who demonstrated against
 authority were arrested, but they were apparently released
 soon thereafter.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary does not operate as an independent branch
 of the Government. Depending upon the sensitivity of the
 case, defendants may or may not be permitted legal counsel.
 There is no time limit on charging a defendant or on bringing
 a person to trial. In recent years, the Government has used
 only the established civilian revolutionary court system.
 Courts are organized on provincial and national levels, and
 they are planned for the district level when sufficient
 judges have been trained. The highest court of appeal is the
 Central Peoples' Court.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Despite constitutional provisions safeguarding the inviolability
 of the home, forced entry is occasionally rumored to take
 place, particularly in sensitive political cases. Beninese
 law provides, however, that a warrant must be obtained from a
 judge before police can enter a residence. There are no
 known instances of other types of violation of the home by
 the Government of Benin.

 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Benin's Marxist-Leninist leadership suppresses individual
 freedoms of spiech and press in the interest of the party-
 state. Opposition to government policies and criticism
 of the Government are not tolerated.
 The local press is government owned and operated, but
 there is no censorship of foreign books and artistic works.
 Academic freedom on non-political issues is permitted. There
 are no independent media in Benin, except for a Catholic
 Church newsletter. No media have been closed recently;
 those which operated privately prior to 1972 closed
 thereafter or were taken over by the state.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 With the exception of political gatherings, public meetings
 are allowed. Political meetings must be sponsored by the
 single party. Labor unions are unified under a general
 organizational umbrella and are organs of the party and
 Government.   Although controlled by the Government,
 individual local unions negotiate with individual employers
 and represent their fellow workers' grievances, so that the
 Government may in reality often have to play the role of
 arbiter. There is no known persecution of professional
 groups in-Benin. Both unions and professional groups
 maintain international affiliations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no officially favored religion in Benin. The open
 practice of religion is permitted, except for one syn-
 cretistic group, Celestial Christanity, which has been
 banned by the Government. There are no other restrictions
 on religious ceremonies or teachings. Religious conversion
 is freely permitted. Except for the Celestial Christianity
 group, there is no religious discrimination. Adherence to a
 particular faith confers no particular status or benefits.
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religion all co-exist
 in Benin.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. International move-
 ment is controlled to the degree %hat a passport and exit
 permission must be obtained for travel to other than West
 African countries, but obtaining them presents no unusual
 problems. Economic rather than governmental concerns usually
 preclude travel outside the region. There are no restrictions
 placed on residence within Benin, except for recently-
 released prisoners who may be subject to travel restrictions.
 Emigration is a way of life; many Beninese go to neighboring
 countries to earn their livelihood. Citizenship is not
 revoked. Beninese abroad are encouraged to return home to
 help develop their country, although only a small number
 have  returned. The few refugees in Benin appear to have no
 problems in staying in the country.

 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 With the Action Plan of 1972, the Marxist-Leninist
 Option of 1974, the proclamation of the Peoples'
 Republic of Benin in 1975, and the Constitution of 1979,
 the Government attempted to restructure the political
 system, and the Beninese economy, along the lines of
 East European models. The single party plays a role
 similar in theory to that of the Soviet and other
 ruling Communist parties. Despite considerable pro-
 gress in building up the party's role, placing civilians
 in the Government, and creating various revolutionary
 institutions, the military remains the primary power
 base of the Kerekou regime.
 All political activity occurs within the context of
 the one-party system, and there is little real political
 choice. On the local level, mass rallies select candi-
 dates who make up the party slate. No opposition to this
 slate is permitted. The party controls the entire
 electoral process and even local party-endorsed
 officials are under the authority of government-
 appointed district officers. Opposition groups are
 not allowed. Women are represented in the Govern-
 ment and in the party structure.
 3.    Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government considers any attempt to investi-
 gate human rights practices an interference in its
 internal affairs. Amnesty International has appealed to
 the Government for the release of various persons de-
 tained without charge or trial. In one 1981 case,
 Amnesty reported that the Government informed the
 organization that a prisoner had been detained "in
 conformity with the laws and regulations in force..."
 "but offered no further information concerning the
 reason for detention."   The Government makes
 occasional strong statements about human rights in
 other areas of the world, e.g., the Middle East.
 There are no organizations in Benin which attempt
 to protect individual liberties. Freedom House in 1982
 called Benin "not free".
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Government has tried since assuming power in 1972
 to distribute the country's wealth more equitably and to
 promote economic development, particularly in the poorer
 rural areas. There is a working system of old age bene-
 fits and free medical care.
 The population numbers an estimated 3,683,000 per-
 sons, growing at a rate of three percent per year.
 Unadjusted per capita GNP reached $304.6 in 1980, but
 inflation has accounted for much of the GNP increase in
 recent years. Benin still ranks as one of the world's
 25 poorest countries. Life expectancy at birth is 47
 years, and the infant mortality rate is 154.4 per
 1,000 live births. The adult literacy rate was last
 estimated at 11 percent, but the country has an active
 
 
 31
 literacy program in operation, Twenty-one percent of the
 population has access to safe water, and there are a number
 of well-drilling programs (combined with sanitation
 education) underway which may raise this figure in coming
 years. Primary school enrollment increased from 34.28
 percent in 1972 to 50.98 percent in 1982. Education
 consumes one-third of the national budget. On the average,
 the population receives 98 percent of the daily nutritional
 requirements. Sixty-five percent of the rural population
 lives below the poverty level.
