 CHILE
 Chile has been ruled since 1973 by the Army's Commanding
 General, President Augusto Pinochet. A military junta
 composed of representatives of the four military services
 exercises legislative functions, but primary authority resides
 with President Pinochet. Since independence in 1810, Chile
 has experienced alternating periods of authoritarian and
 parliamentary rule. The Junta took power in 1973 when the
 multi-party democratic system, in place since a previous
 military regime was replaced in 1931, broke down during a
 period of Marxist-led rule from 1970-73. The current
 Government includes both civilian and military officials and
 operates based on the authority of the Constitution approved
 by popular plebiscite in September 1980, which replaced the
 previous Constitution of 1925.
 Under the September 1980 Constitution, President Pinochet's
 term of office expires in 1989, when a plebiscite will be held
 on a presidential candidate to be selected by the Junta.
 There are no restrictions on President Pinochet's standing for
 another term of office. If approved, the Junta candidate
 would serve until 1997. If rejected, open and direct
 presidential elections would be held within one year. The
 Constitution also provides that the Junta will serve until
 congressional elections are held in 1990.
 The series of "National Days of Protest', begun in May 1983 by
 political and trade union groups calling for the removal of
 President Pinochet and an accelerated return to an elected
 civilian government, continued in 1984 on a diminished scale.
 There were six "National Days of Protest', often marked by
 violence, as well as a series of smaller demonstrations. Most
 democratic political parties object to the provisions of the
 1980 Constitution delaying the transition to democracy and to
 various other provisions restricting liberties previously
 established in the 1925 Constitution. The Marxist-Leninist
 parties and groups do not accept the legitimacy of the 1980
 Constitution.
 While the military have indicated their intention to carry out
 the provisions of the 1980 Constitution, and in spite of
 extensive discussion and study in 1984, no progress was made
 in legalizing political parties, establishing electoral laws
 and an electoral tribunal, or in reestablishing electoral
 registers. Progress on the proposed legislation was set back
 when President Pinochet announced on October 29 that the
 political parties law would not be promulgated until after
 other political laws, at an undetermined future date.
 Human rights conditions in Chile are strongly affected by the
 lack of progress toward a transition to democracy and by
 terrorism from the extreme left. The general human rights
 trend in Chile continued to be mixed. During early 1984,
 there were specific human rights improvements in judicial
 independence, in the return of exiles, and in freedom of
 speech and association. This improvement was coincident with
 the political opening begun in late 1983 and followed the
 series of national protests. As the political opening
 faltered and then failed, human rights conditions
 deteriorated, including in those areas where progress had been
 noted.
 Parallel to the lack of progress on the political transition,
 a significant problem of terrorism and political violence
 
 
 451
 CHILE
 emerged in Chile in 1984. There were 735 terrorist bombings
 in 1984, compared to 139 in 1983. Responsibility for most of
 these acts was claimed by the Manuel Rogriguez Patriotic Front
 (KRPF), a guerrilla organization created by the the Chilean
 Communist Party in 1980. The Communist Party and the MRPF
 seek the overthrow of the military government and were
 responsible for significant human rights violations in 1984,
 including murder.
 On November 6, 1984, the Government reinstated a State of
 Siege under the authority of Transitory Article 41 of the 1980
 Constitution. The Government explained the State of Siege as
 necessary to curb growing terrorism and to control delinquency
 and violent protestors. However, the same authority was used
 against non-violent political dissenters as well. The
 Government has maintained significant discretionary authority
 since 1973 under three of the four states of exception
 provided for under the transitory articles of the 1980
 Constitution which progressively limit civil liberties
 otherwise provided for by the Constitution. All four may be
 in force concurrently; three were in force concurrently in
 late 1984. The "State of Danger of Disturbance of Internal
 Peace* (renewable every six months) was extended in March and
 September, and has been in force continuously since the
 promulgation of the Constitution in March 1981. The 'State of
 Emergency', which had been lifted in August 1983 after ten
 continuous years, was reinstituted in March 1984 (renewable
 every 90 days) in response to the perception by the Government
 of a threat of violence during the opposition's March 27
 "National Day of Protest*. The most restrictive state of
 exception, the State of Assembly, has never been implemented
 by the Government.
 Prior to the State of Siege, Government attempts to restrict
 individual liberties had generally been based on the
 provisions of the 1958 Internal Security Law, under which the
 courts have usually ruled in favor of the defendants, or on
 the transitory articles of the 1980 Constitution, which in
 accordance with the States of Emergency and Danger of
 Disturbance of Internal Peace allow extrajudicial penalties
 such as internal and external exile.
 Measures taken by the Government under the State of Siege
 resulted in numerous violations of internationally recognized
 human rights and a general deterioration of human rights
 practices. Under the State of Siege, the Government increased
 its authority at the expense of the courts, whose rights of
 judicial review were restricted, and over the communications
 media. In addition, the existing powers of the Government,
 under the previously existing State of Danger of Disturbance
 of Internal Peace, State of Emergency and the transitory
 articles of the 1980 Constitution, were applied more
 vigorously. Using these extraordinary powers, the Government
 conducted several mass sweeps of poorer neighborhoods
 involving the temporary detention of over 8,000 persons, sent
 421 persons, mainly alleged petty criminals, to a remote
 detention camp without trial and internally exiled another 257
 persons without charges or trial, closed down or restricted
 the opposition media, restricted nearly all domestic political
 reporting, expelled two foreign priests, allegedly for
 political activities, censored public statements by Catholic
 Church leaders, as well as prohibiting several meetings
 planned by the Church, reimposed a late night curfew and
 selectively detained various political and trade union members
 
 
 452
 CHILE
 for their political activities. Individual arrests related to
 politically motivated violent or non-violent activities rose
 substantially. Allegations of torture increased compared to
 1983.
 The State of Siege also undercut tie political opening begun
 in August 1983, under which political parties, although still
 tectnically illegal or suspended, were allowed to operate in
 an increasingly open manner. Under the State of Siege,
 democratic non-Marxist parties continued functioning, albeit
 without media coverage, but some democratic socialist groups
 and non-democratic Marxist groups, including the Communist
 Party, were harassed and detentions occured.
 Chile has an internal security apparatus composed of tile
 National Information Center (CNI), a plain-clothes police
 force (Investigations), a militia-type police force
 (Carabineros) and military intelligence units. All are under
 the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense except the CNI,
 which is technically under the Ministry of Interior but is run
 by military officers. Most complaints concerning the security
 services are directed against the CNI, although the police
 forces have sometimes been accused of using excessive force in
 controlling violent demonstrations and in raids in poor
 neignbornoods in search of terrorists and weapons.
 Labor union activity continued to be subject to the 1979
 "Labor Plan," which reformulated and restored many labor
 rights, including collective bargaining. However, some other
 rights remain restricted and the right to strike in
 non-strategic industries continues to be limited to 60 days.
 During 1984, the Government continued to allow the return of
 some exiles. In September, an official list of 4,860 Chileans
 prohibited from returning was made public together with the
 statement by a government spokesman that all others were free
 to return. Prior to publication of the list, an average of
 50-100 exiles per month had been authorized to return
 tnroughout 1984 under an already established system which will
 continue for those on the prohibition list. Included on the
 prohibited list were the names of two persons expelled earlier
 in the year. Both returned because of a favorable court
 decision. When that decision was later overturned on a
 government appeal, the two went into hiding after their names
 were published among those not permitted to return.
 Throughout the year, various groups of exiles on the list of
 t|iose prohibited reentry attempted to return to Chile. These
 individuals were denied entry and airlines were informed that
 they would be obliged to return the exiles to their point of
 departure at the airlines' expense.
 Despite a large public sector and considerable government
 regulation of the economy, Chile basically follows a free
 market model. Chile's level of economic development places it
 among the most advanced of the less developed countries, and
 educational and health standards are good. The Government
 respects private property, and encourages private business.
 Nonetheless, the severe recession from late 1981 to mid-1983
 led to an increase in government intervention in the economy,
 especially for ailing financial institutions. A two-year
 macroeconomic adjustment program, agreed upon with the
 International Monetary Fund in January 1983, limits the
 Government's economic policy options. Government efforts to
 stimulate the economy in 1983 led to a decline in
 
 
 453
 CHILE
 unemployment. However, the level of unemployment equaled 14.6
 percent of the work force for the three-month period ending in
 November 1984, the same as at the end of 1983. Over the same
 period, the percentage of the work force in public work
 programs declined from 13.2 percent to 9.7 percent. Social
 expenditures as a percentage of total government spending
 totaled 59.7 percent in 1983 with emphasis directed at the
 poor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated violence increased in Chile in 1984. A
 total of 58 persons were killed and 515 injured in apparently
 politically-related acts. The deaths and injuries resulted
 from actions by the Government, by left and right-wing
 terrorists, and by those associated with protest
 demonstrations and include those specified in the following
 paragraphs.
 The death of an individual under detention by the CNI in the
 town of La Serena and the discovery of the body of a young
 worker several weeks after he was allegedly detained by
 Carabineros are currently under judicial investigation.
 Assertions have been made that several of the 14 alleged
 extremists killed and four wounded in shoot-outs with
 government security forces were actually murders of
 surrendered or surrendering suspects. An Army officer
 apparently killed himself when a bomb being planted in a
 church exploded prematurely.
 Two government security agents were killed and eight wounded
 in the shoot-outs with extremists. In addition, 26 government
 security agents were wounded as a result of 21 separate
 terrorist attacks on precinct houses.
 The continuation of "National Days of Protest* in 1984, as
 well as numerous smaller demonstrations, resulted in 24
 civilians being killed and about 335 injured as a consequence
 of government attempts to control popular demonstrations or in
 associated accidents (down from 45 killed and about 400
 injured in 1983). In addition, nine uniformed security agents
 were killed and about 45 more were injured during the protests.
 In the 735 separate terrorist bombing attacks, most of which
 the Chilean Communist Party-linked Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
 Front (MRPF) claimed to have carried out, four persons were
 killed and 102 injured. There is considerable evidence of
 Cuban, Nicaraguan, Libyan, and East European training and
 other support for the MRPF and the leftist terrorist group the
 Movement of the Revolutionary Left. The objective of both
 groups is the violent overthrow of the military regime and its
 replacement with a Marxist-Leninist regime.
 One person, a Mapuche Indian leader, died under unknown
 circumstances in an action the rightist terrorist group
 Chilean Anti-Communist Action (ACHA) claims to have carried
 out. Human rights sources believe that ACHA is supported by
 and has links to Chilean government security services,
 particularly the CNI. Death threats from ACHA were received
 
 
 CHILE
 by numerous human rights and Indian leaders throughout Chile
 in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 The first case of mysterious disappearance since 1978 occurred
 in 1984. On October 25 the body of a young Chilean worker was
 found in a river. The body was decapitated and missing one
 hand. Family members identified the body as that of an
 individual arrested by the Carabineros on September 4. The
 Catholic Church human rights organization, the Vicariate of
 Solidarity, has initiated civil and military court
 proceedings. The security services deny that the individual
 was arrested.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and police brutality continue to be a serious problem
 in Chile. Torture by the security services, particularly the
 CNI, in actions related to its anti-terrorist mandate, is
 apparently permitted by the Government. The Chilean Medical
 Association is investigating cases of involvement by military
 doctors in torture and is preparing disciplinary action in one
 case.
 The Constitution prohibits 'use of all illegal pressure' and
 guarantees to all persons the right to life and to the
 physical and psychic integrity of the individual.* High-level
 government officials deny that the use of torture is
 authorized, but there is no evidence of specific government
 action to end torture. Transitory Article 24 of the
 Constitution permits incarceration in places other than jails,
 and it is in these other detention facilities where most
 torture is alleged to occur. In June, however, in keeping
 with a late 1983 court ruling, the Ministry of Justice
 published the addresses of ten previously secret CNI detention
 centers. The Government has also given itself authority for
 tie CNI formally to arrest persons and detain them in its own
 facilities.
 Credible reports of torture at these and possibly other
 detention centers of the CNI were made public by human rights
 sources in 1984. On October 18, one individual died,
 apparently as a result of torture while in CNI custody. The
 hospital admittance report, as well as the victim's oral
 testimony prior to his death, indicated that he had been
 subjected to electrical shocks and repeated blows to the
 abdomen which reportedly caused extensive internal bleeding.
 A habeus corpus petition was presented in favor of the man
 shortly after his detention. However, the petition was
 denied. The man was subsequently delivered by the CNI to a
 hospital where he died in surgery. CNI issued a statement
 saying the individual, a regional member of the Christian
 Democratic Party, was a terrorist.
 In 1984, 84 persons filed complaints in courts alleging
 torture or cruel and unusual punishment compared with a total
 of 77 in 1983, 57 in 1982, 68 in 1981, and 100 in 1980. From
 1976 to 1979, cases of torture declined as compared to the
 period 1973 - 1975. Most of these individuals allege that
 they were subjected to beatings, electric shocks, or threats,
 particularly during the first days of detention prior to
 arraignment. Chilean judges have recently begun ordering
 
 
 455
 CHILE
 physical examinations for those alleging torture but no cases
 have completed the court process as yet. In most cases, the
 civilian judges have indicated that they lack jurisdiction and
 tne cases have been referred to military courts where the
 military judges have either indicated an inability to identify
 the perpetrators or had nothing to report. While the civilian
 courts have named individuals they believe should have been
 indicted for torture if the civilian courts had jurisdiction,
 or, therefore, who should be indicted by the military courts,
 no military person has been charged or tried for torture in
 Chile.
 Although the Government asserts that security and military
 forces are under strict control, a continuation of incidents
 of deliberate and random police brutality was reported by both
 Chilean and international human rights sources during 1984.
 Some such street incidents have been photographed and
 reproduced internationally on television. While most
 detainees do not file formal claims of mistreatment, some
 persons detained during the 'National Days of Protest' or on
 other political grounds have complained of being beaten and
 forced to remain unclothed for extended periods of time. As a
 result of some of these incidents, police and military
 officials accused of excessive use of force were arrested.
 Must of those arrested have been arraigned and are currently
 free on bail awaiting trial.
 Since January 1981, all persons officially charged with or
 convicted of violation of internal security laws have been
 lodged in the same penal facilities with other offenders.
 They have the rights of visitation and communications with
 family, friends, legal counsel, and representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrests, detentions and internal exile without trial
 were amony the most serious areas of human rights violations
 in 1984. Under the state of siege, more than 8,000 persons
 were temporarily detained in massive police round-ups.
 Hundreds were detained without charge and 678 were sent into
 internal exile (421 to the Pisagua detention camp and 257 to
 other remote locations). Transitory Article 24 of the 1980
 Constitution provides that security officials may detain
 individuals for investigation for a period of up to five days
 and up to 20 days in cases of terrorist acts which involve
 death, injury, or kidnapping before bringing them to a court.
 -During the initial period of investigation, prisoners are
 often held incommunicado. In those cases reaching the courts,
 the investigating judges may take up to five more days to
 deliberate. These time limits are enforced and all defendants
 are allowed a lawyer of their own choosing. Lawyers
 affiliated with human rights groups are readily available
 without charge if necessary. Some of those arrested are
 charged with common crimes, such as illegal possession of
 weapons, roboery or murder. In other instances, the arrests
 appear clearly related to expression of the individual's
 political views or to alleged seditious activity, although the
 Government denies that anyone is arrested or detained because
 of his or her political views.
 Although Chilean law specifically states that search and/or
 arrest warrants must be obtained from the courts and shown to
 the accused before implementation, a right guaranteed by the
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 30
 
 
 456
 CHILE
 1980 Constitution, this right is undercut by the Executive
 Powers granted under Transitory Article 24. In 1984, the CNI
 continued to obtain broadly-worded warrants which gave it
 considerable latitude in making searches or arrests. In most
 cases during the State of Siege, no warrants were shown by
 security officers. However, the courts have become firmer in
 demanding prompt accounts from the Government of those
 arrested by the CNI, including during the State of Siege.
 While writs of habeas corpus can be and are accepted during
 tne initial arrest period, judges traditionally have been
 required only to verify the legal authority under which the
 person was detained. On November 12, the Supreme Court
 ordered all judges to begin insisting on the physical presence
 of the detainee in the courtroom, but it is not yet clear
 whether the Government will abide by the Court's order. When
 individuals are detained for activities related to politics,
 friends or relatives normally report the detentions, the press
 publicizes them, and the Government subsequently acknowledges
 them, although press restrictions during the State of Siege
 have made this process less effective.
 The Catholic Church human rights organization, the Vicariate
 of Solidarity, reported handling directly a total of 5,264
 detentions for security reasons during 1984, including 2,446
 individual and 2,818 persons arrested in groups. (The
 comparative figures for 1983 were 4,537 total arrests, of
 wnich 73t were individual arrests and 3,802 persons arrested
 in groups.) In 1984, as in previous years, only about one
 ,ercent of those initially arrested were convicted of a
 serious crime, nearly two percent were internally or
 externally exiled by administrative decree, another 40 percent
 paid small fines in a municipal court (averaging less than ten
 dollars per person) for disorderly behaviour, about nine
 percent were declared innocent following a public trial, about
 13 percent were released by investigating judges for lack of
 sufficient evidence and slightly over 35 percent were released
 by toe Government within five days without any charges being
 pressed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Actions taken under the State of Siege resulted in serious
 violations of the right to a fair public trial. Respect for
 individual rights and civil liberties are guaranteed by the
 1980 Constitution, but they are restricted to varying degrees
 by constitutionally sanctioned emergency powers. In 1984, the
 Chilean Government used its extraordinary powers under
 Transitory Article 24 effectively to nullify due process of
 law in several instances. Special laws were created or
 administrative decrees issued to thwart or reverse decisions
 by the court system.
 As part of a general trend towards greater judicial
 independence, the courts have struck down some of these new
 laws and some lower courts even challenged Executive actions
 sanctioned by the transitory articles of the Constitution.
 Tnis trend suffered a setback in July when the Supreme Court
 held that the President had 'exclusive" power under authority
 granted in Transitory Article 24 to declare a 'State of Danger
 of Disturbance of Internal Peace" and that "all means of
 judicial appeal (of executive actions authorized by that
 article) were suspended," leaving only the possibility of
 appeal to tae President. However, as arrests and detentions
 continued under the State of Siege, a conflict emerged between
 
 
 CHILE
 the Executive and Judicial Branches of Government. The
 Judicial Branch is insisting that the courts have jurisdiction
 over those detained and can order inspections and process
 writs of habeus corpus under Article 21 of the Constitution.
 The Executive Branch insists that the Executive has the right
 to detain persons, per Article 41, which outlines procedures
 for the State of Siege. The Supreme Court has issued
 instructions to all Municipal Court officials outlining their
 responsibilities under the State of Siege. It is not clear
 wnether the Government will comply with the Court's
 instructions.
 Chile's civilian judges are career officials and most served
 in the judiciary before the present Government took power in
 1973. First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of
 proscribed political activities lies with regular civilian
 courts. As is common in Latin America, there is no trial by
 jury, and reliance is on the written record, rather than oral
 testimony. A judge serves multiple functions: as prosecutor,
 sometimes as defense attorney, and finally as the one who
 decides innocence or guilt. There is a well-developed
 multi-stage appeal process leading ultimately to the Supreme
 Court. Defendants' full legal rights to due process of law,
 including the right to legal counsel of their choice, have
 been limited by the State of Siege. In 1983 and 1984, there
 were fewer accusations than in past years that judges failed
 to assert their independence from the Government.
 Weapons violations, which often are the basis of charges
 against alleged subversives, are tried before a military
 court. Appeals may be made to a military court of two
 civilian judges and three professional military judges and, in
 the last resort, to the entirely civilian Supreme Court. A
 1981 decree granting juridiction over attacks on government
 personnel to a military tribunal--in which defendants' rights
 are limited--was invoked once in 1981, not at all in 1982, and
 in 1983 only fur the accused assassins of the Santiago
 military intendant (governor) and his two army bodyguards.
 The decree was not invoked in 1984, except for the
 continuation of a 1983 case, whose constitutional legality is
 currently under appeal to the Supreme Court.
 At tne end of 1984, the Vicariate of Solidarity reported that
 274 persons were imprisoned in Chile for politically motivated
 acts, some of whicn were violent; 227 were in jail awaiting
 trial and 34 were serving sentences after convictions.
 Additionally, 524 were free on bail while awaiting trial, 5
 had been judicially sent into internal exile, 8 externally
 exiled by judicial decisions, 86 were free on parole and 8
 were fugitives. In addition, 766 persons were internally
 exiled during the year for up to three months by
 administrative orders not subject to judicial reviews,
 compared to 98 in 1983. Most were sent to distant villages as
 punishment for illegal political activities or because they
 were regarded as habitual criminals. Eight persons were
 expelled from Chile in 1984 under Transitory Article 24 of the
 1980 Constitution compared to no cases in 1983 and two cases
 in 1982. There have been no charges of forced labor in Chile
 since the mid-1970s.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Searches or the home and interception of private verbal or
 written communications are permitted by the 1980 Constitution
 
 
 458
 CHILE
 provided that search warrants are issued by either a civilian
 or military court for specific locations. Wiretapping is also
 permitted subject to issuance of a judicial order. The new
 anti-terrorist law published May 17, 1984, in Articles 9 and
 14, provides legal authority for surveillance of those
 advocating political views contrary to the 1980 Constitution
 and for interception, opening or recording of private
 communications and documents as well as the surveillance of
 individuals suspected of the commission of terrorist crimes.
 There are allegations that security forces do not always
 comply with the legal requirements for search warrants or
 judicial orders. In addition, searches of homes continue to
 be carried out under general warrants issued by civilian or
 military courts. Human rights organizations report that in a
 number of searches, legal requirements, such as display of a
 warrant, were not observed. This was particularly true in the
 search-and-detain operations carried out in four poor Santiago
 neighborhoods during November under the State of Siege where
 extensive property damage was also reported.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1980 Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and of
 the press. While freedom of speech is the norm in private
 conversations in Chile, various human rights groups indicate
 that extensive monitoring of mail and telephonic
 communications is conducted by government security services,
 particularly CNI. There are no constitutional provisions for
 otficial censorship. However, the Government exercises
 control of the media under the authority of Transitory Article
 24 of the Constitution and the three states of exception
 concurrently in force (State of Danger of Disturbance of
 Internal Peace, State of Emergency and State of Siege). In
 addition, since 1973, the Government, usually through informal
 channels, has advised print, radio and television editors when
 their coverage was considered too critical of the Government.
 To forestall such notification, self-censorship is practiced
 uy the electronic media and dailies with most editors adopting
 a cautious approach in the formulation of commentary. Several
 major media companies are in debt to government financial
 institutions, possibly'resulting in further constraints on
 freedom of expression.
 Tne Government, after relaxing controls on the media in 1983,
 in 1984 reestablished and enlarged restrictions on freedom of
 the press. Steps were taken through the civil and military
 courts, through a series of special administrative measures
 made possible by the powers granted the Government during the
 "State of Emergency" declared on March 21, and by rewriting
 tne laws on libel and defamation of character. Multiple,
 overlapping edicts were issued banning photos, placement of
 news, types of news, specific coverage, and specific topics.
 Several journalists were arrested. While the courts threw out
 most of the edicts as unconstitutional, the Government
 achieved its short-term objective of blocking specific issues
 or news and, in several instances, simply issued another edict
 once the others were ruled out by the courts, in effect
 neutralizing the courts and blocking due process.
 On March 26, in anticipation of widespread disruptions during
 the protests scheduled for March 27, the Government published
 
 
 459
 CHILE
 two edicts. The first directed the media to refrain from
 publishing any material which encouraged 'any alteration of
 the puolic order." The second edict directed four opposition
 magazines to suomit their copy for prior censorship. This
 second edict was withdrawn four days later, though not before
 all the punlications so directed had filed protests in the
 civil courts.
 In April, the Government attempted to impose selective prior
 censorship for the second time and also filed charges.against
 an opposition magazine and its editor for violating the State
 Security Law of 1958. These charges were dismissed by the
 courts which also ruled against the Government in disallowing
 prior censorship. On May 17, following publication of-
 articles cnarging financial corruption by President Pinochet,
 members of his family and aides, the Government published a
 new version of the existing libel law. Called the 'Law on
 Publicity Abuses," the rewritten statute significantly
 increased potential penalties for publishing false information
 about an individual's public affairs and made publication of
 any material, true or false, about an individual's private
 life or those of his spouse, descendents, forebearers, or
 siblings an actionable of fense. An individual involved in
 bringing the charges against President Pinochet was beaten by
 unknown assailants and documents relating to the corruption
 charges were taken.
 On September 3, one day before a scheduled national protest,
 the Government initiated court actions against several
 opposition magazines and ordered one of them to suspend
 publication for five issues. This suspension was subsequently
 lifteo by the Appeals Court, but the objective of blocking
 puolication was achieved in the interim. On September 4, the
 Government banned news broadcasting by four opposition radio
 stations. The bans were lifted a few days later, but not
 until the protests were over, thas achieving the objective of
 censoring the news without having the courts again declare the
 restriction illegal. On September 9, the Government published
 'Edict 19,' which prohibited certain opposition magazines from
 pablsning graphics of any kind and limited them to publishing
 information about protest demonstrations on their inside
 pages. The graphics prohibition was overturned by an
 Appellate Court on October 26, but the ban on front page
 coverage ot protests was upheld. The Government has since
 appealed the court's decision on the publication of graphics.
 Under the State of Siege declared by the Government on
 November 6, such control of the media has been greatly
 expanded to include prohibitions against media coverage of
 terrorist acts and all domestic political events and
 declarations except those provided by official government
 sources, though this latter restriction is not uniformly
 enforced. In addition, five opposition periodicals have been
 suspended from publication and a sixth is required to submit
 its copy to government censors prior to publication.
 Cases involving most of the opposition press continue to be
 adjudicated. A number of these cases have been brought by
 various offices of the Government, but a significant number
 have also been initiated by the press. Over the year, the
 courts have maintained their independence vis-a-vis the
 Government on the issue of freedom of expression and, in a
 series of important cases, ruled in favor of opposition
 puolications.

 CHILE
 Individuals distributing publications considered subversive
 are subject to arrest and prosecution. All motion picture
 films must obtain approval from a censorship board and some
 are not permitted to enter Chile. The Governnent owns one
 newspaper, one radio network and the only truly nationwide
 television nietworK. Access to this network is strictly
 controlled and opposition views are not given coverage. All
 other media firms - the majority - are privately owned. The
 Government does not jam foreign radio broadcasts. The
 distribution of foreign publications has rarely been delayed,
 although some foreign publications have been banned.
 Under tne State of Siege, the foreign press in Chile has come
 under increased government scrutiny with reports of incidents
 of confiscation of press notebooks and films at
 demonstrations, government monitoring of foreign
 correspondents' dispatches abroad, the November 26 government
 cancellation and review before reissuance of credentials to
 foreign press, and the expulsion from the country of the
 resident UPI correspondent on November 29. He was later
 allowed to return to the country in exchange for the departure
 of another UPI employee. Prior to the State of Siege, the
 foreign press generally operated free from government
 interference.
 0. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Significant violations of freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association continued to occur in 1984. Restrictions on
 freedom of assemoly, which were lifted when the State of
 Emergency was ended in August 1983, were reinstituted when the
 State of Emergency was restored in March 1984. On October 27,
 1983 tne Government had passed special legislation placing
 responsibility for protest demonstrations on certain
 individuals, and thius seeking to discourage further protests.
 Under this law, leaders of tne two main opposition movements
 were arrested on October 9, 1984 on charges of encouraging the
 September 4-5, 1984 protest demonstration. The charges were
 dropped the next day at the request of President Pinochet.
 Other administrative measures were taken against workers and
 trade unionists in an effort to stop a planned national strike
 on October 29-30. With the declaration of the State of Siege
 on November 6, 1984 all political and labor assemblies have
 been required to give five days advance notice to the
 authorities. Five days notice must be given, as well as
 receiving government authorization, for special events,
 although tnose who peacefully protested the State of Siege in
 Santiago on November 27-28 were not arrested when the
 unauthorized demonstration was dispersed by the Carabineros.
 Individual labor leaders have sometimes been dismissed under
 circumstances suggesting that they lost their jobs because of
 criticism of management or of the Government. The State of
 Siege nas not interfered with most trade union activities.
 Collective bargaining, strikes, and internal union elections
 can go on as before. However, trade unions, as with other
 legally constituted groups, must obtain permission five days
 in advance to hold mieetings. Some trade unions have had their
 premises searched, and several Coammunist Party labor leaders
 have been internally exiled.
 Many traue union rights, suspended after the military takeover
 in 1973, were reinstated in July 1979, by a series of
 
 
 461
 CHILE
 decree-laws known as the 'Labor Plan.* The trade union
 movement had little effective participation in the formulation
 of the Labor Plan and little influence in the Government's
 decisions regarding implementation of the new Labor Code. In
 1983, opposition labor organizations, which enjoyed legal
 status, were given the opportunity to participate in a study
 of possible revisions of the Labor Plan. The vast majority of
 these organizations chose not to join, mainly because they
 objected to the original Labor Plan which would remain the
 oasis for any revisions. The study was completed, and
 proposed modifications were submitted to the Junta in early
 1984. The Junta reportedly continues to study the revisions.
 Under the Labor Plan, workers at units employing 25 or more
 individuals can form a union by majority vote and elect their
 officers from among their co-workers. Officers of trade union
 organizations (including federations and confederations) must
 continue to be employed in their jobs in a plant represented
 by their union but are legally entitled to specified paid time
 off for their union work. Trade union leaders have three
 specific objections to the Labor Plan. First, collective
 bargaining is permitted at the plant level only. Second,
 national confederations embracing more than one industry as
 well as unions at the local level embracing more than one
 euiployer have no legal standing, although de facto nationwide
 confederations exist and their leaders sometimes meet with
 government officials. Federations and confederations are
 limited generally by law to providing technical assistance,
 education programs, and welfare and benefits activities for
 their affiliates. In fact, many are active politically, often
 in opposition to the Government. Third, the right to strike,
 legal only during collective bargaining negotiations, is
 limited to 60 days, after which workers may be considered by
 their employers to have voluntarily resigned their jobs. The
 right to strike is prohibited in designated strategic
 industries. In 1984, 48 firms, mostly public utilities,
 government copper mines, and the petroleum industry, were so
 listed. For these companies, failure to reach agreement
 during negotiations leads to binding arbitration. Management
 is legally permitted to hire strikebreakers in all instances.
 In 1981, labor courts were incorporated into the normal
 juridical system. However, the Minister of Justice has
 declared the Government's intention to establish a labor court
 system, following complaints from labor and management that
 the present system is not working well.
 The civil service is allowed to form associations but not
 unions. It does not have the right to bargain collectively or
 to strike. The Dockworkers' National Union, as previously
 constituted, and the union card, which severely restricted
 access to port jobs, were eliminated in 1982. The National
 Dockworkers' Union was replaced by small independent unions
 estaolished in individual private companies which contract
 ship handling services. Professional groups and associations
 have not been limited by recent decree laws which were aimed
 at eliminating closed shop-type compulsory licensing
 privileges.
 Labor unions are permitted to maintain relations with
 non-Marxist international labor bodies in their fields. In
 1984, the International Labor Organization (ILO) conference
 accepted the credentials of the Chilean worker delegates which
 were challenged Dy the Christian Democratic-oriented
 
 
 462
 CHILE
 International Confederation of Labor (WCL) and the
 comiunist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU)
 on behalf of opposition labor groups in Chile. The
 Credentials Committee did, however, urge the Government in the
 future to consult with all the most representative
 organizations without exception. In recent years these two
 labor internationals and the democratic-oriented International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) have been active in
 bringing complaints in the ILO against the Government,
 alleging violation of several conventions concerning freedom
 of association, employment, forced labor, and unemployment
 policies. Cnile was the subject of a critical, special
 paragraph in the 1983 report of the ILO's Committee on the
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations. The committee
 observed that national legislation and practice were not in
 conformity with the Commission on Discrimination in Employment
 and Occupation. In its 1984 report, however, the committee
 noted tnat positive developments had taken place, in
 particular that an advisory mission had permitted detailed
 discussion ot the points raised by the ILO and that new
 legislation was being envisaged to meet these comments.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez, who had tried
 to establish a national union. In late 1983, lawyers for the
 Jimenez family reported that they had completed their
 investigation of the case and had submitted evidence obtained
 from a former CNI employee to the courts, where it is
 currently under consideration. The evidence reportedly
 implicates persons associated with tne CNI in the murder.
 Tlere were no developments in this case in 1984.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Tne Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of religion.
 Although a predominantly Roman Catholic country, there are no
 restrictions on freedom of religion and no official
 discrimination practiced against any religious group. A
 number of Protestant denominations and other groups are active
 and report full freedom and tolerance, as does the Jewish
 community. Religious belief and adherence appear to ave no
 effect on acceptability for government positions in Chile.
 On November 10, 1984 the Government prohibited media coverage
 of a pastoral statement by the Archbishop of Santiago
 concerning the mass police sweeps made in areas of Santiago,
 though it did not interfere with the Church's publication and
 distribution of the statement. Other steps were taken
 throughout the country to limit expression by the Catholic
 Cnurch, incLuding television censorship of remarks by a Church
 spokesperson on November 12, and cancellation on November 14
 of the Catnolic Church's thirteenth annual social week devoted
 to consideration of a peaeeful transition to democracy in
 Chile. On November 18, the Archbishop of Santiago issued a
 pastoral letter critical of the Government for censorship of
 tne Church and for numan rights violations.
 On November 11, the Government issued a decree forbidding the
 return to Chile of a Spanish national priest who was the head
 of the Church's human rights organization, the Vicariate of
 solidarity. A French national priest was apparently
 accidently shot in his residence during the September 4
 demonstration and on December 5 a Carabinero officer was
 charged by the courts with the death. On December 27, a U.S.
 
 
 463
 CHILE
 national priest was expelled from Chile for activities related
 to an anti-torture campaign.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans have full constitutional freedom to move about within
 or to leave their country, although the State of Siege gives
 the President the power to restrict movement on an individual
 basis, a power as yet unused. As many as one million Chileans
 live abroad, principally for economic reasons. Most of them
 have resided for many years in Argentina. In the judgment of
 international organizations dealing with migrants, the volume
 of skilled and unskilled workers returning to Chile now
 roughly equals the number leaving. Most of the current
 emigrants seem to be motivated by economic rather than
 political factors, and no impediments have been placed in the
 way of their return. There have been no complaints concerning
 tne treatment of either political or economic repatriates.
 Following the military takeover in 1973, thousands of persons
 left Chile. Later, many were forbidden to return by
 administrative decrees, although the exact number was in
 dispute. After initially publishing lists of those persons
 permitted to return, in September 1984, after years of
 controversy, the Government made public a list of 4,860
 Chileans in exile who would not be allowed to return, thereby
 resolving the question of who was exiled and who was
 considered to have left voluntarily. A government
 spokesperson stated that all those not on the list are
 permitted to return. For those on the list, the Government
 continued its already established system of requiring
 individual exiles to apply at Chilean missions abroad for
 approval to return. (An average of 50-100 a month were
 authorized to return during 1984.) It is not known how many
 persons have actually returned or how many have petitioned
 Chilean missions abroad for the right to return.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees from other countries in
 recent years and makes regular, modest financial contributions
 to international organizations aiding refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 in 1984 there were six *National Days of Protest' against the
 military Government's announced intention, pursuant to the
 1980 Constitution, to remain in power at least until the
 plebiscite of 1989, and in favor of a return to an elected
 civilian government. Democratic opposition groups, organized
 in a coalition known as the Democratic Alliance, have called
 for an early return to democracy and on December 14 sent a
 letter to the members of the Junta proposing the basis for a
 discussion of the transition process. At issue is the
 legitimacy of the 1980 Constitution and the transition
 schedule established in that document. In the September 1980
 plebiscite, which approved the new Constitution by a
 two-thirds majority, there was universal suffrage and voting
 was required by law. While most observers believed that the
 results of the plebiscite reflected the will of the majority,
 opposition elements criticized the lack of choice for an
 alternative constitution, as well as the absence of electoral
 registers and other safeguards and restraints on the ability
 to publicize fully objections to the proposed Constitution.
 
 
 464
 CHILE
 According to the Constitution, a plebiscite will be held in
 1989 to accept or reject a Junta-approved candidate for
 President. If approved, he will serve until 1997; if
 rejected, there will be open presidential elections in 1990.
 Congressional elections are also scheduled for 1990. Prior to
 tne State of Siege, government spokespersons indicated some
 willingness to consider a plebiscite to change the
 Constitution to advance the date for congressional elections
 and President Pinochet submitted a proposal to the Junta in
 March suggesting that a plebiscite be held on whether or not
 to grant the Executive authority to hold consultative
 plebiscites at will. The proposal is still under study by the
 Junta. However, according to the Constitution, which was
 approved in voting based on identity cards, any plebiscite to
 change the Constitution can be held only after publication of
 a new electoral law. If the plebiscite approves changes in
 the Constitution to advance the date for congressional
 elections, such elections would then be set for a subsequent
 date. Government spokespersons have officially indicated that
 such elections would also require reestablishment of electoral
 registers which were destroyed in 1974 because of
 falsifications that had taken place during the Allende
 Government. Meanwhile, the Junta exercises legislative
 authoritj, subject to presidential approval.
 Prior to the State of Siege, President Pinochet had committed
 himself to issuance of a law legalizing political parties.
 Significant differences emerged between the President and the
 Junta over the terms of the new political parties law,
 specifically with regard to the formation of regional
 political parties'and the required number of signatures to
 form a national party. In view of the unresolved issues, and
 making reference to the ongoing protests and increasing
 terrorism, President Pinochet on October 29 declared that the
 political parties law would not be published until after an
 electoral tribunal law and electoral law were passed, but set
 no date for doing so. Technically, the Junta is still
 considering the political parties law. The draft, which is
 largely in the public domain, has been denounced as
 undemocratic by several opposition political parties which
 refused to participate in the drafting process despite being
 invited by the Government to do so, since, in their view, such
 participation would imply acceptance of the 1980
 Constitution. The law on electoral tribunals is also still
 before the Junta. In addition, a Government-appointed body,
 the Council of State, is studying proposals for electoral laws.
 Political parties, including those with a Marxist orientation,
 were allowed to function in an increasingly open manner after
 tae relaxation of political restrictions in August 1983 until
 the declaration of the State of Siege on November 6, 1984.
 All parties remain formally "recessed" by the Government and
 Marxist parties that were members of the 1970-73 Government
 remain illegal. Democratic parties have been allowed to
 continue functioning under the State of Siege, albeit under
 duress and without publicity. Marxist parties have been
 harassed into the quasi-clandestine status that prevailed
 before the August 1983 political opening.
 University students increased substantially their political
 activity in 1984, despite a 1981 law forbidding nearly all
 political activity in the country's state-supported
 universities. In direct elections, opposition university
 
 
 465
 CHILE
 student groups won control of a number of student federations,
 including that at the University of Chile. Student pressures
 for reduced government interference in universities continue.
 Student demonstrations, often involving takeovers and
 violence, have occurred on a number of campuses and
 autnorities have sometimes called in the Carabineros to
 restore order. Nearly two hundred students have been expelled
 from various campuses in Chile as a result of the
 demonstrations.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-government Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 In July 1978, the Government allowed members of an ad hoc
 working group of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) to visit Chile. After taie group completed its work, a
 Special Rapporteur was appointed to submit human rights
 reports on Cnile to the Cojmmission and to the United Nations
 General Assembly. The Government has informed U.N.
 autnorities yearly since 1979 that it will not cooperate with
 UNHRC's Special Rapporteur, contending that the special status
 given to Chile 'has no legal or moral validity and is
 unjustifiable discrimination against Chile," a position
 supported in recent years by the U.S. The Government has also
 refused to cooperate with the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission and has denied permission for the Commission to
 enter Chile. However, government policy has generally been to
 allow visits and investigations by private international human
 rights groups. In 1982, Amnesty International visited and in
 more recent years there have been numerous visits by less
 well-known international human rights groups, as well as
 visits by individual representatives of such groups. In
 addition, in 1978 and 1980, the Government allowed visits by a
 mission from the International Labor Organization (ILO) to
 check on alleged abuses of trade union rights, particularly
 freedom of association. While the allegations remain pending,
 ILO reports specifically noted the cooperation of the Chilean
 Government in the investigations.
 Since the 1973 military takeover, the Inter-Government
 Committee for Migration (ICM) has been active in Chile,
 conducting a program giving prisoners convicted of politically
 related offenses an opportunity to go into exile rather than
 remain in prison. In recent years, the ICM has been involved
 in helping some migrants, mainly economic ones, to return.
 The Lawyer's Committee for International Human Rights and
 other non-governmental organizations have expressed special
 concern about Chile. Amnesty International, in its 1984
 report, expressed concern over the complaints of torture and
 other mistreatment of detainees by security forces, the
 arbitrary detention of thousands of demonstrators, the
 banishment without trial of 127 persons, the imprisonment of
 prisoners of conscience, the death of political opponents of
 the Government in disturbing circumstances, the continuing
 enforcement of emergency legislation affecting the right to
 due process of law, and the failure to account for those 663
 persons who disappeared in the period 1973-78. Although the
 Government contends that virtually all of the reports produced
 by these foreign organizations exaggerate or deliuerately
 distort the scope and volume of abuses, it has permitted
 visits by tneir representatives. International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) representatives also regularly visit
 
 
 466
 CHILE
 Chile to check on prison conditions. Freedom House, in its
 1984 report, gave a "partly free" rating to Chile.
 The Catholic Church since 1973 has taken the lead in defending
 human rights and supplying legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to alleged victims of human
 rights abuses. The Church's human rights group, the Vicariate
 of Solidarity, monitors the human rights situation from church
 offices throughout Chile, issues monthly reports, and has
 protected and defended significant numbers of people since
 1973. The Church's activities have resulted in visible
 tensions between the Government and the Church hierarchy, and
 official action was taken in 1984 to prohibit the re-entry
 into Chile of the head of the organization, a Spanish national
 priest. Some church activists and human rights lawyers have
 occasionally been threatened anonymously.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, a private
 organization, has also publicized alleged abuses and spoken
 out strongly against them, as well as issuing monthly reports
 on the human rights situation. It has been allowed to
 maintain affiliations with international human rights grbups.
 During the State of Sege, a number of the Commission's
 members were subjected to arrest and sent into internal exile,
 'allegedly for their political activities.
 The Vicariate of Solidarity, despite having some active
 political figures, including Marxists, on its staff, maintains
 a posture of being concerned only with human rights and
 publicly offers no specifically political opinions. The
 Chilean Commission for Human Rights, directed by opposition
 political figures, openly devotes its efforts not only to
 human rights issues but also to bringing about major changes
 in the nature of the government as the best means of
 ending human rights abuses.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Chiile suffered a severe recession in 1982 and as a
 consequence, agreed to a two-year standby program with the IMF
 in January 1983 to provide essential support for balance of
 payments purposes and orderly external debt servicing. At the
 same time, the program limited the Government's ability
 further to stimulate the economy, and to counteract the social
 effects of the recession.
 Large fiscal expenditures, plus some recovery in private
 sector activity, led to a real GDP increase of 5.9 percent in
 1984, although the rate declined in the last half of the
 year. Inflation grew by 23 percent in 1984 and real wages
 declined by 5.6 percent through October. Unemployment
 remained at 14.6 percent through November, the same as at the
 end of 1983. However, the percentage of the work force in
 low-wage government emergency work programs equaled 9.7
 percent at the end of November, down from 13.2 percent at the
 end of 1983. Austerity measures, including a devaluation and
 an increase in import duties, were announced on September 17,
 1984.
 In 1983, 59.7 percent of all central budget expenditures went
 to social services, with health expenditures declining to 8.6
 percent of the social services subtotal, social welfare
 expenditures increasing to 28.6 percent, housing increasing to
 2.2 percent, pension and unemployment support increasing
 
 
 467
 CHILE
 slightly to 33.3 percent, and education declining to 26.3
 percent. The Government focuses its social programs on the
 poor. The number of Chileans living below the absolute
 poverty level exceeds 15 percent of the population. Health
 and nutrition programs in Chile are extensive, despite some
 recession-induced cuts in 1983 spending. The level of
 malnutrition in children under six years of age increased
 slightly to 9.0 percent in 1983. Infant mortality rates
 declined to 20 per 1,000 live births in 1983. Average life
 expectancy at birth increased to 67.8 years in 1983. In 1977,
 the Chilean calorie supply as a percentage of nutritional
 requirements was 108.9 percent. In 1979, 87.0 percent of the
 population had access to safe water. The Government devoted
 15.7 percent of its central budget to education in 1983. The
 primary school enrollment ratio was 119 percent in 1979
 (indicating some primary enrollment by older students) and the
 adult literacy rate increased to 94.4 percent in 1983.
 The population's economic and social needs, while still very
 high among the poorer sectors, are largely met on a
 non-discriminatory basis. Nonetheless, some legal
 distinctions between the sexes still exist. For example, the
 legal retirement age for women is five years lower than that
 for men. Married women may not conduct commercial
 transactions unless a separation of goods contract is
 established at the time of marriage, or through a subsequent
 special one-time request. Married women may not take children
 out of the country without the permission of the father. On
 tne other hand, inheritance laws provide strong protection for
 wives and favor female heirs over male heirs. Abortion is
 iilegal, but birth control information and devices are readily
 available in private channels and through many government
 health clinics. Women's status in society has evolved
 positively over the years, and women now enjoy greater access
 to education and employment than in the past. In 1981, the
 primary school enrollment ratios for females and males were
 avout the same. In 1970, female literacy equaled 88.2
 percent, compared with 89.9 percent for males. In 1982, 39.4
 percent of all university students were women. Women have
 served in such important government positions as mayors,
 agency neads and ministers.
 Women have good access to entry-level and mid-level
 protessional jobs, but they do not hold a proportional number
 of upper-level positions.
 Minority groups do not suffer any specific legal
 discriminations. The only significant minority group, the
 Mapuche Indians from the southern region of Chile, remains
 partly separate from the rest of the society due to
 historical, cultural, educational, and geographic factors
 ratner than official policy. Government efforts to integrate
 this group through, among other things, division of connunal
 lands into individual land holdings, led to several violent
 demonstrations. Problems were encountered by the leaders of a
 Mapuche organization throughout 1984. On April 25 twelve
 Mapuche's were arrested and two were reportedly beaten. Two
 were internally exiled to small towns in the north of Chile
 for 90 days each. During the State of Siege many of these
 individuals were again arrested and four were ordered into
 internal exile.
