 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar held its second presidential election under the 1992 Constitution in
 1996, following the impeachment of then President Albert Zafy earlier that year.
 The election was widely accepted as free and fair, and the winner, former Second
 Republic President Didier Ratsiraka, took office in February 1997. An extensive re-
 vision of the 1992 Constitution was narrowly approved in a March constitutional
 referendum; while International Foundation for Election Systems' observers con-
 cluded that the election was generally free and fair, the referendum was marred by
 significant difficulties in compiling voter lists, distributing electoral cards, and other
 problems, which led to charges of fraud and manipulation. Although power remains
 formally divided between the President, his Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and a bi-
 cameral legislature (Senate and National Assembly), the revised Constitution sig-
 nificantly strengthened the presidency and weakened the National Assembly. Na-
 tional Assembly elections held in May were generally accepted as free and fair, how-
 ever, there were a number of credible complaints of electoral fraud. A number of
 institutions provided for in the revised Constitution, including the Senate, a restruc-
 tured judiciary, and autonomous provincial governments are scheduled to be estab-
 lished by March 2000. The judiciary is subject to outside influence.
 The State Secretary of the Ministry of Interior for Public Security-and, under the
 State Secretary, the national police-are responsible for law and order in urban
 areas. The Ministry of Armed Forces oversees the army, air force, navy, and the
 gendarmerie. The gendarmerie has primary responsibility for security except in
 major cities, and is assisted in some areas by regular army units in operations
 against bandit gangs and cattle thieves. After a number of years of decline, military
 force strength has stabilized at about 22,000 troops, including the gendarmerie.
 There are also traditional village-level law enforcement groups, or -vigilance commit-
 tees, known as dna. There continued to be occasional reports that police, gendarmes
 and dna commit human rights abuses.
 Madagascar is a very poor country. The economy relies heavily on agriculture; the
 growth of agriculture declined from 2.5 percent in 1996 to 1.9 percent in 1997. Tra-
 ditional exports (vanilla and coffee) continued to decline in value in 1997, but non-
 
 
 traditional exports (shrimp and textiles) grew significantly. The smuggling of va-
 nilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle continued to be major concerns. Overall eco-
 nomic performance improved, but nearly three-fourths of the population of about
 14.2 million still live in poverty. Foreign assistance remains a major source of na-
 tional income. Living standards are low, with the annual per capita gross domestic
 product estimated at $257. Inflation fell from 8.3 percent in 1996 to 4.8 percent in
 1997. Unemployment and underemployment, especially among youth, remained
 high, although there was significant job growth in the capital during the year. After
 18 months of inaction, the Government made significant progress on its privatiza-
 tion program during the last 3 months of the year.
 The human rights situation generally remained unchanged, and problems con-
 tinue in several areas. In some prisons, women experienced physical abuse, includ-
 ing rape, and some prisoners were used as forced labor. Lengthy pretrial detention
 remains a major problem, and suspects often were held for periods that exceeded
 the maximum sentence for the alleged offenses. The Government began a major ef-
 fort to reduce the number of preventive detainees. Dina imposed summary justice
 in rural areas where the Government's presence was weak, but government efforts
 to bring dina under closer regulation and scrutiny began to show results. There was
 virtually no political violence during the year, and while both the March referendum
 and the May elections were generally free and fair, both were marred by charges
 of fraud. Women continued to face some societal discrimination.
 During the year, the President declared amnesties for members of the security
 forces who had killed or injured civilians in several pre-1998 incidents (see Section
 1.c.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government forces. However, harsh prison conditions and the authorities'
 failure to provide adequate food and medical treatment contributed to an undeter-
 mined number of deaths in custody (see Section 1.c.).
 There were no developments in the 1994 beating death of radio journalist Victor
 Randrianirina, who had reported on alleged sapphire smuggling. The President de-
 clared an amnesty for several pre-1998 incidents including 1991-93 incidents in
 which security forces killed or injured unarmed civilians; a 1992 incident in which
 soldiers killed 6 pro-Ratsiraka supporters at the national constitutional convention;
 and the deaths of more than 30 demonstrators who were killed by the presidential
 guard at Iavoloha Palace in 1991. Reportedly, the President granted the amnesty
 because he believed that some of military personnel had been unfairly imprisoned
 and to promote national unity.
 Village dina continued to mete out summary justice, but there were no reports
 of dina executions.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person. However, there were
 occasional reports that police or other security forces mistreated prisoners or detain-
 ees. Dina authorities continued to use torture to gain confessions.
 Prison conditions remain harsh and life threatening. Prisoners' diets are inad-
 equate, and family members must augment daily rations. Prisoners without rel-
 atives nearby sometimes live for days without food. Prison cells average less than
 1 square meter of space per inmate. The authorities do not provide adequate medi-
 cal care. The prison population of approximately 19,200 suffers a range of medical
 problems that are rarely or inadequately treated, including malnutrition, infections,
 malaria, and tuberculosis. These conditions have caused an unknown number of
 deaths. There were instances in which prisoners were used as forced labor (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 Women in prisons suffer abuses, as do the children who are sometimes confined
 with them. Gender segregation is not absolute, and rapes by other prisoners were
 reported.
 The Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, religious and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), lawyers, and inves-
 tigative journalists.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons, but in practice the authorities do not always observe legal safe-
 guards against arbitrary arrest and detention. In particular, excessive investigative
 detention of suspects results in the denial of due process. However, as the result
 of international pressure, some long-term detainees were released.
 
 
 244
 By law a criminal suspect must be charged, bound over, or released within 3 days
 of arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but is not always required. Defendants
 in ordinary criminal cases have the right to be informed of the charges against
 them, must be charged formally within the specified time permitted, and must be
 allowed access to an attorney. Court-appointed counsel is provided for indigent per-
 sons accused of crimes that carry a minimum 5-year jail sentence. An attorney or
 the accused may request bail immediately after arrest, after being formally charged,
 or during the appeal process, but bail is rarely granted in the case of violent crimes.
 Of a prison population of approximately 19,200, 12,650 or about two-thirds of per-
 sons held in custody were in pretrial detention. Despite existing legal safeguards,
 investigative detention often exceeds 1 year, and 3 or 4 year's detention is common,
 even for crimes for which the maximum penalty may be 2 years or less. The accused
 may wait years in prison only to be ultimately exonerated in court. The Ministry
 of Justice continued a program to reduce excessive pretrial detention through case
 reviews and expedited judgments.
 Although the law allows detainees to sue the Government for damages in cases
 of unlawful detention, no such suits were reported. By law persons accused of sub-
 versive activity may be detained incommunicado for 15 days and are subject to in-
 definite detention if considered necessary by the Government; however, this law was
 not invoked during the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The amended Constitution provides for an autono-
 mous judiciary; however, implementing legislation has not yet been passed, and the
 High Constitutional Court is subject to the President's influence.
 The judiciary has three levels of jurisdiction: local courts for civil and criminal
 cases carrying limited fines and sentences; the Court of Appeals, which includes a
 criminal court for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and the Supreme
 Court. The judiciary also includes courts designed to handle specific kinds of cases
 such as cattle theft. The High Constitutional Court is an autonomous court that un-
 dertakes technical reviews of laws, decrees, and ordinances, and certifies election re-
 sults. The establishment of a number of courts also provided for in the Constitution
 awaits the creation of the Senate, which is scheduled to be established by Septem-
 ber 1999.
 The judiciary remained under the control of the Ministry of Justice. A lack of in-
 ternal controls and relatively low salaries for magistrates encourage corruption. A
 large backlog of cases remains (although efforts are underway to address the prob-
 lem), contributing to excessive investigative detention.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney, to be present at
 the trial, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a pre-
 sumption-of innocence under the Penal Code.
 The right of traditional dna village institutions to protect property and public
 order is codified in the Constitution as well as earlier laws. Dina adjudicate or arbi-
 trate civil disputes within and between villages. Dina also are established in some
 urban areas. In practice, dna deal with criminal cases because of the isolation of
 many rural areas and ineffectiveness of the police and the judiciary outside major
 centers. Dia punishments were at times severe, but there were no reports of dna
 executions.
 Decisions by dina are not subject to codified safeguards for the accused, but in
 some instances may be challenged at the appeals court level. Some cases have also
 been referred to the Office of the Mediator (ombudsman), which investigates and
 may seek redress from formal judicial authorities. An interministerial committee
 that includes the Ministries of Justice, Interior, and Armed Forces was established
 to improve the surveillance of dina and assure their adherence to the law. The Min-
 istry of Justice has moved away from its earlier permissive approach to dina and
 emphasized their subordination under the formal judicial system.
 The Government continued to combat crime and insecurity in isolated rural re-
 gions by augmenting the gendarmerie-traditionally responsible for law and order
 in rural areas-with army units. Military courts are integrated into the civil judicial
 system and differ only in the kinds of cases tried and in the inclusion of military
 officers on jury panels. Such courts have jurisdiction over some cases involving na-
 tional security, including acts allegedly threatening the nation and its political lead-
 ers; invasion by foreign forces; and rioting that could lead to the overthrow of the
 Government. Defendants in military cases, as in civil law, enjoy an appeals process
 that reexamines points of law ra       an te facts of the case. A civilian mag-
 istrate, usually joined on the bench by a panel of military officers, presides over
 military trials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 245
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, at times the Government pressures the media to curb
 its coverage of certain events and issues. In addition, journalists practice self-censor-
 ship.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. However, fear of crime effectively restricts travel to some
 places, especially at night.
 The country does not have a law governing refugees nor has it ratified the 1951
 United Nations Refugee Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol. However, the Government cooperates closely with the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees in processing the small number of refugees or asylum seekers.
 The status of 54 Ethiopian asylum seekers who had been in Madagascar since 1994
 was resolved by their resettlement in third countries. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those with recognized or pending claims to refugee status. The
 issue of provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct universal suf-
 frage by secret ballot. Didier Ratsiraka was elected to a 5-year term as President
 in 1996 in the second presidential election held under the 1992 Constitution. In May
 the National Assembly's 150 members were elected to 4-year terms. The new Na-
 tional Assembly was seated in July. While no international organization sent ob-
 servers, this election appeared to be generally free and fair; however there were a
 number of credible complaints of electoral fraud; however, no investigations of
 claims of fraud have taken place. As of year's end, at least one complaint by a de-
 feated candidate had been filed for review by the High Constitutional Court.
 Under the Constitution, the President has primary responsibility for national de-
 fense and foreign policy, while the Prime Minister is the head of government and
 responsible for domestic policy. The President selects the Prime Minister at will.
 The Constitution gives the President the right to dissolve the National Assembly for
 cause. The revised Constitution retains the possibility of censure by a two-thirds
 majority of the National Assembly and Senate. The Senate had not yet been created
 by year's end; it is scheduled to be established by September 1999. Under the re-
 vised Constitution, two-thirds of the Senate's members are to be elected within the
 autonomous provinces, and one-third of the members are to be appointed by the
 President. Local government elections were held in 1995, and under the revised
 Constitution, elections for provincial assemblies must be held prior to September
 1999.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but in practice they are underrepresented in both areas. The Government of
 31 ministers and state secretaries appointed in July includes 4 women. Women
 make up 7 percent of National Assembly deputies (11 of 150).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 usually are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 The Government is open to visits by international human rights groups and to
 domestic and international election observers. International organizations sent ob-
 servers for the March constitutional referendum and the May National Assembly
 elections.
 The Constitution provides for an independent office to promote and protect human
 rights. In 1994 the National Assembly assigned that role to the Office of the Medi-
 ator (ombudsman), which relies on moral suasion to correct abuses. The Office pub-
 lishes annual reports on its activities and distributes brochures to educate citizens
 on their rights and responsibilities. Its reports outline the rights of women and chil-
 
 
 dren, and focus public attention on the potential for human rights violations by
 dina.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and outlaws groups that ad-
 vocate ethnic or religious segregation. No specific government institutions are des-
 ignated to enforce these antidiscrimination provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is not widespread. Police and legal authorities
 intervene when physical abuse is reported. No law deals specifically with violence
 against women except rape. Spouses can be tried for nonrape abuses, generally
 under civil law.
 In urban areas where many women manage or own businesses or hold manage-
 ment positions in state industries, there is relatively little societal discrimination
 against women. However, discrimination against women in rural areas remains a
 problem. A number of nongovernmental organizations focus on the civic education
 of women and female children to assure rights and legal protection are fully under-
 stood and acted upon as appropriate.
 Under a 1990 law, wives have an equal voice in selecting the location of a married
 couple's residence, and they generally receive an equitable share of common prop-
 erty on divorce. Widows with children inherit half of joint marital property. A tradi-
 tion known as "the customary third" is occasionally observed in some areas. Under
 this custom, the wife has a right to only one-third of a couple's joint holdings. How-
 ever, a widow receives a pension, while a widower does not.
 Children.-While official expenditures on children's welfare are low, the Govern-
 ment has maintained the spending levels of the Ministries of Health and Education
 despite increasing fiscal austerity. These levels are not sufficient to maintain ade-
 quate public services under current economic conditions. The Government provides
 education through the secondary or vocational level, and it is compulsory through
 the age of 14. However, in practice the percentage of 6- to 10-year-olds attending
 primary schools is estimated to be about 32 percent, with rural children dropping
 out to help on family farms and urban children working as domestics. -
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children, although child labor continues
 to be a pervasive problem (see Section 6.d.), and children are imprisoned with adults
 (see Section 1.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-There is no systematic discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. There
 is no law mandating access to buildings for people with disabilities. The National
 Assembly passed a law to define the rights of the disabled in February, but imple-
 menting regulations had not been issued by year's end.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Malagasy, who are of mixed Malayo-
 Polynesian, African, and Arab heritage, include 18 distinct groups differing in re-
 gional and ancestral affiliation. Although there are some linguistic differences, near-
 ly all speak a dialect of the Malagasy language. None of these groups constitutes
 a majority of the population. There are significant minorities of Chinese and Indo-
 Pakistani heritage, as well as a large number of resident French nationals.
 A long history of military conquest and political consolidation raised the political
 and economic status of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin above that of coastal
 groups of more African ancestry. Centralized administration and economic planning
 since independence reinforced the concentration of economic and political power in
 the central highlands, where the capital is located. These policies feed enduring ten-
 sion between coastal and highland peoples. Ethnicity, caste, and regional solidarity
 are often factors in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Pakistani community has resided in Madagascar since the early part of
 the century. Traditionally engaged in commerce, this community now numbers
 about 20,000. Relatively few of these individuals have made successful claims to
 Malagasy nationality, which is customarily acquired through a native-born Mala-
 gasy mother. Indo-Pakistani merchants are widely mistrusted. In past years, their
 shops have been looted during civil disturbances.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1995 Labor Code provide
 workers in the public and private sectors with the legal right to establish and join
 labor unions of their choosing without prior authorization. However, essential serv-
 ice workers, including police and military personnel, may not form unions. Unions
 are required to register with the Government, and registration is routinely granted.
 About 80 percent of the labor force of 5 million is engaged in agrarian production.
 Union members account for only about 5 percent of the total labor force.
 
 
 247
 There are a number of trade union federations, many formerly affiliated with po-
 litical parties. Neither public nor private-sector unions have played a major political
 or economic role in recent years. The Government exercises very limited control over
 organized labor.
 The Labor Code and the Constitution include the right to strike. This right ex-
 tends to export processing zones (EPZ's). Workers in essential services have a recog-
 nized but restricted right to strike, although in practice short strikes took place
 without reprisal. The Code requires workers to exhaust conciliation, mediation, and
 arbitration procedures before striking but has not in practice been a significant de-
 terrent to legal strikes.
 Short and generally nondisruptive strikes took place over fiscal and administra-
 tive issues in many cities. Government workers and university students also called
 strikes to protest austerity measures.
 The International Labor Organization has noted a number of instances in which
 the Government has failed to bring law and regulation into conformity with existing
 conventions or otherwise submit texts for ILO review, including those addressing
 forced labor, freedom of association, guarding of machinery, hygiene in commerce
 and offices, and weight limits. In most instances, these failures indicated legislative
 inertia rather than abuses.
 Unions freely join and participate in international bodies and may form federa-
 tions or confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the Labor Code and the
 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The Code states that col-
 lective bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor on the initia-
 tive of either party. However, collective bargaining agreements are rare in practice.
 The Government is often involved in the bargaining process, in part because of the
 large percentage of public employees who are union members.
 The Labor Code prohibits discrimination by employers against labor organizers,
 union members, and unions. In the event of antiumon activity, unions or their mem-
 bers may file suit against the employer in civil court. Labor laws apply uniformly
 throughout the country, including in the EPZ's. However, the Government's enforce-
 ment of labor laws and regulations is hampered by lack of staff and financial re-
 sources. The 27 Ministry of Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites with some
 reguarity but most often those located near the capital.
 There are several EPZ's which are, in practice, frs operating under special im-
 port and export rules. Such firms are required to follow all pertinent labor laws and
 regulations, including minimum wage laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code explicitly pro-
 hibits forced labor, and generally it is not known to occur. However, there were in-
 stances of prisoners being illegally ' hired out" by prison officials to private enter-
 prise. There also apparently has been systematic use of detainees and prisoners as
 personal servants by a substantial number of magistrates, judiciary officials, and
 local government figures. In one particularly egregious case, a minister used a num-
 ber of prisoners for months to build a private residence. Some prison officials or ju-
 dicial authorities have engaged in the falsification of records to ensure a supply of
 unpaid labor for themselves or other government officials. The Government pro-
 hibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code defines a child as any person under the age of 18 years. The legal mini-
 mum age of employment is 14 years, and work by individuals under the age of 18
 is prohibited at sites where there is apparent and imminent danger. The Govern-
 ment enforces child labor laws in the small formal economic sector through inspec-
 tors of the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Laws. In the large agricul-
 tural sector, young children work with parents on family farms at much younger
 ages. In urban areas, many children work as petty traders, casual transport work-
 ers, and beggars.
 The law prohibits forced and bonded child labor and the authorities enforce this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 Education is compulsory to the age of 14. In practice, however, only about 32 per-
 cent of children between the ages of 6 and 10--the most likely to attend primary
 school--do so.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and implementing legislation
 prescribe working conditions and wages, which are enforced by the Ministry of Civil
 Service, Labor, and Social Laws. The law makes separate provisions for agricultural
 and nonagricultural labor.
 The nimnum wage of $25 (fing 139,027) per month for the private sector is set
 by the Government. This wage does not provide a decent living for a worker and
 fmily and must he supplemented by subsistence agriculture, petty trade, support
 
 
 248
 
 from relatives, or employment of other family members. Minimum wage rates are
 not always respected, since high unemployment and widespread poverty lead work-
 ers to accept wages at lower levels.
 The standard legal workweek in nonagricultural and service industries is 40
 hours, and 422 hours in agriculture. At least one 24-hour rest period each work-
 week is mandated. The Labor Code sets rules and standards for worker safety and
 work site sanitation. Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Laws officials mon-
 itor labor conditions. However, they are usually able to cover only the capital region
 effectively. If violators do not remedy cited violations within the time allowed, they
 may be sanctioned legally or assessed administrative penalties. In some sectors,
 safety equipment is not used due to the expense of protective clothing and other
 safety devices. There have been no published reports of occupational health hazards
 or accident trends. There is no explicit right for workers to leave dangerous work-
 places without jeopardizing their employment.
