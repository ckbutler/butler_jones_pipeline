 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko, who came to power in 1965, heads
 both the Government of Zaire and its only legal party, the
 Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR). Although in theory
 he shares legislative power with the elected unicameral
 Legislative Council, the President has the constitutional
 power to promulgate laws by decree, and all party and
 government organs are subordinate to him. All citizens are
 automatically members of the single legal political party.
 The Executive Council (Prime Minister and Council of
 Ministers), the Legislative Council, the judiciary, and the
 only labor union (National Union of Zairian Workers) are all
 organs of the party. Political activity is limited to the
 party and its affiliates. The focal point of the party and
 the Government is the party's Central Committee (148 members)
 which meets semiannually.
 A complex of security organizations, notably the civilian
 National Documentation Agency, the National Immigration
 Agency, the Gendarmerie, the Civil Guard, and the armed forces
 (especially the Military Action and Intelligence Service)
 share responsibility for identifying and controlling potential
 internal and external threats. Their broad powers and
 influence have resulted in the arbitrary harassment, physical
 mistreatment, and detention of ordinary citizens as well as
 political opponents of the Government.
 Zaire has a mixed economy involving an active private sector
 and an extensive but declining number of state enterprises.
 Major mining, transportation, and communication activities are
 still largely state owned. About 70 percent of the population
 is rural, cultivating the land by traditional methods. Since
 1983 Zaire has followed a'series of stabilization plans, with
 varying degrees of success, with International Monetary Fund
 (IMF) support. In the last quarter of 1987, the government
 budget deficit greatly increased, and inflation, exchange
 rates, and interest rates again departed from adjustment
 program targets. Inflation rose dramatically. In July 1988,
 the Government decided to pursue an independent adjustment
 program, though it continued contacts with the IMF and World
 Bank, seeking a new program incorporating lower debt payments.
 By the end of 1988, inflation had receded somewhat, and
 continuing high copper prices bolstered the Government's
 foreign currency reserves. Notwithstanding this improvement,
 most of the population still experiences severe economic
 hardship. Per capita income is approximately $180 per year
 but is declining as population increases faster (3 percent per
 year) than economic growth (2 percent per year).
 Human rights in Zaire continued to be substantially
 circumscribed in 1988, including in such important areas as
 freedom of speech, press, assembly, and integrity of the
 person. The Government took harsh actions, including the use
 of arrests and internal exile, to quash activities of members
 of the internal opposition group, the Union for Democracy and
 Social Progress (UDPS), who advocate the establishment of a
 second legal political party. Many human rights abuses stem
 from endemic corruption. In 1988, for example, police and
 military personnel frequently abused their authority and
 arbitrarily arrested, detained, and extorted money from
 civilians including businessmen. The Government continued in
 1988 to give greater public attention to some aspects of human
 rights and pressed forward with some important, but still
 limited, institutional action in meeting public concerns. The
 
 
 400
 ZAIRE
 President of the Judicial Council (a super-Ministry of Justice
 also charged with administration of the court and penal
 systems) took specific positive measures, e.g., closing some
 prisons, enacting ordinances to regulate arrest authority and
 procedures, and airing public grievances. The new Department
 (ministry) of Citizens' Rights and Liberties (DCRL), whose
 mission is to redress citizen's rights when all other legal
 resources have been exhausted, expanded its structure and
 began to assert its role. It proved successful in resolving a
 significant number of cases of a civil nature (e.g., titles to
 land and contract disputes) but its impact on human rights
 cases (e.g., wrongful detention) had yet to be demonstrated.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed cases of political killing in 1988.
 However, one member of the the UDPS reportedly died as the
 result of beatings received while in detention following his
 arrest on January 17. He was released after 3 1/2 days in
 prison, where he had reportedly received no medical care, and
 died in a clinic shortly after his release.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons for
 political causes. However, there were in 1988 reports of
 disappearance--and possibly some summary executions--of
 citizens in the Kivu and Haut Zaire regions in June and July
 attributed to members of the Zairian military in actions
 against an armed opposition group. A report published by the
 European Parliament in July discussed similar incidents in the
 Kibali-Ituri (North Kivu) and Haut Zaire regions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture or physical mistreatment of detainees is common in
 most Zairian places of detention. Reliable sources reported
 beatings and other physical mistreatment of prisoners and
 detainees during the year, many involving UDPS members held at
 high security prisons. Amnesty International's (AI) 1988
 report (covering 1987) notes that one of the UDPS founders,
 Lumbu Malaba Ndiba, while imprisoned was brutally treated,
 deprived of food, and beaten. The Government claims that it
 does not condone torture or cruel or inhuman treatment, but
 there are few, if any, instances of officials being tried and
 punished for such actions.
 Private citizens are often mistreated by members of the
 Zairian security forces. There were many reports of private
 citizens being beaten at the hands of security officials after
 refusing to surrender money or other valuables. Reports of
 unsanitary facilities and starvation among prisoners continued
 to emanate from Zaire's prisons in 1988. Such conditions have
 led to outbreaks of dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and other
 communicable diseases. In many prisons, medical supplies and
 treatment are either inadequate or nonexistent. Food and
 medical supplies provided for prisoners are reportedly
 diverted or sold by prison officials. While lack of concern
 among senior officials, incompetence, corruption, and limited
 
 
 401
 ZAIRE
 government funding have helped perpetuate these problems, the
 Government has publicly recognized that changes must be made.
 Accordingly, throughout 1988 the Judicial Council continued to
 introduce measures to improve conditions in Zaire's prison and
 judicial systems. The Judicial Council President personally
 inspected many prisons throughout the country, ordering
 several closed pending renovation of the facilities. In those
 prisons under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Council,
 funding was increased to provide prisoners two meals d day,
 beds, blankets, and medical supplies. A special commission,
 separate from the prison staff, was created to supervise
 prison administration. These measures, in addition to those
 implemented in 1987, have been reasonably effective in
 Kinshasa and in some of the other major cities. Their
 effectiveness in outlying areas is doubtful, and they have no
 effect on the military prison system where political detainees
 are likely to be held.
 The International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) has also
 helped to improve conditions in some civilian prisons by
 providing cots and basic medical supplies. Throughout 1988,
 the ICRC was allowed access to prisons and detention centers
 under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Council, but ICRC
 officials were not allowed to visit UDPS detainees, and access
 was reduced while UDPS members were being held in those
 facilities. ICRC access to other prisons and detention
 centers under the control of the various security agencies -
 remained restricted throughout 1988. The heads of these
 agencies would not allow the ICRC to visit the centers unless
 the security agency set the time and the place of the visit in
 advance, a condition which is contrary to ICRC policy.
 Conditions in prisons which do not come under Judicial Council
 jurisdiction remain poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 By law, those arrested by a judicial police officer must be
 brought before a magistrate within 48 hours for an initial
 hearing and determination that there are sufficient grounds
 for the arrest. If this determination is positive, the
 magistrate can order bail or preventive detention for up to 15
 days. The case must be brought up for review by a
 three-magistrate body within 5 days of the defendant's
 imprisonment or preventive detention. If the decision is
 upheld, the case is ordered to trial when the investigation is
 completed. The law stipulates that these periods of detention
 may be extended only in exceptional cases. In practice,
 arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without charges are
 common occurrences, affecting many people who come into
 contact with the criminal justice system. Suspects are often
 arrested and held for months without a hearing, often
 incommunicado. In an effort to reduce the frequency of such
 occurrences, Judicial Council personnel visit various prisons
 and detention centers each night to take detainees before a
 magistrate within the required 48 hours.
 Undisciplined police and military personnel frequently abused
 their authority in 1988 to harass, arrest, and extort money
 from civilians. The Civil Guard arrested a number of local
 and foreign businessmen on false charges or for questionable,
 albeit common Zairian business practices. They were held in
 detention until bribes were paid.
 
 
 402
 ZAIRE
 Persons with financial resources are known to buy their way
 out of detention without charges ever being filed. Moreover,
 anyone with money or strong political ties is often freed
 before serving his sentence, regardless of the gravity of the
 crime committed. One 1988 example: a former government
 agency director was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment for
 offenses including arbitrary arrest and embezzlement of public
 funds, but he was released in June under an official
 government ordinance. On the other hand, detainees and
 prisoners without financial means or political influence may
 remain in custody beyond the term of their sentences without
 ever going to trial. One foreign journalist was held for 6
 months without charge when he refused to bribe military police
 for the return of his personal items which had been taken by
 the police at the time of his arrest.
 The President of the Judicial Council enacted a series of
 ordinances in 1988 to rein in corruption and abuses by police
 and security officers. These ordinances regulate who has the
 authority to make arrests and the procedures to be followed.
 In theory, the ordinances cover all officials with arrest
 powers from any police or security agency. All officials are
 required to take an oath to uphold the law and to act solely
 within his or her authority. After taking the oath, each is
 assigned a number and given an identification card with a
 photograph which must be presented when carrying out an
 arrest, search, or seizure. Citizens have the right to ask to
 see the identification card. The ordinances specify powers
 and duties of these officers, including limits on arrest
 authority, and requirements to arraign detainees within 48
 hours. Thus far, the impact of these ordinances has been been
 limited. To date only judicial police officers under direct
 Judicial Council control have taken the oath. None from the
 security agencies has done so.
 Most individuals detained for political reasons are held by
 means of nonjudicial sanctions which range from administrative
 detention and house arrest to internal exile and .restriction
 of movement and travel. They are not formally charged or
 tried, remaining in detention or internal exile until the
 President chooses to release them. Such arrests and
 relegations are made openly, and the whereabouts of detainees
 are usually known, at least unofficially, although sometimes
 not acknowledged by the Government.
 In recent years, the Government has engaged in repeated
 actions (using both internal exile and prison detention) to
 curb and coopt back into the MPR the "primary" banned internal
 opposition party, the Union for Democratic and Social
 Progress. UDPS members were arrested and detained during two
 periods in 1988, in January and April, ostensibly on public
 disturbance grounds, although in most cases formal charges
 were never pressed. In January more than 100 people were
 arrested while attending a rally at which a UDPS leader,
 Tshisekedi wa Malumba, was to speak. Many were questioned and
 released, but around 40 UDPS supporters were held without
 charge. In mid-March, Tshisekedi wa Malumba was released from
 prison but placed under house arrest. The Government released
 almost all of the detained .JDPS members at that time.
 Tshisekedi was rearrested in April for the circulation of
 leaflets calling for a boycott of legislative elections, and
 he was sent into internal exile from April 8 until his release
 on September 17. The exile of Tshisekedi in April was
 followed by the arrest and forced internal exile of a second
 
 
 403
 ZAIRE
 UDPS leader, Birindwa ci Birhashwirwa, and the arrest of 75 to
 100 UDPS activists in the capital and in the interior.
 Birindwa was released from exile on June 24. Reports indicate
 that all those arrested had been released by the end of 1988.
 The total number of political detainees remaining, if any, was
 unknown.
 A small number of opponents of the Government live in
 self-imposed exile in Europe. There were no known cases of
 external exile or expulsion of Zairians from the country in
 1988. With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section
 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zaire's highly centralized Government exercises control over
 the judiciary, principally through the Judicial Council. The
 legal system is a mixture of Belgian and customary law. The
 modern court system includes a Supreme Court, a Court of
 Appeals in each region, and a Court of State Security.
 Defendants are entitled under the Constitution to a public
 trial and defense counsel. In practice, most citizens are not
 aware of these rights or are not in a position financially to
 insist on them. There is an insufficient number of lawyers in
 Zaire to provide adequate counsel to most defendants, and
 defendants have no right to an attorney at public expense in
 nonpolitical cases. When available, defense counsels
 generally function freely and without coercion. Most
 defendants who are aware of their rights avail themselves of
 the right to appeal. Decisions of the State Security Court
 involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling are
 not subject to appeal; but all other procedural protections of
 the criminal code apply. Nor are military court decisions
 appealable. While courts-martial generally try only cases
 involving military personnel, in time of emergency or during
 military operations the President can suspend civilian courts
 and transfer jurisdiction over all cases to them.
 The judicial process is subject to criticism. At the
 political level, all judges are members of the MPR and are
 subject to party discipline. Thus, while judges in fact
 perform their function without political interference in the
 great majority of cases, in sensitive or highly politicized
 cases they operate under implicit or explicit constraints from
 the executive or security forces. Judicial proceedings
 against UDPS leader Tshisekedi wa Malumba, charged with
 holding an unauthorized rally in Kinshasa, were suspended
 without trial when Tshisekedi was declared insane. One
 psychiatrist who examined Tshisekedi and refused to certify
 that he was insane was himself detained for several days. At
 the daily operational level, it appears that some magistrates
 and lawyers accept bribes, applying the full rigor of the law
 only to those who are unable to pay.
 The President of the Judicial Council, in-his continued effort
 to improve the judicial system, suspended several magistrates
 and officials from four courts in the Kinshasa area for their
 inaction on 1,147 cases. During September, he and his staff
 presided over "judicial days" at courts throughout Kinshasa's
 24 zones allowing citizens to present complaints about court
 officials and the administration of justice. These limited
 steps attracted popular interest.
 
 
 404
 ZAIRE
 The Department of Citizens Rights and Liberties (DCRL),
 created in 1986 to redress citizens' rights when all other
 legal resources had been exhausted, began operation on July 1,
 1987. The DCRL has a central office and district offices in
 all of Kinshasa's 24 zones. On July 1, 1988, the DCRL
 Minister named representatives for 32 offices throughout the
 rest of the country, but most regional offices had not been
 opened by the end of 1988. Of the 1,990 cases initially filed
 with the DCRL, 72 percent treated such subjects as labor
 questions, title to land, execution of judgments, and
 inheritance. Only 28 percent concerned human rights abuses
 such as arbitrary arrests, prolonged detentions, illegal
 seizures, and abuses by security forces. By June 1988, at
 least half of the 1,990 cases had reportedly been resolved,
 but only a few were in the human rights category.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Membership in Zaire's sole political party is obligatory. All
 Zairians automatically become members of the MPR at birth.
 Party and state security organizations extend down to the
 neighborhood level, and both maintain liaison offices in all
 government agencies (including military units, universities,
 the legislative council, and ministries). Party officials,
 civil servants, armed forces personnel, parliamentarians, and
 employees of state enterprises are taxed to support the
 activities of the party's major organs (Cadre Training,
 Mobilization, Propaganda, Women's Affairs, and Youth). These
 party cadres are also required to attend the party's training
 institute. Absence can result in reprimands and suspensions.
 Government employees, market vendors, and blue-collar workers
 are often required to participate in public events--parades,
 official arrival and departure ceremonies, etc.--or risk being
 suspended from their jobs. In line with the party-state's
 ideology of "Zairian authenticity," Zairian men are forbidden
 to wear neckties. Zairians are also forbidden in principle to
 use non-African names.
 Except in cases of threats to national security, the law
 requires the police to have a judicial warrant before they can
 search a home. In practice, police and security authorities
 enter and search homes without such warrants. Mail is opened
 sporadically by security services, some telephone conversations
 are tapped, and government informers surveil places of
 residence as well as employment. In civil cases in which
 defendants have been found guilty of fraud or embezzlement
 from the Government, their property and homes can be
 confiscated without reimbursement.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right of all citizens to
 express their opinions and feelings freely, either orally or
 in writing, but it subordinates that and all other rights to
 the need to ensure "public order and good conduct." Since
 Zairians are automatically members of the sole political
 party, the ideology of the MPR is the only acceptable public
 profession of political thought. The MPR ideology comprises
 the views and policies of the party's chairman and founder,
 President Mobutu Sese Seko. The theater, songs, and
 all-pervasive street gossip are important means for
 communicating popular opinions and news.
 
 
 405
 ZAIRE
 Dozens of people were arrested in 1988 for possessing or
 distributing political literature or documents that the
 Government found objectionable. In July UDPS leader Kalengayi
 Kadima was arrested under a Zairian law forbidding the
 distribution of "pamphlets of a foreign origin or inspiration
 and of such a nature as to damage the national interest." A
 letter signed by 48 members of the U.S. Congress which
 criticized human rights abuses in Zaire was cited as an
 objectionable document in Kalengayi's case. Judicial
 proceedings against him were suspended before trial and have
 not resumed.
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the State. The
 major newspapers are privately owned but depend upon
 significant government subsidies for survival. In addition,
 they receive most of their news from the Zairian National
 Press Agency (AZAP), a state organization. The media are
 expected to promote the ideals and principles of the party.
 Generally, publishers and editors are active party members.
 Commentary on politically sensitive domestic or foreign issues
 is discouraged, and direct criticism of the President is
 forbidden. While journalists are circumspec- in their
 criticism of other high officials as well, criticism of
 certain government practices, inadequate services, and
 corruption frequently appears in print.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed. Zairian
 journalists must be members of the press union in order to
 practice their profession. The threat of ouster from the
 union and consequent loss of livelihood are strong inducements
 toward self-censorship.
 The Government also uses other techniques to control the
 media, including the use of detention. In 1988 local
 officials had the director of one of Zaire's major daily
 newspapers arrested and detained for several months after
 publishing an article criticizing the officials' involvement
 in smuggling activities. He was released only after
 journalists from his newspapers's central office in Kinshasa
 published articles and made a public issue of the case. In
 another case, the Government accused the director of a
 regional paper of being in possession of documents from the
 opposition UDPS party and had him held in prison for several
 months.
 In July the Government shut down one private journal,
 Zaire-Actualites, when its July edition contained numerous
 articles critical of the party, Government, and certain
 high-level officials. The authorities cited the journal as
 antirevolutionary and irresponsible and the owner as not
 possessing the proper license.
 There are several clandestine presses which operate
 sporadically, printing flyers and handbills critical of the
 Government and various Zairian leaders.
 All foreign journalists wishing to visit Zaire must receive
 prior permission from the Ministry of Information.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organizations and well-developed
 informer networks serve to discourage dissent. From time to
 time, books, films, and certain issues of newspapers and
 magazines are banned. Imported publications, including books
 
 
 406
 ZAIRE
 and periodicals, are subject to censorship if they are
 critical of Zaire or its Government. However, articles
 criticizing aspects of the Government's economic policy have
 circulated uncensored.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the party and its affiliates may generally hold public
 meetings. The Government permits the existence of
 nonpolitical associations, but in principle they must notify
 authorities when they plan meetings or activities involving
 more than five people. In practice this is rarely enforced.
 The Government can also prohibit meetings which continue after
 9 p.m. Meetings of nonofficial organizations have been
 disrupted on occasion by government agents because of
 suspected political activities. In January police forcefully
 broke up a UDPS rally, ostensibly because no permit for the
 rally had been issued, and arrested more than 100 UDPS
 supporters. In October police fired on rioting students who
 had seized members of the security force during a
 demonstration against the South African President's visit to
 Zaire. Two persons reportedly were wounded. The President
 later criticized the security forces for using excessive force
 and the students for violent behavior.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is recognized in the Constitution, and the
 Government officially sanctions most of the major world
 religions. However, new churches must obtain government
 recognition to operate freely, and that recognition has been
 difficult for less well-known churches to obtain. Adherents
 to sects not officially recognized by the Government are
 subject to harassment by local officials, including arrest,
 physical mistreatment, seizure of property, and demands for
 bribes.
 Traditional African religious groups are tolerated but not
 officially recognized. The Jehovah's Witnesses and a number
 of other religious groups, banned in 1986 on charges of fraud
 or subversive activities, remained banned throughout 1988.
 These groups are considered antigovernment because of their
 refusal to recognize national symbols, such as the flag and
 the national anthem, or to participate in political
 ceremonies. In October the Civil Guard seized property in
 Kinshasa belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses, pursuant to a
 1986 court order that it liquidate its property, and in
 December evicted the Witnesses' caretakers. A government
 report issued in April 1988 indicated that 357 sects and
 churches were operating illegally in Zaire, 171 of them in
 Kinshasa. The Government ordered them closed until such time
 as the authorities give them permission to function. The
 report noted that the Constitution recognized the rights of
 religious associations as long as their activities were not
 contrary to the law or public order.
 The two major religions in Zaire are Christianity (Catholicism
 50 percent, Protestantism, including Kimbanguism, 36 percent),
 and Islam (5 percent). Officially recognized religions are
 free to establish places of worship and to train clergy. Most
 churches maintain active links with coreligionists outside the
 country, and expatriate missionaries are allowed to
 
 
 407
 ZAIRE
 proselytize and to serve both Zairian and expatriate
 congregations. Affiliation with a recognized religion confers
 neither advantage nor disadvantage with respect to secular
 status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government at times imposes special documentation
 requirements for travel to areas of unrest or security
 concern. As noted earlier, the Government also restricts some
 dissidents to villages of origin or other locations in the
 interior. Expatriates must have special permits to travel
 into certain regions such as diamond-producing areas. All
 citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry
 government-issued identity cards, and police and military
 personnel often set up checkpoints along major roads to
 inspect papers. Those whose documents are not in order must
 pay a fine or go to jail. In principle, any Zairian citizen
 may obtain a passport and exit visa, although on occasion
 government and security officials have impeded issuance in
 order to prevent or disrupt travel of persons suspected of
 political opposition. A married woman must have her husband's
 permission before obtaining a passport.
 As of 1988, there were estimates of 50,000 officially
 registered Zairians living as displaced persons or refugees in
 neighboring countries. This figure includes over 10,000
 supporters of the National Front for the Liberation of the
 Congo (FNLC) who remain in Angola. A small number of
 political refugees also resides in the Congo. A few asylum-
 seeking refugees are in Europe, particularly in Belgium.
 Experience indicates that many Zairian displaced persons could
 return to Zaire if they wished as many did in 1986 and 1987.
 Political opponents of the Government living in self-imposed
 exile in Europe probably could not return safely to Zaire
 without renouncing their political views.
 By mid-1988, Zaire was providing safehaven to approximately
 377,000 refugees, of whom 316,000 are Angolans. Refugees are
 generally allowed to pass freely into Zaire. The Government
 provides land for resettlement and camps. Outside agencies,
 especially the'United Nations High Commisioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), provide food, housing, transportation, and medical
 care.
 Upon entering Zaire, refugees are first processed by Zairian
 military and state security officials. Although the
 Government's policy and practice towards refugees are liberal,
 security officials sometimes harass and extort money and
 personal possessions from refugees. Refugees are also
 sometimes detained or closely monitored on suspicion of
 illegal political activity.
 Forced repatriation is contrary to official government policy
 and rarely occurs. The UNHCR was aware of no cases of forced
 repatriation from Zaire in 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through democratic means. Political power in Zaire is highly
 centralized and controlled by the President, who makes all
 
 
 408
 ZAIRE
 important decisions. Under Zaire's Constitution, the State is
 essentially the executive organ of the country's sole
 political party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution.
 Party congresses meet every 5 years under the guidance of the
 President to set national political guidelines, which are then
 supplemented by resolutions of the party's Central Committee
 A party congress was held in May 1988. Policies are executed
 by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, both appointed by the
 President. Advocacy of a multiparty system or opposition to
 the party-state are both unconstitutional and illegal, as are
 actions which question the authority of the President and the
 political system.
 Suffrage is universal beginning at age 18, and voting is
 mandatory, enforced by penalties including fines or arrest.
 The national Parliament, municipal councils, and rural and
 urban zone councils are chosen by direct popular elections
 which also take place every 5 years. All candidates are
 screened by party committees at the appropriate level, but
 voters generally have a choice of several candidates. In the
 1987 parliamentary elections over half of the incumbents were
 defeated. President Mobutu was reelected unopposed in 1984 to
 a third 7-year term in office.
 General municipal, rural, and parliamentary elections were
 last held in 1987. The local elections were voided because of
 election fraud and irregularities; they were rescheduled for
 March 1988, but then postponed again to March 1989. The
 official reason for this latest postponement was budgetary
 limits, although the inability of the Minister of Territorial
 Affairs to organize the elections may have also been a
 factor. The Central Committee has made several changes in
 election procedures in an effort to prevent the 1987
 irregularities from recurring. A second set of parliamentary
 elections was held in April to fill the 12 new parliamentary
 seats given to the capital city of Kinshasa, now totaling 24.
 The elections were organized by the Central Committee and were
 intended to redistribute the ethnic composition of Kinshasa's
 representatives. Despite theoretical mandatory participation,
 voter turnout was reported to be less than 50 percent.
 Since 1980 members of the UDPS (see Section l.d.) have been
 involved in efforts to establish a second political party.
 Many are former Members of Parliament. Their efforts have
 been rebuffed both by the official party and the President,
 and they have suffered arrest and detention at various times
 over the past 7 years. UDPS leaders released from internal
 exile in June 1987 have taken two different routes. Five UDPS
 leaders accepted appointments to high-level MPR and government
 positions. Two others remain outside the MPR and suffered
 arrest and detention on several occasions in 1988.
 Zaire has a female Director of Women's Affairs and 10 women in
 the Parliament. Women also occupy other important positions
 in the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains that Zaire's human rights practices
 meet international standards and denies charges of systematic
 and serious violations. It participated in the 43rd and 44th
 sessions of the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), and
 Zaire's representative, the Minister of the Department of
 
 
 409
 ZAIRE
 Citizens' Rights and Liberties, again defended his Government's
 concern for human rights. However, Zaire did not respond to
 the specific international human rights charges made in the
 UNHRC in 1987.
 The Government's attitude towards external investigations has
 been mixed, but at the invitation of the head of the DCRL, an
 AI mission visited Kinshasa in October 1987. The ICRC has
 been allowed to maintain a permanent office in Zaire since
 1978, although at times its access to prisons has been
 restricted.
 In October the National.Bar Association, in collaboration with
 the Judicial Council, the DCRL, the Central African Lawyers
 Union,..and the Inter-African Lawyers Union, held a 3-day
 symposium on human rights. Zairian and other African legal
 specialists gathered in Kinshasa to consider the general theme
 of "Respect for Human Rights in African Development."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Home to approximately 300 disparate ethnic groups, most of
 which have their own languages, Zaire has a population of over
 33 million. The Government has sought to defuse disputes
 based on linguistic or ethnic differences by adopting French
 as the official language of government and education. Four
 vernacular languages--Lingala, Swahili, Tshiluba, and Kikongo--
 also serve to bridge the communication gap with smaller tribal
 groups. Many urban Zairians speak Lingala, the language used
 in both the army and the capital city, or Swahili, used in the
 east of the country. Both were originally nontribal trading
 languages. The fact that many rural people are unacquainted
 with these languages complicates their dealings with
 government and military officials.
 The Government strives to counter ethnic divisions by
 recruiting ministers and other high government officials from
 all regions and major ethnic groups. One longstanding
 hallmark of the Mobutu Government is an emphasis on the
 primacy of the Zairian national identity, and the Government
 has made efforts to insure that all ethnics groups have access
 to jobs in government. At the local level, the Government
 recognizes group differences by giving tribal elders and
 customary chiefs authority in many local matters.
 Custom, tradition, and existing law continue to constrain
 women from attaining a position of equality in society. Women
 generally hold lower positions and earn less than their male
 counterparts in the same jobs. Nevertheless, the role of
 women in Zairian society is given great emphasis in the party
 doctrine and in government policies and statements. Women's
 rights to own property and participate in the political and
 economic sectors are protected by law, including the new
 Family Code. This Code expressly provides for women to
 inherit their husband's estates and strengthens their right to
 manage personal property and their right to a property
 settlement upon divorce. The party's Office of Women's
 Affairs promotes greater participation by women in the
 nation's economic, social, and political life and encourages
 respect for women's rights. A growing number of women work in
 the professions, the universities, and government service.
 Several women have been graduates from the Zairian Armed
 Forces' Command and Staff College, although attendance by
 women there has reportedly declined in recent years.

 The new Family Code, promulgated in August 1987, went into
 effect on July 30, 1988. This Code, which combines elements
 of traditional and western jurisprudence, addresses many
 social issues including divorce, property, and inheritance.
 Although the new Code expands women's rights, it retains
 provisions requiring a married woman to obey her husband and
 obtain his permission for all legal transactions (to open a
 bank account, accept a job, obtain a passport, rent or sell
 real estate, etc.) The Department of Women's Affairs in
 conjunction with the Judicial Council, the Association of
 Women Jurists, and other professional organizations has
 launched a full-fledged campaign to inform the general
 population of the contents of the Family Code. Televised
 discussions of the Code began weeks before it went into effect.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.
 Worker rights and working conditions are established by the
 Constitution, the Labor Code, and collective bargaining. The
 labor movement in Zaire is limited by law to one national
 union, the National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), which is
 an integral unit of the sole political party. The Secretary
 General of UNTZA is a member of the party's Central Committee,
 and union officials at the regional level serve on regional
 party committees.
 Membership in UNTZA is compulsory for civil servants,
 employees of state enterprises, and employees of private firms
 with at least 20 employees. The union claims about 1 million
 workers as dues-paying members. However, the overwhelming
 majority of the work force is self-employed, either in the
 unofficial sector or in subsistence agriculture.
 UNTZA participates actively in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and maintains ties with a number of foreign labor
 confederations.
 The right to strike is included in the labor law, but because
 the law establishes lengthy and mandatory arbitration and
 appeal procedures which result in the resolution of most labor
 disputes, in practice lawful strikes do not occur. Workers,
 nevertheless, conduct frequent unauthorized strikes against
 employers. In these circumstances, UNTZA is called in to
 attempt to resolve the dispute.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 UNTZA has the right, and it exercises this right, to bargain
 collectively with employers. It also provides significant
 social and educational services to members and their
 families. It implements government programs to improve worker
 benefits. As part of Zaire's party-state structure, it is
 unable to protect worker interests or defend worker rights
 which run counter to government policies.
 Workers are uniformly covered by labor legislation throughout
 the country, including in the new export processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 On paper the Constitution and Labor Code forbid forced labor.
 Zairian legislation providing for compulsory civilian service
 
 
 ZAIRE
 for graduates from pedagogical and technical institutes was
 repealed in March 1987. The ILO Committee of Experts has
 noted that a draft has been prepared to repeal sections of an
 ordinance authorizing imprisonment with compulsory labor for
 tax defaulters. There are, however, no known instances in
 which tax defaulters have been sentenced to compulsory labor.
 Also, the Committee of Experts has observed that amendments
 are currently being prepared to bring into conformity with ILO
 Convention 105 legislation which now obliges every able-bodied
 adult national (who is not already considered to be making a
 contribution to national development by reason of employment)
 to carry out agricultural and other development work laid down
 by the Government, under penalty of penal sanctions. While
 imprisonment at hard labor is a common sentence for those
 convicted of a range of major crimes, the Labor Code requires
 that such convict labor work only under the supervision and
 control of the Government and not for any private or corporate
 authority.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legislated minimum age for employment is 18, although
 those between ages 14 and 18 can legally engage in "light
 work" if a parent or guardian consents. Due to high levels of
 unemployment, many children under 14 years of age work in the
 unregulated economic sector, especially subsistence
 agriculture, to supplement family income, and minimum wage,
 safety, and health standards are not observed for them.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workers are entitled to a minimum daily wage (currently 50
 cents), paid holidays, and vacations; they receive at least 1
 rest day per week; and they enjoy fringe benefits which
 usually include a housing allowance, medical care, uniforms,
 transportation, and a midday meal. Working hours are limited
 to 48 hours a week. Workplaces are expected to meet minimum
 safety and health standards. Most workers in the organized
 sector know their rights, and employer compliance with labor
 laws is monitored through the national labor union. However,
 this covers only the roughly 1 million organized workers out
 of a potential work force of 17 million. The majority of the
 population is engaged in subsistence agriculture and small
 scale commerce outside the formal sector. In recent years
 income in both sectors has not kept up with inflation.
 The minimum wage does not provide a decent living for workers
 and their families. As a result, in the private sector,
 fringe benefits, which are not subject to income tax, often
 constitute more than half the total wage package and do enable
 workers to maintain a very modest standard of living. In the
 public sector, where remuneration is lower, workers often
 resort to corruption or take second jobs in the private sector.
