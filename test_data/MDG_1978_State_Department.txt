 MADAGASCAR
 After many years of political instability, the
 present Government came to power through a military
 coup in 1975, but later that year obtained legitimacy
 through elections. In December 1975 the voters gave
 their approval to the adoption of the present Consti-
 tution and the Charter of the Socialist Revolution,
 the document which codified the goals of the state.
 Although all political activity is restricted to
 supporters of the present regime and the National
 Front for the Defense of the Revolution, opposition
 leaders are at liberty and there are virtually no
 political prisoners. The Government espouses an
 egalitarian political philosophy and a socialist
 economic doctrine, and has sought to honor the
 Malagasy national tradition of humane rule. Although
 implementation of its programs has just begun and
 faces many difficulties, the Government appears to be
 concerned with enhancing the well being of the
 population as a whole and the rural population in
 particular, with special emphasis on the remote and
 impoverished areas of the country.
 The present Government has done little to enforce
 respect for the person, private property or the
 home. Although it seeks to strengthen public secur-
 ity, public order is weak. There are numerous
 robberies in the capital, and there reportedly is a
 general sense of insecurity in the countryside. In
 May 1978, following a confrontation between students
 and the police, the capital was left virtually
 unprotected for a 24 hour period as the police
 abandoned their jobs. A mob burned several police
 buildings and looted stores owned by Indian mer-
 chants. In December 1976, over 1,000 Comorian
 Islanders living in the coastal city of Majunga were
 killed in a racial clash; no attempt was made to
 protect them from the Malagasy mob. Over 150 of
 the Malagasy responsible for this violence were,
 however, subsequently sentenced to prison terms.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by law, but there have been
 occasional reports of physical abuse of prisoners
 arrested for suspected activities against the state.
 The use of torture appears to be rare, however, and
 is contrary to the humane tradition of the people.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the prisons are crowded and conditions are
 primitive, mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by
 regulations and does not appear to be a significant
 problem.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although there are virtually no political prisoners
 in Madagascar,individuals suspected of activity
 against the state can be arrested and held incommuni-
 cado for three weeks. Occasional delays are encoun-
 tered due to an overworked and inefficient judicial
 system.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that all courts must be
 open to the public except in cases involving national
 defense matters or trials of minors. Although
 juvenile cases are routinely heard in camera, the
 Government prides itself on having others open
 to the public. The trials in Madagascar are gen-
 erally fair. Departures from impartiality have
 usually involved light sentences for government
 officials, slowness in getting cases to trial, and
 occasional lengthy detention of the accused. Civil-
 ians can be tried before military courts for crimes
 involving the external security of the state. This
 has occurred only twice in recent years, and in
 both instances the court appeared to follow legal
 procedures scrupulously and made decisions which were
 considered lenient.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 Process servers may enter a private dwelling only
 during daylight hours. Police may enter at any time
 if in possession of written orders from the Chief of
 Police or a high magistrate.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The charter of the socialist revolution sets ideal-
 istic goals to be achieved by the institution of a
 socialist economy. Although the Government estimates
 that it now controls over sixty percent of the economy,
 this has had little effect on the lives of most
 Malagasy, 85 percent of whom exist on subsistence
 farming. The Government receives considerable
 foreign assistance for economic development. How-
 ever, development projects give primary emphasis to
 infrastructure and industry. Moreover, development
 efforts are hampered by maladministration and,
 reportedly, corruption. City dwellers probably have
 suffered economically over the past several years
 because the needs of the private sector have
 been ignored during the push to establish a socialist
 economy. Standards of living differ widely between
 regions and economic classes, and the poorest twenty
 percent receive only six percent of national income.
 Some authorities have estimated that under optimum
 conditions Madagascar could support double the
 population it now has, and the availability of
 untilled land has mitigated the population pressures
 felt in other parts of the world.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is fully respected in Madagascar.
 Freedom of thought and speech are generally respected,
 but anyone arguing too openly against the Government's
 
 
 policies risks contravening Article 16 of the Consti-
 tution, which authorizes the suspension of the rights
 and liberties of individuals "impeding the advent of
 the socialist state." Freedom of assembly and press
 are limited. Permits needed to hold meetings can be
 withheld under Article 16. In fact, no meetings to
 criticize the Government have been held since early
 1977, although students occasionally demonstrate
 their displeasure with specific government measures
 affecting education. There is pre-publication
 censorship of the press, and as a result no articles
 are published which would discomfit the Government or
 its international friends. Suspension of publica-
 tions is authorized to insure public order and
 preserve national unity. Radio and television are
 government-controlled.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Travel is not restricted within the country, but it
 has become increasingly difficult to obtain passports
 or authorization to travel abroad except on busi-
 ness. Moreover, the Government has sharply curtailed
 funds which may be taken out of the country, further
 limiting travel possibilities. Emigration is not
 significant but is limited by the same restrictions.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political freedom is diminished by the Government's
 prohibition of political activity by all but a
 handful of political organizations which "fully
 support the aims of the revolution." These organi-
 zations are specified by ordinance and their activi-
 ties must be exercised only within the National
 Front for the Defense of the Revolution. The Front
 submitted a single list of candidates for the
 National Assembly elections of June 31, 1977, the
 last national elections to be held.
 Labor unions participate in the political process
 through their affiliation with an approved political
 organization. Those unions choosing not to affiliate
 with such organizations are not authorized to
 conduct political activities.

 Equal rights for women are guaranteed by the Consti-
 tution, and many women hold official positions in all
 levels of the Government
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The Government permitted an investigation by the
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) of the 1976
 massacre of Comorians in Majunga cited above. The
 investigators had freedom of movement and access to
 all persons concerned. Their report, said to be
 highly critical of the Malagasy Government's perform-
 ance, has not been disseminated by the OAU. It is
 doubtful that the Government would be receptive
 to other organizations investigating alleged viola-
 tions of human rights. During the past year both
 President Ratsiraka and Foreign Minister Richard
 have publicly criticized the human rights policy of
 the United States.
