 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 The United States formally recognized the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
 one of six constituent republics of the former Yugoslavia, as a sovereign state in
 April 1992, following a free and fair referendum in which 63 percent of its voters
 endorsed independence. President Alia Izetbegovic heads the multiethnic collective
 presidency of a parliamentary democratic government elected in 1990. Since 1992,
 approximately 80 countries, including the United States, have recognized the Re-
 public, which is a member of the United Nations. Within days of the Republic de-
 claring its independence, elements of the JNA, supported by Serbian nationalist mi-
 litias,launched attacks throughout northern and eastern Bosnia and Serbian Demo-
 cratic Party leader Radovan Karadzic declared the establishment of the "Republika
 Srpska" or "Serb Republic."
 Seventy percent of the Republic remained under Serbian occupation throughout
 1994. The estimated number of dead neared the quarter-million mark, while more
 than half of the country's prewar population of 4  million continued to be dispersed
 as refugees or displaced persons. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, rebel
 forces, and representatives of the international community wielded varying forms of
 authority over various areas of the country during the year.
 The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was constituted in March and estab-
 lished in May, transforming the internal structure of the territories with an ethnic
 Bosnian and Croatian majority. At year's end, the President of the Federation
 (Kresimir Zubak) was a Croat and the Vice President (Ejup Ganic) was a Bosnian
 Muslim. Although the parliaments of the Federation and the Republic differed
 slightly in their makeup, the Prime Minister (Haris Silajdzic) and cabinet ministers
 governed in the name of both the Republic and the Federation.
 The self-proclaimed 'Serbian Republic" of Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) leader
 Radovan Karadzic, headquartered in the Sarajevo suburb of Pale, is the illegitimate
 
 
 755
 occupation authority of the 70 percent of the country's territory held by the nation-
 alist Serbs. Although a "Serbian Republic" parliament exists, the "government" is
 run by a small group of military and civilian authorities," dedicated to an extreme
 nationalist ideology, who control an elaborate police and security structure and an
 enormous army inherited from the former Yugoslavia.
 Another self-preclaimed authority, the "Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosna" was
 the institutional wing of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) and Croatian bemo-
 cratic Union (HDZ), as well as a rival claimant to territory in Bosnia and
 Herzegovina until the Washington Agreement in March, which led to formation of
 the Federation. It continued to exist through much of western Herzegovina and
 some of central Bosnia as a provisional Croatian authority within the Federation,
 pending formation of cantons as prescribed by the Federation Constitution.
 In August Bosnian army troops retook the territory of yet another self-proclaimed
 entity, Fikret Abdic's "Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB), a pro-Serb
 Muslim enclave within the larger Muslim enclave of Bihac.
 The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina
 exercised limited authority in spcic areas. These included control of some border
 points and control of air space and some overland movement, as well as police pow-
 ers and other quasi-governmental functions.
 The Bosnian Army (ABH) is the military branch of the Republic. It is a
 multiethnic fighting force, including predominantly Bosnian Muslims, but also
 Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians of mixed[ ethnicity. It isbasically a citizens' militia and
 suffers from a lack of equipment and training. The ABH generally respected the Ge-
 neva Convention and citizens' human rights. The ABH also has maneuver and com-
 mando forces, such as the 7th Muslim brigade, the "Black Swans," other home-
 grown special forces, and some foreign mercenaries of Muslim origin, who called
 themselves "muahidin.j These latter elements of the ABH were accused of commit-
 ting atrocities during the course of the war. Specifically, in 1994, mujahidin merce-
 naries, mostly located in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, were accused of unlaw-
 fully entering Croatian homes, vandalizing Croatian property, and desecrating Cro-
 atian cemetaries. A Turkish battalion of UNPROFOR succeeded in stopping these
 activities.
 The IVO was credibly accused of abusing human rights, though HVO's behavior
 toward non-Croat populations has improved somewhat since the signing of the Fed-
 eration Agreements. Some local Croatian paramilitary units retained a considerable
 criminal element, especially in areas such as Kise  Vitez, and Prozor. The HVO
 also attracted a larger proportion of mercenary elements, who were implicated in
 human rights abuses.
 The Bosnian Serb army (BSA) is the military arm of the "Serbian Republic."
 Amalgamated in 1992 from Serbian paramilitary bands, local rural militias, and ele-
 ments of the JNA, it continued its pattern of using terror tactics against Sarajevo
 and other civilian areas within sniping or artillery range. U.N. sources reported that
 in late summer the BSA cut off utilities service to Sarajevo upon orders from the
 Serbian military, a violation of U.N. Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 900. BSA
 forces regularly shot at, harassed, and kidnaped  N  OFOR troops, frequently re-
 sulting in injury and occasionally in loss of life, with the goal of disrupting delivery
 of humanitaran assistance and coercing UNPROFOR into cooperating with Serbian
 objectives.
 The Bosnian economy, once dependent upon heavy industry, such as construction,
 metallurgy, m    g, hydrelectricity, and forestry, largely came to a halt, both in
 federal and Serb-occupied territories. In July the Government switched to the Ger-
 man mark as its official currency and in October "officially" introduced the "Bosnian
 dinar"; however, the German mark remains the de facto currency. Most prewar in-
 dustries no longer function either because of damage from fighting or shortages of
 spare parts and supplies. here is some agricultural production in contiguous Fed-
 eration territory, munimiing the need for humanitarian food assistance there. Serb-
 blockaded Sarajevo, however, remains almost completely dependent upon humani-
 tarian assistance, as do Bihac and the eastern enclaves. When the Uh.-protected
 road to the Sarajevo airport was opened in June, Sarajevo began to experience a
 revival of commerce. But when UNPROFOR shut it down on July 26 at the request
 of SDS leader Karadzic, trade all but stopped again. Serbs were able to feed them-
 selves in Serb-occupied territory, but lack of markets and raw materials shut down
 most industry there as well.
 In 1994 Serbian expulsions of mainly Muslims and Croats--what has become
 known as "ethnic cleansing -slowed but did not cease. In pursuit of the goal of eth-
 nic cleansing, the Serbs for more than 2 years have laid siege to cities, indiscrimi-
 nately shelled civilian inhabitants, withheld food deliveries and utilities so as to
 starve and freeze residents, executed noncombatants, ran detention camps in which
 
 
 756
 they executed some prisoners and subjected many inmates to inhumane treatment,
 employed rape as a tool of war to terrorize people, forced large numbers of civilians
 to flee to other regions, razed villages to prevent the return of displaced persons,
 and interfered with international relief efforts, including attacks on relief personnel.
 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHOR) confirmed reports of sub-
 stantial ethnic cleansing in the Bijeijina area of northeast Bosnia, in Banja Luka
 in northwest Bosnia, and in Regatica, north of the Gorazde enclave. Non-Serbs were
 lured out of their homes by promises of transit out of Serb-held territory and were
 then robbed and abandoned en route. Men were taken to work camps to dig trench-
 es along the confrontation lines and were used as human shields. There were credi-
 ble reports that Serbian military and paramilitary groups conducting ethnic cleans-
 ing acted at the behest of the 'Serbian Republic" leadership in implementing its
 pocies.
 The work of the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal, established at The Hague in 1994,
 is expected to document, assess, and determine the culpability of alleged perpetra-
 tors of war crimes, including the extent to which Serbian atrocities and genocide
 were a matter of low-level loss of control or of high-level policy. In late 1994 the
 Tribunal began legal proceedings against the first defendant, a Serb now living in
 Germany, accused of being an officer and ordering summary executions at the
 Bosnian death camps in 1992. The European Unions (EU) Administrators office
 continued to report Croatian expulsions ofMuslims from east Mostar and protested
 to Croatian authorities. Croats, on the other hand, complained that Muslim pres-
 sure in Bosnian-held areas, in particular in Bugojno, forced Croats to leave their
 homes.
 Generally, wartime conditions stalled the democratization process in Bosnia, initi-
 ated in the ifi-fated 1990 "free" elections which brought about the victories of ethnic-
 based parties. The Party of Democratic Action (SDA) of President Izetbegovic and
 the HDZ were the dominant parties on Federation territory. Opposition parties
 claimed that the SDA and HDZ increasingly control the media and scarce jobs and
 housing. In Serb-held territory, the SDS, led by Karadzic, controlled both the media
 and political activity, and did not permit dissent.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS*
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Both Government and Federation
 Constitutions guarantee the right to life. There was no credible evidence that gov-
 ernment forces committed political or other extrajudicial killings. Nor was there
 credible evidence in support of allegations of Bosnian atrocities against the popu-
 lation of the APWB during the overthrow of its leader Fikret Abdic; direct observa-
 tion suggested humane treatment of persons and property there. Similar allegations
 of Bosnian atrocities committed in the course of an early October commando raid
 outside of Sarajevo also proved unfounded.
 Military and paramilitary forces of the "Serbian Republic" continued to terrorize
 Bosnian civilians through shelling, sniping, and other military action (see Section
 1.g.). While accurate statistics are difficult to obtain because Serbian authorities do
 not cooperate with international human rights groups, significant numbers of non-
 Serbs were killed in Serb-run detention camps (see etion 1.c.). Opposition to SDS
 views also resulted in death. Risto Diogo, a popular satirist, was found mysteriously
 drowned in a lake near Zvornik on the Serbian border, after a dinner with the noto-
 rious paramilitary leader "Arkan." While the official account claimed his death was
 accidental, due in part to drunkenness many Bosnians stronglysuspected that he
 was assassinated because he had run aoul of Serbian President Milosevic.
 b. Disappearance.--Since the beginning of the war, 3,800 Bosnians have been reg-
 istered with the Bosnian Red Cross as missing. The Red Cross suspects the real
 number of missing could be more than twice as high, given the inability of many
 Bosnian citizens to come to the Red Cross to register those missing. In addition,
 since some families were completely wiped out, many missing citizens may simply
 have no one left to inquire about them. The Red Cross believes these missing per-
 sons fall into different categories: Some have escaped but have failed to contact rel-
 atives, some have been killed, and some remain in work camps that the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not been able to visit. The Bosnian
 Red Cross has registered 83 cases of persons who disappeared and who were last
 seen in 1994. Although during the year the Bosnian Red Cross registered a total
 *NOTE: Although the United States and other friendly governments actively are involved in
 helping establish Federation governmental structures, all references to the "government" in the
 report apply to the Government of the Republic, not the Federation.
 
 
 757
 of 928 missing persons, the majority of those disappeared in prior years; their rel-
 atives had been unable to register them until 1994. The majority of those who dis-
 appeared in 1994 came from Gorazde, Bijeijina, and the vicinity of Sarajevo.
 There was no resolution of the longstanding case involving the disappearance of
 approximately 180 men from Hadzici in June 1992. Pending information on the
 whereabouts of these men, the Bosnian Government continued to detain for a sec-
 ond year approximately 150 Bosnian Serbs in a grain silo in the nearby town of
 Tarcin. Five Bosnian Muslim community leaders in Ba.ja Luka were reported to
 have been arrested in late August by local Serb "authorities." There was no further
 word on their welfare or location. Local Bosnian officials in Bugojno have yet to pro-
 vide satisfactory information on the whereabouts of 26 prominent Croats who dis-
 appeared when the ABH took the town in late 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitutions of both the Government and the Federation provide for the right
 to freedom from torture and cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment, and there
 are no credible allegations that the legitimate Government or its authorities en-
 gaged in such practices in 1994.
 In1994 in Siroki Brijeg, HDZ militia severely beat a Croat who was trying to es-
 tablish an arm of the rightwing Croatian Party of Rights.
 Non-Serbs in Serb-held territory credibly repod they were routinely beaten by
 the authorities. For example, a retiree from  *avor reported that military police
 entered his home, beat him, then took him to the police station and continued to
 beat him for several hours, breaking his ribs and teeth and leaving him with a
 cracked skull. In another case, a man evicted from his home in Banja Luka was
 later arrested and beaten at the local military police headquarters by the same men
 who had evicted him. Another case of serious abuse involved the participation of
 medical professionals. A Muslim woman in Bijeijina was mistreated by hospital per-
 sonnel while giving birth to her first child. She suffered terrible pain for 3 months
 after delivery. After fleeing to Tuzla where she sought medical help, doctors discov-
 ered that her vagina had been stitched with wire and the surgical needle and wire
 left in her vagina. According to the woman, the medical personnel of the hospital
 in Bijejina had threatened her that she would suffer after her childbirth. Three op-
 erations were required to remove the wire and needle. Doctors in Tuzla stated that
 the use of these methods was unheard of in such medical procedures.
 In government prisons, access to prisoners being held for criminal offenses is ade-
 quate, according to human rights lawyers. Prisoners of war (POW's) are kept in the
 same jail facilities as common criminals, as well as in military prisons, contrary to
 the Geneva Convention.
 Both Bosnian and "Serbian Republic" authorities allow the ICRC access only to
 "conflict-related prisoners." This term is not to be confused with that of prisoner of
 war as defined by the Vienna Convention. In particular in Serb-held territory, "Serb
 Republic authorities" routinely detain non-Serb civilians for use in exchanges for
 Serb POW's. This practice constitutes another form of "ethnic cleansing.' Approxi-
 mately 500 acknowledged 'conflict-related prisoners7 on both sides are being de-
 tained in jails, prisons, and some 15 to 20 camps on the Serbian side and 10 camps
 on Federation territory. Both Bosnians and Serbs deny the ICRC access to prisoners
 accused of common crimes.
 The best known Bosnian-run detention facility is the grain silo in Tarcin (see Sec-
 tion 1.b.). Relief workers who have visited the grain silo state that, although it is
 an unacceptable detention facility, those held there are fed, clothed, and in reason-
 ably good health. The detainees are forced to labor in the local agricultural fields.
 According to credible sources, in addition to Tarcin, the Bosnian Government also
 allegedly runs 9 or 10 other detention facilities for Serbian conflict-related prisoners.
 According to recently exchanged Bosnian prisoners of war, the BSA allegedly reg-
 ularly engages in torture, including use of electric shocks. During its November of-
 fensive against Bihac, the BSA humiliated Bosnian prisoners in front of television
 cameras, ridiculing them and forcing them to chant pro-Serb slogans.
 The Karadzic Serbs continue to hold non-Serb military personnel and civilians in
 from 15 to 20 detention camps. According to government sources, the ICRC has ac-
 cess to some but not all of these camps, as Serbs also differentiate between "conflict-
 related" and other prisoners and deny access to the latter.
 According to a reliable source, the forced labor camp "Rasadnik" outside of
 Rogatica continued to function through April 1994. The Serbs denied access to the
 camp, claiming that it was not related to the conflict. The camp has held up to 50
 prisoners who worked asprison labor in the stockyards. There reportedly were ap-
 proximately a dozen murders at this camp at the hands of camp officials; one was
 confirmed in 1994-a prisoner from Gorazde was r    tedly beaten to death in front
 of his fellow prisoners following the Serbian assault on Gorazde in May. A reliable
 
 
 758
 source reported that in 1994 "Rasadnik" officials raped five women from this camp,
 also following the Gorazde assault--two of whom were teenage girls from Gorazd,
 two were young women, and one a woman in her fifties. Most of the prisoners from
 this camp were transferred to Kula Prison outside of Sarajevo in the spring, and
 some were freed in the October prisoner exchange.
 The Kula Prison houses the Serbian poet, Vladimir Srebro. In 1992, shortly after
 the invasion began, Srebro walked from Sarajevo to Ilidza to protest the actions of
 the Karadzic Serbs. He was quickly arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail for
 being an "enemy of the Serbian nation." Released Kula Prison inmates report Srebro
 is regularly tortured and his health has seriously deteriorated. However, he refuses
 to sign a document swearing his allegiance to the 'Serbian Republic."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-n September the Bosnian police in
 Hrasnica detained 100 Serbs boarding a bus for an "organized trip" to Serb-con-
 trolled Ilidza. The Bosnians accused the Serbs of trying to avoid military service and
 civil defense duties and of attempting to "depart illegally" from Bosnia and
 Herzegovina. Women, children, and the elderly were released fairly quickly, but
 men of military age are allegedly still detainedin jails in Hrasnica and Sarajevo.
 Bosnian authorities deny the existence of a jail in -rasnica and have not allowed
 access to the prisoners held in Sarayevo, saying they are imprisoned for "civil of-
 fenses" However, some Bosnian officials admit these men are being kept for future
 POW exchanges.
 In parts of the Bosnian Federation where curfews were in force (such as Sara-
 jevo), violators were subject to arrest and detention overnight. They typically had
 access to a telephone but were not released until the next morning, at the end of
 the curfew period.
 Both sides typically held POW's for exchange. Several hundred were traded by
 each side during the course of the year, the largest exchange taking place on Octo-
 ber 5 when 295 Serbs were released in exchange for 166 Bosnians. As is the case
 with the majority of these exchanges, Bosnian civilians from ethnically cleansed
 areas of Serb-held territory were exchanged for Serbian POW's.
 The Kula Prison outside of Sarajevo has approximately 60 prisoners, mostly from
 ethnically cleansed areas of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Rogatica.
 These civilians were kept in the Kula Prison pending U.N.-brokered POW ex-
 changes. Bosnians argue that UNPROFOR is assisting with ethnic cleansing be-
 cause it accepts the "exchange" of ethnically cleansed Bosnian civilians for Serbian
 POW's. A Western relief worker based in Serb-held Bosnia noted that one of the
 main goals of ethnic cleansing in 1994 was to have a readymade pool of non-Serbs
 to exchange for Serbian POW's. Serbs running the Kula Prison told relief workers
 that the civilians held there are not being detained but rather are kept in the facil-
 ity pending release to the Bosnian Government, because "there is no hotel in this
 area."
 Over 10,000 Bosnians in 1994 were victims of ethnic cleansing, including over
 6,000 in the Bijeljina region from July through October (many at the hands of para-
 military "colonel Vojkan Djurkovic), hundreds more from Prijedor and Bania Luka
 in the spring and summer, and more than 100 people from Rogatica in early Octo-
 ber, 2 weeks after U.N. Special Representative Akashi had protested directly to
 "Serbian Republic" leader Karadzic. Statistics as of late September reveal the extent
 of the planned removal of non-Serbs from Serb-held territory. An estimated 80,000
 non-Serbs remained in Serb-held northeastern Bosnia, compared to 837,000 living
 there before the war; only 10,000 non-Serbs remained out of a prewar 300,000 in
 eastern Bosnia; and just 17,000 non-Serbs remained in the area of Banja Luka and
 Prijedor, where there were 537,000 in 1992.
 In the course of these expulsions, Serbian agents typically coerced proerty own-
 ers into handing over property titles, robbed them of their money and belongings,
 demanded "fees to pay for their transport into exile, and seized military-age men
 for detention in "work camps,* such as one in Lopare where over 200 were held for
 forced labor. The ICRC hasbeen consistently denied access to the Lopare camp.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Republic's Constitution establishes a regular
 judicial hierarchy based on municipal courts, which have original jurisdiction in
 most civil and criminal cases, and cantonal courts, which have appellate jurisdiction
 over the canton's municipalities, as well as three federal courts (Constitutional, Su-
 preme, and human rights). The Constitution provides for open and public trials.
 Judges are appointed for terms which end upon their reaching age 70, and adminis-
 traton of the judicial branch is managed internally. The judiciarys independence
 extends to the investigative division of the criminal justice system, as the Constitu-
 tion also establishes ag dicial police force that reports directly to the courts. These
 principles appeared to be practiced in areas under Bosnian Government control.
 
 
 759
 The legal system is designed to guard against discrimination against ethnic mi-
 norities by ensuring adequate diversi o representation on the bench, although
 there have been allegations that the ruling SDA and HDZ parties are "stacking the
 courts." The court system for the most part uses the same criminal code used by
 the former Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Constitution provides
 for the right to fair criminal proceedings. There is a functioning appellate system
 and the accused has the right to legal counsel.
 According to international relief workers based in Pale, the Bosnian Serbs, for the
 most part, use the same criminal code as that of the Republic for trials of common
 criminals. It is unlikely, however, that there are any non-Serb judges serving on
 Serb-held territory, reducing the possibility of a fair trial for non-Serb defendants.
 In late October, Bosnian Serb television reported the establishment of "drumhead
 courts," in which local military or police commanders had the right to arrest and
 punish civilians and military personnel guilty of "spreading disinformation about
 the 'Serbian Republic.'" These commanders were authorized to kill offenders on the
 spot or sentence them to forced labor on the front lines, without benefit of a trial.
 This measure was directed primarily at soldiers who refused to fight or males who
 refused to be mobilized. According to a reliable observer, deserters were shot after
 drumhead court procedures even before the policy was announced. An eyewitness
 reported that in July a soldier was shot in front of his unit for 'failure to fight."
 The Bosnian Government does not hold any political prisoners. The Serbian au-
 thorities hold poet Vladimir Srebro (see Section 1.c.) as well as a journalist charged
 with terrorism in October in the 'Tajfun affair," an alleged conspiracy against the
 Karadzic regime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Re-
 publics Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection of the family and
 of children, and property. Governmental respect for these rights was the rule rather
 than the exception in 1994. Bosnian authorities attempted to monitor communica-
 tions that impinged on military or other national security concerns.
 Local Serbian authorities in Serb-occupied territories in Sarajevo, such as
 Grbavica, instituted a policy of summarily confiscating the property of mixed-mar-
 riage couples with sons who had either fled abroad or to Federation territory. Ac-
 cording to a credible observer, Serbian authorities in Grbavica threatened to con-
 fiscate the property of a mixed Serb-Muslim family whose son fled from Grbavica
 to Bosnian-controlled Sarajevo and who was dating a loyalist Serb if the son did
 not return to fight for a "Greater Serbia." There are five other mixed families living
 in the same building with sons who have fled, who also were threatened with hav-
 ing their property confiscated unless their sons acceded to the draft.
 The persistence of the Serbian policy of ethnic cleansing constituted sustained ar-
 bitrary interference with family and home. Serbs continued to enter Bosnian and
 Croatian homes in Serb-held territory without search warrants. In the towns of
 Banja Luka, Bieljina, and Rgatica, the pattern of ethnic cleansing usually began
 with unauthorized entry into non-Serb homes by the BSA, Serbian police, or other
 paratary forces who demanded weapons and threatened residents with violence
 if they did not leave. In the village of Janis, in the Bteijina township, Serbs regu-
 larly placed Serbian refugee families in Muslim homes, forcing the owners to live
 in one room. In general, in Serb-occupied Bosnia, police powers were intrusive and
 only minimally restricted by law or custom. Letters carried through Serbian lines
 were regularly opened.
 In addition to forcible eviction, extortion, and robbery, Bosnian Serb authorities
 routinely harassed and terrorized non-Serbs in Serb-held territories by breaking
 into homes with dynamite and threatening to blow up the occupants; by destroyg
 graveyards so that deceased family members had to be buried in family gardens;
 and by destroying farm animals and crops to starve out the population.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Bosnian government forces are under orders to honor the Geneva Conven-
 tion and subject to discipline if they violate it. Allegations of official abuse have not
 been substantiated with credible documentation. For example, although the ABH's
 success in subduing the rebel Muslim insurgency in Bihac led by Fikret Abdic re-
 sulted in the flow of almost 20,000 persons into Serb-held Croatian Krajina in Au-
 gust, there was no credible evidence of human rights abuses committed by the
 B osmans.
 Although Serbian officials in Pale also claim to honor the Geneva Convention,
 international observers agree that the Serbian forces continue to violate the terms
 of the Convention on a massive scale.
 The BSA continues to target noncombatant and populated areas in order to main-
 tain a constant atmosphere of terror and vulnerability. Standards of wartime behav-
 ior are dictated by the Geneva Convention, but UNPROFOR must nevertheless ne-
 
 
 760
 gotiate with Serbian forces to seek their adherence to these standards. Frequently,
 these negotiations involve issues, such as sniping at civilians, that are explicitly
 cited as unacceptable in UNSC resolutions. The Serbs routinely violate even these
 agreements. Some acts routinely committed by the Serbs, (e.g., sniping at civilians)
 not only constitute ordinary crimes (for example, murder when the sniping results
 in death) but also violations of the Geneva Conventions, with the result that those
 who order the act can be prosecuted, along with those committing the act, before
 national courts as well as the War Crimes Tribunal.
 From January through October, Serbian snipers killed over 50 Sarajevo civilians
 and wounded more than 300. Even though an antisniping agreement was signed in
 August, there were eight fatalities in September, and the sniping continues
 unabated. There were more persons wounded in September (60) than there were in
 January (47), before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) ultimatum.
 UNPROFOR figures on this subject may be somewhat different because, as of the
 September antisniping agreement, UNPROFOR bean classifing      uries from snip-
 er fire as "injuries caused by random exchange of fire." Thus, uner UNPROFOR
 categories, only killings are classified as sniper fire.
 Throughout 1994, the BSA continued to pound Bosnian populations centers with
 mortars and automatic weapons fire, causing the death of hundreds of civilians from
 January through October. The population centers most affected were Sarajevo,
 Gorazde, Mostar, Olovo, Tuzla, Visoko, Vares, and Breza. During the May offensive
 against Gorazde, Serbian shelling killed between 500 and 600 Bosnian civilians. In
 Saraevo, prior to the NATO ultimatum, the most deadly results from a single pro-
 jectile came in a downtown Sarajevo marketplace in February when one shell killed
 68 people. Also prior to the ultimatum, on January 22, Serbs fired three shells into
 a residential neighborhood, killing five children.
 In addition to firing directly on civilians, during the year the BSA fired directly
 on humanitarian aid convoys and on UNPROFOR troops escorting them. It choked
 off assistance at various times to the eastern enclaves, Sarajevo, and (through its
 Krajina Serb allies) Bihac. In an early November order on mobilization, issued in
 response to ABH successes near Bihac, the "Serbian Republic" leadership ordered
 secondary schools closed, students to report to their units, and emigres to return
 to fight under penalty of being branded as deserters.
 UNSC Resolution 900 specifically provides for the uninterrupted supply of utilities
 to Sarajevo. In defiance of this resolution, Bosnian Serb authorities continued to ma-
 nipulate the supply of basic utilities as part of their strategy of pressuring and de-
 moralizing the population of Sarajevo. UINPROFOR-sponsored talks were held to re-
 solve the utilities problem, but the Bosnian Government claims that utilities were
 restored only ater the Bosnians found ways to cut off utilities to Serb-occupied ter-
 ritory.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but 3 years of wartime conditions have thwarted the development
 of truly independent media in Federation territory. As a result, the Government
 only partially reapects this right in the majority of Federation territory, and the au-
 thorities in the IZ-controlled "Herceg-Bosna" do not respect this right at all.
 Although there are some independent media in Federation territory, in general
 the ruling SDA and HDZ political parties exert considerable influence over the
 media,   any private radio stations broadcast from Federation territory; a smaller
 number of private television stations serve local markets in Zenica and Tuzla. These
 independent media have complained of strong-armed Bosnian government tactics.
 When the ruling SDA party came under strong criticism for alleged corruption by
 the Sarajevo paper Bosna, former employees for the paper claim it subsequently was
 harassed out of existence, closing its doors in October. In the northeastern city of
 Tuzla, for example, the local television station "FS3" lost its building and some
 equipment when the district government moved Tuzla Radio and Television oper-
 ations to its premises.
 Bosnian government-controlled television dominates the airwaves. It came under
 strong criticism in 1994 for alleged censorship of programming that did not hew to
 the SDA line, such as a series of broadcasts by the satirical troupe "Nadrealisti"
 ("Surrealists"), which Bosnian television had itself produced. The development of
 independent media also was constrained by the wartime lack of start-up capital,
 raper, and supplies. Western television stations such as Cable News Network
 ,CNN) and Sky News are available to those in Federation territory who can afford
 such service. In HDZ-controlled "Herceg-Bosna," the media are part of the HDZ
 structure but not as strictly censored as in the "Serbian Republic. Croatia supplies
 transmissions of Radio Split to the inhabitants of"Herceg-Bosna."
 
 
 761
 Foreign journalists in Sarajevo and elsewhere on federation territory say they op-
 erated without censorship or government interference of any kind, whereas media
 in the "Serbian Republicare a propaganda tol of the ruling SDS party. The SDS
 strictly censors the media in Srb-controled territory, laissez-passers for foreign
 journalists are issued by Karadzic's daughter. The party's media voice, the Serbian
 Republic News Agency, Tanug (the news agency of the Milosevic regime in Serbia),
 and other Serbian sources aormed the basis for near total domination of both print
 and electronic information media. All foreign media are banned in the "Serbian lRe-
 public.' The public in Serbian territory only has access to two choices: Serbian
 media from Pale or Serbian media from Belde.
 In Bosnia and Herzegovina, academic freedom was constrained more by lack of
 resources and access (to information, other academic communities, etc. than by gov-
 ernment policies. In Serb-contrlled areas, general lack of tolerance for dissent led
 to total control of the educational media. urriculums in Serb-contrlled areas have
 been revamped to teach solely Serb history, art, literature, etetera. There has been
 no evidence of an intellectual exchange of ideas in the media or other academic fora
 in Serb-held territory since the 1992 invasion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association, and the Government generaly respected this right in prac-
 tice. Although large gatherings of people were generally discouraged in Sarajevo for
 security reasons, demonstrations too       or example, to protest the offensive
 against Gorazde in ApriL
 While political membership is not forced, membership in the riling SDA and HDZ
 parties in Federation territory is viewed as the main way to obtain scarce housing
 and jobs. In "Herceg-Bosna," the HI)Z, through threat and coercion, has prevented
 other Croatian parties from forming.
 In the "serbian Republic," the SDS's control over security and police impose se-
 vere limitations on the right to assemble and associate. In September, however, the
 authorities took no action against demonstrations by small grups in the Serb-con-
 trolled Sarajevo suburb of fida, protesting the closure of the iue route (the  N-
 roteted rad over Mount Ig an leading into and out of Sarajevo which was closed
 ythe UN in July after Karadzic threatened to use force to close it). While political
 membership is not forced, membership in the SDS is viewed as the means to obtain
 access to beth jobs and housing.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing private and pubice  worship. However, within the Federation the authorities did
 not respect these rights in consistent fashion. In general during 1994, conditions for
 reigious observance were significantily better for non-Muslims in those  parts of the
 Federation where Muslims dominated than they were for non-Catholics in areas
 where Croats dominated.
 In Tuzla, for example, which is governed by a nonnationalist city administration
 with a Muslim majority, the authorities repaired a Serbian Orthodox church dam-
 aged by Serbian shelling The dominant political parties are both based on ethnic
 or religious identification: SDA-Mslim and HDZ-Croat. Members of these parties
 used religion or ethnicity as ideological litmus tests and means of intraparty com-
 petition. The results, reinforced by Communist-era experience, sometimes emerged
 in the form of radical positions embraced by some political or reigious fires. For
 example, a trend towards Islamization of Bosnia was widely reported in inter-
 national media during the latter half of 1994. Among the examples cited to illus-
 trate this trend were statements made by the Reis-ul-Ulema, the head of Bosna's
 Muslim community, criticizing mixed marriages and consumption of pork and alco-
 holic beverages, Culture and Education M    iter Enes Ka rc was also cited for
 heavyhandedly promoting Muslim religious studies in elementary schools, calling for
 a ban against Serbian music played over Sarajevo radio stations, and trying to exer-
 cise political control over the content of educational and cultural activities. In al-
 most all cases, however, public outcry (especially among Muslim Bosnians) forced
 politicians to back down from such positions.
 mTe "Serbian Republic" continued systematically to eradicate the remaining traces
 of the centuriesld Muslim and Catholic presence, demolishing mosques, churches,
 cultural and religious monuments, and graveyards. In spite ofte Ser "authorities"
 use of religion as an identifier for "ethic cleansing, those remaining non-Serbs in
 Serb-held territory reportedly are allowed to attend services, if they can find a place
 in which to worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The ConaWtitution provides for freedom of movement. In practice, how-
 ever, the ongoing hostilities effectively restricted the full exercise of this right The
 demands of mobilization and the dangers of crossing checkpoints and confrontation
 lines often made movement difficult.Moreover, as a matter of policy, the Govern-
 
 
 762
 ment sought to avoid letting all would-be refugees flee to avoid both depopulating
 the country and creating massive resettlement problems throughout Europe.
 The Federation has not yet fully addressed the issue of the right of refugees and
 displaced persons to freely return to their homes of origin and to have returned to
 them any property of which they were deprived in the course of ethnic cleansing,
 as provided for in the Constitution. According to Bosnian Red Cross statistics, there
 are currently a quarter of a million displaced persons in Federation territory. Fre-
 quently they are prevented from returning to their homes because of harsh recrimi-
 nations leveled by different communities. For example, in mid-October Bosnian
 Croat leaders denounced alleged ethnic cleansing by Muslim Bosnians in cities such
 as Vares, Bugojno, Zenica, and Sarajevo. Bosnians in Bugojno denied this was true,
 and claimed that their city contained many Bosnians driven out of Croat-controlled
 Prozor, Stolac, and Cap~jina who had personally witnessed the brutality of ethnic
 cleansing by Croats.
 The proposed law on refugees and displaced persons being considered by the Fed-
 eral Parliament provides for the return home of all Federation citizens. Bosnian Red
 Cross officials oppose massive population resettlements and view relocation as con-
 tributing to Karadzic's policy of ethnic cleansing.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens of the Bosnian Federation have the right to change their government
 peacefully, both through direct elections and by amending the constitution. How-
 ever, they have not had the ability to do so since the elections of December 1990.
 According to the Constitution, elections to the federal legislature ought to have been
 held 6 months after the Constitution's entry into force, that is, by September 30.
 These elections were delayed pending the formation of the federal cantons which
 were in turn delayed by disagreements between Croats and Bosnians on formation
 of the cantons' constituent municipalities.
 The delay in establishing the Federation's internal structure was compounded by
 the nature of the Federation as a state of Bosnians, Croats, and "others." Under the
 Constitution, power would be shared primarily between Bosnians and Croats. It be-
 came clear during 1994 that, in practice, "Bosnians" actually meant the dominant
 Muslim political party SDA, and "Croats" meant the dominant Croat party HDZ.
 Among the quasi-disfranchised "others" were non-SDA Muslims and non-HDZ
 Croats, along with Serbs who had been loyal to the multiethnic republic, Bosnians
 of mixed ethnicity (estimated to make up 30 percent of the prewar Bosnian popu-
 lation), Jews, Roma, Vlachs, and the rest of Bosnia's varied ethnic mix.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics, although a few women
 occupy prominent positions. For example, a Serbian woman belongs to the Repub-
 lic's collective presidency, and a Muslim woman heads Bosnian radio and television.
 Although people on territory controlled by the 'Serbian Republic" have a theoreti-
 cal right to change their government and actually participated in "referendums," in-
 cluding one in August on the Contact Group proposal (with a 90 percent-plus vote
 against), SDS control of the media and security apparatus effectively precludes true
 citizen participation without intimidation. In the "Serbian Republic, women such
 as Karadzie's daughter, his wife (head of the "Serbian Republic Red Cross), and one
 of his vice presidents occupy important posts.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In late 1994, officials of the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal said that the Bosnian Gov-
 ernment was cooperating fully with their investigations and inquiries, even in cases
 of accusations of war crimes by Bosnian forces. Other human rights monitors also
 worked effectively with the Bosnian Government.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur and his staff, however, remain barred from Banja
 Luka following publication of their report in 1993 which condemned the ethnic
 cleansing that occurred there.
 The staff of the War Crimes Tribunal also traveled to Pale in "Serbian Republic"-
 held territory and described its visit as "satisfactory." However, most human rights
 monitors observed that Bosnian Serb authorities effectively impeded the War
 Crimes Tribunal's work by blocking its passage to Serb-held areas.
 In early November, the Government accused the UNPROFOR of blocking the
 transport of witnesses to testify at a war crimes trial in Denmark. This accusation
 appeared to be without substance; UNPROFOR did much to support the War
 Crimes Tribunal staff during its visits to Bosnia.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for freedom from discrimination based on race, color,
 sex, langage, religion or creed, political or other opinions, and national or social
 ori. However, the state of war and the ethnic and religious basis of that war cre-
 ated an environment in which many forms of discrimination were practiced.
 Women.-Women hold some of the most responsible positions in society, including
 judges, doctors, and professors. However, they continued to be subjected to rape and
 other forms of physical abuse. Officials at the "Rasadmk  forced labor camp in the
 .Serbian Republic" raped five women from the camp early in the year (see Section
 1.c.).
 Children.-There is no discrimination against children as such, but they suffered
 long-term harm from war-related shortages of food and clothing, the closing of
 schools, psychological trauma, and constricted environments for living and playing.
 Serbian snipers are suspected of targeting children; the inordinate number of chil-
 dren killed by snipers apparently substantiate this suspicion. In the final months
 of the year, Serb snipers shot and killed a 12 year old girl in the middle of town,
 a young boy riding his bicycle in front of the Holiday Inn and another young boy
 in the Dobrinja area near the airport.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities-Ethnic differences are at the heart of the
 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and have been manipulated by both the SDS party
 and the HDZ to sustain concepts of a "greater Serbia" and a "greater Croatia." The
 human rights violations addressed throughout this report-ethnic cleansing, rape,
 forced labor, forced relocation, extrajudicial killing-were largely perpetrated with
 the goal of establishing the superiority and political domination of a particular eth-
 nic group. No group was more victimized than Bosnia's Muslims.
 People With Disabilities.-It is not known whether there are laws providing for
 protection of the handicapped. In 1994 the number of disabled veterans and civil-
 ians disabled by war injuries continued to increase. The Government had limited
 resources to adrss the special needs of the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to form and join labor unions. The largest union is the Confederation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heir of the old Yugoslav Communist
 Trade Union Confederation. Unions have the right to strike, but in practice mobili-
 zation and other emergency wartime measures generally restricted the exercise of
 this right. Moreover, the economic devastation and joblessness caused by the war
 throughout much of the Federation allowed trade unions little opportunity to orga-
 nize and carry out their normal role.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The law provides for this
 right, but the practice of collective bargaining in labor-management negotiations
 was not significantly used in 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Most Bosnians of productive age
 in the Federation were mobilized to serve either in the military or in supporting ca-
 pacities in connection with the war. Government authorities in practice tolerated a
 significant amount of independent freedom of choice in the selection of work to fulfill
 the obligations imposed by the mobilization decree.
 Reliable sources reported that detainees at the government-run detention facility
 in Tarcin did agricultural forced labor in the fields nearby (see Section 1.c.).
 According to a reliable service, the forced labor camp "Rasadnik" operated by "Ser-
 bian Republic" authorities outside of Rogatica continued to function through April
 1994. Serbs have denied access to the camp, saing it is "not related to the conflict."
 The camp has held up to 50 prisoners who wore-as prison labor in the stockyards
 there (see Section 1.c.). "Serbian Republic" agents seized military-age men for deten-
 tion in "work camps," such as one in Lopare where over 200 were held for forced
 labor, without access to international observers. As of October according to Bosnian
 Serb television reports, local military and police commanders have the right to pun-
 ish those guilty of spreading disinformation about the "Serbian Republic" by sen-
 tencing then to forced labor on the front lines (see Section i.e.).
 Non-Serb men and women in the Bahja Luka and Bijeijina regions were routinely
 forced to labor, digging trenches, tilling fields, cleaning streets, etc. They received
 no compensation or    *s work. A few farmers were able to avoid forced labor by
 giving their entire harvest to the authorities. Reports of the forced labor of non-Serb
 women began to appear in September.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children remained 16. Eosnia had no effective social services agency to enforce
 
 
 the limit in 1994. Children sometimes assisted their families with farm work and
 odd jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In principle, minimum wages were guaranteed,
 but with the economy in collapse workers had no assurance they would be paid for
 work performed. The basic wage paid to government employees in Sarajevo, for ex-
 ample, was $0.66 (DM 1.00) per month, with supplemental allowances of flour and
 other humanitarian assistance.
 The prewar 42-hour workweek, with a 24-hour rest period, was formally still in
 effect, but for many workers no limits on working hours appeared to apply.
 Occupational safety and health regulations were generally sacrificed because of
 the demands and constraints imposed by the war.
