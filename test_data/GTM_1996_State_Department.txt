 GUATEMALA
 The 1985 Constitution provides for election by universal suffrage of a one-term
 president and a unicameral congress. It also mandates an independent judiciary and
 a Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH), who is elected by and reports to the Congress.
 Elections for president, vice president, congress, and municipal offices held on No-
 vember 12, 1995, resulted in the National Advancement Party (PAN) winning 42 of
 the 80 congressional seats; however, no presidential candidate received an absolute
 majority of the votes. Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen of the PAN won the runoff presidential
 election and took office January 14. Reflecting a greater opening for political activ-
 ity, 24 parties, including a broad front coalition composed of civic, human rights,
 and labor leaders, campaigned in the free and fair elections.
 Peace talks between the Government and the leftist insurgent Guatemalan Na-
 tional Revolutionary Unity (URNG) resulted in a negotiated end to the 36-year-long
 civil war, with a final peace accord signed on December 29. Guerrilla groups unilat-
 erally eased offensive action in March, and government forces immediately re-
 sponded by halting counterinsurgency patrols. In May the URNG announced that
 it would cease collection of "war taxes" following signature of an accord dealing with
 socioeconomic and agrarian issues. Even before the inal peace agreement, the Gov-
 ernment began demobilizing the rural civil self-defense groups called Civilian De-
 fense Patrols (PAC's), a process largely completed in November. The peace accords
 call for restructuring and downsizing the miitary, aboishing all PAC's, and
 strengthening the civil government, including increased spending on education and
 health. The army's budget and authorized strength of 43,000 men are to be reduced
 by one-third by 1999 and the Government is to propose a constitutional amendment
 to permit a civilian Minister of Defense. The agreements also call for the creation
 of a new police force with increased training and for the army to be removed from
 all internal security functions. A broad range of civic groups, including prominent
 human rights groups, endorsed the final accords.
 The U. Human Rights Verification Mission (MINUGUA), established by a 1994
 Government-URNG accord on human rights, maintains a large staff with regional
 offices to monitor compliance with the human rights accord. It is expected to assume
 expanded responsibilities in the wake of the final peace agreement. A military ob-
 
 
 455
 server component will be added to MINUGUA for a short time to monitor demobili-
 zation. MINUGUA has served as an important deterrent to human rights abuses.
 The Minister of Government oversees the National Police and the Treasury Police,
 which shared responsibility for internal security with the army. There are no mem-
 bers of the military in the police command structure. More than 200,000 men served
 in the PAC's at the beginning of the year, and some PAC's still conducted
 counterinsurgency patrols then. An estimated 137,000 men participated in Peace
 and Development Committees (PDC's) at the beginning of the year. While PDC's are
 voluntary associations that have no official links to either the military or the PAC's,
 the are often composed of former PAC members. By the end of the year, the PAC's
 had been disbanded, over 215,000 PAC members demobilized, with over 10,000
 weapons surrendered. Although the Constitution requires that service be voluntary,
 the PDH's office, the Catholic Archbishop's Human Rights Office (ODHAG), and
 MINUGUA reported that in some regions certain PAC's were still compelling mem-
 bers to join or remain in the patrols in the first half of the year. Security forces,
 especially PAC's and members of the police, committed numerous serious human
 rights violations.
 The agricultural-based, private sector-oriented economy grew by approximately
 3.1 percent in real terms. Coffee, sugar, and bananas are the leading exports, with
 more than half the work force engaged in agricultural labor. Inflation was 11 per-
 cent.There is a marked disparity in income distribution and poverty is pervasive,
 particularly in the large indigenous community. According to U.N. statistics, ap-
 proximately 80 percent of Guatemalans live in poverty, with 59 percent in extreme
 poverty. Per capita gross national product was approximately $1,400.
 There was marked improvement in the overal human rights situation, as dem-
 onstrated by a decrease in the number of serious violations, but problems remain
 in several areas. The improvement was the result of the March cessation of hos-
 tilities, the December final peace accord, the Government's initial reforms of the se-
 curity services, including disbanding the PAC's, as well as increased political will
 to combat impunity. These favorable military and political developments resulted in
 a greatly reduced number of conflict-related violations. Nonetheless, the PAC's,
 former civilian military commissioners, members of the army, and the police com-
 mitted serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, physical
 abuse, arbitrary arrest and detention, and death threats. The security forces gen-
 erally enjoyed impunity from the law. However, in contrast to past years, the Gov-
 ernment prosecuted and civilian courts convicted members of several PAC's and
 some police officers, and the authorities indicted several members of the military
 for human rights abuses. In December Congress passed a controversial national rec-
 onciliation law to implement the peace accords provisions on reintegrating the
 URNG into civilian life. The law provides exemption from prosecution for specific
 war-related acts; MINUGUA stated that it was consistent with international stand-
 ards.
 Even before the final agreements, the Arzu Government took important steps to
 begin to reduce the extensive institutional and legal autonomy of the army and
 lice in military and security matters. In January the President restructured te
 military command, reducing the number of general officers from 23 to 8 and retiring
 or leaving without assignment numerous officers alleged to be involved in corruption
 or other abuses. In September the President dismissed two other generals, including
 the Deputy Defense Minister, on corruption charges. Earlier, in June the Congress
 enacted a law removing from military jurisdiction cases involving members of the
 military involved in common crimes; as a result 347 cases. were transferred from
 military to civilian courts. In January the Government also dismissed over 100 po-
 lice officers for corruption and other crimes, many of whom were also the subject
 of criminal investigations at year's end. In addition, it dismissed 25 members of the
 Treasury Police for similar reasons in the first half of the year.
 Nonetheless, government policy changes and a more aggressive stance by the Min-
 ister of Government and the Director of the National Police, while having important
 positive effects and demonstrating increased political will, have not yet been suffi-
 cient to eliminate completely the impunity commonly enjoyed by government secu-
 rity forces and others. A climate of lawlessness persisted throughout the year, and
 violent acts were committed against all sectors of society, in particular striking such
 groups as media representatives and human rights monitors. With judges and other
 law enforcement officials subject to intimidation, corruption, and inadequate re-
 sources, the judicial system was often unable to ensure fair trials. Both legal and
 societal discrimination and violence against women persisted. Societal abuse of chil-
 dren and discrimination against indigenous people continued as well. Guerrillas, as
 well as leftwing and rightwing extremist groups, committed major human rights via-
 
 
 456
 lations. Guerrilla abuses included death threats, kidnaping for profit, the use of
 mines and explosives in civilian areas, and forced recruitment of minors.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIdling.-Politically motivated killings contin-
 ued with disturbing frequency, albeit at lower levels than in recent years. PAC
 members, police and military personnel, and rightwing extremist groups were all re-
 sponsible for political and extrajudicial killings. Because of the scarcity of law en-
 forcement resources and a weak and ineffective judicial system, the Government did
 not successfully investigate many killings or other crimes fully or detain and pros-
 ecute perpetrators. The Government's inability to identify, prosecute, or punish
 those responsible for such offenses remains an impediment to human rights
 pro s.-
 The PDH's office, which generally compiles data based on personal interviews
 with victims and their families, listed 173 cases of possible extrajudicial killings in
 1996, compared with 216 in 1995. Using media reports and interviews with victims
 and their relatives, the ODHAG reported 120 extrajudicial killings, compared with
 215 in 1995 and 287 in 1994. For its part, MINUGUA listed 69 complaints of
 extrajudicial killings for the period between January 1 and June 30, but it was able
 to confirm only 6. None of these human rights offices broke down the figures accord-
 ingto the organization believed responsible, but government security forces, former
 military commissioners, and current and former PAC members committed such of-
 fenses.
 The ODHAG and MINUGUA also accused some members of the army and the Na-
 tional Police of directing an extrajudicial "social cleansing" campaign in which they
 or their agents kill minors and adults believed to have committed common crimes.
 PAC members continued to commit human rights abuses, including extrajudicial
 killings, extorting money from those who did not want to participate (see Section
 1f.), and general criminal activity including burglary and assault. Former PAC
 members and former military commissioners, who often form an important part of
 the local power structure in the absence of day-to-day central government authority
 in outl    areas, are feared in many rural communities. (Military commissioners,
 formaly decommissioned September 15, 1995, were generally local civilian leaders
 who represented the army, serving as intermediaries with PAC members.) Despite
 thepeace accords and the Government's success in disarming and disbanding the
 A   there exists a widespread perception that the PAC's and former PAC mem-
 bers enjoy army backing and immunity from prosecution. The ODHAG and the
 Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Communities (CERJ, an indigenous human rights
 organization), reported that the executive branch failed to carry out arrest warrants
 against a number of military commissioners and PAC members for their involve-
 ment in human rights crimes. PAC members and military commissioners are rarely
 convicted for their crimes. Nonetheless, in an improvement over past years, the
 courts convicted and sentenced 4 PAC members during the year, with 15 still pend-
 ing trial. In several of these cases, CERJ acted as a joint complainant (see Section
 i.e.).
 Since the 1994 killings at the La Exacta farm, the Ministry of Government has
 modified its procedures and has promoted improved discipline and greater restraint
 in the use of force in property eviction tactics employed by the authorities. They car-
 ried out at least 20 evictions without incident during the year. Nonetheless, on April
 17, the commander of the Police Rapid Reaction Force. Ernesto Soto, and Roberto
 Velasquez, a peasant participating in the occupation of El Tablero farm, were killed
 when peasants clashed with police attempting to dislodge them. It is unclear who
 instigated the confrontation; MINUGUA, the PDH, and the ODHAG each issued
 conflicting statements.
 There was no significant progress in the case of the 1993 murder of newspaper
 publisher and former presidntial candidate Jorge Carpio. In November the pros-
 ecuting attorney announced he was quitting and going into voluntary exile because
 of continued threats and harassment. At year's end, the case continued under a dif-
 ferent attorney.
 On January 6, assailants killed CERJ member Miguel Us Mejia and his wife
 Lucia Tin Tuin, a member of the Guatemalan Conference of Widows (CONAVIGUA),
 who were returning from a wedding in a remote village in Quiche department. The
 killer stabbed Us Mejia more than 20 times and shot Ti Turm twice. The authori-
 ties have not arrested anyone for the crime; the violence of the attack and the ab-
 sence of robbery suggest political motives. Human rights groups accused local PAC
 members of committing the murders.
 
 
 On January 23, Miguel Mijanos, a member of a military patrol, shot and killed
 Narciso Alcor along the Central American highway in Chimaltenango. Alcor had ap-
 proached the patrol late at night and apparently disregarded several orders to halt.
 Mjanos fired shots in the air, at which point Alcr fled. Mijanos then shot Alcor
 twice in the back. Mijanos was detained and under investigation for extrajudicial
 execution at year's end Tere was no indication of a political motive.
 On September 20. a Treasury Police agent, Armando Ramirez, killed 16-year-old
 Ronald Raul Ramos Hernandez. According to Casa Alianza, an organization dedi-
 cated to assisting street children, Rnmirez-apparently under the influence of alco-
 hol-app~roached and demanded money from Ramos and other street children sleep-
 ing under a bridge in Tecun Uman on the Mexican border. The agent then beat
 Ramos and shot him once in the head. The authorities issued a warrant to arrest
 Ramos but he apparently fled the country. Casa Alianza charged that the refusal
 of local officials to investigate the case and detain Ramirez facilitated his escape.
 Popular frustration with the inability of the authorities to combat crime resulted
 in a series of lynchings and mob attacks throughout the year. Mobs killed at least
 31 people who were suspected of crimes ranging from murder to petty theft and in-
 jured many other suspected criminals. There were allegations that some of these
 mobs had been incited for political purposes, but the majority of incidents appeared
 to be spontaneous. Efforts by volunteer firemen and police, sometimes assisted by
 the military, to aid the victims were often unsuccessfl. With few exceptions, the
 Government made no effort to arrest or prosecute the perpetrators of these attacks.
 Congress passed a National Reconciliation Law in-December to implement the
 provisions of the peace accord on reintegration of the URNG into political life. The
 law provides amnesty for political crimes directly related to the war. However, it
 states that those who committed serious human rights violations-torture, forced
 disappearance  genocide, illegal treatment of prisoners, and those crimes not subject
 to a statute of i ttions or to amnesty by domestic law or international treaty-
 do not receive relief from criminal responsibility. The law provides for a special re-
 view by the Appeals Court, on a case-by-case basis, for common crimes committed
 in connection with war-related acts to determine if any exemption from prosecution
 applies. Human rights activists criticized the law as too lenient, but MINUGUA
 stated that it was consistent with international standards.
 There were developments in some high-profile cases from previous years:
 The ODHAG and MINUGUA issued separate reports concluding that the October
 1995 killing of 11 returned refugees at the Xaman Ranch in Alta Verapaz by an
 army patrol was not premeditated or ordered by the military command. In February
 an appellate judge ordered the criminal case against the soldiers involved trans-
 ferred to civilian jurisdiction. In June the civilian judge granted bail for 8 of the
 26 soldiers in the case, including the commanding officer, Lieutenant Lacan
 Chaclan. The prosecution appealed this decision, and, based upon irregularities in
 the way this and other decisions were made, the authorities subsequently suspended
 the judge and returned the eight to jail. The case continued under a different civil-
 ian judge at year's end.
 Victor Roman, the alleged perpetrator of the 1995 murder of evangelical pastor
 Manuel Saquic and the 1994 murder of pastor Pascual Serech, remained at large
 at year's end, despite an arrest warrant and the offer of a $3,300 (20,000 quetzales)
 reward. In September the Public Ministry ified charges against two other persons
 allegedly involved in the Serech murder, including Serech a wife, and filed charges
 in absentia against Roman. Members of the presbytery to which both Saquic and
 .Serech belonged reeived numerous death threats during the year, presumably re-
 lated to their continued demands for the apprehension of Roman and their testi-
 mony before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). In June
 the IACHR issued a resolution faulting the Government for a lax investigation and
 ordered protection of the witnesses involved and monthly reports from the Govern-
 ment on the progress of the case.
 Partly in response to the Commission's findings, the Government established reg-
 ular meetings between civilian and military authorities responsible for the case and
 members of the presbytery. In August the presbytery withdrew from the meetings
 citing a lack of progress in the investigation and a lack of cooperation from the mili-
 tary. A search of local military facilities where Roman allegedly had been sighted
 failed to uncover Roman or further leads.
 In the April 1994 killing of Constitutional Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez
 Dubon, an appeals court overturned the verdict of two of the six persons convicted;
 they were released in March. The Constitutional Court later reversed this decision
 after an appeal by the Public Ministry. One of the accused had been arrested on
 unrelated charges but subsequently escaped in August and remained at large at
 year's end. The other was recaptured in September. Meanwhile, the authorities in-
 
 
 458
 dicted Antonio Trabanino Vargas, already in prison on other charges, for involve-
 ment in the killing. Judicial proceedings against Trabanino continued at year's end.
 Although the Public Ministry ruled out any motive other than robbery there was
 widespread speculation that Gonzalez Dubon was killed because he had decided to
 uphold the onstitutionality of an extradition order to the United States for former
 A vieotpe f a  oveber199 demnstatin byuniersty tudents showed p~o-
 l     n s     y   aing         M       pez S     z afte      as ijured and in-
 capable of resistance. Lopez later died from his injuries. Judicial proceedings contin-
 ued at year's end. An appellate court reinstated a previously dismissed wrongful
 death lawsuit for $1.6 miion (10 million quetzales) a ainst the Government filed
 by the family. MINUGUA reports that, since Lopez' death, there have been inci-
 dents of torture, kidnaping, and intimidation directed against witnesses and others
 involved in the prosecution of the case.
 The authorities arrested seven police officers in connection with the August 1994
 killing of three workers at the La Exacta farm. The seven were still awaiting trial
 at year's end. According to MINUGUA, however, Public Ministry officials have ne-
 glected to carry out some basic investigative inquiries into this incident.
 There were major developments in the case against three former army officers ac-
 cused of ordering the 1990 murder of anthropologist Ma Mack. An October Su-
 preme Court decision to proceed with the case under the former penal procedures
 code rendered inadmissible all evidence previously gathered by the Public Ministry
 and cocomplainant Helen Mack, effectively ending the prosecution. The Public Min-
 istry and Mack appealed the ruling to the Constitutiona Court. The convicted mate-
 rial author of the crime, Jose Noel Beteta, is in prison serving a 30-year sentence.
 There was no progress in the presumably related case of detective Jose Luis Merida
 Escobar, killed in 1991 while investigating Myrna Mack's death.
 The 1988 "white van case," in which members of the Treasury Police allegedly ab-
 ducted, tortured, and murdered victims using a white van, remained open at year's
 end. In June the Public Ministry announced that unknown individuals had broken
 into its offices and searched the prosecution's file on the case.
 On April 11, a court acquitted members of a PAC in Colotenango -which was
 disbanded on August 9-due to lack of evidence in the August 1993 murder of Juan
 Chanay Pablo, an anti-PAC demonstrator. The Public Ministry is appealing the de-
 cision. Family members also brought the case to the IACHR. For the first time in
 any such case, the Government is seeking to negotiate a settlement with the plain-
 tiffs.
 There was no progress in resolving numerous other past extrajudicial killings: The
 1985 killings of-Nicholas Blake and Griffith Davis; the 1989 disappearances and
 murders of university students; the 1990 Hector Oqueli Colindres and Gilda Flores
 killings; the 1990 disappearance of Maria Tiu Tojin and her daughter, the 1991 dis-
 appearance of Diego Domingo Martin; the 1992 kidnaping, torture, and murder of
 Huehuetenang peasant Lucas Perez Tadeo; the 1993 shooting of street children
 Henry Yubani Alvarez and Francisco Tziac; and the 1993 shooting of student pro-
 tester Abner Abdiel Hernandez Orellana.
 b. Disappearance.-In contrast to past years, there were no credible reports of dis-
 appearances attributed to official forces.
 The PDH's office received 47 complaints of forced disappearance,compared with 77
 for 1995. While motives in the incidents reported by the PDH are difficult to deter-
 mine, the victims were not, in general, politically active. Using a more restrictive
 definition than the PDH, the ODHAG reported no forced disappearances during the
 year.
 Disappearances in high-profile cases from recent years remained unresolved at
 year's end. Arnoldo Xi, a community leader in Tixila, Purulha, Baja Verapaz and
 a member of CONIC (an indigenous human rights organization dedicated to saving
 Mayan culture), reportedly wounded by gunfire and abducted by armed men on
 March 23, 1995, remained missing. The whereabouts were unknown of Salvador de
 la Rosa, a member of a military patrol who disappeared in March 1995, and of
 Lorenzo Quiej Pu, a member of CONDEG (an organization dedicated to helping
 Guatemalans internally displaced due to the armed conflict), who disappeared in
 January 1994. The disappearances of San Marcos PAC members Margarito Lopez
 and Obdulio Zapeta, army enlisted man Diego Chel Matom, and farmers Ramona
 Munoz and Maritza Gil, who were aillegedly kidnaped in 1993 by guerrillas, also re-
 mained unresolved at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the integrity and security of the person and prohibits
 the physical or psychological torture of prisoners. There were credible reports of
 mistreatment by members of the security forces, including sexual abuse of minors
 
 
 459
 and adults and use of excessive force at the time of arrest. Additional reports indi-
 cated that, especially in rural areas, the army, civil defense patrols, former military
 commissioners, and police all at times used excessive force against the civilian popu-
 lation.
 Many bodies were found in various p arts of the country bearing signs of severe
 disfigurement or mutilation. It was difficult to determine those responsible, in part
 because the authorities do not have the capacity to undertake serious investigations.
 The PDH's office listed 12 potential cases of torture, compared with 9 in 1995. The
 ODHAG listed 4 cases of torture, compared with 5 cases in 1995 and 17 cases in
 1994. Some of these incidents were believed to be politically motivated, such as the
 case of radio reporter Vinicio Pacheco (see Section 2.a.) Evidence of torture and se-
 vere mistreatment are also prevalent in murders arising from nonpolitical disputes,
 particularly those related to narcotics trafficking.
 Casa Alianza reported various instances in which the National Police abused
 street children. It also reported that the criminal case against the five policemen
 charged in the March 1994 baton beating of Luis Antonio Roldan Izeppi remained
 pendcg because two policemen have not testified. One of the five has since left the
 force. Also according to Casa Alianza, private security guards routinely abuse street
 children. The courts convicted five people, including two police officers and one mili-
 tary officer, of abusing street children. Guerrilla forces also occasionally abused the
 civilian population, especially in rural areas.
 There were no new developments in the investigation of abuses suffered by U.S.
 citizen Sister Dianna Ortiz in November 1989.
 Prison conditions are harsh but not life threatening. The Government reports that
 prison capacity is 7,100 persons. However, prisoners frequently complain of over-
 crowding, even though there were less than 5,700 inmates at year's end. Prisoners
 also complain of inadequate food, and fights among inmates led to the deaths of sev-
 eral prisoners. Corruption-especially drug-related-is widespread, and the authori-
 ties replaced the director of prisons in November due to allegations of corruption.
 Women prisoners are held in facilities separate from men, and minor children are
 held in separate detention facilities.
 The Government permits access to prisons by family members as well as inde-
 pendent international monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, and failure to
 adhere to prescribed time limits in legal proceedings by the security forces. The
 Constitution requires that a court-issued arrest warrant be presented to a suspect
 prior to arrest unless he is caught in the act of committing a crime. Police may not
 detain a suspect for over 6 hours without bringing the case before a judge. The law
 also provides for bail and access to lawyers.
 There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary detentions, although most
 accounts agree that the security forces routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus in
 cases of illegal detention. There were 5,400 men and 277 women in prison at year's
 end. Reliable estimates suggest that about 70 percent have been sentenced, and 30
 percent are awaiting sentences. Prisoners are often detained past their legal trial
 or release dates. The ODHAG has charged that prisoners are sometimes not re-
 leased in a timely fashion after completing their sentences due to the failure of
 judges to issue the necessary court order.
 There were numerous reports that policemen illegally detained street children;
 the authorities rarely took action in any of these incidents.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not officially practiced. There are in-
 stances of threatened individuals fleeing the country out of fear for their lives.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However independent in fact, in practice the judicial system often fails to pro-
 vide fair trials. International organizations, including MINUGUA, continued to note
 the Government's failure to investigate, prosecute, and punish'many suspects, espe-
 cially in cases involving members of the military and public security forces.
 The judiciary is composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, appellate
 courts, lower courts, and courts of special jurisdiction (e.g., labor courts). The Con-
 stitution provides that the Congress elect Supreme Court and appellate court mag-
 istrates from lists prepared by panels comprised of active magistrates, the Bar Asso-
 ciation, and law school deans.
 The new Criminal Procedures Code, which came into effect in mid-1994, fun-
 damentally alters the administration of criminal justice by strengthening the pros-
 ecutorial function, establishing a public defender program, and instituting oral ad-
 versarial proceedings at the trial phase. Its key precepts include the accused's pre-
 sumption of innocence, the right to be present at trial, the right to counsel, and the
 
 
 460
 possibility of release on bail. Trials are public. The new code also provides for lan-
 guage interpretation for those who require it (see Section 5).
 Because of the difficulty in implementing the new code, however, the commitment
 to transform a dysfunctional judicial system into an effective one is being seriously
 tested. Despite evidence of increased political will and some concrete advances, the
 legal obligation of the State (through its Public Ministry) to investigate crimes, pros-
 ecute offenders, and administer punishment has been severely hampered by mad-
 equate training and equipment, as well as insufficient numbers of investigators. The
 courts' response to human rights violations, as well as to general criminal activity,
 has been very slow. The authorities often avoid conducting investigations that might
 lead them into conflict with powerful forces. There is apparently no set procedure
 within the Public Ministry to govern criminal investigations and thus to ensure a
 viable response to criminal activity. In an effort to improve coordination and set an
 example for other investigative units, a specially trained investigative task force
 began operating in May. The task force is made up of members of the Public Min-
 istry andi Ministry of Government and is assigned to high priority cases. By year's
 end the task force had made arrests in a number of kidnaping and murder cases.
 Coordination between the Public Ministry and the National Police with regard to
 investigations is inadequate. Security forces personnel are reluctant to investigate
 cases potentially involving colleagues. Police are poorly paid, relatively few in num-
 ber, and lack adequate resources and training. Judges and prosecutors are suscep-
 tible to intimidation and corruption and suffer from low pay, poor working condi-
 tions, and low morale. Such factors, combined with the small number of prosecutors
 and the interference of the Supreme Court with the lower courts, demonstrate that
 the Government's efforts to date have been insufficient to combat the existing perva-
 sive atmosphere of impunity.
 There are, however, signs that the reforms are taking root. There were over 600
 oral trials held under the new procedures; of which approximately 100 resulted in
 acquittals. In contrast with the past, during the year the authorities tried and con-
 victed some police officials and current and  former members of PAC's and arrested
 several members of the military, including high-ranking officers, who awaited trial
 at year's end (see Section L.a.). The Public Ministry was successful in prosecuting
 a number of other high-profile cases of common crime as well, including the 1994
 murder of Karin Fleischmann, for which a court sentenced Ricardo Ortega del Cid
 to 30 years in prison. In an effort to improve the functioning of the court system
 in rural areas, the judicial system added 19 judges and 5 justices of the peace in
 August and announced plans to expand the court system in rural areas.
 Members of the judiciary, as wen as prosecutors, continued to receive threats, ei-
 ther in an attempt to influence current decisions or as reprisals for past decisions.
 According to the Secretary General of the Supreme Court, early in the year, 40
 judges had reported receiving threats related to their cases. Public prosecutors, pri-
 vate plaintiffs, and officials from MINUGUA, the ODHAG, and the PDIs office also
 received threats.
 Corruption continues to impede the proper functioning of the police force, and
 there are credible allegations of some police involvement in narcotics trafficking. In
 numerous criminal cases, police were unwilling to execute arrest warrants. In Janu-
 ary the Arzu administration began an effort to combat corruption in the security
 forces by dismissing over 100 National Police and 25 Treasury Police officers. By
 the middle of the year, more than 100 of these officers were facing judicial proceed-
 ings. In a further effort to professionalize the police force, the Ministry of Govern-
 ment initiated a mandatory 6-month training course for all newly hired police offi-
 cers. In the past, many officers received no formal training. The new training pro-
 gram includes instruction on human rights given by the PDH and Casa Alanza and
 was developed with assistance from MINUGUA and other international organiza-
 tions. The first officers graduated from the new course in mid-summer. Plans incor-
 rated into the final peace agreement include the unification of the civilian security
 orces into a single police force, a professional training and development program,
 and a significant increase in the number of officers. All new officers are to pass the
 6-month training course.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but the authorities at times disregard these provisions. Elements of the se-
 curity forces reportedly continue to monitor private communications. As recently as
 1995, Ministry of Defense officials admitted that the military monitors communica-
 tions "when necessary." In January the daily newspaper Siglo Veintiuno charged
 that the Presidential Military Staff had tapped its fax machine. Many human rights
 workers alleged surveillance of their movements and activities.
 
 
 MINUGUA reports that the military has honored the June 1994 presidential
 order to suspend all conscription, including forced recruitment. However, while the
 Constitution requires that IAC service be voluntary, in some regions, army officers
 and PAC leaders pressured men to become and remain members or extorted a fee
 from individuals in exchange for permission to resign. There are credible reports
 that individuals refusing to serve in PAC's suffered threats and other abuses. The
 Government's action to disband the PAC's was a major step toward ending these
 abuses.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-A mutual cessation of hostilities in March, a major agreement in September,
 and the signing of the final peace accord on December 29 that ended the 36-year-
 long civil war greatly reduced the number of human rights violations related to the
 coniflict. However, instances of terrorist bombings conducted by unknown perpetra-
 tors occurred throughout the year. At least five explosive devices were detonated or
 deactivated in Guatemala City and two others outside the city, leaving at least two
 persons dead and several injured. Several of these devices were accompanied by
 URNG leaflets. Other bomb attacks were believed to be orchestrated by rightist
 groups opposed to the peace negotiations.
 Alter reaching agreement on an accord with the Government on socioeconomic
 and agrarian issues on May 6, the guerrillas unilaterally stopped the collection of
 war taxes. Prior to this decision, however, MINUGUA had verified the accuracy of
 complaints of ranch owners against the URNG's practice of collecting war taxes in
 several departments. There were also complaints that either the URING or criminal
 elements were still collecting "back taxes" at year's end.
 Both the army and the guerrillas used antipersonnel land mines in civilian areas,
 particularly in San Marcos and Quiche departments. However, both sides cooper-
 ated with the U.N. and national authorities in the removal of mines. M]NUGUA
 reported that three members of the military were killed, and one soldier and three
 civilians injured, in five mine explosions in the first half of the year. These incidents
 mainly occurred during attempts to remove the mines.
 Throughout the year, guerrilla groups assembled captive audiences to listen to
 their political pronouncements. Armed guerrilla units occupied various towns
 tughout the countr and the University of San Carlos campus in Guatemala City
 for several hours to disseminate propaganda. Local military zone commanders did
 not resist these incursions, and there were no confrontations or casualties. On July
 30, press reports indicated that guerrillas took over a radio station in Mazatenango,
 forced personnel to play URNG propaganda tapes, and detonated a pamphlet bomb.
 There were no casualties in the incident.
 On October 28, the Government announced it had captured a high ranking guer-
 rilla commander in connection with the kidnaping of a wealthy 86-year-old woman.
 After negotiations, the authorities released the guerrilla in exchange for the victim's
 safe return. Guerrilla leaders later confirmed the commander's involvement in the
 kidnaping but claimed that he was acting without orders. There was widespread
 speculation of guerrilla involvement in other kidnapings.
 The URNG claims it holds no prisoners, and there were no reports of any captives
 in URNG custody at year's end.
 U.S. citizen lawyer Jennifer Harbury continued to search for the remains of her
 husband, guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, who disappeared following a
 March 1992 clash between army and URNG forces. The military contends that
 Bamaca died in battle, but reliable information indicates the army captured Bamaca
 and held him for an undetermined period, interrogating and ultimately killing him.
 Several legal developments in ongoing Guatemalan court cases related to Bamaca's
 disappearance failed to shed additional light on his fate. In addition, the military
 frustrated at least two separate attempts to exhume a possible grave at the Las Ca.
 banas military detachment in San Marcos by obtaining countermanding judicial or-
 ders. MINUGUA is assisting the Public Ministry in its investigation as part of its
 suport for due process. In October the Constitutional Court denied legal recognition
 of te U.S. marriage of Harbury and Bamaca. The Inter-American Court of Human
 rights accepted a case against the Government over Bamaca's disappearance but
 gave no indication when a ruling may be issued.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. In addition to regular and open criticism of government policies, the media
 publicizes communiques from the URNG, leftist groups, and others opposed to the
 Government or its policies. Journalists admit, however, that in some particularly
 sensitive cases pressure and fears of reprisal result in self-censorship and limits on
 investigative reporting. Some journalists report they are reluctant to criticize the
 
 
 462
 military or military officers or to discuss topics that could be perceived to affect the
 interests of powerful economic groups and individuals. Reports on human rights and
 narcotics trafficking are carefully written and sourced so that neither journalists nor
 their institutions are put at risk. Radio and television station owners observe that
 licensing procedures could give the Government powerful leverage over their edi-
 torial policies, but they have not cited any instances in which the Government at-
 tempted to use this power.
 Continuing acts of political violence directed against journalists give credence to
 their complaints of pressure and oercion at the working level. The ODHAG re-
 ported 18 incidents of violene or threats against the media, including 3 murders,
 2 bomb attacks, 1 case of torture, and 12 threats against reporters or editors. The
 ODHAG was unable to identify the perpetrators or determine the motives in most
 of these incidents but believes that many were related to the journalists' work.
 On February 28, unknown men abducted radio reporter Vinicio Pacheco and phys-
 ically abused him. They reportedly warned Pachec to discontinue his aggressive
 coverage of drug trafficking and car theft. The authorities have not arrested anyone
 for this crime. On May 16, hand grenades were thrown at the car of newspaper edi-
 tor Jose Ruben Zamora who, as editor of one of the major daily newspapers, had
 run articles sharply critical of the military and other powerful interests. The per-
 petrators were not apprehended.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom. There were no reports of profes-
 sors or students being subject to violence or intimidation for their academic work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. Peaceful demonstrations were common, and demonstrators some-
 times occupied government institutions, including the presidential palace, govern-
 ment ministries Congress, and the Supreme Court building. In all these cases, the
 police acted with restraint, and the authorities negotiated a peaceful departure of
 the demonstrators. The Government did not interfere with political associations.
 The law requires organizations to obtain legal status, a cumbersome and expensive
 procedure.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 authorities respect it in practice. However, personal and political enemies some-
 times threatened or killed religious personnelecause of their activism in human
 rights, indigenous rights, land reform, and related fields. During the year, both the
 ODHAG and the Council of Evangalical Churches denounced acts of intimidation
 and harassment directed against several members of the clergy, Evangelical pastors,
 and lay workers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict foreign travel, nor does it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. The authorities did not restrict movement inside the
 country except in some areas of conflict before the cessation of hostilities, where the
 army and PAC's limited travel.
 Early in the year, guerrillas established roadblocks to rob private citizens, extort
 protection payments from businessmen, attack and drain petroleum trucks, and
 hinder travel in certain rural areas.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitaian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees from other countries. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons to countries where they feared
 persecution. Voluntary repatriation of refugees from Mexico continued. The UNHCR
 reported that 4,185 refugees returned to Guatemala in 1996, bringing the total to
 over 25,000 since initiation of the program in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government by peaceful and democratic
 means, through secret ballot and universal suffrage for those 18 years of age and
 older. Members of the armed forces and police may not vote. Since the return to
 democracy and civilian rule in 1985, there have been seven free elections. Inter-
 national observers concluded that both the general elections for President, Vice
 President, Congress, and municipal offices, held on November 12, 1995, and the run-
 off presidential election held on January 7, 1996, were free and fair. In the runoff
 between Alvaro Arzu of the National Advancement Party (PAN) and Alfonso Portillo
 of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG), Arzu won with 51.2 percent of the vote
 to Portillo's 48.8 percent, and he took office on January 14.
 Reflecting a greater opening for political activity, 24 parties, including a broad-
 front coalition composed of civic, human rights, and labor leaders, campaigned. The
 
 
 463
 parties put forward 19 presidential candidates and thousands of candidates for con-
 gressional deputy and mayor. The election also was characterized by a greater par-
 ticipation by grassroots organizations and the lef, incorrated into a newly formed
 coalition party called the New Guatemalan DemocraticFront (FDNG). Although the
 URNG did not participate directly, in a radical departure from previous policy, it
 did call for voter partcipation in the election and agreed to a unilateral cease-fire
 for the last 2 weeks of both the first and second election periods in return for politi-
 cal parties' commitment to abide by those peace accords previously agreed to by the
 Government and the URNG.
 Voters elect the 80-member Congress using a system of proportional representa-
 tion based on population, with deputies elected both from districts and from a na-
 tionwide list. Congress has 64 deputies from districts and 16 from the national list.
 The last elections involved 24 political parties; 6 won seats in the legislature. Con-
 gress can and does act independently of the executive, but fragmentation along
 party lines and a weak support structure result in the Government being driven by
 the executive branch.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in politics, but women
 are underrepresented in the political arena. Nevertheless, women do hold some
 prominent political positions, including a cabinet post. In the November 1995 elec-
 tions, voters elected 11 women to the 80-member Congress. Two women also serve
 as Supreme Court justices, and one is a Constitutional Court justice.
 Indigenous people are entitled to equal rights under the Constitution. Some have
 attained high positions as army officers (including one general), judges, and govern-
 ment officials, including eight members of Congress. In the November elections, 40
 indigenous candidates won mayoral positions (out of 300 municipalities), including
 the mayor of Quetzaltenango, the second largest city. Nonetheless, they are still
 heavily underrepresented in politics due to limited educational opportunity and per-
 vasive discrimination (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits local human rights groups to operate freely. However,
 as noted by MINUGUA, a ervasive attitd continued among rightwing elements
 of the army, military commissioners, and civil defense patrol members that human
 rights activists were really subversives tied to the URNG.
 A government-URNG accord led to the November 1994 introduction of MINUGUA
 into Guatemala. MINUGUA became fully staffed in 1995 and now numbers 305 per-
 sonnel, with 8 regional and 5 subregional offices. MINUGUA's extensive inter-
 national presence, its verification of alleged abuses, and other activities serve as a
 deterrent to human rights abuses. MINUGUA's two comprehensive 1996 reports
 documented both the Government's and the URNG's successes and failures in imple-
 menting the terms of the human rights agreement.
 Relations between the Ombudsman's office and the executive branch were
 strained. The PDH reported that some security force agents intimidated and refused
 to cooperate with Ombudsman officials. Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia
 also complained that the Government was neither funding his office adequately nor
 implementing his recommendations on human rights.
 Other high-ranking officials working in the fields of human rights and jurispru-
 dence complained publicly and privately of receiving threats stemming from their
 interest in resolving cases related to human rights violations, official corruption, and
 drug trafficking. ODHAG spokesmen reported that members of that office had re-
 ceived threats as well.
 Several members of Congress, who are also leaders of human rights groups, re-
 ported receiving threatening letters at various times throughout the year. On April
 11, unknown men broke into the house of Amilcar Mendez, FDNG congressional
 deputy and founder of the human rights group CERJ, and assaulted his adopted
 daughter. While the Government actively investigated the crime, there were no ar-
 rests. Other human rights activists also reported receiving threats throughout the
 year. For example, Federico Reyes Lopez, a member of the Guatemalan forensic an-
 thrpology team which is dedicated to unovering mass graves-mainly resulting
 from human rights abuses in the 1980's--reported in June receiving threats pre-
 sumably relatedsto his work.
 Both the PDH's office and the ODHAG continued to enjoy widespread public supi-
 port and respect. Senior government officials also met with numerous foreign offi-
 cials and human rights monitors. While many international human rights organiza-
 tions and their workers do not enjoy formal legal status, they continue to operate
 openly.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and
 rights and that the State must protect the life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and
 development of all Guatemalans. In practice, however, the Government is frequently
 unable or unwilling to enforce theseprovisions, due to inadequate resources, corrup-
 tion, and a continuing atmosphere of impunity.
 Women.-CONAVIGUA and the PDH reported that violence against women, in-
 cluding domestic violence, remains common among all social classes. There is no
 specific law against domestic violence, although it is considered to fall under other
 statutes. Victims rarely report criminal sexual violence, and relatively few rape
 cases go to court. The PDH reported that complaints of spousal abuse committed
 by husbands have continued to rise due to increased nationwide educational pro-
 grams, which have encouraged women to seek assistance. There are family courts,
 and judges may issue an injunction against an abusive spouse or companion. The
 p olie are charged with enforcing such injunctions. There is also a Women's Rights
 atment of the PDH, and various nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) pro-
 vide medical and legal assistane and information on family planning. In March the
 Constitutional Court overturned an adultery statute that app lied only to women.
 The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes. Nonetheless,
 women face job discrimination and on average receive significantly lower pay than
 men. They are primarily employed in low-wage obs in the textile industry, agri-
 culture, retail businesses, and the public sector. Mdore working women than men are
 employed in the informal sector of the economy, where pay and benefits are gen-
 lower. A 1989 survey reported that in Guatemala  ity women are underrep-
 resented in high-incme job categories and overrepresnted among poorly paid work-
 ers. Women may own, manage, and inherit property on an equal basis with men.
 Children.-The Constitution charges the Government with protecting the physical
 and mental health, as well as the moral well-being, of minors. These provisions not-
 withstanding, the Government consistently fails to devote sufficient resources to en-
 sure adequate educational and health services for children. The abuse of street chil-
 dren (see Section i.c.) is a serious problem in major cities. Estimates of the number
 of street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the majority of these youths
 concentrated in Guatemala City. Corrupt police and military personnel and crimi-
 nals often recruit these children into thievery or prostitution rings. The Government
 and a number of NGO's operate youth centers, but the funds devoted to them are
 not sufficient to alleviate the problem.
 The Presidential Human Rights Commission continued weekly meetings of the
 Permanent Commission for Children, composed of representatives from Casa
 Alianza and from the judicial and executive branches, with the aim of addressing
 the problems of street children. Relations between Casa Alianza and the National
 Police have often been strained.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices, and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation mandating provi-
 sion of accessibility to public buildings or transportation for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution states that Guatemala is composed of di-
 verse ethnic groups and obliges the Government to recognize, respect, and promote
 the lifestyles, customs, traditins, forms of socil organzation, and manner of dress
 of indigenous people. Indigenous people constitute over one-half the population but
 remain largely outside of the countrs political, economic, social, and cultural main-
 stream. Indigenous people suffered most of the serious human rights abuses de-
 scribed in Section l.a. and throughout this report. Although the Constitution ac-
 cords indigenous people equal rights, in practice they have only minimal participa-
 on in dcisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions, and allocation of natural
 resources. In July the Coness ratified International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 169, ntendd to safeguard the rights of indigenous people. The final
 peace accord reached between the Government and the URNG includes agreements
 on indigenous and socioeconomic issues which, together, should strengthen indige-
 nous participation in society and increase government resources devoted to indige-
 nous areas.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational op portunities and thus have
 fewer employment opportunities. Many indigenous peope are illiterate and do not
 speak Spamsh. Linguistic barriers hinder interaction with the Government and
 limit access to public services, including the judiciary, since few officials speak any
 of the 21 indigenous languages. Indigenous persons arrested for crimes are often at
 a disadvantage due to their limited comprehension of Spanish. The new Criminal
 
 
 465
 Procedures Code, which took effect in July 1994, states that, beginning in July 1996,
 the courts must provide interpretation for anyone requiring such services during
 criminal proceedings. The first programs aimed at implementing this provision
 began to function in May.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide work-
 ers complete freedom of association and the right to form and join trade unions. The
 Government does not control unions. Major reforms to the Labor Code in 1992 man-
 dated steps to improve worker rights by facilitating freedom of association, strength-
 ening the rights of working women, increasing penalties for violations of labor laws,
 and enhancing the role of the Labor Ministry and labor courts in enforcing the stat-
 utes. All workers have the right to form or join unions, including public sector em-
 ployees, with the exception of members of security forces.
 At most, 8 percent of the work force, or 240,000 out of 3 million workers, are
 members of labor organizations. The 1,100 registered unions in the country are
 independent of government and political party domination. Labor Code amendments
 simplified the process for unions to obtain legal status. The Minister of Labor fur-
 ther revised the administrative process in May, reducing the number of steps within
 the Ministry for consideration of union applications and establishing strict time-
 tables; the time for the procedure has been reduced to 20 days from 60. The Labor
 Ministry also initiated a program to assist unions with their applications, and the
 Minister warned officials that noncompliance with the timetable could lead to dis-
 missal of those responsible for the delay. These new regulations accelerated the ap-
 proval procedure and largely eliminated the backlog of union applications. The
 Labor Ministry granted legal status to 150 unions in the first half of 1996. Of the
 registered unions, 900 are in the private sector, and 250 are in the public sector.
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures for having a strike
 recognized as legal are cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that
 two-thirds of the workers must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes
 by agricultural workers at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit
 strikes that it considers seriously harmful to the national economy. In June the
 Congress approved a law that further restricted the right to strike for workers em-
 ployed in essential public services. The law was strongly opposed by unions and
 some members of Congress, who called the measure unconstitutional and contrary
 to commitments to the ILO. The law deems such services as urban and interurban
 transport, mail, and telegraph as essential. The law was under review by the Con-
 stitutional Court at year's end.
 Those strikes that do occur are frequently in the public sector and almost always
 called without legal authorization. The Government declared illegal a strike by judi-
 cial workers in April and May; the workers eventually resumed their duties, and
 were paid for the time they were on strike. Previously, the Government had made
 no effort to intervene on the basis of a strike's illegality, but the new strike regula-
 tion law passed in June permits it to act more forcefully. Hence, the lack of legal
 approval for a strike can be used as a threat against strikers. Employers may sus-
 pend workers or fire them for absence without leave if the authorities have not le-
 gally approved their strike. The strike regulation law calls for binding arbitration
 ifan impasse has been reached after 30 days of negotiations.
 The law protects workers from retribution for forming and participating in trade
 union activities, but enforcement of these provisions is spotty. While an increasing
 number of employers accept unionization, many routinely seek to circumvent Labor
 Code provisions in order to resist union activities, w the view as historically
 confrontational and disruptive. An ineffective legal system and inadequate penalties
 for violations have hindered enforcement of the right to form unions and participate
 in trade union activities. While workers illegally fired for union activity should,
 under the Labor Code, be reinstated within 24 hours, employers often file a series
 of appeals, or simply defy judicial orders of reinstatement. Penalties for defying such
 orders were increased somewhat in the 1992 Labor Code reform.
 In contrast to 1995, trade union leaders and members did not suffer labor-related
 violence, although written and telephone threats continued. Some public sector
 union leaders, as well as unionists in the high-profile in-bond export sector, reported
 receiving threats against themselves and their families. Investigations continued
 into previous years' cases of violence, including murder, against various labor lead-
 ers, although some of these investigations appear to have been suspended for lack
 of evidence.
 An active "solidarity" movement claims approximately 250,000 members in over
 475 companies. Unions may legally continue to operate in workplaces that have soli-
 darity associations, and workers have the right to choose between the two or to be-
 
 
 466
 
 long to both. The Government views these associations as civic organizations that
 need not interfere with the functioning of trade unions. The amended Labor Code
 stipulates very clearly that trade unions have the exclusive right to bargain collec-
 tively over work conditions on behalf of workers. Unionists charge, however, that
 management promotes solidarity associations to avoid the formation of trade unions
 or to compete with existing labor unions. There are credible reports that some of
 these associations did not always adhere to democratic principles in their formation
 and management and that workers are unable to participate fully and freely in deci-
 sionmaking. Similar credible charges are made against some trade union organiza-
 tions. At the request of trade union leaders, the independent Human Rights Om-
 budsman, through its Office for Economic and Social Issues, receives complaints re-
 lated to trade union activities. Union leaders and workers fied some complaints
 with the PDH during the year, and the Ombudsman has spoken out in public state-
 ments about labor conditions in varying sectors of the economy. The PDH can inves-
 tigate union complaints and issue a statement, but the office has no enforcement
 powers beyond attempting to ameliorate the situation through publicity and moral
 suasion.
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and join international or-
 ganizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. However, the practice of collective bargaining is lim-
 ited by the wea structure of the union movement, the requirement that 25 percent
 of the workers in a factory or business must be union members in order for collec-
 tive bargaining to take place, the lack of experience with this practice, and the pref-
 erence of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with trade unions. While
 both management and the unions honored some well-written collective contracts, in
 other instances both parties openly ignored and violated contracts. Most workers,
 even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective contracts to cover their
 wages and working conditions but do have individual contracts as required by law.
 Most workers receive the minimum wages established by bipartite commissions,
 which operate under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers cannot dismiss workers for participating in the formation of a trade
 union; workers file complaints in this regard with the labor inspectors for resolution.
 The Labor Code provides for the right of employers to fire union workers for cause,
 permits workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts, and requires the rein-
 statement within 24 hours of any union worker fired without cause. The revised
 code prohibits employers from firing workers for union organizing and protects them
 for 60 days following the official publication of approval of the union. It also pro-
 hibits employers from firing any member of the executive committee of a union and
 protects them for an additional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive
 committee. An employer may fire a member of the union's executive committee for
 cause only after a trial and issuance of a court resolution.
 Labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued to be generally ineffec-
 tive. Although two labor courts, the sixth and seventh, continued to function, efforts
 to restructure and modernize the labor court system made little headway. However,
 in November the president of the Supreme Court announced creation of eight new
 labor courts and two appeals courts, which are expected to open in early 1997. A
 heavy backlog of labor cases continues to clog the courts due to inefficiency and lack
 of resources. There is only spotty enforcement of the Labor Code, due to the scarcity
 of labor inspectors, corruption, the lack of adequate training and resources, and
 structural weaknesses in the labor court system. Nonetheless, enforcement is im-
 proving as new labor inspectors complete training and begin work outside the cap-
 ital, allowing the Ministry of Labor to increase significantly its rate of inspections.
 The Ministry continued a series of inspections (initiated by the previous administra-
 tion) at farms and plantations in rural areas, especially in Alta and Baja Verapaz,
 and cited those employers who were not paying the minimum wage. The number
 of ranches in these regions paying below minimum wage dropped from 42.6 percent
 of the total number inspected to 13.9 percent after the completion of the program.
 The Ministry of Labor reorganized the Labor Inspector Corps to permit some com-
 plaints to be heard at the Ministry of Labor rather than requiring that inspectors
 travel to each work site. The Ministry increased the number of court cases filed for
 failure to comply with the Labor Code and has begun an educational campaign on
 worker rights (especially the rights of minors and women workers), including pro-
 viding some documents in indigenous languages. In an effort to improve enforce-
 ment of the Labor Code outside the capital, the Ministry of Labor began an effort
 to decentralize its operations, beginning by opening a branch office in Coban, Alta
 Verapaz.
 
 
 467
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones (EPZ's). The laws governing EPZ's are not discriminatory on
 the subject of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. While union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and their unofficially restricted access to the EPZ's
 for their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones, labor conditions in the
 EPZ's are no different from those found outside the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. The Government repealed an old
 law that called for forced labor in prisons.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution bars employment
 of minors under the age of 14 without written permission from the Ministry of
 Labor. However, children below this age are regularly employed. The laws prohibit
 minors from night work, extra hours (the legal workday for minors under the age
 of 14 is 6 hours; for minors 14 to 17 years of age, 7 hours), and from working in
 establishments where alcoholic beverages are served or in unhealthy or dangerous
 conditions. Laws governing the employment of minors are not effectively enforced,
 due to the shortage of qualified labor inspectors and structural weaknesses in the
 labor court system. While only 5,000 minors have permission from the Labor Min-
 istry to work legally, thousands of others working without legal permission are open
 to exploitation, generally receiving no social benefits, social insurance, vacations, or
 severance pay, and below minimum salaries.
 The Labor Ministry has a program to educate minors, their parents, and employ-
 ers on the rights of minors in the labor market. Economic necessity, however, forces
 most families to have their children seek some type of employment to supplement
 family income. There are no export industries in which child labor is a significant
 factor. Child labor is largely confined to small or family enterprises, to agricultural
 work, and to the informal sectors of the economy.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the age
 of 12 or to the sixth grade. However, less than half the population actually receives
 a primary education. Children in rural and indigenous areas are less likely to com-
 plete primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although the law sets minimum wages, the le-
 gally mandated minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is not
 always paid. A bilateral committee representing labor and management in specific
 economic sectors is named each year to make recommendations for increases in the
 minimum wage. In the event that agreement is not possible, the Government may
 decree such increases. The minimum wage was raised by 10 percent in December
 1995, effective January 2, 1996. The new rate is $2.93 (17.60 quetzales) for indus-
 trial workers for an 8-hour workday, including a required hourly bonus, and is $2.66
 (15.95 quetzales) per day plus mandatory productivity bonuses for agricultural
 workers. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide even a minimum standard
 of living for a worker with a family. According to the U.N. Development Program,
 an estimated 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, including ap-
 proximately 60 percent of those employed.
 The legal workday is 8 hours, and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor Code
 requires a weekly paid rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders and
 human rights groups charge that workers are sometimes forced to work overtime,
 often without premium pay, in order to meet work requirements. Labor inspectors
 report that numerous instances were uncovered of such abuses, but lack of stiff fines
 or strong regulatory sanctions, as well as inefficiencies in the labor court system,
 inhibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the Labor Law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also inadequate. Work-
 ers have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations,
 and the law provides them with protection for their continued employment. How-
 ever, few workers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about unsafe
 working conditions. When serious or fatal industrial accidents do occur, the authori-
 ties generally take no legal steps against those responsible. The Labor Ministry pro-
 vides training courses for labor inspectors in health and safety standards but does
 not accord them a high priority due to scarce resources. The Government does not
 effectively enforce legislation requiring companies with more than 50 employees to
 provide on-site medical facilities for their workers, although most large employers
 do provide such facilities.
