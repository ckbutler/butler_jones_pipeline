 GUINEA
 The People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea is a one-party
 "socialist' state that has been ruled by President Ahmed Sekou
 Toure since independence was declared in 1958. The state is
 controlled by the Democratic Party of Guinea which is directed
 by the President as Secretary General. No opposition parties are
 tolerated.
 During the 1960's and 1970's the Government arrested and impris-
 oned many Guineans; some prisoners were condemned and executed.
 Many others simply *disappeared". In the late 1970's the Govern-
 ment began to relax controls on many aspects of Guinea's polit-
 ical, economic,--and social life as a result of public expressions
 of discontent with some of the Government's economic and other
 policies. A general amnesty of all Guinean exiles was declared
 in July 1977 and thousands of emigrants returned to Guinea.
 Internal security controls were partially relaxed, and interna-
 tional movement of goods and people was eased. Indications are
 that the number of political prisoners has been considerably
 reduced over the past several years. There were no reports of
 political detentions during 1983, and many nonpolitical prisoners
 have been pardoned since December 1982.
 Guinea is a resource-rich, but economically underdeveloped
 country. Its agricultural sector, which produces mostly at
 subsistence levels, provides livelihood for over 60 percent of
 the population and contributes 40 percent of the gross domestic
 product. The modern sector consists of a few mining enclaves,
 which generate nearly all of Guinea's foreign exchange, and a
 variety of state-owned industrial, agro-industrial and commercial
 enterprises. At independence in 1958 the Government implemented
 state ownership of the means of production and centralized eco-
 nomic decision making. Private export agriculture was replaced
 with agricultural collectives. Guinea opted not to join the
 French-backed West African Monetary Union in 1960, establishing
 its own central bank and currency. Strict foreign'exchange
 controls were imposed and the currency made inconvertible.
 State ownership of the means of production and agriculture
 resulted in uneconomic state-owned institutions and declining
 agricultural production. Large investments in the public sector
 contributed to inflation and balance of payments difficulties.
 As it began to relax political and security controls, the Govern-
 ment also undertook cautious steps toward economic reform. It
 has opened private retail and wholesale trade for some agricul-
 tural products, developed an investment code, decentralized some
 state holding companies, and established a secretariat of small
 and medium-sized industries.
 In regard to property ownership, the Guinean Constitution
 stipulates that legal title to all land belongs to the state.
 Individuals are allowed to lease land from the state and are
 obliged to improve the property by cultivation or construction.
 They are also allowed to sublet land under conditions estab-
 lished by the Government.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 During 1983 there were no reported instances of politically-
 motivated killings in Guinea.
 
 
 158
 b. Disappearance
 While the Government has not accounted for the more than 2,000
 disappearances of the mid-1970's, there were no reported
 instances of disappearance in Guinea during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The only form of abuse reported during 1983 was the beating of
 suspects at police stations after arrest. Prison conditions in
 Guinea are generally poor. Except for those held in solitary con-
 finement, prisoners are permitted to receive food from family and
 friends. There is no evidence that prisoners are treated
 differently on the basis of social class, tribe, sex, or religion.
 Certain categories of prisoners are allowed to leave prison during
 the day on work assignments. Pardons are increasingly being
 granted, with 46 granted between August 1981 and August 1982 and
 455 reported between August 1982 and June 1983.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Procedures for organization and operation of the judicial
 system in cases involving civil, commercial, or criminal
 matters are governed by a June 1, 1982 law. A person detained
 on such charges must be interrogated within 24 hours by the
 President of the People's Tribunal and either placed under
 arrest or freed. Once arrested, the interval during which the
 prisoner must be brought to trial varies from 48 hours at the
 arrondissement level to one month at the regional level depend-
 ing on the seriousness of the case and whether it involves
 civil, commercial, or criminal matters. It is understood that
 practice regulations are not always followed, but even general
 estimates of frequency of abuse or number of political detainees
 are impossible to obtain.
 Transgressors against "internal and external" security of the
 "state and constitution" come under the jurisdiction of a
 Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal, which operates under special
 rules.  In past practice, such persons have been detained with-
 out a judicial determination of the legality of detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Trial
 Guinean People's Tribunals are established at the four levels of
 Government:   local (village), arrondissement, regional, and na-
 tional. Local courts are essentially traditional courts with
 jurisdiction over civil matters only. Arrondissement and re-
 gional tribunals have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal
 matters. Courts of appeal exist at the regional and national
 levels.
 The independence of the judicial system is limited; it is politi-
 cized with party officials participating as judges and tribunal
 members at all levels. In principle, most defendants may choose
 an attorney from a roster of government lawyers; private practice
 of law is not allowed. Those accused of crimes against the
 security of the state have been required to defend themselves
 without benefit of counsel and without being aware of the charges
 or evidence against them. The last such trials known to have
 taken place were in 1976. Since then, there have been no
 reported trials of people accused of crimes against the state, and
 
 
 159
 if there are any political prisoners, the number is not known.
 International organizations estimate from 600,000 to two million
 Guineans have left their country since independence in 1958.   It
 is generally agreed that the constant deterioration in the econ-
 omy was a major motivation in the flight into exile of most
 Guineans. However, there were many for whom objections to the
 governing party's policies and fear of imprisonment or execution
 were the major causes of flight. Those who fled Guinea in fear
 of government reprisal were primarily former soldiers, who had
 served in French military units before independence, and intel-
 lectuals. There have been no reports of significant numbers of
 people going into exile in recent years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Party-state organizations exist at all levels of government, and
 Guineans are expected to participate in party activities. Par-
 ticipation is judged by the taking of attendance at party
 meetings and major activities. While there are no reports of
 penalties imposed for non-participation in party activities, it
 appears that most Guineans working for governmental organization
 participate regularly. Schools from primary grades through high
 school are called "Centers of Revolutionary Education," a name
 itself connoting the degree to which the Government equates
 education with civic and moral formation. Through membership in
 the "young pioneers", participation in various civic and party
 demonstrations, as well as classrocm instruction, Guinean students
 receive a sort of "citizenship training" based on the writings and
 declarations of President Toure. The latter have a heavy moral as
 well as a purely political component--one of the principal tenets
 being social responsibility. A function and result of this ideo-
 logical or citizenship formation is an unusual degree of "student
 government" whereby "commissaires de classes" assume such respon-
 sibilities as maintaining order and taking roll. They perform
 these tasks as marks of conscientiousness toward both school and
 party. University graduates are required to take a post graduate
 seminar in party ideology conducted by senior members of the
 party. There is no interference in family matters or in the use
 of indigenous languages.
 Although censorship of international mail exists, it is not known
 to what extent internal correspondence is censored. It is gener-
 ally believed some monitoring of telephone conversations takes
 place. Police may enter homes without warrants to pursue sus-
 pects or obtain evidence, but it is not possible to determine
 how frequently this practice actually occurs. Most surveillance
 appears aimed at controlling both fraudulent or criminal commer-
 cial activity, (e.g., illegal currency exchange), and curbing
 undesired political activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government and party own and operate all Guinean media; crit-
 icism of the Government rarely appears, and only if officially
 sanctioned. While no formal reporting guidelines exist, Guinean
 journalists generally confine their reporting to accounts of
 government activities and development issues. Foreign books,
 newspapers, and journals are not available in Guinea, with some
 few exceptions, and are subject to censorship. A National Book
 
 
 160
 Committee determines those books and reviews by Guineans that may
 be published.
 Speech appears to be the least hampered mode of expression.
 Government officials, including the President, operate with doors
 open and maintain close contact with the population through the
 all-pervasive party structure through which they try to build
 consensus on national issues. This system accommodates only a
 limited degree of dissent and opposition.
 Academic freedom is limited, and all research is government-
 controlled. History and ideology of the party are standard
 elements of the curriculum for all students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution allows freedom of assembly and
 association, public meetings are largely organized under the
 auspices of the party-state. No meetings by opposition groups
 are allowed.
 All Guinean workers in state enterprises, mixed, and private
 companies are required to join the party state controlled labor
 unions, as are workers in enterprises with more than 50 employees.
 Worker committees oversee employee-management relations, settle
 employee disputes, hear grievances, and serve as a link with
 local party organizations. Although the Constitution ensures the
 right to strike, in practice there have been no strikes since
 1961. The local committees are linked to 35 regional unions
 which, together with 14 professional unions (representing
 teachers, doctors, and engineers among others), belong to the
 party-controlled National Confederation of Workers. Union
 leaders are elected from a slate, drawn up by the party. Only
 one slate is presented to Union members; non-party-endorsed
 candidates are not permitted.
 The national union is affiliated with the following international
 bodies: International Labor Organization; Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity; General Union of Workers of Black Africa;
 World Federation of Trade Unions. Guinea regularly sends labor
 officials to the annual conference of Soviet trade unions. In
 1982, the Guinean union established relations with the AFL-CIO's
 Afro-American Labor Center.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Islam is not the official religion of the state, there
 is a Ministry of Islamic Affairs. The majority of Guineans are
 Muslim and enjoy benefits that may not be available to adherents
 of other religions, such as annual, governmentally-organized pil-
 grimages to Mecca. However, care is taken to avoid appearances
 of favoritism with Christian holidays and ceremonies being re-
 ported in the national media. All religions have the right to
 establish places of worship and maintain links with coreligion-
 ists in other countries. A provision of the Constitution that
 everyone has the right to elect and be elected regardless of race,
 sex, and religion is honored in practice; adherents of all
 religions are found at various levels of Government and public
 life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 
 
 161
 Freedom of movement within the country exists in Guinea, but all
 citizens are required to carry identity cards. Documents are
 often required for internal travel by foreigners, but are readily
 obtainable and do not present unreasonable difficulties. Families
 and ethnic groups are frequently located across national borders,
 and substantial movement back and forth has been permitted and
 observed in recent years. Legal entry into and exit from the
 country remains subject to controls, but enforcement is relaxed
 except for a small number of individuals who, in the Government's
 view, might pose security threats to the state. Foreign travel is
 inhibited by the lack of foreign exchange.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:    The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 According to the Constitution, the party controls the People's
 Revolutionary Republic of Guinea. However, President Ahmed Sekou
 Toure controls both the state and party as President of the former
 and Secretary General of the latter. He was first chosen as
 President by the National Assembly in 1958 and chosen in January
 1961 in the first siingle-party election held after independence.
 Although he has always been the only candidate on the ballot, and
 there have been no elections in the democratic sense, Tours was
 "reelected" in 1968, 1975, and May 1982.
 Elections for the National Assembly, which exercises no meaningful
 separate power, also are from a single slate of candidates
 selected by the party's regional organs, the Party's National
 Political Bureau and Women's, Youth, and Labor Organizations.
 The party-state has parallel party and administrative organiza-
 tions at all four levels of government. It is difficult for an
 individual to avoid taking part in the party-controlled political
 activity that guides most aspects of national life.
 The political role of women in Guinea matches the significant
 influence and power which they enjoy in economic life. Women
 traditionally have been a large, articulate, and faithful polit-
 ical group in President Toure's power base, and on occasion have
 evinced the will and capability to influence policy, most notably
 in the 1977 demonstrations against some restrictive economic
 policies of the Government. Women are represented at both the
 ministerial and counselor levels of government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The last visit to Guinea by an organization investigating human
 rights practices was made by representatives of Amnesty Inter-
 national's London office in December 1981. Amnesty's report on
 that visit, released in October 1982, noted that detention without
 trial of suspected political opponents of the Government, forcible
 repatriation of refugees, ill treatment of detainees, and poor
 prison conditions were discussed during the visit. In January
 1983 the U.S. office of Amnesty International launched a campaign
 through newspaper advertising to mobilize public opinion on human
 rights conditions in Guinea. All cases cited in the trip report,
 the advertising, and in Amnesty's 1983 report concerned those
 arrested in the early and mid-1970's, who never reappeared again
 and are presumed to have been killed.
 
 
 162
 After the release of the 1982 Amnesty report, the President
 repeated his arguments that persons imprisoned in the mid-1970's
 are traitors and enemies of the people rather than political
 prisoners. Guinea's Honorary Consul to Great Britain presented
 the same argument during an interview in May 1983. Following
 Amnesty's December 1981 visit to Conakry, the President
 announced his willingness to allow another international inquiry
 into human rights violations in Guinea. None, however, has yet
 taken place. Amnesty International's main concerns during 1983
 were the continuing refusal of toe authorities to provide infor-
 mation about the fate of some 2,900 "disappeared" prisoners,
 political opponents of the Government and poor prison conditions.
 Freedom House rates Guinea "not free."
 There are no official or nongovernmental internal human rights
 organizations in Guinea, and the Government does not play a human
 rights role in international bodies.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea's per capita gross national product was $298 in 1981.
 This figure does not reflect the fact that only about 150,000
 Guineans, approximately one-third of the 440,000 employed in the
 industry and services sector, are registered wage earners. The
 remainder are private sector artisans and traders, who either sell
 their goods for sylis (local currency) at the unofficial rate of
 exchange or trade them for foodstuffs and consumer goods on the
 parallel market. Registered wage earners (employees of state
 enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and civil servants) are
 allowed to purchase essential foodstuffs (rice, cooking oil,
 flour, sugar, meat, and fish) at heavily subsidized prices. The
 rural sector, which comprises most of Guinea's population, is
 essentially outside the national money economy and is largely
 self-sufficient in foodstuffs.
 The liberalization of private commerce, begun in the late 1970's,
 has brought more foodstuffs and consumer goods into the parallel
 market, which the Government tolerates. In recent years, it has
 authorized private imports of certain consumer items and has in-
 creased official imports of foodstuffs.
 Agricultural development is one of Guinea's major goals. The
 Government has devoted the largest share (26 percent) of the
 latest five-year-plan budget to the agropastoral sector, but
 agricultural development and food production continue to lag. In
 1977 the calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirement was 84 percent. The chief impediments to
 increased productivity are lack of improved technology, price in-
 centives, and government credit to small farmers. Life expectancy
 at birth rose from 38.5 years in 1968 to 44 in 1982. The infant
 mortality rate declined slightly from 165 per 1,000 in 1980 to
 157.9 in 1983, but is still relatively high compared with earlier
 years (141 per 1,000 in 1968). Low nutrition standards and
 sanitary conditions prevailing throughout most of the country are
 largely responsible for infant mortality. The overall population
 growth rate reportedly declined from 2.9 percent in 1980 to 2.7
 percent in 1983. About 44 percent of the urban population has
 access to a safe water supply, but this drops to'2.5 percent for
 the rural population. The Government has a nationwide program for
 improving the rural population's access to safe water. With the
 assistance of outside donors, the Government has begun construc-
 tion of wells, springs, and canals in the Fouta DJallon and
 
 
 163
 Kankan regions. Its ultimate goal is to provide safe water
 within a reasonable distance from each village in the country.
 Education is free and universal. National languages are the
 medium of instruction in primary schools. In recent years
 Koranic schools are said to be gaining popularity. From
 primary to university level, facilities are generally poor, with
 textbooks seldom available. Teaching as a profession is avoided,
 as it offers few perquisites. Total enrollment at primary,
 secondary, and higher education levels was estimated to be 450,000
 in 1981 as compared with 45,000 in 1958.
 Educational policy is oriented toward national development
 and the acquisition of practical skills. Manpower needs are
 determined by the Ministry of Labor, and progress through the
 educational system is controlled by a series of competitive
 examinations. Those obtaining diplomas (equivalent to an American
 Masters Degree) are ranked according to their academic work and
 performances at a militia camp for graduates and at a national
 ideological seminar conducted by the President. Both the militia
 camp course and attendance at the seminar are compulsory for all
 graduates.
 In addition to the three-level educational system, the Government
 sponsors an adult literacy program in industrial and agroin-
 dustrial installations and adult education courses by radio.
 Guinean officials report about 20 percent of the population is
 literate in French and about 48 percent in one or more of the
 Guinean languages.
 Apart from the three ministries concerned with primary, technical,
 and higher education, the women's, youth, and labor wings of the
 Democratic Party of Guinea assume certain educational tasks such
 as organizing literacy classes and providing civic education.
 They are also instruments for combatting vestiges of Guinea's
 caste system, tribalism, and sexual inequality.
 Women in Guinea have long enjoyed a special status as a result of
 the important political role they played prior to independence.
 Guinean women are represented in all professions from civil
 engineering to the national police and militia. The majority of
 students enrolled in the national medical college are women.
 The Government has enlightened health-care policies which stress
 prevention and child and mother care. The level of medical care
 actually available is often low, largely owing to inadequate
 facilities and medical supplies. There are organized campaigns
 of preschool vaccinations for children and a system of widely
 dispersed dispensaries and hospitals.
