 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen was proclaimed in 1990 following the unification of the
 former Yemen Arab Republic, or North Yemen, and the People's Democratic Repub-
 lic of Yemen, or South Yemen. After a transition period of several years, a "unity"
 crisis ensued, and in May 1994 civil war broke out, during which the southernpart
 tried to secede. Following the northern-led victory in July of that year, most of the
 secessionist leadership fled abroad where they remain. Later in 1994 a new postwar
 governing coalition was formed, composed of the General People's Congress (GPC)
 and the Yemeni Grouping for Reform (Islaah). The Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP),
 formerly the main party of the south and a previous coalition partner, is now a frac-
 tured opposition party.
 Lieutenant General Ali Abdullah Salih is the President and leader of -the GPC.
 He was elected in 1994 to a 5-year term by the legislature. However, the Constitu-
 tion provides that henceforth the President will be elected by popular vote from at
 least two candidates selected by the legislature. The 301-seat House of Representa-
 tives was elected in 1993-the first multiparty Parliament elected by popular vote
 and universal suffrage. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for April
 1997. The Parliament is not yet an effective counterweight to executive authority;
 real political power rests with a few leaders, particularly the President.
 The primary state security apparatus is the Political Security Organization (PSO)
 which reports directly to the President. It is independent of the Ministry of Interior.
 The Criminal Investigative Department (CID) of the police conducts most criminal
 investigations and makes most arrests. The Central Security Organization (CSO),
 a part of the Ministry of Interior, maintains a paramilitary force.
 Yemen is a poor country with an emerging market-based economy that is impeded
 by excessive government regulation and by corruption. Oil is the primary source of
 foreign exchange, but remittances from some 500,000 Yemenis working abroad (pri-
 mari~" in Saudi Arabia) are also important. Remittances were sharply reduced ater
 Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states expelled up to 850,000 Yemeni workers during
 the Gulf War because of the Government's pro-Iraq position. The Gulf states also
 suspended most assistance programs, and much Western aid was reduced.
 The general human rights situation improved slightly in 1995, although continu-
 ing problems include arbitrary arrest and detention, especially of those regarded as
 "separatists"; inf-ingements on the freedom of the press; and widespread discrimina-
 tion based on sex, race, disability, and to a lesser extent, religion. A noted intellec-
 
 
 1281
 tual and journalist, Abu Bakr AI-Saqqaf, was briefly abducted and beaten on two
 occasions by suspected government agents. PSO officers have broad discretion over
 perceived national security issues and, despite constitutional constraints, routinely
 detain citizens for questioning, sometimes mistreat detainees, monitor their activi-
 ties, and search their homes. Prison conditions are poor. There are significant limi-
 tations on citizens' ability to effect political change. Female genital mutilation is
 practiced to an undetermined extent by some families of African origin; it is not pro-
 hibited by the authorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rllling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Security forces continue to arrest and detain citizens for vary-
 ing periods of time without charge or notification to concerned families. Many de-
 tainees are associated with the YSP and accused of being "separatists." Most such
 disappearances are temporary, and detainees are released within months.
 Hundxeds of cases of disappearances dating since the 1970's, implicating the
 former governments of both north and south Yemen, remain unresolved. In October
 the bodies of several high-ranking officials in the South Yemen Government were
 discovered in Aden. The officials were apparently killed in 1986 during a surge of
 civil strife in Aden and had since been listed as missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution is ambiguous on its prohibition of cruel or inhuman punishment.
 It states that the Government may not impose "illegal" punishments-a formulation
 that could be interpreted as permitting amputations according to Islamic law, or
 Shari'a. Moreover, another article in the Constitution asserts that Shari'a "is the
 source of all legislation." There were no reports of amputations. However, in June
 a judge sentenced a convicted murderer to multiple amputations and death by cru-
 cifixion; that sentence was later changed by the Higher Judiciary Council, which re-
 views deaths sentences, to death by beheading.
 Abu Bakr Al-Saqqaf, a 61-year-old university professor and journalist, was briefly
 kidnaped and beaten on two occasions, in January and December, by persons sus-
 pected of being government agents. A1-Saqqaf has periodically written articles criti-
 cizing the Government's policy toward the former South Yemen, which he as de-
 scribed as "internal colonialism.* In the second abduction, A1-Saqqaf was thrown
 into a car near his home in Sanaa by two identified men whom he later said beat
 him with sticks and an electric prod. According to Al-Saqqafs account, the assail-
 ants shouted at him to stop writing as they beat him. Photos of A1-Saqqafs battered
 face and torso appeared in a December issue of the English-language Yemen Times
 (also see Section 2.a.). The Government claims to be investigating the second abduc-
 tion, but no suspects have been charged.
 The Government tightly controls access to detention facilities. Nonetheless, it per-
 mits most impartial observers to visit prisoners and detainees. Although there is no
 evidence of the use of torture in detention facilities, arresting authorities are known
 to use force during interrogations, especially of those arrested for violent crimes.
 There were no reports of torture of persons arrested for political offenses. Authori-
 ties still use leg-irons and shackles, and flogging is still occasionally inflicted as
 punishment for minor crimes.
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards.
 Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions poor, and food and health care inad-
 equate. Inmates must depend on relatives for food and medicine. Prison authorities
 and guards often exact money from prisoners and even refuse to release prisoners
 until family members pay a bribe. Conditions are equally bad in women's prisons,
 where children are likely to be incarcerated along with their mothers. There have
 been reports that some female prisoners have been raped by prison guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to the law, detainees must be
 arraigned within 24 hours of arrest or released. The judge or prosecuting attorney
 must inform the accused of the basis for the arrest and decide whether detention
 is required. In no case may a detainee be held longer than 7 days without a court
 order. Despite these constitutional and other legal provisions, arbitrary arrest and
 prolonged detention without charge are common practices.
 Detainees have the right to inform their families of their arrests and may decline
 to answer questions without an attorney present. There are also provisions for bail.
 In practice, many authorities respect these rights only if bribed.
 
 
 1282
 In cases where a criminal suspect is at large, security forces sometimes detain a
 relative while the suspect is being sought. The detention may continue while the
 concerned families negotiate compensation for the alleged wrongdoing.
 The Government has failed to ensure that detainees and prisoners are incarcer-
 ated in authorized detention facilities. The Ministry of Interior reportedly operates
 extrajudicial detention facilities. Unauthorized prisons also exist in "tribal' areas,
 where the Central Government has limited authority. Some detainees are reportedly
 held in an undetermined number of unauthorized prisons.
 Thousands of people have been imprisoned for years without documentation con-
 cerning their trials or sentences. In an attempl to redress this problem, the Commit-
 tee to Investigate the Truth, under the leadership of the head of the Yemeni Human
 Rights Organization, and with the cooperation of the Ministry of Interior, has begun
 investigating individual complaints ofwrongful imprisonment. The Committee has
 the authority to order the release of individuals imprisoned illegally, i.e., without
 chage or trial.
 Approximately 100 to 200 military officers, suspected of having separatist sym-
 pathies, were imprisoned following the 1994 civil war. All but about a dozen senior
 commanders have been released.
 At the end of the civil war, the President pardoned nearly all who fought against
 the Central Government, including military personnel and most leaders of the un-
 recognized, secessionist Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY). The Government de-
 nied this amnesty to only the 16 most senior leaders of the DRY, who fled abroad.
 Although they were technically not forced into exile, they are subject to arrest if
 they return. The Government is negotiating with several of the 16 for their eventual
 return without trial.
 Some tribes, seeking to bring their concerns to the attention of the Government,
 kidnap and hold hostages. Some victims have been foreign workers or tourists. For-
 eign victims are rarely injured. The authorities have succeeded in obtaining the fair-
 ly quick release of foreign hostages.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Troal.-nThe  (udiciary is not fully independent, even
 though the Constitution provides for an autonomous" judiciary and "independent
 judges." Many litigants maintain that a judge's social ties and susceptibility to brib-
 ery sometimes have greater influence on the verdict than the law or facts of the
 case. Others maiain that judges appointed since mid-1994 are poorly trained, and
 that those closely associated with the Government often render decisions favorable
 to it.
 Ther   ere rtwo types of courts: Islamic law or Sari'a courts, which try criminal
 cases and adjudicate civil disputes (such as divorce and inheritance cases), and com-
 merial courts. There are no jury trials under Shari'a. Criminal cases are adju-
 dicated by a judge who plays an active role in questioning witnesses and the ac-
 cused. Defense attorneys are allowed to counsel their clients, address the court and
 examine witnesses. Defendants, including those in commerical courts, have the right
 to appeal their sentences. Trials are public. However, both Shari'a and commercial
 courts may conduct closed sessions  or reasons of public security or morals." For-
 eis itigants in commercial disputes have complained of biased rulings.
 Female judges who worked in the south prior to the civil war have been
 reappointed to positions. There are no female judges in the north.
 There were no reports of plitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions against government interferene with privacy, security
 forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal
 mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such
 activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial rspe.sion. Se-
 curity forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and have interfered with the
 telephone service of government criis and opponents.
 Seciion 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Spch and Press.-hThe Constitution restricts the freedom of speech
 and press "within the limits of the law." Although many citizens are uninhibited in
 their discussions of domestic and foreign policies, some are cautious, believing that
 theyr may be harassed for publicly expressed criticisms of the Government.
 From 1990 until mid-194, there was relative freedom of the press in Yemen. Dur-
 ing the 1994 civil war, the Government closed papers affiliated with the YSP, the
 main party in southern Yemen, for expressing separatist views. Wartime difficulties
 restricted the production of many other papers. After the war, the Government al-
 lowed some YSP-affiliated publications to resume publishing.
 The Ministry of Information influences the media by its ownership of the printing
 presses, subsidies to certain newspapers, and its ownership of the television and
 
 
 1283
 
 radio companies. The Government selects the items to be covered in news broad-
 casts, and does not permit reporting critical of the Government. Even televised de-
 bates in the Parliament are edited to delete the most biting commentary on the Gov-
 ernment.
 Although newspapers are allowed to criticize the Government, journalists some-
 times censor themselves, especially when writing on such sensitive issues as the
 1994 civil war, relations with Saudi Arabia, or government corruption. The penalties
 for exceeding these self-imposed limits can be arrest for slander or libel, dismissal
 from employment, or extralegal harassment. The Ministry of Information has taken
 most opposition newspapers to court at least once in the last year. Most of these
 cases are perceived to be a form of harassment.
 From January to A ril, the Government suspended publication of the independ-
 ent, Aden-based weekfy AI-Ayyam for publishing articles critical of government poli-
 cies in the south. Abu Bakr Al-Saqqaf, a writer of one of these articles, was -itd-
 naped by suspected government agents (see Section l.c.). At year's end, the paper
 was allowed to publish only in Sanaa. The writer was dismissed from his position
 at the University of San-a, but was later reinstated by a court order.
 In July Al-Shura, an outspoken opposition newspaper affiliated with the Union
 of Popular Forces, was suspended from publication by the Minister of Legal Affairs
 as part of a larger ruling involving the party (see Section 3).
 The independent English-language weekly, the Yemen Times, has frequently criti-
 cized the Government. The management has been periodically subjected to anony-
 mous threats of violence, and government authorities have interfered with the pa-
 per's operations.
 On several occasions, the Ministry of Information prohibited the publication of the
 Nasserist paper, Al-Wahdawi, and has brought several court cases against the
 paper. The Ministry has also been involved in legal disputes with the YSP-owned
 newspaper, A-Thawri, since the end of the civil war. Several southern journalists
 have :en arrested in the past year for writings related to the civil war as well as
 for alleged secessionist sympathies.
 Customs officials confiscate foreign publications regarded as pornographic or ob-
 jectionable because of religious or political content. The Ministry of Information has
 periodically prevented the distribution of certain issues of A-Hayat, the Arabic
 internationaldaily, and other periodicals which report on sensitive policy issues.
 Academic freedom is impinged by the presence of security officials on university
 campuses and at most intellectual forums. Government informers monitor the ac-
 tivities of professors and students. The authorities review prospective university
 professors and administrators for their political acceptability before they are bired.
 During the year, the Government leaked a list of professors from Sanaa University
 who were to be dismissed on political grounds, but at year's end took no steps to
 prevent them from teaching.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--Citizens exercise their right to
 demonstrate peacefully. Associations must obtain an operating license from the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs, a usually routine matter.
 In July security forces dispersed a convention of the Union of Popular Forces,
 headed by Ibrahim A-Wazir. The Government claims that the Union of Popular
 Forces is not a legal party and that the convention was an illegal gathering. It
 banned the party's newspaper, Al-Shura.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and there are restrictions on
 the practice of other religions. Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either of the Zaydi
 branch of Shi'a Islam or the Shafe'ei branch of Sunni Islam. There are also some
 Ismailis in the north. Private Islamic organizations may maintain ties to pan-Is-
 lamic organizations and operate schools, but the Government monitors their activi-
 ties.
 Most of the once sizable Jewish population has emigrated; fewer than 500 remain.
 Jewish religious services are held in private homes. Previous restrictions on Jews
 obtaining passports and having contact with foreign Jewish groups have been abol-
 ished.
 Most Christians are foreign residents, except for a few families of Indian origin
 in Aden. There are several churches and Hindu temples in Aden, but no non-Muslim
 places of worship in the former north Yemen. Church services are regularly held.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not obstruct domestic travel, although the army
 and security forces maintain checkpoints on major roads. Likewise, the overnment
 does not obstruct foreign travel or the right to emigrate and return. In recent years,
 it has removed bureaucratic obstacles that prevented most Jews from traveling
 abroad. Women must obtain permission from a male relative before applying for a
 passport. The Constitution prohibits the extradition of a citizen to any country.
 
 
 1284
 
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) in assisting refugees arriving from east Africa. During the year, the
 Government reportedly deported several hundred Somali refugees back to Somalia.
 The practice was discontinued after the intervention of the UNHCR and the diplo-
 matic community.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 International observers judged as generally free and fair the last parliamentary
 election which was held in 1993. Although the Government is accountable to the
 Parliament, there are significant limitations on the ability of the people to effect po-
 litical change. To date, the Parliament is not an effective counterweight to executive
 authority; it does little more than debate issues. Decisionmaking and real political
 power still rests in the hands of relatively few leaders, particularly the President.
 The President has the authority to introduce legislation and promulgate laws by
 decree when Parliament is not in session. Decrees must be approved by Parliament
 30 days after reconvening. In theory, if a decree is not approved, it does not become
 law; in practice, a decree remains in effect even if not approved. The President ap-
 points the Prime Minister, who forms the Government. The Cabinet comprises 24
 ministers, with the majority of ministers presently coming from the GPC and the
 remainder from Islaah.
 In some governorates, tribal leaders retain considerable discretion in the interpre-
 tation and enforcement of the law. Central government authority in these areas is
 often weak.
 There is a functioning multiparty system. All parties must be registered in accord-
 ance with the Political Parties Law of 1991, which stipulates that each party must
 have 75 founders and 2,500 members. This law had not been enforced until Septem-
 ber when the President decreed that the law would be implemented by the end of
 the year. Strict enforcement may have the effect of severely reducing the number
 of small parties.
 The Constitution prohibits the establishment of parties that are contrary to Islam,
 or oppose the goals of the Yemeni revolution, or violate Yemen's international com-
 mitments. The Government provides financial support to all parties represented in
 Parliament. The parties are permitted to publish their own newspapers.
 Although women may vote and hold office, these rights are limited by cultural and
 religious customs. Only 2 women have been elected to the 301-member Parliament,
 and few hold senior leadership positions in the Government or political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Yemeni Human Rights Organization (YHRO) is the best known local non-
 governmental human rights group. It is headquartered in Sanaa with branches in
 seven other cities. The Government does not overtly restrict its activities and is co-
 operating with it to release prisoners in prolonged detention without trial.
 Another group, the Yemeni Organization for the Defense of Liberties and Human
 Rights, is based in Aden. After the 1994 civil war, the Government dissolved it be-
 cause it was purportedly regarded as a "separatist" organization. It has resumed op-
 eration and issued a report on the 1994 civil war and human rights. There is a
 Human Rights Committee in Parliament, which does little of significance.
 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch observe Yemen closely. There
 is an International Committee of the Red Cross representative resident in Yemen.
 The Government has given these groups relatively broad access to government offi-
 cials, records, refugee camps, and prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Prior to 1994, the Constitution stated that "no discrimination shall be practiced
 due to sex, color, racial origin, language, occupation, social status, or religious be-
 liefs." However, as amended in 1994, the Constitution now states that "all citizens
 are equal in general rights and duties. . ." The change has been interpreted as an
 attempt to weaken previous constitutional guarantees of equality, especially for
 women.
 Women.-Although some spousal abuse occurs, it is undocumented and its inci-
 dence seems to be relatively light. In Yemen's traditional society, an abused woman
 would be expected to take her complaints to a male relative (rather than the au-
 thorities) who should intercede on her behalf or provide her short-term sanctuary
 if required.
 Women face significant restrictions imposed by law, social custom and religion.
 Men are permitted to take as many as four wives, though few do so for economic
 
 
 1285
 reasons. The practice of dowry payments is widespread, despite efforts to limit the
 size of such payments. Husbands may divorce wives without *ustifying their action
 in court. Following a divorce, the family home and children (who are older than a
 certain age) are often awarded to the husband. Women also have the right to di-
 vorce, in accordance with the precepts of Shari'a. Women seeking to travel abroad
 must obtain permission from their husbands or.fathers and are expected to be ac-
 companied by male relatives.
 Islamic law permits a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but
 no Muslim woman may marry outside of Islam. Married women do not have the
 right to confer citizenship on their foreign-born spouses; they may, however, confer
 citizenship on children born in Yemen offoreign-brn fathers.
 An estimated 80 percent of women are illiterate, compared to approximately 35
 percent of men. In general, women in the south are better educated and have had
 somewhat greater employment opportunities. Since the 1994 civil war, however, the
 number of working women in the south appears to have declined, in part due to
 the stagnant economy, but also because of increasing cultural pressure from the
 north. Nevertheless, female judges, magistrates, and prosecutors in southern
 governorates have been reappointed.
 The Government has established a women s association to promote female edu-
 cation and civic responsibilities, and a nongovernmental organization has also been
 established for the same purpose.
 Children.-While the Government has asserted its commitment to protecting chil-
 dren's rights, it lacks the resources necessary to ensure adequate health care, edu-
 cation, and welfare services for children.
 Child marriage is common, especially in rural areas. The median marrying age
 for girls is 15, but marriages at 13 are not unusual.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by some Yemenis of African origin living mainly in the coastal areas. It is not
 known to exist among the majority Zaydi and Shafe'ei populations. There is no
 available information on its extent. While some government health workers actively
 discourage the practice, the Government has not passed legislation outlawing it.
 People With Disabilities.-There are distinct social prejudices against persons
 with mental and physical disabilities. The disabled often face discrimination in edu-
 cation and employment. The Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise
 mandated accessibility for the disabled, nor provided special clinics or schools for
 them. Mentally ill patients, particularly those who commit crimes, are imprisoned
 and even shackled when there is no one else to care for them. There is a charity
 project to construct separate detention facilities for mentally disabled prisoners.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from a small but undetermined number of Christians
 and Hindus in Aden, and a few Baha'is in the north, Jews are the only indigenous
 religious minority. Their numbers have diminished dramatically due to voluntary
 emigration. Jews are traditionally restricted to living in one section of a city or vil-
 lage and are often confined to a limited choice of employment, usually farming or
 handicrafts. Jews may, and do, own real property.
 Christian clergy who minister to the foreign community (see Section 1.c.) are em-
 ployed in teaching, social services, and health care. Following the 1994 civil war,
 suspected Islamic extremists looted and vandalized Christian, Hindu, and even Is-
 lamic sites in Aden. There have also been incidents at Islamic sites in the north.
 Government forces have taken steps to ensure security at these places of worship.
 A hospital in Jibla operated by the Baptist Church has experienced occasional
 threats and harassment from local Islamic extremists who fear the hospital may be
 used to spread Christianity. Local religious extremists have reportedly harasse the
 hospital's Muslim employees. In August, in response to the hospital's request, a
 court ordered the removal from hospital property of locally-owned shops" that were
 suspected of fencing hospital supplies. Subsequently, a mob of young males marched
 on the hospital, fired shots at government security guards, and threw an explosive
 device. Security forces restored order, and community leaders later condemned the
 attack and expressed their support for the hospital and its staff.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent, called
 "Muwalladin," may face discrimination in employment and in other areas. Persons
 seeking employment at Sanaa University or admission to the military academy
 must by law demonstrate that they have two Yemeni parents. Nonetheless, many
 senior government officials, including members of Parliament and ministers, have
 only one Yemeni parent. In some cases, naturalization of the non-Yemeni parent is
 sufficient to overcome the "two-Yemeni-parent"l requirement.
 A small group believed to be descendants of ancient Ethio ian occupiers of
 Yemen, who were later enslaved, are considered the lowest social class. Known as
 
 
 1286
 the "akhdam" (servants), they live in squalor and endure persistent social discrimi-
 nation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The R*ght of Association.-In March the Parliament passed a new labor law
 to replace the preunification legislation that had governed labor relations. This law
 provides workers with the right to strike and equal labor rights for women, and it
 renews the freedom of workers to associate. The Labor Law does not stipulate a
 minimum membership for unions, nor does it limit them to a specific enterprise or
 firm. Thus, Yemenis may now associate by profession or trade.
 The Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions, affiliated with the Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions, remains the sole national umbrella organization. Observers suggest that the
 Government likely would not tolerate the establishment of an alternative labor fed-
 eration unless it believed it to be in its best interests.
 By law civil servants and public sector workers, and some categories of farm
 workers, may not join unions. Only the General Assembly of the Yemeni Confed-
 eration of Labor Unions may dissolve unions.
 No strikes occurred in 1995.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The new Labor Law provides
 workers wit the right to organize and bargain collectively. All collective bargaining
 agreements must be deposited with and reviewed by the Ministry of Labor; such
 agreements exist. Unions may negotiate wage settlements for their members and
 can resort to strikes or other actions to achieve their demands.
 The law protects employees from antiunion discrimination. Employers do not have
 the right to dismiss an employee for union activities. Employees may appeal cases
 of antiunion discrimination to the Ministry of Labor. Employees may also take a
 case to the labor courts, which are often favorably disposed toward workers espe-
 cially if the employer is a foreign company.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. There are no reports of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor is common, especially
 in rural areas. Even in urban areas, children may be observed working in stores,
 workshops, selling goods on the streets, and begging. The established minimum age
 for employment is 15 in the private sector and 18 in the public sector. By special
 permit, children age 12 to 15 may work. The Government rarely enforces these pro-
 visions, especially in rural and remote areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law sets a monthly and daily mini-
 mum wage. The minimum wage provides a worker and family with only a very mod-
 est standard of living. Inflation has substantially eroded wages during the past few
 years.
 The law specifies a 40-hour workweek with a maximum 8-hour workday, but
 many workshops and stores operate 10- to 12-hour shifts without penalty. The work-
 week for government employees is 35 hours, 6 hours per day, Saturday through
 Wednesday, and 5 hours on Thursday.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations.
 The Ministry of Labor now has the responsibility for regulating workplace health
 and safety conditions, but enforcement remains lax. Some foreign-owned companies
 implement higher health, safety, and environmental standards than required in
 Yemen.
