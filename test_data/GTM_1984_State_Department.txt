 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala continued in 1984 to be ruled by a de facto military
 government, headed by Chief of State, General Oscar Humberto
 Mejia Victores, which took significant steps during the year
 to return the country to democratic rule. Constituent
 assembly elections were held freely in 1984, and national
 elections were announced for 1985. Although both civilians
 and military officers hold cabinet-level positions and are
 delegated important responsibilities, ultimate authority
 presently rests with the military.
 Overall human rights conditions improved in 1984. The United
 Nations Special Rapporteur noted several areas of improvement
 in his report to the UN General Assembly following an August
 visit to Guatemala, citing resettlement of internally
 displaced persons, government grants of land titles to
 Indians, pardons and release of those convicted by Special
 Triounals, and a continuing good record in the area of freedom
 of speech, assembly and the press. Politically related deaths
 remained significantly below the 1981-82 levels although they
 continued to be a major problem; kidnappings and
 disappearances, however, increased. The offer of amnesty for
 those associated with the insurgency remained open all year,
 and several thousand reportedly took advantage of it. As in
 1983, there were no verified instances of massacres of
 Indians. The Government demonstrated in several ways
 increased sensitivity to human rights questions. A
 substantial number of police were either indicted for crimes
 or corruption or dismissed from the force, and the Army
 removed an officer from his command in one location in
 response to complaints from the community. There is a growing
 awareness in the military that repression and fear were
 counterproductive in the past to the goal of controlling
 insurgency. However, sporadic abuse still does occur at the
 local command level.
 The military is devoting increased priority to addressing the
 root causes of the insurgency, and this has taken much of the
 initiative from the guerrilla organizations. While a low
 intensity conflict continues, the guerrilla groups have seen
 much of their urban infrastructure dismantled and much of the
 highlands has come under control of the Government. Guerrilla
 groups still engage in deadly ambushes, but the number of such
 incidents has decreased, and the number of reported
 combat-related deaths was only one-half of 1983 levels.
 Elections for a Constituent Assembly took place on July 1. In
 tne largest turnout in Guatemalan history, over 72 percent of
 the 2.6 million registered voters participated. International
 observers characterized these elections as open and honest.
 Nine political groups won seats in the Assembly, with three
 parties (representing the right, center, and left of the
 democratic spectrum) dominating the outcome. The Assembly was
 seated on August I and is actively engaged in drafting a
 constitution, and laws regulating elections and habeas
 corpus. This task is expected to be concluded in early 1985,
 after which Chief of State Mejia has publicly stated that
 national elections will be convoked, and power handed over to
 the winners.
 Guatemala is primarily an agricultural country with a dual
 culture in which the majority indigenous population continues
 to observe traditional values. The economy has been in,,
 recession since 1980, which has adversely affected the
 
 
 542
 GUATEMALA
 Government's ability to deal as it would like with pressing
 economic and social problems.
 The Civil Defense Force totaled approximately 900,000 members
 at the end of 1984. A code of conduct was reissued to each
 member during the year and, with continued training, they have
 played a major role in the pacification process. Although
 concern had been expressed that the Civil Defense Force might
 become a factor in the political process, credible observers
 tu the Constituent Assembly elections found that this did not
 occur.
 Women were noticeably more active in the political process
 during the Constituent Assembly elections. The Roman Catholic
 Church spoke out strongly against violence during the year,
 and urged citizens to participate in the political process. A
 local group was formed seeking the return of disappeared-
 persons and has functioned openly without interference. The
 Government established a Tripartite Commission to investigate
 cases of disappearances, and invited outsiders to accompany
 the Commission on factfinding trips. A number of asylees in
 diplomatic missions were granted safe passage to leave the
 country. Press freedom was more evident; labor unions were
 more active although they were confronted with continued
 employer resistance to organizational efforts and by
 bureaucratic delays in complying with legal formalities. The
 right to private property. and to pursue private interests
 continued to be respected. Among the negative aspects of the
 year's developments were infringements of the integrity of the
 judicial process, increased numbers of disappearances, and
 continued abuses by both guerrillas and security forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1984 there were an estimated 525 civilian non-combatant
 deaths. Some were believed to be victims of the Guatemalan
 security forces, others victims of the civil defense patrols,
 and others died from the activities of the four
 Marxist-Leninist guerrilla groups. In all, approximately 993
 persons are believed to have been killed for political reasons
 or in combat, compared to an estimated 1564 persons killed
 through political violence and warfare in 1983. As in 1983,
 the level of violent deaths in Guatemala in 1984 remained
 significantly below that of 1981 and 1982: 993 violent deaths
 compared to 3,573 in 1982 and 525 civilian non-combatant
 deaths, compared to 2,240 in 1982.
 While there were fewer reports of violence and political
 deaths in the countryside, continuing a trend which began
 after the military coup in 1982, allegations of abuses against
 Guatemala's Indian population continued to be made. Most of
 the alleged incidents reported in 1984 involved individuals in
 isolated areas of the western highlands, an area of Marxist
 guerrilla activities, where Guatemalan Government forces
 continued to engage guerrillas. There were no credible
 reports of massacres during the year.
 Many of the victims of guerrilla violence were members of the
 Government's security forces, but the guerrillas also
 
 
 543
 GUATEMALA
 continued killing municipal workers, farm owners and managers,
 and other civilians. In at least six incidents reported in
 July and August in the country's Pacific slope farming area,
 ranch properties were burned or destroyed, farm workers
 abused, and several ranch owners fired upon by guerrillas.
 Two business owners were reported killed.
 In August, an insurgent group ambushed a civilian engineering
 unit of the Guatemalan military which unit was working on a
 road project in El Quichf Department. Seventeen Government
 employees were reportedly killed and more than a dozen wounded.
 Killings were also reported to have been committed by some of
 the 900,000 members of the civil defense patrols, sometimes in
 clashes between neighboring patrols or between civil defense
 members and civilians over land disputes and in personal
 vendettas. There were unsubstantiated allegations that in
 some cases military personnel turned over guerrillas or
 suspected guerrillas to civil defense patrols for summary
 execution.
 There is no evidence that the Government has consistently
 punished members of the security forces in cases of arbitrary
 deaths--although some alleged offenders have been dismissed--
 but there are reports that members of civil defense forces
 have been more severely disciplined for abuses. Late in the
 year seventeen members of one patrol were given thirty-year
 prison terms for murdering four villagers. A 14-point code of
 conduct governing standards of behavior for the civil defense
 patrols was reissued; it emphasized the social responsibility
 of the patrols.
 For many reasons, it is difficult to apportion responsibility
 for many killings. The guerrillas on occasion use the same
 weapons, tactics and uniforms as the army in an effort to
 place blame on government forces. However, the security
 forces have been charged with using the same tactic. Bodies
 frequently appear without evidence of who was responsible for
 the murders--or whether there was, in fact, any political
 motive for the killing. Such cases, in which there is much
 speculation and few facts, comprise the bulk of the killings
 in Guatemala.
 There were many examples during 1984 of the kind of violent
 incidents endemic in Guatemala, including: (A) The August 15
 murder of the son of Elder Sesam Lopez, a member of the
 Constituent Assembly. The father accused certain members of
 the national police of being responsible for the murder, and
 the Constituent Assembly passed a resolution demanding an
 investigation by the Chief of State. The police, denying any
 role, declared the murders to be the result of common crime
 and promised to bring the culprits to justice. (B) The
 discovery of 12 bodies, tentatively identified as highland
 Indians, in a clandestine grave site in October. The
 Government announced that the victims had been identified as
 members of civil defense patrols, implying that insurgent
 groups were responsible for the murders. (C) The murders, in
 late October, of two professors of the National University
 killed in separate attacks. In none of these cases has there
 been evidence that specifically links the deaths to the
 victims' political or professional activities, making it
 impossible to determine the cause or the authors of the act.
 
 
 544
 GUATEMALA
 b. Disappearance
 There was an increase in the number of kidnappings and
 disappearances in 1984. Kidnappings were believed to have
 been carried out for criminal reasons (ransom gangs and
 narcotics traffickers), for private vengeance, or for
 political reasons by various groups including Guatemalan
 security forces and the guerrillas. The security forces often
 take into custody suspects for questioning about subversive
 activities, while officially denying that they have done so.
 They almost always also deny knowledge of the whereabouts of
 the disappeared persons in response to inquiries. Some kidnap
 victims eventually reappear alive; these have included the
 Christian Democratic Party Youth leader Edgar Ren6 Villar, a
 villager from Santiago Atitlan, an evangelical minister from
 Guatemala City, the leader of a farm workers union, and
 several urban union leaders. Several groups of Indians being
 held captive by guerrilla groups in the-interior were rescued
 by government forces during the year.
 Government security forces were alleged to have been
 implicated in the October kidnapping of Domingo Ochoa, an
 affiliate of the Union of National Center (UCN) political
 party. A party spokesman accused an officer of the
 investigative branch (DIT) of the National Police of
 responsibility. The UCN spokesman linked the DIT official to
 the rival National Liberation Movement (MLN) party.
 Students and faculty at the National University of Safi Carlos
 continued to be the object of kidnappings in 1984. Some of
 these cases were attributed to government security forces
 acting against suspected leftist sympathizers or their
 supporters. A 'Group of Mutual Support,* formed in 1984 and
 comprised in large part of families of missing students, named
 at least 40 relatives as victims of disappearances during the
 year.
 While various cases have been attributed to government forces
 or political extremists of the far left or far right, the bulk
 of disappearances are in fact never definitely linked to any
 faction.
 Some disappearances are eventually found to have other
 explanations. Amanda Avilez, a court official who was
 declared in an October news headline to have been abducted,
 was reported by another newspaper of the same date as having
 been located at a hospital, the victim of an attack by a
 disgruntled citizen who was upset with a judicial decision the
 victim had made. Persons involved with the insurgency are
 known to leave the country for travel to Soviet bloc
 countries, Cuba, or Mexico, by pretending to disappear.
 Friends or relatives, uninformed of their intentions, report
 them as kidnapped or disappeared.
 Definitive statistics on the number of missing or kidnapped
 individuals are impossible to obtain. Foremost among the
 limiting factors is the accuracy of media reporting, the
 unwillingness of relatives and friends in some cases to reveal
 the occurrence, and the inability of outsiders to separate
 political from other motives. Although there is little
 consensus on causes of kidnappings, the economic downturn
 figures prominently. Guatemalan National Police statistics
 for the first six months of 1984, for 97 solved kidnap cases,
 state that 90 percent had a financial motive. Whatever the
 
 
 545
 GUATEMALA
 mix of causes, overall disappearances and kidnappings with
 possible political motivations in 1984 rose to an estimated
 425 compared to 307 for 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is considerable evidence that harsh treatment and/or
 torture is inflicted upon detained persons in Guatemala.
 Newspapers report with regularity the discovery of bodies
 showing evidence of torture. That torture occurs is beyond
 dispute, but the identity of the perpetrators can be
 determined only inferentially. Security forces, vigilante
 groups, guerrilla organizations, criminals, or private
 citizens at various times have been held responsible for these
 acts.
 In November, the Guatemalan Army rescued some 55 peasants held
 captive by the guerrillas in an insurgent training camp. The
 rescued peasants, all in poor health and suffering from
 malnutrition, were used as servants and camp workers by the
 guerrillas. Included among them were 35 children.
 Some human rights groups assert the existence of secret
 government prisons where harsh treatment occurs (most
 trequently mentioned is the basement of the old 'Escuela
 Polit~cnica'). The Government denies these allegations and,
 their accuracy has never been confirmed. In late November the
 Government announced the creation of a Tripartite Commission
 to investigate disappearances. Allegations that the
 newly-established 'model villages' are somehow equivalent to
 concentration camps are not credible, and do not accurately
 reflect the views of inhabitants or most outside observers.
 The principal government prison, Granja Penal Pavon, located
 near Guatemala City was subject to strikes and riots in 1984.
 Government officials have acknowledged that the prison
 population of some 2,100 was in excess of the facility's design
 capacity and that the budget was inadequate for the number of
 prisoners. Prison officials blamed the overcrowding on
 insufficient financial resources which prevented the
 construction of new facilites; much of the violence in that
 facility was attributed to drug use and trafficking.
 Infopress-Centro Americana, in its July 26 issue, reported
 that 18 prisoners were discovered being held in underground
 cells at Pavon by a new prison director who replaced his
 dismissed predecessor, and that the prisoners were returned to
 .tne regular prison population.
 Government officials periodically took action against police
 officials charged with violations of law. In July, two
 policemen were indicted in the beating death of a prisoner in
 Puerto Barrios. During the course of the year over 400
 policemen were indicted, according to government statistics,
 for various crimes, and over 300 treasury police were
 dismissed as well on suspicion of complicity in various crimes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Involuntary exile is not utilized as a form of punishment, nor
 are critics of the Government arrested and convicted on
 unrelated charges. The current Government facilitated, during
 1984, the voluntary departure from the country of persons who
 
 
 546
 GUATEMALA
 sought refuge in the Belgian, Ecuadorian, Venezuelan and,
 reportedly, other diplomatic missions.
 Forced labor is not practiced. Service in the civilian
 self-defense patrols in many rural areas takes on the
 character of a requirement for able-bodied males. This
 practice has come under criticism from the Guatemalan
 Episcopal Conference whose members consider this a form of
 involuntary labor.
 Under the Guatemalan legal code, persons may not be held for
 more than 48 hours without being brought before a judge.
 Despite this and other legal provisions, the illegal detention
 of individuals suspected of having subversive sympathies
 continues to be a serious problem. Persons are held
 incommunicado for varying periods of time, with no clear
 pattern evident. The Government officially denies that any
 political prisoners are held in custody.
 In February the Government published a list of 87 persons
 previously reported missing or kidnapped, who were in the
 custody of the National Police. No names of prominent missing
 persons appeared in this list, however. The bulk of the
 individuals appeared to be common criminals. Both National
 Liberation Movement and United Anti-Communist party spokesmen
 condemned the irony of writs of habeas corpus having been
 returned stating that the persons were not in custody, while
 officials later admitted that they may have actually been in
 police custody at the time.
 In April, a Mexican-based organization aligned with the
 violent leftist Revolutionary Organization of the People in
 Arms, requested writs of habeas corpus for 157 missing
 persons; none was successful. In May the same group requested
 habeas corpus writs for 54 additional persons, and 51 were
 successful. Some of these persons were located in prison,
 having been convicted in regular trials, and others had
 already been released upon completion or commutation of their
 sentences. In August, the 'Group of Mutual Support for the
 Safe Return of Our Children, Spouses, Parents and Siblings'
 published the names and photographs of 120 persons who had
 disappeared since 1982. Other groups have also petitioned the
 courts for the release of 310 individuals who had
 disappeared. In August, the Archbishop of Guatemala,
 Monsignor Prospero Penados, told reporters that 'even though
 there is no proof, it is possible that some members of the
 security forces are involved in kidnappings." He acknowledged
 that it was difficult to assign responsibility to any
 particular group for a specific act because guerrilla groups
 commit the same types of acts.
 In July, the Government granted a full pardon for all persons
 who had been convicted on criminal charges by the now
 abolished secret special courts. The pardon did not apply to
 civil penalties (restitution to victims, etc.) levied at the
 same time against those convicted by the special courts. The
 President of the Supreme Court said that he had no statistics
 on the numbers of persons processed by the defunct special
 courts, explaining that many of those arrested were released
 witnin hours of arrest without a record being kept; some were
 convicted by the court of the first instance, but released
 after review by the court of the second instance; many were
 transferred to the civil courts for trial; while others were
 
 
 547
 GUATEMALA
 tried, convicted, and sentenced within the special courts.
 Apparently only in the latter case were complete files kept.
 Beginning in about April the Detective Division of the
 National Police (Departamento de Investigaciones Tecnicas -
 DIT) allegedly began a practice of arresting and holding
 defense attorneys for periods of 24-72 hours on charges of
 complicity when they appeared at the DIT headquarters to
 provide legal counsel to their clients. The practice was
 protested to the Minister of Interior by the Board of
 Directors of the Bar Association during a meeting held on June
 11. As of late October, sources reported that the DIT
 practice had ceased.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guatemala's 1965 Constitution was replaced by the 'Basic
 Statute of Government" after the 1982 military coup. Under
 the Basic Statute, all executive and legislative powers are
 vested in the head of state, General Oscar Humberto Mejia
 Victores, and all Government officials serve at his pleasure.
 In May, the President of the Guatemalan Supreme Court, Ricardo
 Sagastume, was dismissed by the Chief of State. The ex-Chief
 Justice claimed that, among other reasons, he was removed for
 opposing military interference in the courts. Several other
 Supreme Court officials and justices resigned in sympathy
 following Sagastume's removal. His summary dismissal was
 protested by the Guatemalan Lawyers Association which issued a
 public statement declaring, in part, that the act 'demonstrates
 once again the lack of independence of the judiciary.'
 Overt military interference in the courts' operation has
 declined in recent months, according to authoritative
 observers. As a practical matter, however, the removal of the
 Supreme Court President has served to remind all judicial
 officers of the need to respond to indications of special
 interest in particular cases by high government or military
 officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Basic Statute guarantees the inviolability of the home,
 and of personal correspondence and private papers. Prior to
 August 1983, the State of Exception then in force allowed the
 Government to restrict freedom of movement, examine
 correspondence and private papers, and conduct warrantless
 searches of private residences. During 1984 the Government
 continued to set up roadblocks in the interior to check
 documents of travelers and search vehicles for security
 reasons. Occasionally, security forces have entered homes
 without warrants in search of guerrilla safehouses or arms
 caches.
 Charges that private correspondence is tampered with continue
 to be made. Postal authorities acknowledge that this
 sometimes happens and blame dishonest employees; several
 postal employees were arrested in 1984. There have also been
 allegations of mail opened for security or political reasons.
 There is no organized system of Government informers or
 neighborhood watch committees in the urban areas. However,
 the civil defense patrols in the countryside have served as a
 
 
 548
 GUATEMALA
 means of reasserting government control. Guerrilla groups
 have killed a number of persons in rural areas whom they
 accused of being informers. The involvement of large segments
 of the rural population obviously contributes to the
 Government's knowledge regarding movement of citizens, an
 important function of the patrol in countering the insurgency.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government affirms these rights, and no major abuses were
 reported in 1984, nor was there indication of any attempt to
 prevent the media from freely airing diverse viewpoints and
 covering the spectrum of political opinion during an election
 year.
 This situation contrasts sharply with that of recent years
 when the media, newspaper reporters, and broadcast journalists
 in particular were frequent targets of political violence from
 all extremes. Lingering fears serve to limit press freedoms
 somewhat today. While opposition views and even criticism of
 the Government are printed and aired freely, with broad-gauged
 editorial opinions in daily newspapers, journalistic
 self-restraint results in only perfunctory coverage of such
 topics as military and national security, corruption, police
 investigations, and some judicial proceedings. Journalists
 are not prevented from-entering or covering newsworthy events
 in conflict zones, but they rarely do. Guerrilla
 organizations and civil rights groups have access to the media
 through communiques and manifestos; the Government no longer
 prevents their publication, as it did in past years.
 Local reporters are more apt to characterize their inattention
 to certain stories as a generalized or traditional lack of
 investigative journalism skills, rather than the bowing to any
 outside pressure. In the case of foreign journalists, there
 were incidents reported in 1984 involving two American wire
 service stringers who may have been subject to harrassment by
 government officials and/or private security forces as a
 result of their uwn news investigations.
 Radio is Guatemala's most pervasive medium, with over 100
 privately owned stations operating throughout the country.
 The Government owns and operates six radio stations and one
 television station which broadcast a variety of news,
 educational, and entertainment programs. There are four
 privately owned television stations, plus one religious
 (evangelical) station, and two independent television news
 programs. Six major independent daily newspapers are
 published in the capital; the Government publishes one daily
 with official announcements/decrees and selected national news
 items.
 There is no censorship of either local or foreign books in
 Guatemala, but a few local writers and artists continue to
 live and work in self-exile outside the country. The main
 campus of San Carlos University in the capital has been a
 center of political violence in recent years, but the number
 of persons associated with the university who were victims of
 disappearances and killings in 1984 declined slightly with
 respect to previous figures.
 
 
 549
 GUATEMALA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Basic Statute of Government affirms the rights of
 petition, assembly, and political association. Through the
 end of April 1984, some 41 political groups registered and
 attempted to meet the requirements set by the electoral law
 regulating the organization of political parties. Of that
 number, 20 met all requirements and participated in the July
 1, 1984 Constituent Assembly elections, which international
 observers characterized as free and honest. Throughout the
 electoral campaign, the freedom of political assembly was
 respected by the Mejia Government and only scattered incidents
 of interference with the political process by officials at the
 local level were reported.
 The Basic Statute of Government recognizes the right of
 workers to organize and strike in conformity with the labor
 code, which requires a process of negotiations and
 conciliation before a legal walkout can take place. These
 procedures often make it difficult to call a legal strike.
 According to Government statistics, some 645 labor unions are
 legally recognized by the Ministry of Labor; of this number,
 381 are active. The balance are inactive largely as a result
 of repression by the Lucas Garcia Government (1978-82) and the
 continuing economic difficulties. Less than 10 percent of the
 Guatemalan labor force is currently organized.
 Trade union organization is basically divided into two types;
 legally recognized and active centrals, and underground
 centrals. The largest and most significant labor central in
 Guatemala is the Confederacion de Unidad Sindical Guatemalteca
 (CUSG), which was recognized by the Government in November,
 1983. CUSG is a democratic confederation that follows the
 principles of the free trade union movement and emphasizes
 economic unionism. In mid-1984 it consisted of twelve urban
 and rural trade union federations with approximately 165,000
 members.
 The Federacion Autonoma Sindical de Guatemala (FASGUA), the
 trade union arm of the Guatemalan Communist Party, with some
 6,500 members, and the Central de Trabajadores (CNT), a
 Marxist-dominated ad hoc group of union locals without legal
 recognition, representing about 4,000 members, comprise the
 .political underground' unions in Guatemala. In May 1984,
 FASGUA and CNT formed the Coordinating Committee of
 Organizations for National Syndicalist Unity (CONUS).
 Although locals affiliated with either FASGUA, CNT, or CONUS
 are often active in labor disputes, these three parent groups
 are not particularly active within Guatemala. However, they
 do issue press bulletins and manifestos outside the country.
 Aside from trade unions, there are numerous professional and
 trade associations in Guatemala. These groups operate
 autonomously, without Government interference and often
 exercise considerable political influence.
 During the first 6 months of 1984, 11 leaders of left wing or
 unrecognized unions either were murdered or disappeared. Of
 the latter group, two later reappeared. Seven leaders of
 recognized unions were also abducted but were released after a
 short time.
 
 
 550
 GUATEMALA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Tne Basic Statute of Government recognizes the individual's
 right to freedom of conscience and to the free exercise of
 religion. These rights are respected in practice. The
 Statute also grants legal recognition to all denominations.
 More than 70 percent of the population adheres to the Roman
 Catholic faith. Many Indians, however, practice religion
 which combines Roman Catholic tenets with elements of the
 traditional Mayan religion. Evangelical churches have grown
 rapidly, especially among Indians, and their followers number
 about one quarter of the population. In addition, there is a
 small Jewish community.
 There has been active proselytizing and religious work in the
 country by foreign Catholic clergy and religious workers.
 Foreign Protestant evangelical clergy remained in the country
 after General Mejia came to power. They have been joined in
 their efforts by local representatives of Guatemala's growing
 evangelical movement. A result of this religious mix and zeal
 has been some tension between Catholics and Protestants.
 Although authorities deny any deliberate policy of
 discrimination, evangelicals nevertheless have charged cases
 of intimidation by the national police.
 Neither Catholics nor evangelicals have registered claims that
 they cannot preach the gospel or develop congregations, but
 some Protestants have complained of unequal treatment in
 certain matters. For example, they have claimed that land
 owned by the Government is available to them only at extremely
 inflated prices and that aid items, such as clothing from
 foreign charitable organizations and affiliated church groups,
 are subject to duties not levied on the Catholic Church.
 Others maintain very good relations with authorities and
 report excellent cooperation by government officials.
 In 1984 the Catholic Church exercised the freedom of
 conscience provided by government statute as it took outspoken
 stands on human rights issues. The hierarchy issued a
 pastoral letter in June which called for the disbanding of the
 civil defense patrols because of the time and effort taken
 away from the pursuit of their families' livelihood. The
 letter also called for respect of human life, protection of
 the family, and freedom to speak, organize and move about
 openly. Separately, the Archbishop registered to vote and
 urged all citizens to exercise their franchise in the
 Constituent Assembly elections. In October he spoke out
 again, stating that the freedom to exercise one's rights was
 being impeded. Despite these frank criticisms, the Archbishop
 did acknowledge that the human rights situation in Guatemala
 had visibly improved. The Government's response to the
 Archbishop was to say that officers responsible for actions
 outside of the law had been discharged or brought before the
 courts. The church and Government have maintained regular
 contacts, including at the highest levels, which are described
 by both sides as cordial.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not limit the freedom of movement of its
 citizens within the national territory. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel or on the right to reenter the
 
 
 551
 GUATEMALA
 country. All citizens are free to migrate to other
 countries.
 In early 1984, international organizations assisting refugees
 estimated that some 46,000 Guatemalan refugees, mostly Indians
 from areas affected by insurgent activities, had sought refuge
 in Mexico, primarily in the border areas of the State of
 Chiapas. Since 1982, the Government has followed a policy of
 encouraging the voluntary repatriation of all refugees and
 assisting their reintegration into the country. Following a
 general decline in guerrilla activity, and the decision by
 Mexico to relocate the refugees away from the border, refugees
 began to return to Guatemala, mostly in small groups. The
 Government has welcomed them and provided assistance for their
 return to their former homes, or in cases where their homes
 were destroyed during the insurgency, to one of the model
 towns in the 'Polos de Desarrollo' (rural resettlement
 program).
 In addition to the refugees who sought haven in Mexico, a
 major by-product of the insurgency was the internal
 displacement of as many as 400,000 persons during the past
 three years. Both Government and private agencies working
 with displaced persons agree that the actual number is now
 substantially below that figure. Various government programs
 have resulted in assistance to almost all the displaced and
 the permanent resettlement of the majority.
 Following a pattern that began under the Rios Montt Government
 in 1982, Guatemalans living in voluntary exile continued to
 return to the country in 1984. This trend was further
 encouraged by the successful Constituent Assembly elections.
 Representatives of the major political party in exile, the
 Social Democrats, have visited the country as a public prelude
 for their return.
 Exiles from other countries in the region have sought and been
 granted asylum during the past year.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guatemala continued to be ruled throughout 1984 by a de facto
 military-controlled Government which took power following a
 coup on August 8, 1983. General Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores
 was elevated to the position of Chief of State, while
 retaining the dual function of Minister of Defense. He
 governs with the advice and consent of a Council of Military
 Commanders through a Cabinet of Ministers composed of both
 military officers and civilians.
 On January 19, 1984, the Mejia Government convoked the
 election of a Constituent Assembly to take place on July 1,
 1984. Under the direction of an autonomous Supreme Electoral
 Tribunal, established during the previous Government and
 composed ot reputable civilians, and a subordinate Citizen's
 Registry, some 17 political parties and 3 additional
 department civic committees completed requirements to contest
 the elections. Some 1,157 candidates ran for the 88-seat
 Constituent Assembly, and 2,554,000 citizens, out of an
 estimated 3.5 million eligible, registered to vote.
 The elections took place as scheduled with over 72 percent of
 the registered citizens casting ballots. Nine parties,
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 36
 
 
 552
 GUATEMALA
 including two running in coalition and one civic committee,
 won seats. International observers from nine countries and
 the Organization of American States were present throughout
 the country on election day and, without exception, testified
 to the openness and honesty of the process.
 The mandate of the Assembly is to draft a new constitution and
 new laws of habeas corpus, elections, and protection of
 constitutional rights. The Assembly, inaugurated on August 1,
 1984, was considering a draft of the new constitution at the
 end of December, after studying proposals from various sectors
 including universities, the Lawyers Guild, and political
 parties. The timetable for completion of the constitution and
 related laws is early 1985. Chief of State Mejia has stated
 publicly on various occasions that his Government will
 guarantee free and open national elections, and will hand over
 power to the winners in 1985. Parties of all democratic
 tendencies will be able to participate in the national
 elections, including those which return from exile, provided
 they are able to meet the requirements of the new electoral
 law.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Government maintained an open door to visits by human
 rights groups during 1984, but few came in comparison to the
 previous year. The Government continued to cooperate with the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission's Special Rapporteur on
 Guatemala, Viscount Colville of Culross, who visited in August
 1984, following earlier visits in June and November 1983. He
 met with the Chief of State, the Foreign Minister, Supreme
 Court and Constituent Assembly presidents, representatives of
 labor organizations and political parties, and traveled to
 interior locations. In public statements, Lord Colville
 stated that he found the situation in the interior to be
 tense, and guerrillas still active. He praised the honesty of
 the July I Constituent Assembly elections, but expressed
 concern over continued violence, shootings, and kidnappings.
 He was further quoted as stating "I consider that human rights
 have improved, even though there has been a small escalation
 during recent months (of incidents).' The formal report of
 his latest visit was issued in late October. On December 7,
 1984, the United Nations Human Rights Commission adopted a
 resolution on the situation of human rights in Guatemala
 which, while noting the report of the Special Rapporteur and
 welcoming several positive developments, was generally
 critical. The U.S. Government opposed the resolution as
 unbalanced in that it appeared to apply only to the Guatemalan
 Government and ignored violations committed by the guerrilla
 insurgents. The U.S. did support the extension of the mandate
 of the Special Rapporteur.
 The Regional Delegate of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross visited in March 1984. He was received by senior
 civilian and military officials of the Government.
 The Government expressed sharp objection to a report issued in
 September by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 (IAHRC). The IAHRC charged that since the advent of the Mejia
 Government, death squads have reappeared, bodies are found
 along roadsides, and 'more than 600 persons have been killed
 among other violations.' The IAHRC also denounced the
 
 
 553
 GUATEMALA
 judicial system as "dependent, subordinate and submissive to
 the Executive,* and for its failure effectively to apply
 habeas corpus. The Foreign Minister publicly announced that
 Guatemala had sent a letter to the Commission pointing out
 mistakes in the report. He noted that the Government had
 invited the Commission to visit one year ago but it did not
 accept, and that the observations in the report were made
 without an on-site visit. The letter argued that the IAHRC
 report was based on 'accusations made, often by groups
 supportive of the subversive movement that seeks through
 violence and terror to institute a Marxist-Leninist regime in
 the country.' Mentioned as one such group was the
 Mexican-based Guatemala Human Rights Commission. The letter
 also noted the failure of the IAHRC to mention the report of
 the United Nations Special Rapporteur.
 After many years of concern regarding the application by
 Guatemala of the Conventions of Freedom of Association and
 Protection of the Right to Campaign and on Abolition of Forced
 Labor, the International Labor Organization's Committee on the
 Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its 1984
 report noted 'with satisfaction' that the state of exception
 which had suspended trade union activities was over and that a
 process of democratization had begun which would also lead to
 the reestablishment of freedom of association. The Committee
 noted that a draft legislative decree had been prepared which
 would meet all the concerns previously raised by the ILO. The
 Committee requested the ILO to assist the Guatemalan
 Government in the rapid elaboration and adoption of the
 decree.
 In Amnesty International's 1984 report entitled 'Torture in
 the Eighties', the section on Guatemala states that 'under
 successive regimes during the period under review, opponents
 or suspected opponents of the Government have been
 systematically seized without warrant, tortured and
 murdered." The report contains no reference to events beyond
 August 1982. An Amnesty bulletin released in March 1984
 focused on alleged violations of human rights of faculty and
 students at the National University, and blamed government
 security forces for detentions and disappearances during the
 period July 1978 to August 1983. In its yearly report for
 1984, a summary of 1983 analysis, Amnesty charged that "forces
 acting under government orders or with official complicity
 continue being responsible for a massive violation of human
 rights.' Amnesty spoke of a notable increase in "death
 squads'-style disappearances and extrajudicial executions in
 Guatemalan cities during the 1983 period, yet observed that
 there were fewer such executions of non-combatant civilians in
 government-controlled rural areas, excepting an increase of
 abuses in areas still in contention. Both the Rios Montt and
 Mejia Governments have publicly stated that Amnesty
 International is free to visit Guatemala to observe conditions
 first hand. Amnesty's response in the past has been that it
 is awaiting a formal written reply to a communication it sent
 that would constitute a formal invitation.
 A subcommittee of the American Bar Association, in a July 1984
 letter, took issue with a Guatemalan Government circular
 communication claiming the existence of an "international
 campaign to discredit the interests of the people of
 Guatemala." The Association called on the Guatemalan
 Government to take a series of steps to improve fundamental
 rights.
 
 
 554
 GUATEMALA
 A memorandum issued in September by the Americans for
 Democratic Action classified the human rights situation in
 Guatemala as 'very complex*, noting that there appear to be
 fewer violations in the countryside but an increase in urban
 disappearances. It observed that 'a fair election with the
 participation of the left is considered by many the best hope
 for resolving the long Guatemalan nightmare.'
 The 'Group of Mutual Support for the Reappearance, With Their
 Lives, of Our Children, Spouses, Parents and Siblings" came
 into being in 1984 and has received support from the
 International Peace Brigades based in Canada. Composed of
 approximately 150 persons, the group has requested government
 help in efforts to locate missing relatives. Representatives
 of the group have met with aany sectors in Guatemala,
 sponsored a mass at the metropolitan Cathedral in August, and
 a peace march through the capital in October. Government
 officials have met with the group and allowed the march, which
 took place without incident. In December, the group met with
 General Mejia who announced a tripartite commission would be
 formed to investigate the cases of missing persons.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guatemala's population topped 8 million in 1984, but only-a
 small portion enjoys a high standard of living. Though there
 is a small and growing middle class, the majority of the
 population lives in the countryside, working small farms,
 hiring out during the harvests of the export crops, or
 engaging in cottage industry. The Guatemalan economy has been
 in recession since 1980; thus while the population has been
 growing at an annual rate of 3.1 percent, per capita income
 declined from $1,141 in 1981 to $1,128 in 1982. The recession
 has forced the Government to cut back sharply its public
 investment program. Political instability in Central America,
 low commodity prices in world markets, and the disruptive
 effects of the insurgency on internal demand have restricted
 improvements in unemployment and underemployment levels, which
 according to official figures are above 8 and 32 percent
 respectively.
 In 1977, the latest year for which there are statistics, the
 caloric supply available for consumption was 92.2 percent of
 nutritional requirements. Notwithstanding considerable public
 investment in potable water projects, medical centers, and
 clinics, health services and sanitation are generally poor in
 rural areas, where available at all. In 1976, again the
 latest year for which figures are available, 40 percent of the
 total population, but only 14 percent of those living in rural
 areas, had access to safe drinking water. Life expectancy at
 birth rose from 58.9 years in 1981 to 60.99 years in 1984, but
 the infant mortality rate has risen from 62 per 1,000 live
 births in 1983 to 63 in 1984. In 1977, 21 percent of the
 urban population and 25 percent of the rural population were
 below the absolute poverty level.
 The adult literacy rate was estimated at 46 percent in 1973
 with males 53.6 percent and females 38.5 percent; the adult
 urban population was 71.8 percent, and the adult rural
 population 31.4 percent. As of 1980, the enrollment in
 primary school (as a percentage of primary school aged
 children) was 68.47 percent with males 7,3.73 percent and
 females 63 percent. Since half the population of Guatemala
 are comprise Indians, who learn Spanish as a. second-language,
 
 
 555
 GUATEMALA
 literacy is a particularly difficult problem. To attack it
 and address the educational needs of the Indian populace, the
 Government has developed a bilingual language program.
 Population growth and economic development as well as other
 pressures are resulting in a slow shift of some Indians away
 from total identification with traditional Indian society, but
 the incorporation of the rural Indian population into the
 political, economic, and social mainstream of the modern
 sector will remain a long, difficult process, complicated by
 the longstanding, traditional animosities between the Indians
 and the ladinos. The Mejia Government is concerned about the
 resettlement of displaced highland Indians on their own lands
 and their return to agricultural self-sufficiency after the
 dislocation suffered as a result of civil conflict. Personnel
 working with the Salvation Army have said that based on their
 current knowledge the number of affected persons reported in
 earlier surveys (approximately 400,000) was greatly
 overestimated. Many displaced families rather rapidly
 re-established themselves on or near their lands and are again
 working their fields. The current official estimate of
 persons geographically displaced from their lands and living
 elsewhere in the country is around 8,500.
 Encouraged by the large number of people who had returned to
 their lands, but who needed greater protection, the Government
 devised and put into action a model town plan known as the
 "Poles of Development.* The program is a joint civilian/army
 effort to reconstruct and resettle 19 villages on or near
 their original sites. The towns each have a potable water
 supply and electricity, at least one school, a church, postal
 and telegraph service, private bus service, and a small army
 stockade nearby. All families will be given title to their
 homes. Access is not controlled. The military offer
 protection from insurgents. Thus far, nine villages have been
 cumpleted and are inhabited.
 Guatemala is a Latin society in which most women play
 traditional roles; there is no discrimination against women by
 law, but de facto discrimination is rooted in centuries of
 cultural practice.
 Although figures show that over one-half the female population
 has not been educated and that 94 percent of the women
 residing in rural areas had less than three years of schooling
 in 1978, it is estimated that 30 percent of the students
 enrolled in Guatemalan universities are women. They generally
 study education, law, humanities, business administration,
 pharmacy, and psychology and go on to careers as health
 workers, teachers, or office workers. The number of women
 occupying professional and managerial positions is
 nevertheless small.
 A few women university graduates have risen to high
 positions. General Mejia appointed Lic. Eugenia Tejada de
 Putzeys as Minister of Education, making her Guatemala's first
 woman Cabinet minister, and a woman heads the National Tourism
 Office. A woman also served in the dual role of Dean of the
 Law Faculty at Rafael Landivar and as a member of Guatemala's
 Supreme Court (from which she resigned following the
 replacement of Chief Justice Sagastume in May). Other women
 serve as judges of lower courts, principally in the area of
 family law. The Ministry of Labor established an Office of
 
 
 556
 GUATEMALA
 Women's Affairs which has responsibility for encouraging the
 advancement of women.
 While te participation of women in politics has been limited,
 1984 witnessed a stirring of overt enthusiasm and
 organizational effort. In the July 1 Constituent Assembly
 elections three women were elected to the new 88-member
 Assembly. Only three other women had been elected to National
 Congress in the previous 35 years, and none to past
 Constituent Assemblies.
 The Vice President of the Guatemalan Journalism Association, a
 woman, is an active contributor to the Association's work,
 which includes input to the Constituent Assembly. Their
 predominance in the textile industry has led one woman to be
 chosen Secretary General of the National Federation of Textile
 Workers.
