 BANGLADESH
 On August 6, Bangladesh's National Assembly votedunanimously
 to amend the country's Constitution to reintroduce a
 parliamentary form of government. This decision was endorsed
 by the general electorate in a referendum on September 15. As
 a result, Bangladesh is now a parliamentary democracy led by
 Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Her ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
 Party (BNP) enjoys a parliamentary majority. The parliamentary
 opposition is led by Sheikh Hasina Wajed, who heads the Awami
 League, and includes other parties such as former president
 Hossain Mohammed Ershad's Jatiyo Party.
 Country-wide parliamentary elections were held on February 27
 under then acting president, Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed,
 who assumed power following the resignation of former president
 Ershad in late 1490. The elections, held under the scrutiny of
 both international and domestic observer groups, were widely
 regarded as free and fair and unprecedented in the history of
 Bangladesh.
 Bangladesh, under its recently amended Constitution, has a
 unicameral Parliament of 330 members, 300 of whom are popularly
 elected. The remaining 30 members occupy seats reserved for
 women, who are chosen by the elected members. The Prime
 Minister appoints the Cabinet, 80 percent of whom must be
 Members of Parliament. The President, who is elected by the
 Parliament, serves as the titular Head of State. The amended
 Constitution ensures strict party discipline, containing harsh
 penalties for floor-crossing.
 The police and paramilitary forces, which are controlled by the
 Home Affairs Ministry, bear primary responsibility for
 maintaining internal security.' Paramilitary forces include the
 Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), which guards the borders; the
 Bangladesh Ansars, a home guard which assists the police in
 maintaining law and order; and the Village Defense Parties
 (VDP), a uniformed but normally unarmed local militia. The
 police and security forces were responsible for human rights
 abuses in 1991. The army and the BDR play an internal security
 role in the Chittagong Hill tracts (CHT), where attacks by
 tribal insurgents against security forces, Bengali settlers,
 and other tribals continued in 1991.
 Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest and most densely
 populated countries. The new Government has been receptive to
 economic policy reform, but implementation has been uneven.
 These reforms face resistance from many who fear losing de
 facto monopolies or guaranteed jobs, or want protection from
 foreign competition.
 The human rights situation improved in 1991. The February
 elections and their aftermath represented a significant
 improvement both in the ability of citizens to change their
 government through democratic processes and in freedom of the
 press. In its first months in power, the BNP Government made
 further improvements in freedom of the press by its revocation
 of sections of the Special Powers Act dealing with press
 freedom. However, there remain serious problems of arbitrary
 detentions under the Special Powers Act (SPA), prisoner abuse,
 and deaths in police custody as well as restrictions on women's
 and worker's rights and some remaining restrictions on freedom
 of speech and press.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Violent confrontations between rival student groups,
 representing different political parties, plagued university
 and lower level educational institutions throughout 1991. The
 participants in these clashes were often armed, and their
 confrontations resulted in injury and sometimes death. The
 police and security forces have been reluctant to intervene in
 these clashes. The police have also been slow to appzehend
 those students accused of killings, including one case pending
 from the 1991 demdcratic movement.
 Sporadic violence during the February elections and the
 September by-elections resulted in several deaths and
 injuries. There were credible reports of deaths of persons in
 police custody during 1991 (see Section i.c.).
 b. 'Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting from
 official actions in 1991. As in the past, however, armed
 tribal insurgents in the CHT kidnaped an undetermined number of
 persons in raids on Bengali and tribal villages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading punishment or treatment, police treatment of
 accused criminals and other detainees, including those held on
 political charges, is usually rough and can include torture and
 other abusive treatment during interrogations. Reports of
 prisoner abuse at Dhaka central jail in April 1991, in the wake
 of prolonged inmate unrest, were among the most serious
 allegations of human rights violations made since the fall of
 the Ershad regime. Two purported eyewitnesses told a local
 human rights group that 7 prisoners were killed and as many as
 2,000 others were burned with scalding water and teargassed in
 a crackdown at the jail between April 8-10. The informants
 also alleged that over 120 prisoners had limbs methodically
 broken before being transferred to other prisons. Furthermore,
 it was alleged that no food was provided to the prisoners in
 the jail during this period.
 The incidents at Dhaka central jail drew relatively little
 press attention. The Government publicly denied the
 allegations of prisoner abuse. Reacting to a series of letters
 from human rights groups and some individuals, the Government
 issued an official press release on April 22 describing the
 charges, as "baseless." It maintained that only two prisoners
 were killed during an escape attempt on April 9. The alleged
 incidents occurred immediately prior to the transfer of former
 President Ershad to Dhaka's central jail. The prison had
 experienced prolonged recurrent unrest since late 1990 as
 prisoners reacted to the atmosphere of "liberation" outside the
 prison walls.
 Three classes of prison facilities exist. Class "C"
 cells--which generally hold common criminals, suspected
 terrorists, and low-level political workers--are the worst.
 
 
 1355
 BANGLADESH
 They often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality
 food, and the use of handcuffs and fetters is common.
 Prisoners in these cells reportedly suffer the most abuse, such
 as beatings and being forced to kneel for long periods.
 Conditions in "B" and "A" cells are markedly better, with the
 latter reserved for "prominent" persons. Former President
 Ershad, who was transferred from a house designated as a
 subjail in a residential area to Dhaka's central jail in April,
 is being detained in an "A" type cell.
 Mistreatment of ordinary citizens frequently goes unpunished,
 but police and jail officials involved in mistreating prisoners
 are sometimes disciplined in cases where the victim or his
 family and friends can attract publicity or persuade human
 rights groups to investigate the allegations. An inquiry by a
 five-member Citizens' Inquiry Commission headed by a former
 District Bar Association president has found that three police
 officials were responsible for shooting at students protesting
 against the Ershad regime. As a result of this incident, two
 students were killed. In ,a follow-up to the Inquiry Commission
 report, a case has been filed in the Mymensingh Sadar court,
 and a one-man committee of inquiry has been formed.  Despite
 increased public awareness, however, abuses continue. Reports
 persisted of abusive treatment of citizens by a variety of
 lower level government officials, party bosses, and labor
 leaders. This treatment included the use of violence and the
 threat of violence.
 The Government has not interfered with human rights groups'
 inquiries into cases of prisoner abuse but seldom undertakes
 its own investigation and seldom punishes those responsible for
 such abuses. Apparently in response to reports of prisoner
 abuse, the Home Affairs Minister now requires a magistrate's
 investigation of any deaths in police custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Special Powers Act of 1974 (SPA), the Government may
 detain a person without charge for an initial period of 30 days
 to prevent the commission of "any prejudicial act" as loosely
 defined in the legislation. The Government is obligated to
 charge the detainee formally by the end of this period or
 release him if it fails to file a charge. The person can
 legally be held until completion of an investigation if the
 Government brings a charge. In practice, though not in law,
 the detainee has 15 days to respond to the specific charge in
 writing to the Home Affairs Ministry, which can grant early
 release. Detentions under the SPA are not subject to judicial
 review until after 6 months, at which time a committee of three
 jurists examines the case to ascertain whether there is
 sufficient reason to continue the detention. Although the
 detainee is theoretically entitled to see a lawyer at the time
 of detention, in practice a lawyer is generally not allowed to
 see the detainee until a specific charge has been filed.
 Although the BNP Government has pledged to repeal the SPA, no
 action had been taken by year's end. While a number of SPA
 detainees were released after the February elections, the
 Government. also used the SPA against figures in the former
 Ershad regime. The Government uses the SPA in ordinary
 criminal cases as well as in political cases.' During a
 parliamentary session in April, the number of SPA detainees was
 put at 1,375, a decrease from the 3,301 registdred as of
 October 1990. On January 20, a three-man government advisory
 board headed by a Supreme Court justice was reconstituted to
 
 
 1356
 BANGLADESH
 review all SPA detainees' cases. By February, it had reviewed
 166 cases and released 141 detainees. -The board discontinued
 its activities subsequently but has issued no report on its
 actions, nor has it put forward-any recommendations.
 The right of a detainee to a judicial determination of the
 legality of his detention exists in local law. Bangladeshi
 legal and human rights organizations, however, continue to
 report cases of suspects who were arrested on minor charges but
 who remained in jail for long periods without trial.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Supreme Court is generally considered to act independently
 in most cases. Civilian courts hear civil and criminal cases
 in public trials, and the right of counsel is respected.
 Criminal courts are considered to be rife-with corruption.
 Though generally considered fair, civil courts are overburdened
 and effectively available only to those who can afford
 representation. The time-consuming and expensive process of
 pursuing cases discourages many from seeking redress though the
 courts. There are few legal aid programs to assist litigants
 and no public defenders. In January the Government amended the
 Code of Criminal Procedure to help speed up the trial process
 and alleviate the associated hardships for prisoners awaiting
 trial. The new ordinance requires magistrates to conclude
 trials within 120 days from the date on which they first
 receive the case and gives midlevel judges no more than 240
 days to try a case. However, a shortage of judges and courts
 and a backlog of over 500,000 criminal and civil cases make
 longer delays a common occurrence. Prominent lawyers believe
 there is little chance these backlogs will be cleared.
 Former President Ershad was convicted and sentenced to 10
 years' imprisonment in June for illegal possession of weapons.
 Other cases against him, and against members of hi6 regime, for
 corruption are currently being tried. Ershad has been
 represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. His trial
 is open to the press and public and appears to conform to
 standard Bangladesh legal practice. Some of Ershad's prison
 privileges have been revoked because of his purported attempts
 to pass messages and funds to his supporters.
 The Government claims to hold no political prisoners. Some of
 those being held under the SPA may be considered political
 prisoners. Three members of the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 People's Council currently detained under the SPA fall in this
 category. The number of political prisoners has been
 significantly reduced since the fall of the Ershad government,
 during which it was estimated to be in the hundreds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 .Correspondence
 Bangladesh law ordinarily requires a judicial warrant before
 authorities enter a home, and courts require evidence
 supporting a reasonable suspicion before -issuing a warrant.
 However, the SPA permits authorities to search premises without
 a warrant under certain circumstances, and authorities have in
 the past entered the homes of opposition leaders and human
 rights activists and detained persons and searched their
 premises without warrants. The Government's civilian and
 military intelligence services are widely believed to monitor
 
 
 1357
 BANGLADESH
 the opposition by such means as selective wiretaps and
 interception of mail.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 A Bangladeshi tribal insurgent group called the Shanti Bahini
 (Peace Force) has been engaged in a low-level conflict with
 Bangladesh security forces in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)
 since 1973. The insurgency is sustained by the tribal people's
 fears that their traditional way of life and special status in
 the hill areas are being undermined by Bengali settlers from
 the overpopulated plains. Religious differences between the
 predominantly non-Muslim tribals and the Muslim settlers is a
 contributing factor to the conflict.
 The Government is attempting to address tribal grievances by
 establishing and supporting elected district councils and by
 discouraging further settlement. The issues of greatest
 concern to the tribals--control over land and law and
 order--have yet to be completely devolved upon the councils,
 however. The Government since 1985 has tried to discourage
 Bengali settlement in the hill tracts, and there has been no
 further large-scale systematic settlement. Individual Bengalis
 continue to settle in the CHT, however. Although there are no
 precise figures available, the number of Bengalis residing in
 the hill tracts continues to grow. In 1947, when British
 colonialism ended, only 3 percent of the CHT's inhabitants were
 Bengali. At present, Bengalis make up 45 percent of the CHT's
 population.
 Both the Shanti Bahini and the Government accuse each other of'
 human rights violations. Access to the hill tracts is limited
 by government travel restrictions, difficult terrain, and the
 unsafe travel conditions caused by the ongoing'insurgency,
 making it difficult to verify allegations of atrocities. In
 the-past, Shanti Bahini attacks on Bengali settlers have led to
 reprisal attacks by Bengalis-on tribal settlements. In 1991
 the security forces remained under strict government orders to
 prevent such reprisals. Human rights groups continue to report
 reprisal killings and torture in the CHT, including some that
 allegedly occurred during 1991. While some of these reports
 seem credible, it is not possible to confirm them.
 The number of complaints of human rights violations by the
 Bangladesh military in the Hill Tracts have declined
 considerably since 1987, when reprisal attacks were at their
 height. Human rights groups continue to monitor the'Chittagong
 Hill Tracts situation closely and to encourage the Government
 to safeguard the rights of tribal people. There was a lull in
 Shanti Bahini activity following the change of government in
 December 1990. This lull ended abruptly in June 1991, when the
 Shanti Bahini mounted a number of attacks against Bengali
 settlers and security forces. These attacks were viewed by
 many observers as an attempt to disrupt the Government's local
 autonomy program. Despite a respite in Shanti Bahini' attacks
 later in 1991, dozens of Shanti Bahini fighters, security
 personnel, and both tribal and Bengali civilians were killed in
 1991.
 There are varying estimates as to the numbers of Bangladeshi
 tribal refugees residing in India. The Government of India and
 other observers claim that as late as 1989 there were 70,000.
 The Bangladesh Government has disputed this figure, claiming
 that there were never more than 40,000 such refugees. All
 
 
 1358
 BANGLADESH
 observers agree that the number has steadily declined over the
 past 2 years. The actual number returning to Bangladesh is
 difficult to verify, however, with estimates varying between
 3,000 and 15,000. There are also competing claims regarding
 the treatment of the returned refugees. The Government has
 announced an ambitious rehabilitation program which includes
 subsidies, housing, and job training. Some tribals charge,
 however, that the army is concentrating returnees in camps with
 little opportunity to work, thus perpetuating dependence on the
 national government.
 In 1990 and 1991, d group of European, Canadian, and Australian
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) under the name
 "Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission" sent a mission to
 Bangladesh and India to investigate allegations of human rights
 violations in the CHT. The Commission's report, issued in May
 1991, was the first attempt at a concise report on the human
 rights situation in the CHT. The report was critical of some
 aspects of the Bangladesh Government's past and present
 policies. The Government has disputed some of the Commission's
 claims, and it has become the subject of some controversy. The
 report has also been criticized as one-sided and as overstating
 government misdeeds.
 Chief among the Commission's conclusions is that the Bangladesh
 Government has militarized all facets of life in the CHT and is
 destroying its tribal society and culture, as well as its
 indigenous economy, by concentrating the population, tribal and
 settler, into cluster villages as part of the government
 counterinsurgency strategy. The Commission also concludes that
 government development and agricultural programs are causing
 grave ecological damage to the area, destroying the habitat of
 the tribal peoples. While the Commission notes that all
 parties to the conflict suffer violence and human rights abuse,
 it is most critical of the effects of continued settlement and
 government policies on the indigenous tribal peoples of the
 Tracts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 and freedom of the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of national security, international relati6ns,
 public order, decency, and morality. In practice, previous
 governments have used a variety of means to attempt to control
 the press. These have included formal and informal censorship,
 "guidance" from the press information department, temporary
 closures of newspapers, control of newsprint, and arrest or
 intimidation of journalists.
 Most private publications are heavily dependent upon
 advertisements from the Government or government-owned
 corporations. These advertisements reportedly account for as
 much as 75 percent of advertising revenues. All newspapers are
 theoretically eligible to receive public sector advertising if
 they meet minimum circulation requirements.  Publishers
 complain, however, that the placing and withholding of
 advertising, as well as payment for it, can be used as a means
 of influencing the press.
 Under the new Government, speech and the press are much freer.
 The Prime Minister is directly criticized by the opposition
 press, as are government policies. There is no overt
 
 
 1359
 BANGLADESH
 censorship-no newspapers have been seized or shut down since
 the new Government took power. The practice of providing
 "guidance" in the form of calls to editors from government
 officials reportedly has not been wholly eliminated but is said
 to be used much less often than in the past.
 The Government still wields immense power through the placing
 or withholding of ads in publications. During 1991, the
 Government denied advertisements to Doinik Janata, the Jatiya
 Party's newspaper. The Government contended that it was simply
 balancing favorable treatment received by the paper under the
 previous government. During November, however, a limited
 number of government ads began to appear in the Doinik Janata,
 indicating a degree of change in this policy. The Freedom
 Party's newspaper Meillat, which has an editorial column
 devoted almost solely to criticism of the Government, continues
 to receive advertisements, as do other parties' newspapers.
 According to some journalists, self-censorship is now practiced
 not out of fear of the Government, but out of fear for it.
 Papers are hesitant to jeopardize the fragile democracy by
 being too critical in their reporting. The example of Meillat
 notwithstanding, papers generally are still reluctant to
 criticize the Government too frequently.
 In a move welcomed by journalists, the Government repealed in
 February the portion of the SPA that allowed the closure of
 newspapers by government decree. This statute was used by the
 Ershad regime during the protest movement of 1990. Now the
 Government must go through legal channels to close a newspaper,
 which it did not do in 1991.
 The atmosphere in the media is generally positive, with new
 publications appearing almost daily. There are now
 approximately 100 daily publications and 350 weeklies and
 periodicals. The Government owns two daily newspapers,
 including one English-language daily, and one Rajshahi daily.
 The Government also owns BSS, the national news service. The
 other wire service, the United News of Bangladesh, is privately
 owned.
 There have been no substantial changes in the broadcast media.
 Radio and television are still the exclusive province of the
 Government. As with the print media, the Jatiya Party is not
 given equal treatment by the broadcast media. For example,
 their candidates were not allowed access to television during
 the parliamentary campaigns, though other parties did not face
 this restriction.
 Although 56 foreign publications (18 dailies and 38
 periodicals) are generally available in Bangladesh, the
 Government has sometimes used the Customs Act of 1969 to
 prevent the importation of foreign publications for various
 reasons. The government ban on the book "The Satanic Verses"
 remains in effect. No foreign journalists were arrested,
 barred from entry, or expelled in 1991. Academic liberties are
 not challenged. Teachers and students enjoy free expression.
 Drama groups are required to obtain official approval to
 perform. Films are censored for pornography, and South African
 and Israeli films are still banned.
 In May the new Government passed the Penal Code (Amendment)
 Bill, 1991 over the heavy opposition of all the opposition
 parties. This bill not only increased criminal penalties for a
 number of offenses, but it contains a clause specifying that
 anyone who "by words either spoken or written, or.. .publishes
 
 
 1360
 BANGLADESH
 or circulates any statement, rumor, or report, which is, or
 which is likely to be, prejudicial to the interest of the
 security of Bangladesh or public order..." shall be punished
 with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or
 with fine, or with both." There were no convictions under this
 section of the Penal Code in 1991, however.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits are not required for public meetings. Sit-ins,
 marches, and rallies are common forms of political expression
 in Bangladesh. Occasionally they lead to violence, with both
 the demonstrators and the police accusing each other of
 provQcation.
 The Constitution assures every citizen the right to form
 associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the
 interest of morality or public order. In practice, individuals
 are free to join private organizations and associations. There
 are no restrictions on affiliations with international
 organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bangladesh, 87 percent of whose people are Muslims, has
 recognized Islam as its state religion since the passage in
 June 1988 of the Eighth Constitutional Amendment. This
 amendment also states that all other religions may be freely
 practiced. Although conversion is possible, there is strong
 social resistance to conversion from Islam. Most proselytizing
 by Bangladeshi citizens is directed toward such minority groups
 as Hindus and tribal people. Proselytizing by Bangladeshi
 citizens is permitted by the Constitution. Members of
 religious minorities have reported being questioned by security
 authorities about proselytizing. In one case, two "Messianic
 Muslims" were imprisoned in 1990 in Bogra under Section 295(a)
 of the Bangladesh Penal Code under charges of "outraging the
 religious feelings of Bangladeshi citizens." While the two
 were released on bail in February, their case is still pending
 at the High Court level. The present Government has not
 continued the policy of interfering with this group.
 Government policy continues to permit various religions to
 establish places of worship, train clergy, travel for religious
 purposes, and maintain links with coreligionists abroad.
 Missionaries, including foreign clergy who serve expatriate
 congregations, are permitted, but they may not proselytize
 Muslims. Some missionaries perceive the various obstacles they
 face, including lengthy delays in obtaining or renewing
 security clearances and residence 'and reentry visas, as
 intended to curb Christian influence by reducing the number of
 missionaries and limiting their humanitarian activities.
 Despite official assurances of freedom of religion and equality
 of treatment, the establishment of Islam as the state religion
 continues to cause concern among Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist
 minorities. Some minority group members still complain that
 this constitutional change has emboldened some Muslims who are
 hostile to the minorities, as well as criminal elements who may
 prey on them.
 In January, following the outbreak of hostilities in the
 Persian Gulf, there were reports of violence directed against
 Christians. There were sporadic incidents of communal strife,
 including attacks on churches and Christian institutions. Some
 
 
 1361
 B NGLADESH
 Christian nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) were harassed
 by antiwar demonstrators. The Government acted quickly to
 restore order.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move about within the country,
 except in designated areas of the CHT. Travel by foreigners is
 also restricted in the CHT and some other border areas.
 Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and emigrate abroad,
 subject to foreign exchange controls, but civil servants
 wishing to travel abroad must obtain permission from the
 President's office. In some instances, persons considered to
 be security risks are barred from traveling abroad.
 Following the fall of the Ershad regime, the former President,
 his family, and senior members of the regime were barred from
 leaving the country. This restriction remained in effect in
 1991. The passports of those subject to these restrictions
 were confiscated by the Government, even though the Supreme
 Court in July 1990 had declared illegal the seizure in 1986 of
 a former Member of Parliament's passport. The right of
 repatriation is observed.
 More than 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis or
 "stranded Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending
 resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these
 persons opted for Pakistani citizenship, and Pakistan agreed to
 accept them, provided financing for resettlements costs was
 made available from outside sources. A Saudi Arabia-based
 social organization has been trying for several years to raise
 money for this purpose and claims that sufficient funds could
 be found if permission were granted for the Biharis to
 resettle. The Biharis, most of whom still reside in 66 camps
 throughout Bangladesh, may seek employment and conduct other
 activities, but they face disadvantages as noncitizens.
 Biharis may apply for Bangladeshi citizenship at any time, and
 those who do are granted full rights of citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Bangladesh exercised this right in the
 parliamentary elections on February 27 and the September 15
 referendum on the Constitution. Under the Ershad regime,
 violence at the polls and questions about the impartiality of
 voting officials led various opposition parties to boycott
 elections. The February parliamentary elections, by contrast,
 were relatively free of these impediments.
 The Government, under the leadership of the acting president,
 took extraordinary measures to provide security and ensure the
 integrity of the voting process. Candidates from dozens of
 political parties competed in 300 constituencies on election
 day. Both international and domestic observer groups praised
 the holding of the elections, calling it the freest and fairest
 in Bangladesh's history. Minor irregularities which did occur
 appeared due to the short preparation time provided to the
 election commission.
 The BNP emerged from the election with a plurality of seats in.
 the Parliament, and was invited to form a government.
 Following lengthy debate, a decision was reached to return to a
 parliamentary form of government. The constitutional amendment
 
 
 -1362
 
 BANGLADESH
 bill was passed unanimously, and the general electorate
 overwhelmingly supported this change in a September 15
 referendum.
 On September 11, by-elections were held in 11 constituencies to
 fill seats vacated by candidates who had won multiple seats in
 the February elections and one seat vacated by the death of the
 incumbent. These elections also appeared free and fair,
 although the incidence of violence increased.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are a number of local human rights organizations which
 investigate allegations of abuse and seek prosecution of human
 rights violators. Human rights groups are also active in
 promoting awareness of human rights and law among the country's
 largely uneducated rural majority. Although the Government
 generally does not hamper these groups' activities, it
 occasionally reminds them to avoid "sensitive" political issues
 such as the CHT issue.
 Following an August 1991 meeting of the independent Bangladesh
 Human Rights Commission, two members of a local human rights
 group were detained by security forces under the SPA.- They
 were questioned about their links with foreign embassies in
 Bangladesh and about their efforts to distribute copies of the
 CHT Commission report entitled "Life is Not Ours." According
 to their statements, 1,000 copies of the report were
 confiscated by the security forces. A local human rights
 lawyer has challenged this seizure in a writ submitted to the
 Supreme Court.
 The Government remains sensitive to international opinion
 regarding human rights issues. Although there were no visits
 to Bangladesh in 1991 by representatives of Amnesty
 International (AI) or similar groups, the Government responded
 to inquiries by AI regarding the incidents in Dhaka's central
 jail in April. When security conditions permit, the Government
 has allowed occasional escorted visits to the CHT by members of
 the diplomatic corps. Similarly, members of the CHT Commission
 were given permission to visit the region.
 International human rights organizations represented in
 Bangladesh include the International League for Human Rights,
 The Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific, and The
 International Commission of Jurists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 By custom and local Islamic tradition, women occupy a
 subordinate place in society. A family's ability to seclude
 its women is a symbol of rising social status. These
 underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the
 participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in rural
 areas, early marriage, high childbearing rates, and long hours
 of household and farm labor leave little opportunity for
 nonfamily interests or outside employment. Even in urban areas
 and among the affluent, the traditional social system makes
 women economically dependent upon their husbands and other male
 relatives. Except in the export-oriented garment industry,
 
 
 1363
 BANGLADESH
 women are virtually absent from the cash-earning work force.
 There are daily press reports of domestic violence against
 women: murder, rape and other physical abuse, breach of
 matrimonial contract, denial of inheritance rights, and
 desertion. There have also been reports of Bangladeshi women
 being lured into travel to foreign countries, where they have
 been sold into prostitution. The suicide rate among women is
 reportedly higher than among men.
 Laws to protect women include the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act of
 1980, the Cruelty to Women Act of 1983, the Child Marriage
 Restraint Act of 1984, and the Illegal Trafficking in Women Act
 of 1988. Enforcement of these laws continues to be lax,
 however. It is a capital offense to traffic in women, to kill
 a woman in the course of rape,.or to murder a woman for dowry.
 Even so, dowry killings, in which the husband or his family
 atack and sometimes murder the bride for nonpayment of a
 supposedly promised dowry, are said to occur frequently,
 especially in rural areas.
 The National Advisory Committee Against Repression of Women has
 established local branches in rural areas to address the
 problem of abused women. Nevertheless, there is still little
 recourse for victims of crimes committed within the family or
 home and, although newspapers occasionally print reports in
 which a husband accused of dowry killing is tried and punished,
 the vast majority of these cases are believed to go unreported
 and unpunished.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, though not in the law, and their access to government
 jobs, including in the military, and political office is
 limited. Despite the fact that minorities account for 13
 percent of the population, only 12 members of the current
 Parliament, including 1 woman, are from minority groups. In
 the years immediately following Bangladesh's independence,
 members of some minorities, principally Hindus, lost or had
 serious difficulty retaining their properties as a result of
 the prejudicial administration of vested property laws. These
 laws permitted the Government to use or even sell property
 belonging to persons who left what is now Bangladesh between
 1965. and 1971. Although President Ershad reaffirmed a 1984
 executive order requiring the return of such property to the
 original owners, in practice this order has not been widely
 followed, and some human rights activists contend that property
 is still occasionally seized under these laws.
 Violation of tribal people's property rights in the CHT has
 been an issue in the past, but there have been no reports of
 such violations in the past 4 years. In addition to suspending
 the transfer of land after 1985, the Government has taken other
 steps to grant authority over land allocations and regulation
 to the tribal-dominated local government councils. Although
 the Government announced in July that all remaining local
 government responsibilities were transferred to these councils,
 the decision has not yet been implemented. Even with such
 improvements, many tribal people remain concerned about their
 ability to retain their distinct culture in the face of
 incessant pressure from the dominant Bengali culture.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of association as well
 as the right to form labor unions, subject to government
 approval. Of Bangladesh's approximately 40 million workers,
 only some 3 million are in the industrial sector. Agricultural
 workers remain outside organized labor. As a result only 3.4
 percent of the labor force is unionized. Labor unions are most
 powerful in the jute, tea, and transportation sectors. The
 law, however, prohibits civil servants and workers employed in
 the Chittagong Export Processing Zone (EPZ) from forming trade
 unions. These workers have formed "staff associations",
 however, which perform many of the functions of unions. For
 example, civil servant staff associations organized a strike in
 August which resulted in large wage increases. The Government
 has the legal right to suspend unions but took no such action
 in 1991.
 Unions are free, within the restrictions noted above, to draw
 up their own constitutions and rules, elect officers, develop
 programs, and conduct business without government
 interference. However, the large number of rival unions tends
 to fracture labor solidarity and inhibit effective union
 activity.
 In addition to criticizing the prohibition of trade union
 activity by public servants and workers in export processing
 zones, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts expressed its continuing concern about restrictions on
 the range of persons that can hold office in trade unions, the
 extent of supervision in the internal affairs of trade unions,
 the "30 percent" requirement for initial or continued
 registration of trade unions, and other issues.
 Although there are no restrictions on forming confederations or
 affiliating with international organizations (all three
 worldwide trade union federations have local affiliates), union
 members need government clearance to travel to international
 labor meetings. No such clearances were withheld in 1991.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law
 but is an accepted and common form of protest. Numerous
 strikes were held in 1991. The Essential Services Ordinance of
 1958 permits the Government to bar strikes for 3 months in any
 sector deemed "essential," and the Government has occasionally
 applied this authority in sectors not normally deemed essential.
 The overwhelming majority of labor unions and federations are
 associated with, and dominated by political parties. As a
 result, union activities are often carried out in support of
 political agendas, rather than the needs of the members. The
 largest single labor organization is traditionally that of the
 ruling party. With the resignation of H.M. Ershad as President
 in late 1990 and the subsequent election of the Bangladesh
 Nationalist Party (BNP) Government, many workers abandoned the
 pro-Ershad federation to join that of the BNP.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to collective bargaining is limited by law, in that
 public sector employees cannot form unions or bargain
 collectively. Except in the EPZ, unions in the private sector
 can generally bargain collectively without government
 
 
 1365
 BANGLADESH
 interference. Union activity in the EPZ has been-suspended
 since 1985, although there have been several reports of ad hoc
 strikes in the EPZ which have not resulted in government
 sanctions against the workers involved.
 The Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969, amended in November
 1989 on the basis of proposals made by a tripartite
 consultative committee, places additional curbs on workers. It
 allows employers to transfer union officials, with the
 exception of the union president and executive treasurer,
 without their consent. Ordinary workers have full
 participatory rights in union business in theory, but some
 union officials and employers often violate them in practice.
 Union leaders allegedly make decisions without consulting
 members, and allegations regarding improper union elections
 have been lodged.
 Employers are frequently accused of ignoring laws prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, harassment of union leaders, and the
 firing of union activists. Although laws against such
 practices exist, the difficulties of prosecuting a court case
 against an employer discourage union attempts to have them
 enforced. Allegations of employer abuses have been especially
 prevalent in the garment industry, where most workers are
 female. There have also been allegations of illegal activities
 by unionists, including lock-ins of company management and
 wildcat strikes.
 The ILO's Committee of Experts continued to express concern
 about the Government's practice of setting wage rates and
 conditions through wage commissions, denial of the right of
 workers to engage in collective bargaining, and other issues.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor. This
 prohibition is generally respected, although there have been
 unverified reports of bonded labor on some tea and rubber
 plantations. This prohibition is not effectively enforced by
 labor inspection. The Government actively seeks to prevent the
 trafficking of bonded laborers into other South Asian countries.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Sanctioned by tradition and encouraged by dire economic
 necessity, child labor is a serious problem. Employment of
 children under the age of 14 has been banned for decades under
 numerous labor statutes, but enforcement remains lax. The
 Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated the number of child
 laborers at approximately 3 million, although informed
 observers assert the number is higher. There is a mandatory
 primary education law which specifies that each child must
 attend school through fifth grade.
 Legal minimum ages for various types of employment are seldom
 enforced, and children are regularly engaged in all available
 jobs. Children pedal rickshaws, serve as domestic servants,
 work in great numbers in agriculture, and are found in textile
 mills and garment factories. Bangladesh has ratified the U.N.
 Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Government has
 taken a number of steps designed to reduce child labor,
 including the passage of a mandatory primary education bill in
 January 1990. Government efforts to control child labor have
 yet to have a serious impact, however, in large part because
 child labor still constitutes a major income source for many

 families. The Government has so far proven incapable of
 providing the expanded educational and social programs required
 to solve the problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Many Bangladeshis live at below subsistence levels.
 Bangladeshi workers able to procure industrial jobs can provide
 their families with a rudimentary standard of living considered
 higher than average.
 Although Bangladesh labor law contains detailed provisions
 regarding minimum wage rates, hours of work, and occupational
 safety and health, these are rarely enforced. The Factories
 Act of 1965 and the Shops and Establishments Act of 1965 limit
 normal working hours to a maximum of 8 hours per day and 48
 hours per week. With overtime, the workweek may not legally
 exceed 60 hours.
 There is-no nationwide minimum wage as such. A minimum wage
 commission sets minimum wages within each industry and
 specialty, but private sector industrial units rarely follow
 this wage structure. Under Bangladesh law, an employer who
 does not pay the required minimum wage is subject to fines and
 imprisonment of up to 1 year, but few employers are prosecuted
 for violating this law. The law also stipulates that overtime
 work is to be compensated by double the hourly rate, but with
 little practical effect.
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Inspectorate is charged with
 insuring the enforcement of Bangladesh labor laws relating to
 the working environment and prosecuting those in violation.
 However, safety equipment and precautions are largely unknown,
 and the small number of safety inspectors are frequently
 untrained, underpaid, and unable to conduct an adequate
 enforcement program. This has resulted in an extremely low
 prosecution rate. A 1989 ILO survey concluded that
 Bangladeshiemployers generally pay little attention to safety,
 health, cleanliness, and the working environment.
