 MARISHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of a number of small islands
 in the central Pacific, comprising a total land area of about 70 square miles. The
 population of approximately 50,000 is of Micronesian origin and concentrated pri-
 marily on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls.
 The Constitution provides for free and fair elections, executive and legislative
 branches, and an independent judiciary. The legislature consists of the Nitijela, a
 33-member Parliament, and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), which serves a largely con-
 sultative function dealing with custom and traditional practice. The President is
 elected by majority vote of the Nitijela, and he appoints his Cabinet from its mem-
 bership.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security, and the Marshall Islands has no security forces of its
 own. The national and local police forces, supervised by the Ministry of Justice, have
 responsibility for internal security. These agencies observe constitutional and legal
 protections of civil rights in carrying out their responsibilities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, and the fishing industry gen-
 erate limited revenues.
 Human rights abuses are rare, but government influence leads to occasional in-
 stances of self-censorship in sensitive political or cultural areas.

 ESP CT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rlling.lThere were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degran    Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment, and there was no evidence that it occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for safeguards
 against arbitrary arrest and detention, and no such incidents were reported. Forced
 exile does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 public trial, and this right is observed in practice. The Government provides legal
 counsel for the indigent. There were no reported denials of fair public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for privacy of the home. This is respected by the Government. There was
 no known instance of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally honors these rights in practice. How-
 ever, government influence leads to occasional self-censorship by the media in areas
 of political or cultural sensitivity. There are four operating radio stations, one gov-
 ernment owned, and three privately owned, including one owned by a prominent
 member of the opposition. A cable television company is owned and operated by
 members of the political opposition. It shows US. programming but occasionally
 covers local events. In 1994 the Government closed the single television station, op-
 erated by the national museum, as a cost saving measure.
 A US. citizen and longtime resident operates the country's sole newspaper. The
 editor and two reporters are also U.S. citizens.
 In September the Nitijela passed a resolution expressing its displeasure over pub-
 lic comments attributed to a prominent US. attorney that were perceived to be criti-
 cal of the Government. The resolution did not repeat what was said, nor did it state
 what the Government found offensive. The resolution demanded that the attorney
 express a formal apology, which he did in a letter to the President.
 The Government publishes a monthly gazette containing official news and notices
 only.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and this is observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion
 and this is observed in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad. Neither emi-
 gration nor repatriation is restricted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens this right and it is exercised in practice. The
 Government is chosen by secret ballot in free and open elections every 4 years. Suf-
 frage is universal for those 18 years of age and older. The formation of political par-
 ties is not restricted, although political activity by aliens is prohibited. The Marshall
 Islands, however, has had the same President since 1979, due primarily to tradi-
 tional loyalties and concentrated political influence.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. A woman currently serves as the Minister of Education, and two women serve
 in deputy minister positions. The mayor of Majuro, the country's capital and prin-
 cipal urban center, also is a woman. Although women's role in government is in-
 creasing, they remain under represented in Parliament and other government posi-
 tions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations have been formed. No international human rights organization has ex-
 pressed interest or concern or visited the country.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color lan-
 uage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 family status, or descent, and the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-Inheritance of property and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with
 women occupying positions of importance within the traditional system. No in-
 stances of unequal pay for equal work or sex-related job discrimination were re-
 ported.
 There are occasional allegations of violence against women, mainly related to do-
 mestic abuse. According to the Government's public health office and women's
 groups, only a few such cases are reported to the authorities every year, but many
 more are believed to go unreported. Although assault is a criminal offense, women
 are reluctant to prosecute their spouses.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and education, but these have not been adequate to meet the
 needs of the country's sharply increasing population. The Domestic Relations
 Amendment of 1993 defines child abuse and neglect and makes them criminal of-
 fenses. Other legislation requires teachers, caregivers, and other persons to report
 instances of child abuse and exempts them from civil or criminal liability. According
 to the Attorney General's office, however, the child abuse law is vague and difficult
 to apply. That office at year's end had the law under study with a view to proposing
 revisions which would make it mere clear and practical. Child abuse is thought to
 be relatively uncommon, and there have been no child abuse prosecutions.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation specifically prohibiting discrimi-
 nation based on disability. Until 1994 there were no building codes, and there is
 still no legislation requiring access for the disabled. There have been no reported
 instances of discrimination against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Government interprets this right as allowing the exist-
 ence of labor unions; however, none has been formed to date. The Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no im-
 pediments to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. Wages in
 the cash economy are determined by market factors in accordance with the mini-
 mum wage and other laws.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits invol-
 untary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law does not prohibit the em-
 ployment of children. Children are not typically employed in the wage economy, but
 some assist their families with fishing, agriculture, and other small-scale family en-
 terprises. The law requires compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14; but the
 Government does not enforce this law due to a lack of classrooms and teachers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in this subsistence economy, where extended families are expected to help less fortu-
 nate family members. The minimum hourly wage for all government and private
 sector employees is $1.50. (The U.S. dollar is the local currency.) The Ministry of
 Resources and Development oversees minimum wage regulations, and its oversight
 has been considered adequate. Foreign employees and Marshallese trainees of pri-
 vate employers who have invested in or established a business in the country are
 exempt from minimum wage requirements. This exemption does not affect a signifi-
 cant segment of the work force. There is no legislation concerning maximum hours
 of work or occupational safety and health, although most businesses are closed on
 Sundays. In 1994, in an attempt to cut government spending, legislation was passed
 to shorten the workweek of most government employees.
 A Labor Board makes recommendations to the Nit**ela on working conditions, e.g.,
 minimum wage, work hours, overtime payments, and occupational health and safety
 standards in accordance with International Labor Organization conventions. The
 Board meets periodically and is open to the public. There is no legislation specifi-
 cally giving workers the right to remove themselves from situations which endager
 their health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment, and no legis-
 lation protecting workers who file complaints about such conditions.
