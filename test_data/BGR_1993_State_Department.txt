 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. President Zhelyu Zhelev, former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces
 (UDF), was elected in January 1992 to a 5-year term in the country's first direct
 presidential elections. After a UDF government fell in October 1992, and the UDF
 and Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) each failed to form a government, the Move-
 ment for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), mainly representing the ethnic Turkish mi-
 
 
 816
 nority, nominated centrist economist Lyuben Berov as its candidate for Prime Min-
 ister. Lacking a stable parliamentary majority during 1993, Berov was forced to de-
 pend on the BSP, heir to the Bulgarian Communist party structure, for much of his
 support.
 Te UDF, formerly the largest parliamentary bloc, was weakened by internal divi-
 sions in 1993. A UDF-supported hunger strike by a Member of Parliament (M.P.),
 aimed at bringing down the Berov Government and forcing the President to resign,
 ended when President Zhelev gave provisional support to the idea of earlier-than-
 required parliamentary elections in 1994. The BSP adopted a policy designed to re-
 duce further the President's already circumscribed powers and to reassert itself as
 the strongest force in the three branches of government.
 Most security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which
 controls the police, National Security Service (civilian counterintelligence), internal
 security troops, border guards, and special forces. The President oversees the Na-
 tional Intelligence Service (foreign intelligence). There were few accusations of ille-
 gal wiretapping in 1993, compared to previous years. Some allegations that police
 used excessive force, particularly against Gypsies, were substantiated by domestic
 and international human rights groups. Human rights groups made credible asser-
 tions that a police bill passed in December gives police forces excessively broad pow-
 ers of search and entry without first obtaining a warrant.
 The transition to a market economy continued, albeit slowly and against political
 and social resistance. Restitution of shops and houses that were confiscated by the
 communists in the 1940's has put capital into the hands of many ordinary Bul-
 garians, helping fuel rapidly growing consumer goods and service sectors. However,
 privatization of state-owned industry moved slowly, as did the breakup of state-or-
 ganized collective farms. Bilateral agreements with members of the European Free
 Trade Association entered into force, and a bilateral investment treaty with the
 United States concluded in 1992 was expected to enter into force in 1994. Bulgaria
 reached preliminary agreement with its private creditors to restructure $10 billion
 of defaulted commercial debt, but had not concluded a standby agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund by year's end.
 Bulgaria's human rights performance continued to be generally good in 1993.
 Freedom of press, assembly, religion, speech, association, and travel were respected,
 with some significant exceptions. Although the Government made some e orts to
 address the specific difficulties of minority groups and to investigate alleged human
 rights violations, xenophobia, nationalism, and antiethnic expression increased no-
 ticeably among the population at large. Gypsies (Roma) continued to be the target
 of police beatings and other excessive force; the Government investigated only a few
 such incidents. Constitutional provisions against ethnically based political parties
 continued to pose a potential threat to the legality of the MRF and to prevent the
 participation of parties representing Gypsy interests. Western missionaries and
 some Bulgarian religious groups reported harassment.
 The Government dismissed several key figures in the state-owned media for so-
 called antigovernment activity. Parliament passed an anti-Communist "lustration"
 bill (see Section L.a.), upheld by the Constitutional Court, which resulted in a sig-
 nificant number of dismissals in the scientific and academic communities. Par-
 liament also annulled census results in two towns in the southwest, on the question-
 able basis that citizens there had beeen pressured into declaring themselves ethnic
 Turkish. Overall, little progress was made toward passing legislation needed to im-
 plement the rights enshrined in the Constitution or toward establishing a clear judi-
 cial basis for addressing human rights complaints.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or extrajudicial killing in 1993. Three prisoners who killed a guard while
 escaping were recaptured and reportedly beaten to death. The Government and a
 human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) are investigating the incident.
 One policeman was convicted of wrongful death in the shooting of an ethnic Turkish
 individual who lived in the Gypsy community, although his conviction was over-
 turned by a higher court.
 One Bulgarian human rights group alleged that the 1992 death of MRF deputy
 Svilen Kapsuzov in an automobile accident was a case of political murder. No direct
 evidence of murder emerged during the trial, although circumstantial evidence lent
 some credence to the charge. The driver of the car which struck Kapsuzov's car, re-
 portedly a former state security agent, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
 
 
 817
 A parliamentary commission charged with investigating the case neither confirmed
 nor dismissed the allegations.
 Many observers expressed concern about the fatal shootings by police of two Ira-
 nians suspected of being involved with a drug ring and of being responsible for the
 earlier death of two policemen. The shootings, and the Ministry of Interior's han-
 dling of the brief investigation which followed, led some observers to question
 whether the intent of the police was to apprehend the suspects or to seek revenge
 for the deaths of their fellow officers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment, forcible assimilation, and subjection to medical, scientific, or other experimen-
 tation without consent.
 A number of credible reports described police beatings of Gypsies during arrest
 and mistreatment during incarceration. In one particularly egregious case, police ar-
 rested on suspicion of attempted theft a 33-year-old male Gypsy and brutally beat
 him during interrogation. Doctors later told local human rights representatives that
 his injuries-several broken ribs on both sides of his chest-most probably resulted
 later surgically removed part of the victim's ung and kidney.
 The Government is conducting an investigation. In another case, a 14-year-old
 Gypsy was severely beaten upon arrest; the local prosecutor's office declined to initi-
 ate an investigation. To date, no police have been convicted and punished for brutal-
 ity against minorities.
 In April in the town of Novi Pazar, a force of more than 50 police arrived at ap-
 proximately 4 a.m. without a written search warrant and forcibly entered a number
 of homes in search of suspected criminals. Police were dressed in plainclothes or
 camouflage uniforms, and some wore masks. According to witnesses, the police
 failed to identify themselves. Witnesses reported that police indiscriminately beat
 men, women, and children of the Gypsy community. Fifty arrests were made. The
 Government initiated no investigation of the incident. By the end of the ear, all
 but six of the detainees had been charged with minor crimes and releasedon bail
 or on their own recognizance.
 A ministry of Interior investigation into a similar case in Pazarjik in 1992 was
 concluded in 1993. The Ministry announced it had found no evidence of serious
 transgressions but declined requests to release the report for examination by inde-
 pendent observers.
 Conditions in some prisons are substandard, although they do not appear to
 threaten life or health, and overcrowding problems eased in 1993. Prisoners' com-
 laints received media coverage and in some cases resulted in improved treatment.
 he Government cooperated with requests by NCO's to monitor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for access to
 legal counsel from the time of detention. Judicial authorities must rule on the legal-
 ity of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the right to visits by family
 members, to examine evidence, and to know the charges against them. Charges may
 not be made public wihth   he permission of the chief prosecutor. Pretrial detention
 is limited to 2 months under normal circumstances, although this may be extended
 to 6 months at the discretion of the chief prosecutor, who may also restart the proc-
 ess.
 Approximately 30 percent of Bulgaria's 8,000 prison inmates are in pretrial deten-
 tion (see Section c.). In the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention
 is credited toward the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detain-
 ees have been released under this provision, although bail is not widely used.
 Neither internal nor external exile is used as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Under permissittion, cs uthe judicia  is grnted
 independent and oequal status with the legislature and executive branci. The
 court system consists of regional courts, district courts, the Supreme Court, and the
 Constitutional Court. A Supreme Court of Cassation, provided for in the Constitu-
 tion, has not yet been established. The Constitution stipulates that all court hear-
 ings shall be public unless the proceedings involve state security or state secrets.
 There were no reported complaints about limited access to courtroom proceedings.
 Defendants have the right to know the charges against them and are given ample
 time to prepare a defense. They are considered innocent until proven guilty and are
 guaranteed the right of appeal which is widely used. Defendants in criminal pro-
 ceedings have the right to confront witnesses and to have an attorney, provided by
 the State, if necessa   s , in serious cases.
 The Constitutiorare Court rles on mmtters of constitutionality. The Supreme
 Court serves as a court of appeal for cases not directly constitutional in nature. Mili-
 tary courts handle cases involving military personnel and some cases involving na-
 
 
 818
 tional security matters. The Constitutional Court does not have specific jurisdiction
 in matters of military justice.
 Most observers agreed that the judiciary, while generally independent, struggled
 with continuing problems in 1993. Judicial salaries were relatively low, and many
 positions remained unfilled, creating a heavy backlog of cases and sparking com-
 plaints that pretrial detention was excessively lengthy. Partly as a legacy of com-
 munism, and partly because of the court system's structural and personnel prob-
 lems, the public at large has little confidence in the judicial system. Many credible
 legal experts from Pariament, as well as voices on the Constitutional Court, con-
 demned attempts, spearheaded by the BSP in late October, to amend the current
 law on the judiciary while a reform judiciary law was already in its second reading.
 These experts noted that the amendments would establish intrusive legislative
 branch control over the tenure of judges in office. They noted further that the pro-
 posed amendments' qualifications or service as Chief Prosecutor or as a member of
 the High Judicial Council, the judiciarys policymaking body, required such a long
 term of prior legal service that unly jurists and judges who had served during the
 era of former Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov would be eligible. Observers ob-
 jected as well to the irregular way in which the BSP and its supporters voted the
 amendments out of committee in the absence of a quorum for the vote. The amend-
 ments passed a first reading the early November. They may be subsumed under the
 reform judiciary law.
 A number of criminal cases against former Communist leaders were carried for-
 ward in 1993. Some observers characterized these indictments as part of the democ-
 ratization process while others viewed the trials as politically motivated. Todor
 Zhivkov appealed his 1992 conviction for abuse of power involving personal expense
 accounts and state privileges. In August he was indicted on a charge of embezzle-
 ment for giving grant aid to Communist regimes in other countries; 10 other former
 leaders, including former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov, were also indicted in the
 "Moscow case." Some human rights observers criticized these indictments, asserting
 the activities in question were political and economic decisions, not criminal acts.
 The Chief Prosecutor responded that the transfer of funds had been carried out
 without parliamentary approval and was thus illegal. In another case, former Prime
 Minister Georgi Atanasov and former Minister of Economy and Planning Stoyan
 Ovcharov were convicted of embezzlement of state funds and sentenced to 10 and
 9 years in prison, respectively. The Supreme Court upheld these convictions, and
 both men went to prison.
 The first indictments relating to the forced assimilation and expulsion of ethnic
 Turks in 1984-85 and 1989 were handed down, and a trial began for five defendants
 who were members of the security services. The Chief Prosecutor asked Parliament
 to strip BSP MP Dimitur Velev of his immunity in this case, but Parliament de-
 clined. Former dictator Zhivkov, former Prime Minister Atanasov, and former Inte-
 rior Minister Dimitur Stoyanov were indicted and are scheduled to go on trial in
 February 1994. Another criminal trial was launched in connection with the notori-
 ous prison camps set up by the Communists after they came to power in 1944. The
 defense claimed that the statute of limitations had expired and two of the five origi-
 nal defendants have died, but proceedings in a regional court continued against the
 remaining three. Finally, two former Communist party leaders were convicted of
 failing to inform the public of health dangers related to the Chernobyl nuclear reac-
 tor accident and received short prison terms.
 The Constitutional Court upheld the controversial 1992 lustration act, the Law
 for Additional Requirements toward Scientific Organizations and the Higher Cer-
 tifying Commission, or "Panev law'. Under this law, former secretaries and mem-
 bers of Communist party committees are barred from positions as academic council
 members, university department heads, deans, rectors, and chief editors of science
 magazines. Several hundred people reportedly lost positions under this law. Some
 of these acknowledged past Communist associations, while others were dismissed
 for refusing to sign a declaration saying they had had no such associations. The
 Panev law applies a presumption of collective guilt that is clearly in conflict with
 international human rights standards.
 The Penal Procedural Code gives prosecutors the right to remove appointed and
 elected officials with little satisfactory recourse. A local prosecutor removed the
 mayor of Satovcha from office on charges he had falsified documents and abused his
 administrative powers by intimidating Pomaks (Muslims of Slavic ancestry) into
 changing their names from Slavic to Turkish versions. The charge of intimidation
 was later dropped, and the mayor appealed his suspension to the court. The appeal
 was unsuccessful, and in November he was formally indicted.
 Human rights groups complain that local prosecutors and magistrates sometimes
 fail to pursue vigorously crimes committed against minorities. Bulgaria has no polit-
 
 
 ical prisoners, although it appears that political motives lie behind some indict-
 ments of former Communist leaders.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution stipulates inviolability of the home, protects the freedom and confiden-
 tiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to choose one's place of work
 and residence. A bill regulating police activities was passed and went into effect in
 December. Several human rights groups made credible charges that the new law,
 which allows police under some circumstances to enter homes without first obtain-
 ing a warrant, was unconstitutional because it provided excessively broad powers
 of search and entry. Compared to previous years, there were few charges of illegal
 monitoring of correspondence or telephone conversations during 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution prohibits censorship of the
 press and mass media. The variety of newspapers published by political parties and
 other organizations represented the full spectrum of political opinion. Foreign news-
 papers circulated without hindrance, and Turkish-langu e newspapers appeared
 regularly. A Gypsy-language paper stopped publishing or inancial reasons. One ex-
 ception to freedom of the press was the confisation of newspapers published by the
 illegal ethnic Macedonian group UMO-Ilinden (see Section 2.b.). Some self-censor-
 ship exists among journalists who must conform to what are often heavily politicized
 editorial views. rn other cases, large financial groups that hold interests in several
 nominally independent newspapers intervened directly to control editorial content.
 A new Penal Code article makes it a crime to publish information about the ac-
 tivities of internal security police. Although not invoked during 1993, the article rep-
 resents a potential stifling of press freedom.
 Television remains a state monopoly under parliamentary supervision. Two chan-
 nels broadcast in Bulgarian, while a third broadcasts Russian programming. For-
 eign government radio programs such as British Broadcasting Corporation and
 Voice of America had unrestricted access to commercial Bulgarian radio frequencies.
 Television and radio news programs present opposition views but are generally seen
 as being biased in favor of the Government. There are no formal restrictions on pro-
 gramming. Some political groups complained that coverage was one-sided, although
 they acknowledged that their representatives were interviewed regularly. Opinion
 polls rate television as the most credible news source. Both television and radio pro-
 vide a variety of news and public interest programming, including talk shows and
 public opinion shows.
 The Berov Government fired a number of hi~h-level media and communications
 figures. Some of the firings were in retaliation for what it described as
 antigovernmnent political activity, while others were a clear attempt to impose strict-
 er controls over the political content of broadcasts. Among those dismissed were Ste-
 fan Sofianski, head of psts and telecommunications, Acen Agov General Director
 of National Television, and Ivo Indjev, director of the Bulgarian telegraph Agency.
 When the High Court ruled that, as a government employee, Indjev could only be
 fired by Parliament, Parliament voted to remove him legislatively. The cumulative
 effect of these firings was to raise questions about the Berov Government's commit-
 ment to freedom of the electronic media.
 Approximately 30 independent radio stations are licensed in Bulgaria. Some Turk-
 ish-language broadcasting takes place. Radio transmitter facilities are owned by the
 Government. Applications were solicited to operate cable television and radio
 throughout the country.
 Private book publishing remained lively in 1993, with more than 50 publishers
 in business. Academic freedom, with the notable exception of the Panev law de-
 scribed in Section i.e., continued in 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constituti:n provides for
 the right to peaceful and unarmed assembly. Permits are required for rallies and
 assemblies held outdoors, and most legally registered organizations were routinely
 granted permission to assemble. However, several religious groups reported difficul-
 ties obtaining permits for outdoor assemblies. The Sofia municipality reportedly de-
 nied an evangelical group a march permit in September on the grounds the march
 might spark violent rotests by those opposed to "foreign" religious groups. Some
 religious groups also ad difficulties renting assembly halls to which they had pre-
 viously had access. Vigorous political rallies and demonstrations were a common oc-
 currence during 1993 and took place without governmental interference.
 Bulgria, as a member state of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
 rope, has undertaken to respect the right of individuals and groups freely to estab-
 lish their own political parties or other political organizations. Despite this under-
 taking, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions on such activity that limit
 
 
 the right of association and meaningful participation in the political process. For ex-
 ample, the Constitution prohibits organizations that threaten the country's terri-
 tonal integrity or unity or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. In 1990 the
 Government denied registration as a legal organization to a Macedonian rights
 group, UMO-Dinden on the grounds it was separatist, and also denied a subsequent
 appeal. Police forcibly broke up attempts by its members during 1993 to hold public
 meetings. One of UMO-Ilinden's leaders, George Solunski, was arrested in June on
 a charge of attempted murder following an incident in which he allegedly fired a
 shot at a political opponent. The murder charge was later dropped, and Solunski
 was charged instead with "hooliganism" and possession of a small amount of ammu-
 nition in his house without a permit. He remained in pretrial detention at year's
 end, which is uncommon for the charge. TMO-Ilinden, a related cultural group
 which was legally registered and operated freely in 1992, had its registration sus-
 pended at the Chief Prosecutor's request. The suspension was justified on the basis
 that elements of the gup's statutes failed to conform with the law, although the
 Chief Prosecutor's pulilic statements suggested it was actually because of the
 group's alleged separatist activities.
 The Constitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic,
 or racial lines. It prohibits "citizens' associations" from engaging in political activity.
 These restrictions were used in 1991 to challenge the legitimacy of one of the three
 leading political parties, the MRF, which has a mainly ethnic Turkish constituency
 but which is working to broaden its appeal and electoral base to become a national
 party. A Constitutional Court ruling in 1991 preserved the party's legal status, but
 the Court's decision was taken with less than the full bench. Some legal observers
 believe the Court's ruling was definitive, while others think the MRF remains vul-
 nerable to a new challenge to its legal status.
 A Gypsy party, also denied registration in 1991 on the grounds it was ethnically
 based, chose not to challenge this stricture in 1993. A party which professes to rep-
 resent the interests of Bulgaria's Pomak population was registered as a political
 party although its legal status may also be open to challenge.
 c. Aeedom of Religion.-The ability of some religious groups to operate freely
 came under attack in Bulgaria in 1993. Early in the year, there was wide public
 support for the decision of the Berov Government to deny entry to a planeload of
 Swedish evangelists who arrived at Sofia airport without visas. In the wake of that
 incident and extensive press reporting which painted lurid and often inaccurate pic-
 tures of the activities of non-Orthodox religious groups, missionaries began to report
 harassment. Specific problems included difficulties in obtaining visas and residence
 permits and, in one case, a bomb threat against the opening of an evangelical Bible
 college. Hare Krishna followers, physically assaulted in the street and the subject
 of threats, reportedly had difficulty obtaining adequate police protection. A neigh-
 borhood organization in Sofia has petitioned for their eviction. M.P.'s from both the
 UDF and BSP supported this call.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional re-
 ligion of Bulgaria. Religious bodies must register with the Directorate of Religious
 Affairs, or with the courts as a citizens' association. No group was denied registra-
 tion, and more than 30 are officially recognized. A number of major religious bodies,
 including the Muslim and Jewish communities, receive government financial sup-
 port. There were no restrictions on attendance at religious services or on private re-
 ligious instruction. A school for imams, a Muslim cultural center, university theo-
 logical faculties, and religious primary schools operated freely. Many new mosques
 were constructed, especially in the southern regions. Bibles and other religious ma-
 terials in the Bulgarian language were freely imported and printed. Muslim, Catho-
 lic, and Jewish publications were published on a regular basis.
 The 1992 schism in the Orthodox Church appeared to move toward resolution in
 1993, as the Government drew back from involvement in the controversy which
 erupted under the previous government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement within the country and the right to leave it are
 constitutionally enshrined and not limited in practice. Every citizen has the right
 to return to Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expatriated, and may not be deprivedof
 citizenship acquired by birth. A number of former political emigrants were granted
 passports and returned to visit or live in Bulgaria. Bulgaria concluded agreements
 with Poland and Germany for the repatriation of thousands of Bulgarians illegally
 resident in those countries.
 Bulgarian law provides for granting asylum to persons persecuted for their opin-
 ions and activities based on standards in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Sta-
 tus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Parliament in April approved an amendment
 to remove geographical restrictions on Bulgaria's ratification of the Convention and
 
 
 821
 the Protocol. To date, Bulgaria has received few requests for asylum and more often
 serves as a transit point for third-country nationals seeking to travel to the west.
 Official estimates of the number of illegal aliens resident inBulgaria, ranging from
 12,000 to 30,000, appear to be exaggerated. A Bureau of Territorial Asylum and Ref-
 ugees was staffed and funded in 1993 and was to begin processing applications for
 refugee status by early 1994. Approximately 100 persons fleeing the conflict in the
 former Yugoslavia are resident in Bulgaria and have received assistance from the
 Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have and exercise the right to change their government and head of state
 through the election of the President and members of the National Assembly, but
 restrictions on parties based on religious, ethnic, or racial identities have the effect
 of circumscribing access to the political process (see Section 2.b.). The most recent
 parliamentary elections took place in October 1991, when more than 40 parties and
 coalitionsparticipated. At the same time, Bulgarians voted in the first multiparty
 elections for lca government since the Communist era. In January 1992, incum-
 bent (appointed) President Zhelyu Zhelev was elected in Bulgaria's first direct presi-
 dential elections.
 A parliamentary commission charged with an investigation into the 1991 elections
 failed to reach a consensus. UDF members of the commission complained that vote
 fraud had taken place. Other members of the commission disputed this charge, and
 independent election observers opined the supporting evidence was inconclusive.
 The Constitution provides for unicameral parliamentary elections by secret ballot.
 The 240 parliamentary deputies are elected by a proportional system from party
 lists. Their term is for 4 years, although the Constitution provides for earlier elec-
 tions if Parliament is unable to agree on a government. Suffrage is universal at the
 age of 18.
 A distinct separation of powers exists between the Government (Prime Minister
 and Cabinet) and the President, who is Chief of State. The President has limited
 poWers and is elected for a term of 5 years. During 1993, as part of ongoingolitical
 i ues, some BSP figures, as well as hard-line elements within the U9 , com-
 plaied that the President had exceeded his constitutional powers. Another chal-
 lengeto the President's power took place during the summer when the UDF mount-
 ed a series of anti-Presidential strikes, but there were resolved through peaceful ne-
 gotiation.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women in gov-
 ernment. A number of women hold elected and appointed office at high levels, in-
 cluding approximately 15 percent of parliamentary seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An increasing number of local and international human rights groups operated
 freely in Bulgaria in 1993. A Bulgarian chapter of Helsinki Th   founded in 1992
 was formally affiliated with the international organization in 1993. This group
 should not be confused with the self-proclaimed Helsinki Watch headed by Rumen
 Vodenicharv, a member of the 1990-91 Grand National Assembly, whose group has
 a strongly nationalistic flavor. Another group, the Helsinki Citizens Alliance, ac-
 tively investigated police-Gypsy clashes and developed a working relationship with
 the Ministry of the Interior. In general, the Government cooperated well with NGO's
 and human rights groups, although such groups often encountered difficulty work-
 ing with local authorities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination. In practice, some instances of discrimination still exist, particularly
 against Gypsies.
 Women.-Most organizations defending women's interests are closely associated
 with political parties or have primarily professional agendas. One nationwide group,
 the Women's Democratic Union of Bulgaa, is heir to the women's up which ex-
 isted under the Zhivkov dictatorship. This group addresses itself primarily to creat-
 ing employment opportunities for women. The Constiution forbids privileges or re-
 strictions of rights on the basis of sex. However, women face discrimination both in
 terms of recruitment and the likelihood of layoffs. Official figures show the rate of
 unemployment for women to he 2.6 percent higher than that for men, and this gap
 appears to be widening. Some obseerals beieve the Labor Code provides relatively
 limited protection for pregnant women and women with small children, although the
 
 
 822
 labor inspection unit of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare has issued a writ-
 ten directive bolstering this protection. While women are equally likely to receive
 university education, some single mothers report difficulty in finding housing, either
 for financial reasons or because their needs are perceived to be less compelling than
 those of men.
 The courts prosecute rape, although it remains an underreported crime because
 some stigma still attaches to the victim. The maximum sentence for rape is 8 years;
 convicted offenders often receive a lesser sentence or early parole. Marital rape is
 a crime but rarely prosecuted. There are no figures on the occurrence of domestic
 violence, and no evidence, either anecdotal or otherwise, that it is either pervasive
 or increasing. No organizations or government agencies exist specifically to provide
 support to victims ofdomestic violence.
 ildren.-The Government appears to be committed to protecting children's wel-
 fare. It maintains, for example, a sizable network of orphanages throughout the
 country. Government efforts in education and health, however, have been con-
 strained by serious budgetary limitations. The vast majority of Bulgaria's approxi-
 mately 1  million children are free from societal abuse. Some Gypsy children, par-
 ticularly those who were homeless or abandoned, were beaten by "skinhead" groups.
 The Helsinki Citizens' Alliance initiated a program to work with Gypsy children.
 There were reports, so far unsubstantiated, that police sexually abused Gypsy mi-
 nors; to date, there has been no response to the reports and no investigation. Some
 Gypsy minors were reportedly forced into prostitution by family or community mem-
 bers.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic Turks and Gypsies make up the two
 largest minorities, each constituting between 6 and 9 percent of the population. The
 overwhelming majority of ethnic Turks are Sunni Muslims, although there are scat-
 tered Shi'ite villages in the eastern Balkan range and Rhodope mountains; relations
 are amicable between the two communities. Pomaks constitute the other sizable mi-
 nority, omprising about 2-3 percent of the population. Sometimes referred to as
 Bulgarian Muslims, Pomaks are a distinct people of Slavic descent whose ancestors
 converted to Islam; most are Muslim, although a handful have become atheists or
 converted to Christianity.
 Economic migration to Turkey continued, although at a reduced pace due to in-
 creased border controls implemented by Turkey. The MRF, supported by the
 Podkrepa trade union confederation, launched a series of strikes in the fall, protest-
 ing low purchase prices for tobacco. While some MRF leaders accused the Govern-
 ment of using economic means deliberately to drive ethnic Turks out of the country,
 the Government's decision to retain control of tobacco purchasing appeared to be
 motivated by a desire to obtain revenues. The Ministry of Labor prepared plans to
 relieve unemployment in hard-hit minority areas in the south and northwest, but
 these plans had not been put into operation by year's end.
 There are no restrictions on the practice of Muslim religious traditions, the speak-
 ing of Turkish in public, or the use of non-Slavic names. A government-funded pro-
 gram which paid administrative costs for those who wished to take Turkish-version
 names endedin November. Some ethnic Turks protested that the program should
 be extended, but this appears to be an administrative rather than a human rights
 issue. Voluntary Turkish-language classes continued and expanded in areas with
 significant Turkish-speaking populations and more than 400 teachers graduated
 from Turkish training in institutes in Kurjahi and Shumen. By year's end, only
 17,000 ethnic Turkish students throughout the country were believed to be without
 access to Turkish-language classes. Most complaints about language classes by eth-
 nic Turks stemmed from a desire either to have more hours per week of such classes
 or to make them compulsory in largely ethnic Turkish areas.
 The results of a census conducted in December 1992 caused controversy. Those
 who consider themselves ethnic Macedonians complained they were unable to iden-
 tify themselves as such on the census form. Others, especially members of the BSP
 and the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), accused members
 of the ethnic Turkish community of "forcible Turkification," i.e., pressuring members
 of the Muslim community to declare themselves ethnic Turks and take Turkish
 names. On the basis of an investigation into these charges, Parliament in Septem-
 ber annulled census results in two towns in the southwest. Independent observers
 found community and peer pressure but no evidence of forcible Turkification. There
 were credible reports that some Muslim religious figures refused to bury Muslims
 with Slavic names, which some observers saw as an encroachment on religious free-
 dom.
 In the 1992 census, approximately 3.4 percent of the population identified itself
 as Gypsy (Roma), although the real number is believed to be much higher since
 many individuals of Gypsy descent tend to identify themselves as ethnic Turks or
 
 
 823
 ethnic Bulgarians to the authorities. Gypsy groups continued to be divided among
 themselves, although a newly formed federation had some success in presenting na-
 tional Gypsy issues to the Government. As individuals and as an ethnic group, Gyp-
 sies faced apparently rising levels of discrimination. Several local citizens' groups
 with antiethnic agendas attacked Gypsy clubs and neighborhoods. Many newspapers
 routinely attribute crimes to Gypsies before any formal investigation has taken
 place. The quality of Gypsy housing is relatively poor, with many houses still lack-
 ing water, electricity, and sewage facilities. Gypsies reportedly encounter difficulties
 aplying for social benefits. Rural Gypsies are discouraged from claiming land to
 whi c they are entitled under the law dividing up agricultural collectives. Domestic
 and international human rights groups substantiated a significant number of re-
 ports of police mistreatment of Gypsies upon arrest and during incarceration. These
 included severe beatings that resulted in serious injuries (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government is beginning to recognize the discrimination Gypsies face. The
 Ministry of Labor launched a pilot work-literacy program in Plovdiv, and the Min-
 istry of Education introduced a Gypsy-language schoolbook into a number of schools
 in areas with Gypsy populations. The Ministry of Interior launched an investigation
 into allegations of po lice brutality in Stara Zagora. The Council of Ministers agreed
 to set up a special governmental council on Gypsy problems. A number of Gypsy
 police were hired, 10 in Plovdiv alone. The first teachers received Roma-language
 training, although this program lagged far behind its Turkish-language counterpart
 and ran into significant local opposition.
 Thousands of Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest, identify themselves as Mac-
 edonians, most for historical and geographic reasons. Members of the two organiza-
 tions which purport to defend the interests of ethnic Macedonians, UMO-linden and
 TMO-Ilinden, are believed to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.).
 Workplace discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Gypsies. Employers justify such discrimination on the basis of their relatively
 low training and education levels. Supervisory jobs are generally given to ethnic
 Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Pomaks, and, particularly, Gypsies often
 being among the first to be laid off.
 During compulsory military service most members of minorities are shunted into
 labor units in which they often perform civilian as well as military construction and
 maintenance instead of serving in normal military units. Only a few ethnic Turkish
 officers, and reortedly no Gypsy officers, serve in the armed forces.
 People with isabilities.-Disabled persons receive a range of financial assistance,
 including free public transportation, reduced prices on modified automobiles, and
 free equipment such as wheelchairs. The Government in 1993 worked with the
 Union for Handicapped Persons to launch a pilot project to improve access to rail
 transportation. Handicapped persons have access to university training and to hous-
 ing and employment, although no special programs are in place to allow them to
 live up to their full employment potential. To date, little effort has been made to
 change building or street layouts to help blind or otherwise handicapped persons.
 Also, policies under the previous regime that deliberately separated mentally and
 physically handicapped persons, including children, often placing them in institu-
 tions andworkplaces remote from the larger cities, have persisted.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution guarantees the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choice. This right appears to have
 been freely exercised in 1993. Estimates of the unionized share of the work force
 range from 30 to 50 percent. This share is shrinking as large firms lay off workers,
 and most new positions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.
 Bulgaria has two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independ-
 ent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (CITUB), and Podkrepa. CITUB, the successor to the
 trade union controlled by the former Communist regime, now appears to operate as
 an independent entity. Podkrepa, the independent confederation created in 1989,
 was one of the earliest opposition forces but is no longer a member of the UDF. The
 two confederations work together on some tactical issues, particularly in the coun-
 try's tripartite body, the National Social Council, which includes employers and gov-
 ernment. Podkrepa's founder, Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, continued to play an active
 role in union and political affairs despite being indicted in a crimina investigation
 concerning a fire in the former security service headquarters.
 Military, police, energy production and supply, and health sectors are defined as
 essential services, and workers in these sectors are restricted from striking. The Na-
 tional Social Council played a major role in political life in 1993, determining pen-
 sion levels, the minimum wage, and cost-of-living adjustments. It also considered
 
 
 824
 legislation which had an impact on labor and agreed on a split of union property
 between the two main labor confederations.
 The Labor Code passed in December 1992 recognizes the right to strike when
 other means of conflict resolution have been exhausted, but political strikes are for-
 bidden. Only one major national strike took place in 1993, a miners' strike called
 in December which had not been resolved at the end of the year. A teachers' strike
 was resolved with some concessions by the Government, as were local strikes by
 arms production workers and transport workers. Legal actions initiated against
 some unions in 1992 on the grounds that their activities violated the constitutional
 prohibition against political activities by citizens' associations (defined to include
 trade unions) were still pendi  at year's end. Until the limitations of this constitu-
 tional clause are more clearly defined, either by legislation or judicial precedent, in-
 ap ropriate attacks on legitimate union activities will likely continue.
 8n a first reading, the International Labor Organization s (ILO) Committee of Ex-
 perts expressed satisfaction with the Labor Codes prvisions barring job discrimina-
 tion. Noting two Constitutional Court rulings which found that legislation excluding
 Communist party officials from elective positions on the boards of banks and exclud-
 ing employment in a management position of a Communist organization as counting
 for pensionable services were in violation of Convention 111, the COE requested fur-
 ther information on lustration proceedings, on measures directed at compensating
 ethnic Turks for abuses under the previous regime, on efforts taken to improve the
 economic condition of minorities, and on measures to promote equality of workplace
 opportunity between men and women. The Committee on Freedom of Association re-
 jected CITUB's contention that a 1991 law confiscating the assets acquired by Com-
 munist organizations since 1944 violated the principles of freedom of association,
 but stated that this should not include voluntary contributions paid by CITUB mem-
 bers since 1990 and urged the Government to settle the trade union assets question
 in consultation with the trade unions. There are no restrictions on affiliation or con-
 tact with international labor organizations, and Bulgarian unions actively exercise
 this Tight.
 b. 7%e Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which was practiced both nationally and on a local level. Only
 Podkrepa and CITUB are authorized to bargain collectively. This led to complaints
 by smauer unions, which may in individual workplaces have more members than
 either of the two large confederations. Smaller unions also complained that they
 were excluded from the National Social Council.
 The Labor Code's prohibitions against antiunion discrimination include protection
 against dismissal as a form of retribution for a period of 6 months. While these pro-
 visions appear to be within international norms, there is no specific mechanism for
 resolving complaints, and the burden of proof in such a case rests entirely on the
 employee. There were no cases in which an employer was found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination and required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. The
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions charged that the revised Labor
 Code does not provide effective protection against acts of antiunion discrimination.
 It also categorized the "national representation" requirement as constituting a sub-
 stantive violation of the right to organize and criticized the provision making nego-
 tiation of individual contracts possible regardless of existing collective agreements.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards pre-
 vails in Bulgaria's export processing zones which, at year's end, appear to exist only
 on paper.
 c. Prhibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Some observers suggested that the practice of shunting mili-
 tary draftees who are members of minorities or conscientious objectors into work
 units that sometimes work on civilian construction projects could be considered a
 form of forced labor (Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age for employment at 16; the minimum for dangerous work is set at 18. Employers
 and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare are responsible for enforcing these
 provisions. Child labor laws are enforced well in the formal sector. Some underage
 employment occurs in the informal and agricultural sectors, although the practice
 is neither widespread nor systematic.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The National Social Council adjusted the mini-
 mum wage on several occasions in 1993, although not enough to keep pace with in-
 flation. At the end of the year it stood at approximately $45 (1,434 leva) a month.
 Inflation in 1993, estimated at 65 percent, dramatically increased the cost of living.
 The minimum wage is not enough for a single wage earner to provide a decent
 standard of living or a family. The Constitution stipulates the right to social secu-
 rity and welfare aid and assistance for the temporarily unemployed.
 
 
 The Labor Codeprovides for a standard workweek of 40 hours, with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Welfare. Enforcement is effective in the state sector but much
 weaker in the emerging private sector.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program with standards established by the
 Labor Code. The Constitution states that employees are entitled to healthy and
 nonhazardous working conditions. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is re-
 sponsible for enforcing these provisions. Under the Labor Code, an employee has the
 right to remove himself from a work situation which presents a serious or  mme-
 diate danger to life or health without jeopardizing continued employment. In prac-
 tice, refusal to work in situations with relatively high accident rates or associated
 chronic health problems would result in loss of employment for many workers. Con-
 ditions appear to be worsening owing to budget stringencies and a growing private
 sector in which labor inspectors have not yet made a concerted effort, due in part
 to the difficulty in locating the many smallunlicensed businesses which do not pay
 taxes and do not have other links to government entities.
