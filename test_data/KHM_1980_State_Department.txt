 KA UCHEA
 'he central features of human rights in Kampuchea are the
 continuing violation by Vietnam of the Khmer nation's and
 people's right to national integrity and sovereignty, the
 repressive policies of both the Heng Samrin and Pol Pot
 contenders for power, and the thin margin of survival
 for most Khmer. Two hundred thousand Vietnamese troops
 continue to occupy and administer Kampuchea, two years after
 the invasion and overthrow of the brutally oppressive Pol Pot
 Democratic Kampuchea (DK) regime. Vietnamese forces and
 administrators stand above the law with respect to any and
 all human rights for the Khmer people. The Hanoi-controlled
 Heng Samrin administration has facilitated some resuscita-
 tion of normal Kampuchean life, but has been callous in
 providing basic food and medical needs to all but those
 Khmer who work directly within or around the administration
 Heng Samrin and his Vietnamese sponsors are attempting to
 construct.
 Ordinary Khmer are left out, despite large-scale interna-
 tional relief donated to Kampuchea for their benefit. The
 Khmer people are caught between their fears of a restoration
 to power by the Pol Pot regime, of the dangers of associating
 or not associating with the fledgling Heng Samrin administra-
 tion, and of the political and police network they see the
 Vietnamese erecting in Kampuchea.
 In the regions controlled by the People's R'public of
 Kampuchea (PRK), there have been improvements, if circum-
 scribed, in educational, cultural, and religious activities.
 The Khmer people, largely on their own initiative, have
 begun reconstruction of a rudimentary economy, based on
 trading of commodities from international relief, from the
 Thai-Kampuchean border, and from their own foraging for
 survival. There has been no institutional progress which
 promises any relief on the human rights front; the establish-
 ment in 1979-80 of a PRK police apparatus concerns many Khmer
 about their future in the PRK.
 The DK discarded in late 1979 most of its state institutions
 and the role of some major personalities shifted, but these
 changes did not ease the profound alienation between the
 regime and most of the population. Only limited information
 is available on the DK administration in 1980.
 Small-scale conflict continues throughout most of central
 and western Kampuchea.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 Neither the DK nor PRK (Heng Samrin) has a codified legal,
 judicial, or constitutional system and,' therefore, there is
 currently no legal protection or recourse in Kampuchea for
 the integrity of the person in Kampuchea.
 a. Torture
 Knowledgeable Khmer citizens and Khmer refugees, based on
 their contacts with inmates or from personal experience,
 report instances of torture in both DK and PRK controlled
 areas of Kampuchea.
 
 
 625
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 While summary executions reportedly were carried out regularly
 by the DK regime from 1975 to 1978, very limited information
 available in 1980 suggests that such executions occur for
 serious offenses, but they no longer appear to be widespread.
 There are no reports of summary executions by PRK authorities,
 but Khmer allege that Vietnamese troops summarily kill Khmer
 thought to be associated with the resistance forces.
 According to one second-hand report, in the central prison
 in Phnom Penh there is no provision of medical care or
 medicines, clothing or soap, and there are cases of
 malnutrition among the prisoners. Some prisoners are
 reportedly kept in total isolation and darkness. Some in-
 mates allegedly were beaten to death.
 c. Disappearances
 People reportedly "disappear" in areas controlled by both
 the DK and PRK. In the latter, most are thought to be
 imprisoned. Families are unable to account for their
 relatives who "disappear" in the DK or PRK penal system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although no adequate information is available, there are
 reports that roughly 2,000 Khmer are currently held as
 political prisoners in Phnom Penh by PRK authorities. There
 are also reports of frequent arrests by PRK and Vietnamese
 authorities in rural areas of those suspected of cooperating
 with resistance forces. No numerical information is
 available on those arrested by the DK, although arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment were common when they ruled in
 Phnom Penh. There is no habeas corpus or other equivalent
 practice in the DK or PRK system. Those arrested are held
 for varying lengths of time without legal recourse.
 Preventive detention exists in both the DK and PRK and its
 terms are open-ended.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In neither the DK nor PRK controlled areas are there trials,
 counsel, defense, or courts. Charges are vague and
 frequently unspecified. There is no judiciary separate from
 the executive. There is no appeal in either the DR or PRK
 controlled areas.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are no prohibitions against invasion of the home in the
 DK or PRK controlled areas. No warrant is required. Local
 authorities exercise this practice at will in both the areas.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Khmer people were narrowly rescued from massive starvation
 in late 1979 by the winter crop of 1979-80 and international
 relief, but the mArgin of survival has remained fragile
 throughout most of 1980. The 1980 winter crop appears to be
 comparatively. good and could move the Khmer a major  step back
 toward self-sufficiency, which possibly could be attained in
 1982. The economy remains one of the world's most rudimentary
 after it was systematically destroyed during the rule of
 Pol Pot.
 
 
 626
 Kampuchea has no foreign exchange and has been dependent
 totally on international assistance to operate. The non-
 communist world has provided more than a half billion
 dollars since late 1979, principally food, seeds, farm
 implements, medicines and fishing nets. The Soviets and the
 East Europeans claim to have budgeted over 200 million
 dollars in aid since 1979. Vietnam claims to have provided
 aid worth 118 million dollars during the same period.
 During 1980, the PRK issued a new currency, the first since
 the monetary system was abolished in 1975, denominated as
 the riel. The riel was backed by nothing, but was equated
 originally at one kilo of rice per riel. Early in 1980 the
 basic commercial economy was resuscitated largely by the
 Khmer people themselves, dependent in considerable measure
 on trade through a free market link to the Thai-Khmer
 border, pilfering of supplies provided through international
 relief through Phnom Penh, and through the labors of Khmer
 themselves such as gathering firewood, fishing, foraging,
 and raising vegetables.
 The PRK has used international relief to build its adminis-
 tration. Until April 1980 relief workers at all levels of
 the administration were paid in internationally-provided
 relief commodities, based on the individual's rank in the
 government, military or party, or the type of work done.
 This included roughly 250,000 Khmer employed by the
 administration throughout Kampuchea. The PRK administration
 provided only miniscule quantities of rice (1-2 kilos or
 less) to rural Khmer who did not work for the administra-
 tion. By its "own admission, the PRK did not provide more
 than token amounts to the rural Khmer who were expected to
 fend for themselves through foraging or raising their own
 vegetables and other produce. Perhaps one million Khmer,
 mainly in western Kampuchea, were saved from starvation by
 relief provided through the unofficial landbridge across the
 Thai-Khmer border, over the objections of the PRK and
 Vietnamese, who denounced the operation as a plot to
 feed resistance forces.
 After abolishing the communes of the Pol Pot era, the PRK
 administration established work solidarity teams to farm
 collective lands in the villages. Villagers thus far are
 also allowed small private plots to cultivate vegetables and
 other crops. Taxes were not levied on the meagre 1979-80
 winter crop, but the administration has not announced its
 plans yet for the coming harvest. The question of land
 ownership has not yet been defined clearly by the PRK.
 Sanitationand medical services remain at very low levels.
 Disease is prevalent. The PRK for a long time refused to
 admit non-communist foreign medical teams. Even medical teams
 from Eastern Europe (there are four in Kampuchea) have had
 difficulty in obtaining visas. Despite numerous offers, only
 five International Committee of the Red Cross teams--i
 Swedish, 4 East European teams-even now have been allowed
 into the area controlled by the PRK, despite the fact that
 only fifty doctors survived the Pol Pot regime. The medical
 school in Phnom Penh has been reopened. Provincial hospitals,
 district clinics and village dispensaries have been reopened,
 but medicines are in extremely short supply. Provincial
 hospitals usually are staffed by one Vietnamese and one
 Khmer doctor. District and village facilities have nurses
 and medics with only minimal training. Internationally-
 donated medicines are in rare supply and are frequently sold
 in the state facilities at prices too high for most Khmer.
 
 
 627
 Religious beliefs are not an asset politically in either the
 DR or PRK. The DK eliminated religious practices during its
 reign, derobed 70,000 monks, .and turned some 2850 pagodas,
 some churches and mosques into warehouses or converted them
 to other secular use. Many were destroyed. The PRK admin-
 istration has tolerated the return of some religious practices.
 Officials in Phnom Penh claim that 1553 monks have been re-
 robed and that 510 pagodas are again functioning. Only
 monks over 50 years of age are allowed to re-robe.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The PRK and DK attempt to control tightly all travel within
 the regions under their control. Passes are required for
 internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous in the PRK areas and require bribes to cross even
 with passes in hand. A system of neighborhood surveillance,
 modeled after the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) system,
 has now been introduced to control the population in the
 PRK. Nonetheless, thousands of Khmer have been able to move
 around the country and to the Thai-Khmer border searching
 for food. Only the very top DK and PRK officials are allowed
 to travel to foreign countries. Emigration is not regularized,
 but cadres of both sides allow Khmer to go to the Thai
 border searching for food or refuge. Since it was ousted
 from Phnom Penh, the DK has urged Khmer to repatriate them-
 selves and has agreed to cooperate in repatriations, which
 in fact it has done. The PRK has stated a willingness to
 permit repatriation through official discussions either
 directly with the PRK administration or through such organs
 as national Red Cross societies. Both the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross have held discussions with the
 PRK on repatriation but no formal repatriation arrangements
 have been made. Voluntary repatriation of Khmer from
 Thailand, not-sanctioned by the PRK, was said by the'
 Vietnamese authorities to have been a reason for a June 23,
 1980 attack on Khmer refugee aglomerations and a Thai village,
 all inside Thai territory.
 Approximately 30,000 Khmer took refuge in Thailand prior to
 the ouster from Phnom Penh of the DK by Vietnamese troops.
 Since the Vietnamese invasion in January 1979, approximately
 150,000 Khmer have fled to Thailand seeking refuge, and
 another hundred thousand (down from over half a million one
 year ago) still seek refuge and relief along the Thai-
 Kampuchea border. Famine conditions in the interior were the
 cause of most flight to the border aglomerations.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 A Khmer can participate in the political process in either
 the DK or PRK only in strict adherence to the rules of the
 communist parties controlling each. Any political deviation
 or suspicion of deviation is harshly punished, often by death,
 particularly in the DK. Opposition is suppressed ruthlessly
 in both the DK and PRK. Political aspirants in the PRK-con-
 trolled areas must learn th "current political dogma, which
 is centered on acceptance of the Vietnamese explanation for
 the SRVIs dominant political role in Kampuchea. Radio Phnom
 Penh broadcasts have reported that DK soldiers who had been
 captured or who had surrendered to the new authorities were
 allowed to rejoin their families after a short period
 
 
 628
 Administrative cadres, Heng Samrin soldiers and officials
 receive preferential medical attention. Corruption is
 reportedly highly developed in the PRK medical system as
 well as in the food distribution system.
 The PRK has established literacy schools for teaching the
 Khmer language and reports that over nine hundred thousand
 students currently are studying in the rudimentary schools.
 Many segments of the population also receive political
 education in preparation for assuming administrative
 responsibilities.
 Most Khmer remain close to survival standards, because of
 the devastation of the Pol Pot years, the conflict, famine,
 and meager crops which resulted from the Vietnamese invasion
 and occupation of Kampuchea in January 1979 at the time of
 the harvest. Only a handful of Khmer in the PRK regime's
 top party and military echelons can be said to earn enough
 to save reserves for later years. The remainder are living
 essentially from hand to mouth. Rural Khmer are discriminated
 against, as indicated above, and those in areas of marginal
 security are denied access to any rations from the
 administration, as are those who are suspect politically.
 Rations are distributed by quotas, but the supplies are
 exhausted before those not associated closely with the regime
 receive their quota. Ethnic Chinese generally have not been
 allowed to return to urban areas, despite the urban background
 of most Chinese in Kampuchea.
 In areas under DK control, about which less is known, the
 administration retains full control over production and
 distribution. Soldiers and cadres are noticeably better fed
 and provided medical services more regularly than are
 civilians. Malnutrition is reported, especially among
 children. The incidence of malaria and other diseases is
 reportedly high. No market economy or monetary system is
 established in DK-controlled areas. The DK teaches some
 reading and revolutionary songs. There have been reports of
 sometimes severe and violent discrimination against ethnic
 Vietnamese, Chinese and Chams, the Muslim minority, in areas
 under DK control. Women generally are remunerated on roughly
 the same minimal bases as men in both the PRK and DK.
 Earlier under DK rule far fewer women than men were executed.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There is no freedom of speech, press, or assembly in either
 the DK or PRK. News organs exist only for the small circle
 of the elite in both areas. No books are available in the
 DK. Some textbooks have now been reintroduced in the PPK
 educational system. There are no domestic or foreign
 publications and books are scrutinized rigorously for
 political content prior to being introduced into the PRK-
 controlled areas. Opposition viewpoints or opinions are not
 tolerated in either DK or PRK areas. Offenders are arrested.
 Serious offenders in the DK controlled areas reportedly are
 executed. Fear characterizes any deviation by Khmer in both
 areas. Except under the auspices of the DK and PRK
 administrations, public assembly and meetings are not allowed.
 There are no known professional associations in either the DK
 or PRK. Government-controlled labor unions reportedly are
 being organized in PRK-controlled areas.
 
 
 629
 of "re-education" and after they had, according to the
 broadcasts, "promised to do their best to redeem themselves
 and become new citizens." Former prisoners report that
 political prisoners who show "progress" in their political
 views are able to obtain early release.
 The PRK has promised to promulgate a constitution and hold
 elections in early 1981, but will not accept objective foreign
 observation of the elections and there is expected to be
 only one slate of candidates. The continued presence of
 200,000 Vietnamese troops plus Vietnamese administrators
 raises basic questions concerning the validity of such
 "elections."
 Women appear to be treated on a roughly similar basis as men
 in the PRK. While forced marriages were common in the DR
 before 1979, limited recent reports suggest that women are
 not discriminated against in the DK. Women serve in high
 political positions in both the DK and PRK. Three women,
 wives of top political leaders, are ministers in the DK
 administration.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Both the DX and PRK administrations regard any attempt to
 investigate or otherwise inquire into human rights practices
 in Kampuchea as interference in the internal affairs of
 Kampuchea. The PRK has stated a willingness to permit a UN
 investigation of human rights if the investigation also
 looks into charges of genocide under Pol Pot. Despite its
 abominable record on human rights, the DR in October adhered
 to the UN human rights covenant. Neither the DK nor PRK has
 communicated with any non-government human rights organiza-
 tions.
