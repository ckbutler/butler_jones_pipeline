 LIBERIA
 Although the first 8 months of 1995 saw a continuation of civil war, a new peace
 accord signed in Abuja, Nigeria on August 19 offered some hope that the 6-year con-
 flict would end. The factions signing the Abuja Accord included. the National Patri-
 otic Front of Liberia (NPFL), two ethnic subfactions-Krahn and Mandingo-of the
 United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO), and a coalition of
 anti-NPFL forces comprised of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), the Lofa Defense
 Force, and a breakaway-NPFL group called the Central Revolutionary Council. A
 cease-fire agreed to in the new accord went into effect August 26, and a new Libe-
 rian National Transitional Government (LNTG--l, the successor to the LNTG-I)
 was inaugurated on September 1. A six-person Council of State-three members
 representing the warring factions and three representing civilians-began filling
 government positions in September.
 Under the Abuja Accord timetable the Economic Communit of West African
 States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and the U.N. Observer Mission in
 Liberia (UNOMIL) were to deploy into areas previously controlled by the factions
 starting in October. ECOMOGs deployment was delayed, however, due to logistical
 problems. ECOMOG did begin further deployment in December but temprarily
 halted this process when its troops were attacked by rebels near Tubmanburg, Bomi
 county, at the end of the ear.
 The Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) remained largely inactive, although they did
 man checkpoints near the Schiefflin Camp on the Monrovia-Buchanan highway. The
 AFL as an institution was not identified with human rights abuses, but many AFL
 soldiers were recruited into the LPC.
 The Liberian National Police (LNP), which reports to the Ministry of Justice, to-
 gether with the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Special Security Services
 (reporting directly to the LNTG) also have responsibility for internal security, but
 they lacked the resources and training to function effectively. In the spring, the
 LNP established a special operations department, composed of a task force and
 rapid response unit to combat soaring crime in Monrovia. While civilian authorities
 generally maintained control of these groups, there were instances in which individ-
 ual members acted independently of governmental authority and committed human
 rights abuses.
 ECOMOG was the key military force supporting the LNTG-H, as for all previous
 interim governments. At the end of 1995 ECOMOG was composed of approximately
 7,200 troops from six West African countries; over half were Nigerian. 7ECOMOG is
 supported primarily by nations who have contributed troops. ECOMOG has in effect
 acted as the interim governments' security force. In addition, absent an effective
 central government, it assumed many police powers in areas under its control.
 ECOMOG also continued its humanitarian role and maintained a protective cordon
 around the cities of Monrovia and Buchanan where 1.2 million people (almost half
 of the country's population) live. There were reports that a few ECOMOG soldiers
 committed human rights abuses such as arbitrary detentions.
 The economy, ravaged by civil war, remained in severe disarray. Prior to 1990 it
 was based primarily on iron ore, rubber, timber, diamond, and gold exports. Eighty
 to 90 percent unemployment, massive displacements of civilians, and wanton de-
 struction and looting devastated productive capacity, despite the country's rich natu-
 ral resource endowments and potential self-sufficiency in agriculture. Gross domes-
 tic product was estimated to be less than one-fifth of its prewar level.
 The war has taken a horrendous toll on civilians. Of a prewar population of 2.8
 million, 150,000 people have been killed, 750,000 have fled the country, and 1.2 mil-
 lion are internally displaced. The media, eyewitnesses, human rights monitoring
 groups, and international observers all reported flagrant disregard for human rights
 by the 40,000 to 60,000 fighters in the major factions. The factions looted and
 
 
 141
 burned villages; used excessive force; engaged in arbitrary detentions and impress-
 ment, particularly of children under the age of 18; employed forced labor, committed
 torture, individual and gang rape, summary executions, mutilations, and cannibal-
 ism.
 Massive emergency operations by the United Nations, as well as by other Western
 relief agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) brought subsistence-
 level humanitarian aid to people living in the ECOMOG protective-cordon around
 Monrovia and Buchanan. Continued fighting and attacks on civilians and humani-
 tarian relief conveys prevented regular delivery of humanitarian assistance outside
 ECOMOG-controlled areas, although sometimes NGO convoys, crossing the borders
 from Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, or factional lines within the country, managed to deliver
 food and medical supplies to needy civilians upcountry.
 Because of the war, citizens have not been able to elect a representative govern-
 ment. The judicial system continued to be hampered by inefficiency and corruption.
 Prison conditions were life threatening. There were some attempts to limit freedom
 of the press and freedom of association. Violence against women is a longstanding
 problem. The practice of female genital mutilation persists. No progress was made
 in resolving outstanding incidents of past human rights abuses.
 Although the 1985 Constitution, the Penal Code, and the Labor Code remain in
 effect, because of the civil war the rights provided for in these documents were
 largely not protected in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and  Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There   were  no reports of
 extrajudicial killings by the AFL, LNTG-I, or LNTG-II security forces, but five
 members of the LNTG-ll police were jailed pending internal investigation for the
 beating death November 18 of a Mandingo merchant.
 Although they professed adherence to the rule of law, the leaders of the major
 warring factions condoned and in some instances seemingly appeared to encourage
 the murderous savagery that killed or maimed more civilians than combatants (see
 Section 1.g.). In the many killings committed by the factions, it was often impossible
 to determine whether they were politically motivated or driven by tribal hatred (see
 Section 5). One such example is the ritualistic mutilation, murder, and dismember-
 ment of a University of Liberia student, a Mandingo, in Tubmanburg on August 14
 by ULIMO-Krahn fighters. After beheading and cannibalizing the young man, sol-
 diers took his body to Lofa Bridge where the Krahns were fighting the  andingos
 for control of the diamond mines. The student's mangled body was found outside
 Tubmanburg 3 days later. ECOMOG soldiers later arrested several ULIMO-Krahn
 fighters.
 The majority of civilian deaths took place during raids on villages (see Section
 l.g). There were reports that ULIMO-Mandingo fighters harassed and executed ci-
 vilians in Lofa county for religious and ethnic reasons.
 In late September, during an intza-NPFL dispute, factional fighters murdered ci-
 vilians in Tappeta and destroyed the town. A number of NPFL commandos were
 tried in Gbarnga by the NPFL for the Tappeta incidents in November and found
 guilty. They were released after serving three months of their 12-month sentences.
 There were credible reports that George Boley, leader of the LPC faction and
 member of the LNTG-II, authorized the summary execution of seven of his fighters
 November 14 for harassment of civilians. Boley did not deny these allegations. Dis-
 placed persons reported that factions usually did not hold prisoners, but either re-
 leased them or shot and killed them on the spot.
 No progress was made in the investigation of the December 1994 massacre at Du-
 Pont Road on the outskirts of Monrovia in which more than 60 civilians, most of
 them children, were murdered (see Section 1.d).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance perpetrated by the
 AFL, LNTG-I or LNTG-I police or security forces, nor by ECOMOG. The major
 factions were responsible for many unexplained disappearances however, notably by
 impressment of children (see Sections 1.g., 5, and 6.d.). Many families remained di-
 vided by the war. Among those are families living in Monrovia, those located in
 other parts of Liberia, and those who fled the country. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross has a family tracing program but, because of the inaccessibility
 of major sectors of the country through most of the year, located only a small per-
 centage of the missing persons brought to its attention.
 Ten ECOMOG soldiers were missing after the ULIMO-Krahn attack in
 Tubmanburg in December. They are presumed dead.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and other degrading treatment, the fac-
 tions continued to perptrate massive abuses. There were no reports of torture by
 the AFL, LNTG-I or LNTG-II police or security forces, nor by ECOMOG.
 Although the Supreme Court ruled that "trial by ordeal" or "sassywood'--com-
 monly, the placement of a burning metal object on a suspect's body to induce confes-
 sion in a criminal investigation-is unconstitutional, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
 continued to have licensed agents who subjected suspects to this practice. A lawsuit
 brought in 1994 for injuries resulting from sassywood is pending before the Supreme
 Court.
 A LNTG-I policeman beat a journalist; authorities did not investigate the inci-
 dent. Eyewitnesses report that ECOMOG soldiers beat individuals at ECOMOG
 checkpoints in an effort to curb criminal activity.
 All the major factions engaged in torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrad-
 ing treatment. After the seating of the LNTG-l Council of State in September, fac-
 tion leaders and their bodyguards traveling in motor vehicle convoys in Monrovia
 routinely intimidated and sometimes beat civilians who did not give way fast
 enough to their processions. NPFL fighters stripped, beat, and tortured civilians at
 numerous highway checkpoints in the NPFL areas, usually in connection with extor-
 tion or other forms of intimidation. In addition, the NPFL was charged by the Jus-
 tice and Peace Commission (JPC) with numerous massacres of civilians (see Section
 1.g.}- Roving bands of ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo fighters raided villages
 in Cape Mount and Bomi counties, pillaging, beating, raping and murdering civil-
 ians as they went. LPC fighters were widely accused of beating, torturing, and kill-
 ing civilians, especially persons suspected of being NPFL sympathizers, and
 torching their villages. Members of all factions practiced cannibalism (see Section
 1.g.). Displaced persons escaping to Buchanan in February claimed that the LPC
 held 6,000 persons hostage in and around Compound Number 3 and the Liberian
 Agricultural Company plantation, under the guise of offering them security but in
 reality using them for forced labor. On February 13, LPC fighters severely man-
 handled an expatriate NGO nurse and badly beat another NGO's local staff mem-
 ber. At year's end, forced labor reportedly continued in the Southeastern counties,
 despite George Boley's December 14 order to his LPC/Coalition fighters to prepare
 to report to assembly sites for disarmament. The warring factions regularly commit-
 ted violence against women, including individual and gang rape, as in the case of
 three rapes December 14 near Sinje, Grand Cape Mount county, which were com-
 mitted either by Mandingo or ULIMO-Krshn fighters.
 Neither the LNTG-I nor LNTG-II addressed the life threatening conditions in
 government jails. There were credible reports of death among prisoners due to star-
 vation. The interim governments did not provide prisoners with adequate food or
 medical care. Cells were small, crowded, and filthy.
 Women, representing 5 percent of the central prison population, were held in sep-
 arate cells, but there were no separate facilities for juvenile offenders. The LNTG-
 I and H regularly granted human rights groups access to prisoners in Monrovia, and
 these groups frequently obtained needed medical treatment for their clients. In a
 number of cases, the pro bono work of human rights groups and interested individ-
 uals resulted in the release of prisoners, many of whom were held for up to 1 year
 without charge.
 The conditions of detention by factions were reportedly even worse. Factions held
 prisoners in makeshift, substandard facilities and subjected them to various forms
 of mistreatment, both physical and psycholo cal-including beatings, rape, threat-
 ened executions, and "tarbeying" (tying the elbows together behind the back).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and provides for the rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests and
 the right of detainees to be either charged or released within 48 hours. In practice,
 Liberian National Police officers, who operate only in the cities of Monrovia and Bu-
 chanan, and during part of the year in Tubmanburg, often disregarded these rights
 and made arbitrary arrests. Many of these officers, who often  not receive their
 monthly salary of $5, accepted bribes to arrest persons based on unsubstantiated
 allegations. Approximately 90 percent of the prison population was held without
 charge for more than 1 year. ECOMOG soldiers played the major role in policing
 the greater Monrovia area. Citizens continued to turn to ECOMO G rather than the
 largely unarmed police force to arrest and detain alleged criminals. ECOMOG regu-
 larly turned detainees over to civilian authorities, although the police denied in a
 year-end dispute that ECOMOG had turned over 11 suspects in the December 1994
 Dupont Road massacre. There were unconfirmed reports that ECOMOG coerced con-
 fessions from suspects.
 There were no -known political detainees in the cities of Monrovia and Buchanan.
 
 
 143
 The factions arbitrarily detained numerous persons and held so-called "prisoners
 of war" from the AFL and other factions. The NPFL committed repeated arbitrary
 detentions in its territory where martial law has been in effect since the war began.
 NPFL fighters had almost unbridled power to make warrantless arrests. They exer-
 cised that power often and capriciously, detaining persons on spurious grounds or
 without charge for periods ranging from several hours to several weeks. Just prior
 to the seating of the LNTG-II, over 300 children from the Fatima Cottage-Orphan-
 age Mission, abducted by Taylor's NPFL forces during "Operation Octopus," were re-
 turned from Gbarnga to Monrovia.                                     /
 Approximately 750,000 citizens, including former political leaders, have fled the
 country because of the war.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the Constitution provides for an independ-
 ent judiciary, because of the war the judiciary does not function in most areas of
 the ountry. Whe it does function, itis in practie subject to political, social, famil-
 ial      inancial suasion. Under the Constitution, defendants have due process
 rights conforming to internationally accepted norms of fair trial. Most of these
 rights, however, were ignored in practice.
 The court structure is divided into four levels with the Supreme Court, whose
 members are appointed by the LINTC-ll, at the apex. Although devastated by years
 of civil war, all levels of the court system, including the Supreme Court, were func-
 tioning in 1995 in Monrovia, although erratically. Corruption and incompetent han-
 dling of cases remained a recurrent problem. Although the judiciary was allocated
 some resources by the interim governments, little progress was made.
 Customary law was also used in Monrovia. The Ministry of Internal Affairs sub-
 jected persons accused of occult practices and other crimes to "trial by ordeal," sub-
 mitting defendants to physical pain to adjudicate guilt or innocence (see Section
 1.c.).
 In the areas controlled by the major factions, there was little pretense of due roc-
 ess- swift judgment was meted out by the faction leaders. Both ECOMOG and the
 AFL chief of staff under the LNTG-I issued warnings to lawyers to desist from de-
 fending armed robbers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the Constitution provides for these rights, in wartime Liberia LNTG-I and LNTG-
 II authorities sometimes ignored them. The Constitution provides that police must
 obtain a warrant or have a reasonable belief that a crime is in progress or is about
 to be committed before entering a private dwelling. In practice, the police forced
 entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations. Members of the
 NSA harassed the director of a well-known human rights organization in July. The
 director's nephew was detained by police, NSA agents and ECOMOG soldiers July
 28 and beaten when he denied knowledge of the director's whereabouts.
 The warring factions committed the most egregious abuses, including confiscation,
 indiscriminate looting, pillaging, and destruction of property. Combatants looted vil-
 lages, with ULIMO-Krahn and ULIMO-Mandingo factions in Bomi and Cape Mount
 counties and LPC and NPFL fighters in Southeast counties and elsewhere drawing
 public outrage. These forces pilfered virtually any item of value and regularly de-
 manded scarce food and personal valuables from already impoverished residents or
 displaced persons, often robbing them of their clothes and physicall abusing them,
 particularly at checkpoints. Confiscation of private homes and vehic es was common
 practice.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The major warring factions inflicted considerably more harm on noncombat-
 ants than on each other. They deliberately targeted, tortured, and murdered inno-
 cent civilians and regularly committed violence against women, children, and the el-
 derly. The four militarily active factions indiscriminately ransacked villages and
 confiscated scant food supplies.
 Displaced persons reported many incidents in which civilians died at the hands
 of marauding fighters. In March the Catholic Church's human rights organization,
 the JPC, published a report charging the NPFL with killing or abducting 2,000 civil-
 ians, or 10 percent of the town's population, in its 6-month siege of Bong Mines and
 raids on neighboring areas. The JPC also accused the NPFL of a massacre over 300
 civilians who were taken hostage on their way to the Heindi market near Bong
 Mines on March 7; the NPFL reportedly later returned to kill 200 more civilians
 and burn 50 houses. The JPC reported a massacre at Heindi early in the week of
 March 25, where 64 bodies were hastily buried in a common grave and 450 houses
 burned. Displaced persons who had fled fighting between the NPFL and ULIMO-
 Krahns in Nyehn, southwest of Kakata, in April reported that the NPFL massacred
 150 persons, raped women, burned houses and mutilated babies. On April 9 in
 Yorsetown, 62 people, including women and children, were killed with cutlasses and
 
 
 knives. Survivors said the NPFL was responsible; they also reported that bodies
 were cannibalized. Survivors of a massacre of 74 civilians on the railroad between
 Bong Mines and Monrovia on May 3 said the NPFL was responsible.
 In late February, ULIMO-Mandingo fighters killed 27 persons in Gbarma, Grand
 Cape Mount, and burned to the ground the neighboring villages of Tarkpoima and
 Zuo. In two separate incidents in the first 2 weeks of March, 300 ULIMO-Krahn
 fighters, said to be "on a rampage" in Grand Cape Mount, massacred 50 people near
 Madina. ULIMO-Mandingo fighters killed hundreds of civilians in Menkor Town,
 Grand Cape Mount, and abducted many others, whose fate is unknown. ULIMO-
 Mandingo fighters ambushed vehicles on the Bomi Highway, killing at least five ci-
 vilians and injuring others at the end of March. ULI  an ingo fighters entered
 Kpeneji town in Grand Cape Mount on April 4, killing three civilians and setting
 the town afire, including a large refugee/displaced persons camp. ULIMO-Krahn
 fighters, headquartered in Roysville, Grand Cape Mount, launched daily operations
 against nearby villages such as one early morning raid on April 15 when they raped
 women, flogged men and boys, and buried people up to their necks on the beach.
 Mandingo forces murdered 55 civilians in Guthrie in late April. During another
 looting raid, ULIMO-Krahn fighters killed a Baptist clergyman and injured an addi-
 tional 6 civilians on May 2 in Bendu Mission, Grand Cape Mount, an incident con-
 firmed by the Baptist Church in Monrovia. Skirmishing between the two ULIMO
 subfactions was continuous at the diamond-rich Lofa Bridge area in southern Lofa
 county. At the end of December, ULIMO-Krahn fighters attacked ECOMOG soldiers
 near Tubmanburg who were deploying to begin disarmament measures called for in
 the Abuja Accord. They killed and wounded numerous people, forcing over 15,000
 civilians to flee the area.
 In the southeastern counties, the NPFL and LPC vied for control. NPFL fighters
 in Rivercess routinely tortured women byplacing hot metal between their legs and
 forcing men to rape women. In February NPFL fighters killed at least 10 people and
 wounded several others in Kabeh town. Displaced persons reported that the LPC
 frequently burned women between their breasts, on their thighs or their backs;
 burned men on their genitals and legs; and buried people alive. The rape of both
 old and young women was common. Displaced persons arriving at Monrovia shelters
 reported that LPC fighters in Greenville in March killed 55 persons who had sur-
 rendered to them.
 At the end of March LPC fighters murdered a number of civilians in Sakpoh,
 Clark's Town, and Cheasbeh, Sinoe county. By the end of April, fighting between
 the NPFL and LPC reportedly resulted in the death of over 1,000 civilians in a 1-
 month period in these counties, with few injuries to the fighters.
 There were credible reports that NPF, ULIMO-Krahn, ULIMO-Mandingo, and
 LPC fighters committed acts of cannibalism (see Section L.a.). In some instances,
 the fighters ate specific organs in the belief that it would make them stronger.
 Relief organizations estimated 1.2 million persons have been internally displaced
 since the war began. Most of these are dependent on humanitarian aid for survival.
 Faction leaders and their followers, suspicious of the possible supply of aid to the
 enemy, often refused to allow international and humanitarian relief agencies access
 beyond their checkpoints to distribute food and supplies. The U.N. and relief agen-
 cies reported regular harassment of their staffs and the looting of food and medical
 supplies and gasoline. In August, after the cease-fire went into effect and the hu-
 manitarian community had access upcountry for the first time, they found severe
 malnutrition in many areas. Throughout the year, due either to unstable conditions
 or sporadic skirmishes between the factions, it remained difficult to deliver humani-
 tarian assistance outside ECOMOG-protected areas.
 Credible reports indicated that members of ECOMOG facilitated the delivery of-
 if they did not actually deliver-weapons and ammunition to the LPC and both
 ULIMO subfactions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for in the Con-
 stitution and, with some significant limitations, were generally exercised in Monro-
 via, although toward the end of the year the LNTG-H attempted to intimidate and
 restrict the press. Citizens, including journalists, usually showed restraint and self-
 censorship in favor of the interim governments. Due primarily to continued eco-
 nomic stagnation, all newspapers strugled to get their editions published. Until Oc-
 tober there were eight privately owned newspapers in Monrovia, which published
 from one to five times weekly, bimonthly or, in the case of the human rights news-
 aper, as the situation warranted. Since mid-October, 7 new tabloid newspapers
 have appeared, bringing the total to 15, an indication of a vibrant press. One of the
 new newspapers focused solely on women's issues; another was dedicated to cover-
 
 
 ing disarmament and demobilization. The press tended to be anti-NPFL, openly
 criticizing Taylor, a member of the LTNG--II. This too was indicative of an increas-
 ingly strong media. In August a new independent and privately owned radio station
 was inaugurated.
 The restrictive Media Law, instituted during the Doe regime, remains in force and
 provides the Ministry of Information wide discretion in licensing and regulating
 journalists. A 1993 decree, which also remains in effect, set up guidelines for report-
 ing on war-related issues.
 On October 9, the LNTG-I[ Chief Justice warned the press, lawyers, and others
 against criticizing decisions of the Court, specifically naming the former Chairman
 of the LNTG-I, who had commented publicly on an appeal motion. In November and
 December, the Minister of Justice brought a number of questionable lawsuits
 against prominent opposition figures for alleged criticism of the Council of State.
 These cases were pending at the end of the year.
 The interim governments failed to take action in several incidents in which jour-
 nalists were mistreated. On April 26, Budu Kaisa, a journalist affiliated with the
 British Broadcasting Corporation, in search of an interview, was flogged by a police
 majer assigued to the Labor Ministry. In May photojournalist James Momo received
 death threats from coalition fighters irked byhis publication of a photo showing a
 naked NPFL fighter holding the bead of his beheaded NPFL colleague. On July 30,
 journalist Bill fJarkloh was flogged by ULIMO--ahn fighters.
 Members of the LNTG-I and II interim governments also harassed and intimi-
 dated journalists, rationalizing their behavior by pointing to a lack of professional-
 ism on the part of journalists and editors. In January the information Minister, who
 insisted on having prior knowledge of program contents before broadcast, canceled
 the government radio station's public affairs program. The Council of State, how-
 ever, warned the Minister to desist from such censorship. At times journalists were
 requested to meet privately with government officials and senior ECOMOG officers
 who had been offended by articles. Some journalists admitted to self-censorship in
 favor of the interim government. Except when fighting became too widespread,
 international journalists were able to visit contested zones and to write news arti-
 cles for their publications with no official censorship.
 After the inauguration of the LNTG-II, threats against the press increased. An
 October 4 front page article in the local press claimed that the new police director
 had instructed the owner of the printing press which publishes daily newspapers
 in the capital to submit copies o all issues to his office before releasing them to
 the public. The press united in condemning this instruction, and the police director
 let it drop. State councilmen and their representatives made repeated attacks on the
 press for-publishing articles or airing comments they considered critical of members
 of the LNTG--II Council. Journalists responded vigorously to each threat.
 On December 8, the Liberia Broadcasting System justified stopping a number of
 reigious and political radio programs, claiming the ontent was inflmmatory or
 dangerous to the pe ae process. In mid-Dcember the Ministry of Information in-
 formed the Press Union of Liberia (PUL) that it would accredit journalists in the
 future, an activity previously carried out by PUL. No newspapers were forcibly
 closed during the year.
 There was one pro-NPFL newspaper intermittently published in NPFL territory;
 none, official or private, were printea in ULIMO- or LPC-controlled areas.
 The government radio station, ELBC, continued to broadcast throughout the year,
 using equipment donated by ECOMOG. Its news reports were favorable (at times
 sycophantic) to the LNTG, and while some talk shows criticized ECOMOG and the
 LNTG, many credible journalists alleged substantial censorship of ELBC. Two pri-
 vately owned religious radio stations also broadcast from Monrovia throughout the
 year, but the content of their programs was noncontroversial. Since the cease-fire
 in August two independent stations began airing programs. The NPFL also opened
 a private radio station with news programs uncitically supporting the NPFL and
 Charles Taylor's political agenda.
 Academic freedom was generally respected at the University of Liberia, which
 continued to operate despite some delays caused by financial problems. In November
 LNTG--II police and NSA officers went to the University to arrest the leader of the
 student union for supporting the teachers' strike. However, the officers left the cam-
 pus after seeing student support for their leader.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. The LNTG-I and II permitted polit-
 ical parties and other groups to organize freely and hold public meetings in Monro-
 via, but ECOMOG generally discouraged large-scale parades or demonstrations for
 security reasons. The factions severely restricted freedom of assembly and associa-
 tion in areas they controlled.
 
 
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as a fun-
 damental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. Although Islam is
 gaining adherents, as much as 40 percent of the population profess to be Christian.
 A significant portion of the population follows traditional animistic religions or prac-
 tices a mixture of traditional religions with Christianity or Islam. Islamic leaders
 complained that Muslims were discriminated against (see Section 5). There was no
 evidence of systematic violation of religious freedom by warring factions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout the
 country as well as the right to leave or enter. To protect the 1.2 million people in
 Monrovia and Buchanan from rampant lawlessness and banditry, ECOMOG estab-
 lished a protective cordon around those cities and numerous checkpoints within the
 capital. There were reports that some ECOMOG soldiers beat individuals at check-
 points (see Section 1.c.). ECOMOG arrested numerous persons for noncompliance
 with the curfew and periodically meted out corporal punishment to repeat curfew
 violators. After the cease-fire, ECOMOG reduced the hours of the nighttime curfew.
 Before the cease-fire on August 26 factional fighting prevented freedom of move-
 ment, restricting a range of activities from resettlement of displaced to ordinary
 commerce and travel. The warring factions impeded the movement of relief workers
 and supplies and extorted, humiliated, and harassed citizens throughout the country
 at checkpoints and makeshift barricades. When ECOMOG could not guarantee safe
 passage upcountry, it restricted the movement of civilians and humanitarian aid
 workers at various times throughout the year. Even after the seating of the LNTG-
 II Council of State, there were reports that beatings of international humanitarian
 workers and thefts of foodstuffs and humanitarian vehicles by the warring factions
 continued.
 Since 1990 approximately 1.2 million citizens (of an estimated prewar population
 of 2.8 million) have been internally displaced. There are more than 750,000 Liberian
 refugees in neighboring West African countries, although the number of refugees
 fluctuated depending on the intensity and proximity of the fighting to population
 centers in Libera. Many of the internally displaced went to Monrovia because of
 the greater security provided by ECOMOG and more reliable relief supplies.
 There are approximately 120,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Liberia. Many Sierra
 Leoneans were mistreated by both ULIMO factions and the NPFL as they were dis-
 placed by fighting. The interim governments cooperated with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting
 refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim
 to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional and statutory guarantees of free and fair elections, due to
 the civil war citizens could not exercise the right to change their government. A new
 interim government, the third since the war began, was installed on September 1,
 as a result of the signing of the Abuja Accord on August 19. The peace accord pro-
 vides for national elections to take place in August 1996.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women in politics. While there
 is only one female cabinet minister in the LNTG-l, several women hold key posi-
 tions and exert considerable influence. Overall numbers of women in the LNTG-II
 and the various political parties are small.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The interim governments have generally permitted domestic and international
 grups to operate freely. However, NSA agents harassed a prominent human rights
 Iayer andis family (see Section i.e.).
 The few domestic human rights organizations are underfunded and lack adequate
 training but made progress in improving their influence, visibility, and performance.
 One group has a weekly radio program; another group occasionally published a
 newspaper dedicated to human rights. There is a Monrovia-based consortium of
 NGO s monitoring human rights, consisting of the Center for Law and Human
 Rights Education, the Justice and Peace Commission, Liberian Human Rights
 Chapter, Liberian Watch on Human Rights, Association of Female Lawyers, and As-
 sociation of Human Rights Promoters. One new group, the National Human Rights
 Monitor, was formed. Some groups visited prisoners in government jails. None of
 these organizations reported governmental interference with their activities.
 There were no domestic human rights organizations extant outside the cities of
 Monrovia and Buchanan due to the warring factions' hostility to such organizations.
 
 
 Although UNOMIL has responsibility for monitoring human rights, for most of
 the year no one carried out this function. In October one trained human rights ob-
 server was assigned to UNOMIL. No UNOMIL reports on human rights were made
 public.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race, sex,
 creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but de facto and in some cases de jure
 discrimination exist.
 Women.-In the massive violence inflicted on civilians during the conflict, women
 suffered a gamut of abuses (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). Rape was commonplace.
 Even prior to the war, domestic violence against women was extensive but never
 seriously addressed as an issue by the Government, the courts, the media, or wom-
 en's groups. Since the war began, several women's organizations were established
 in Monrovia and Gbarnga to advance family welfare issues, to help promote political
 reconciliation, and to assist in rehabilitating former combatants as well as civilian
 victims of war. Several NGO's in Monrovia and Buchanan have developed programs
 for treating abused women and girls and increasing their awareness of their human
 ri hts.
 'he status of women varies by region, ethnic group, and religion. Before the out-
 break of the civil war, women held one-fourth the professional and technical occupa-
 tions available in Monrovia. Some women currently hold skilled jobs in government,
 including in the judiciary. On the whole, however, the situation of women deterio-
 rated dramatically with the onset of war, the closing of many schools, and the loss
 of their traditional role in production, allocation, and sale of food. In urban areas,
 women can inherit land and property. In rural areas, where traditional customs are
 stronger, a woman is normally considered the property of her husband and his clan
 and usually is not entitled to inherit from her husband.
 Children.-Denied a normal childhood, Liberian youth have been the most tragic
 victims of the civil war. The factions have abused children and given no attention
 to their welfare; education and nurturing have been completely disrupted. Many
 who were disabled, orphaned, abandoned, or "lost" during a military attack on their
 homes or villages, accepted the protection and sustenance that joining a faction
 brought. The NPFL, LPC, and the ULIMO-Mandingos recruited and trained chil-
 dren as cooks, spies, errand runners, guards, patrols, and in many instances, com-
 batants. Faction leaders provided addictive drugs to children, thereby ensuring their
 compliance and continued participation in warfare. Many have been killed or
 wounded, have witnessed terrible atrocities, or themselves committed atrocities.
 There are no precise figures on the number of child soldiers, but some sources be-
 lieve that 10 percent ofrthe estimated 60,000 combatants are under 15 years of age;
 about 50 percent may be under 19. Children have become both victims and abusers
 in the conflict. Many suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome and have become
 addicted to drugs. Some NGO's have initiated small retraining and rehabilitation
 programs for a limited number of former child fighters (see Section 6.d.).
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) has been widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychologically health. FGM tradi-
 tionally has been performed on young girls by northern, western, and central tribes,
 particularly in rural areas and among traditional societies. It was difficult to con-
 fin the extent to which this procedure was practiced in 1995 by the uprooted, dis-
 placed, and often inaccessible population. In some instances, female health profes-
 sionals in the tribes participated in the practice to the extent of providing hygienic
 conditions and postoperative care. The most extreme form of FGM, infibulation, is
 not practiced.
 People With Disabilities.-The 6-year civil war has produced a large number of
 persons with permanent injuries in addition to persons disabled from other causes.
 There is no legal discrimination against the disabled, but in practice they do not
 enjoy equal access. There are no laws mandating accessibility to public buildings or
 services.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Some Muslims,
 however, who represent a growing share of the population, believe that Liberia's sec-
 ular culture gives preference to Christianity in civic ceremonies and observances,
 and that discrimination spills over into areas of individual opportunity and employ-
 ment. Although there are some notable Muslims in top government positions, in-
 cluding on the Council of State, many Muslims believe that they are bypassed for
 the highly sought-after technical and bureaucratic jobs available in government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are negroes or of negro descent"
 
 
 148
 may be citizens or own land, thus denying full rights to many persons who were
 brn or lived most of their lives in Liberia. There has been no legislative initiative
 to repeal this racial test, but there are reports that non-Liberians have acquired Li-
 berian passports. The 1975 Economic "Liberianization" law prohibits foreign owner-
 ship of certain businesses, such as travel agencies, retail gasoline stations, and beer
 and soft-drink distributors.
 The roots of the current civil conflict can be found, to a large extent, in the histor-
 ical division between the Americo-Liberian minority and the 16 indigenous ethnic
 groups. Ethnic tensions were exacerbated during the Doe regime because of domina-
 tion by his ethnic group, the Krahns. Throughout the civil war, the factions used
 an individual's language to identify ethnicity and often summarily executed those
 from groups considered hostile.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers, except mili-
 tary and police, have the right to associate in trade unions. The Constitution also
 states that unions are prohibited from partisan political activity, and this restriction
 has been observed in practice. Government interference in union activities, espe-
 cially elections and leadership conflicts, was commonplace before the war. More
 than 20 trade unions, representing about 15 percent of the wage-earning work force,
 were registered with the Ministry of Labor before the war began in 1989. Ten na-
 tional unions were members of the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions. However,
 the actual power the unions exercised was limited.
 Like virtually all other organized activity in the country, unions disappeared as
 economic activity ceased at the beginning of the war. In subsequent years the ability
 of unions to operate was a direct function of the level of factional fighting and the
 effect of the war on extractive industries. Union activity practically halted with the
 increase of factional fighting prior to the August cease-fire. The most active organi-
 zation was the Ship Workers' Union, which urged the LNTG-I and II to pressure
 Liberian flag vessels to employ more Liberian workers.
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under the United States'
 Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was suspended in 1990 as a re-
 sult of the Doe government's failure to take steps to provide internationally recog-
 nized worker rights. The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, but labor laws
 do protect this right. During the year, neither LNTG-I nor LNTG-11 took discrimi-
 natory actions against organized labor, even though the LNTG-I State Council
 chairman threatened to fire government employees if they stayed home on March
 8, a successful 1-day work "stoppage" called by civilian groups to demonstrate their
 discontent with the lack of progress in the peace process. No one was fired for par-
 ticipating. The Liberian Electric company employees, who staged a 1-week strike in
 September to demand back wages, were paid and returned to work. During a 3-
 week November teachers' strike for back pay and other benefits, the Government
 negotiated with the Teachers' Union andpromised to pay; the teachers returned to
 work. In December health personnel askedfor their delayed pay checks, threatening
 a work slowdown. Government officials were attempting to solve the problem of sal-
 ar arrearages for all civil servants at year's end.
 Labor unions have traditionally affiliated with international labor groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporations and autono-
 mous agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In the past,
 agreements were negotiated freely between workers and their employers without
 government interference. In 1995 these rights were largely moot because of the lack
 of economic enterprise, especially in Monrovia, where only a few businesses resumed
 operations, usually with reduced staffing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 projects" which often benefited only local leaders. This year the warring factions
 continued to use forced labor, especially for moving equipment or supplies. There
 were credible reports that ULIMO-Mandingo fighters also used Sierra Leonean refu-
 gees to acquire food for them.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Even before the civil war, enforce-
 ment of the law prohibiting employment of children under age 16 during school
 hours in the wage sector was limited. Small children continued to assist their par-
 ents as vendors in local markets and on family subsistence farms. This practice per-
 sists, particularly in those areas affected by the war, where there are no schools.
 Throughout the conflict, the NPFL and ULIMO-Mandingos recruited young children
 
 
 as soldiers. Many of these children, especially in NPFL-controlled territories, re-
 mained under arms (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards, but with the war enforcement
 mechanisms collapsed. In the war-decimated economy citizens were forced to accept
 any work they could find, regardless of wage. A legal minimum wage of approxi-
 mately $0.90 per day for agricultural workers and 3 or 4 times that amount or in-
 dustrial workers remains in force, but because of the war it was not enforced.
 The Labor Code provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a 30-minute
 rest period per 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56 hours for
 service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond 48 hours.
 Prior to 1990 there also were government-established health and safety standards,
 enforced in theory by the Ministry of Labor. Because of the war these regulations
 were not in fact enforced. Even under the Labor Code, workers did not have a spe-
 cific right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations.
