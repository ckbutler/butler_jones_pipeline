 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's rulers (amirs), drawn from the Al-Sabah family, have governed the coun-
 try in consultation with prominent commercial families and other community lead-
 ers for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution provides for an elected National As-
 sembly and details the powers of the Government and the rights of citizens. How-
 ever, although the Constitution only permits the Amir to suspend its articles during
 a period of martial law, the Amir has on several occasions suspended constitutional
 provisions by decree and ruled extraconstitutionally. The Amir dissolved the Na-
 tional Assembly from 1976 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1992. The holding of Na-
 tional Assembly elections in October 1992 and the subsequent convening of the Na-
 tional Assembly marked a return to parliamentary life.
 The Ministry of Interior supervises the countrs security apparatus, including the
 Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), which
 investigates internal security related offenses. Kuwaiti security forces continued to
 commit some human rights abuses, particularly in dealing with Iraqis, Yemenis,
 Jordanians, Palestinians, and Sudanese.
 Before the 1990 Iraqi invasion, which devastated the economy, Kuwait enjoyed a
 high standard of living, with an estimated per capita income of $10,175 in 1990. En-
 dowed with rich oil resources, the economy has made extraordinary progress in re-
 covering from the destruction wrought by the Iraqi occupation. However, it is likely
 to be at least 2 to 3 years before Kuwait is able to stabilize its fiscal situation. De-
 spite the emphasis the Government places on an open market economy, foreign na-
 tionals are not permitted to own property or majority shares in significant local
 businesses and are subject to restrictive labor laws.
 Kuwait's human rights situation showed measurable progress in 1992; parliamen-
 tary elections were held in a free and open atmosphere, prepublication censorship
 was eliminated and the Government showed a willingness to cooperate with the Na-
 
 
 1036
 tional Assembly, for example by permitting ministers to submit to Assembly cues-
 tioning. Nevertheless, sigmficant problems remained. Principal concerns were  mi-
 tations on the right of citizens to change their government, arbitrary arrest, and
 continuing limitations on the freedoms of assembly and association and on women's
 rights. There were also reports of abuse of detainees, as well as continuing pres-
 sures against, and harassment and mistreatment of, foreign nationals. Some restric-
 tions remain on freedom of speech and press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There was one instance of apparent
 extrajudicial killing in 1992. A Sri Lankan national died in police custody. The pre-
 cise cause of death was not established, but forensic examination revealed that the
 victim had been physically abused. Three police officers subsequently were charged
 with beating him. The Government stated that it was continuing to investigate the
 many extrajudicial killings that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's
 liberation in 1991.
 In one case a Kuwaiti officer was convicted of killing a bidoon (stateless resident
 of Kuwait of Bedouin origin) whom he had stopped at a checkpoint in March 1991.
 Most of the killings and disappearances, however, remain unresolved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of permanent disappearance
 during 1992, but there were several reports of foreigners (particularly Iraqis, Yem-
 enis, Jordanians, Palestinians, and Sudanese) being taken from their homes by un-
 identified Kuwaitis, held for a few hours, and then released as a tactic of harass-
 ment. According to Kuwait's latest figures, provided to the International Committee
 of the Red Cross and Iraq, 850 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait were taken pris-
 oner by Iraqi authorities during the occupation and are still missing or detained in
 Iraq. Approximately 10 percent of the missing are women. The Government of Iraq
 has failed to respond to U.N. and other international calls for the detainees' release
 under U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, denying that it holds Kuwaiti detain-
 ees and refusing to account for missing Kuwaitis taken into Iraqi custody during
 the occupation.
 There were numerous reports of disappearances following Kuwait's liberation in
 1991 as elements of the military and vigilante groups sought retribution against
 persons, particularly foreigners, whom they suspected of being pro-Iraqi. While
 there is no reliable estimate of the total number of disappearances, over 100 cases
 remained unresolved in 1992. The Government of Kuwait says it is continuing to
 investigate the remaining cases of disappearances from 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Kuwaiti Constitution specifically prohibits the use of torture, but some cases
 of serious abuse or torture continued to be reported in 1992. In January a Sudanese
 detainee was tortured, taken to the deportation center, then to a hospital. After the
 incident was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister's office, the Kuwaiti
 Government arrested the officials responsible and paid restitution to the victim. At
 year's end, the case is still under investigation but does not appear to be progress-
 n here were credible reports of abuse in Kuwaiti detention facilities, especially at
 the KSS facility. Reported abuses included blindfolding detainees, verbal abuse, and
 some physical abuse. In some cases detainees were slapped, kicked, or shoved into
 walls. The ICRC has access to all places of detention in Kuwait. The Government
 has responded to specific allegations of abuse by investigating them and punishing
 at least some of the offenders. However, it has not been willing to provide details
 concerning the types of abuse and the punishment meted out.
 Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation can be submitted to Kuwaiti
 courts, and confessions or other evidence obtained through torture are not admissi-
 ble. However, a number of sentences handed down by the 1991 Martial Law courts
 were based on confessions apparently obtained under torture. In the State Security
 Court trials, defense lawyers have, in at least one case, sought exclusion of confes-
 sion on the basis of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are pro-
 hibited by the Constitution, but this prohibition is not always honored in practice.
 There are two different standards in the Kuwaiti Penal Code: one for criminal cases
 and one for cases involving state security. In all cases, a detainee may not be held
 for more than 4 days without charge, but in practice that requirement has occasion-
 ally been ignored in cases involving the KSS. Thereafter, in cases not involving the
 KSS, the suspect must either be released or charged by a prosecutor, who may au-
 thorize detention for an additional 21 days. Further detention pending trial may be
 
 
 1037
 authorized by a judge. Detention rules are different for cases involving state secu-
 rity. In July 1991, the Government amended the State Security Law to limit to 6
 months the period of detention that may be authorized by a prosecutor. A judge may
 authorize longer detentions pending trial. After 21 days in detention, a defendant
 may appeal the detention order to the State Security Court. If the appeal is rejected,
 the defendant may appeal again 30 days after the rejection. The Government, espe-
 cially the KSS, will occasionally prevent families from visiting detainees during the
 fir-st 4 days, while they are being interrogated. After that families are allowed to
 visit the detainees. There does not appear to be any long term incommunicado de-
 tention.
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrests, especially of persons picked up
 at police checkpoints around Kuwait City. Foreign nationals from Yemen, Sudan
 Jordan, and Iraq as well as Palestinians were especially subject to harassment and
 arrest at these checkpoints, as were people without valid Kuwaiti residency visas.
 In September there were credible reports that foreign nationals employed in the
 public sector who had worked -during the occupation, in violation of a boycott or-
 dered by the Kuwaiti government-in-exile, were subject to arrest, interrogation, and
 possible deportation. Individuals detained by the police and the KSS were held for
 3 to 4 days, then released, charged, or deported. Families were able to visit detain-
 ees in the deportation center, police stations, or prisons. However, families were
 rarely able to visit people being interrogated in the KSS facility. The ICRC had ac-
 cess to places of detention in Kuwait for non-Kuwaiti civilians detained in connec-
 tion with the Gulf War. Approximately 900 persons remained in detention as of Oc-
 tober, including those who had been convicted in either the State Security or the
 Martial Law courts. As of October, almost 500 of these persons were detained under
 administrative deportation orders, which may be issued arbitrarily and which pro-
 vide no judicial recourse. Some of these persons, especially Iraqis or bidoon, were
 long-term detainees.
 Under Kuwaiti law no Kuwaiti may be exiled. Noncitizens, even long-term resi-
 dents, may be expelled without charge or judicial recourse if deemed "trouble-
 makers" or "security risks.' In addition, foreign nationals may be expelled if they
 are unable to obtain work or residency permits. During 1992 the Kuwaitis deported
 approximately 1,250 detainees and approximately 2,000 family members of Palestin-
 ians, Yemenis, Sudanese, Jordanians and Iraqis. The ICRC only monitors deporta-
 tions of protected persons, but the Government also deports Iranians and other na-
 tionalities, including Americans and other Westerners, for violating residency re-
 quirements or other offenses.
 A much larger number of long-term foreign workers, particularly Palestinians,
 chose to leave Kuwait due to less favorable economic, residence, and social condi-
 tions. Government policies pressured Palestinians and nationals from Iraq, Yemen,
 Sudan, and Jordan to leave and made it difficult for foreigners in general to sponsor
 their family members' entry into the country. The Government's actions reflected a
 deliberate policy aimed at changing Kuwait's demgraphic balance to reduce reli-
 ance on foreign workers. The Palestinian population in Kuwait dropped to approxi-
 mately 27,000 from a postwarfigreof 120,000 to 150,000.
 e. Denial of Fair" Publicri.-Kuwait's judicial system comprises the regular
 courts, the State Security Court, the Court of Cassation, and the military courts,
 which have jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the armed or
 security forces, except during periods of martial law.
 Kuwait's judicial system, while nominally independent, is subject to executive
 branch control over its administrative and rinancial matters. In most recent cases
 the courts have provided for fair public trials and the right of appeal. Judges in the
 regular courts ar appointed by the Amir on the recommendation of the Justice Min-
 istry. Kuwaiti nationals who serve as judges usually receive lifetime appointments,
 while many non-Kuwaiti judges serve renewable 1 to 3-year contracts. The Justice
 Ministry may also remove judges for cause, but this authority is rarely exercised.
 By law, all defendants in feony cases must be representedby attorneys, court-
 appointedf if necessary. In nmisdemeanor cases, defined as crimes punishable by less
 than 3 years' imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, at the discretion of the defend-
 ant, and the court is not required to appoint a defense attorney if the accused can-
 not afford to pay for one. Defendants tried in absentia have the right to appeal.
 In July 1991, the Government amended the State Security Law to provide for a
 limited appeals process in cases prosecuted under that law. Under the new law,
 bth defendants and prosecutors may appeal verdicts of the State Security Court to
 the Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation may conduct a formal review of
 cases to determine whether the rule of law was properly applied in each sentence.
 A number of state security cases were appealed to the Court of Cassation in 1992,
 but, as of October, the court had not rendered any coa verdicts.
 
 
 1038
 In 1991 the Government prosecuted 74 cases, involving 164 defendants, in martial
 law courts. These trials did not generally meet international standards of due proc-
 ess, although the Government has resisted international appeals for retrials. Cases
 which were not completed before the end of martial law were held for the State Se-
 curity Courts which resumed hearing cases in April 1992. Two state security court
 circuits, each consisting of a 3-judge panel, heard approximately 60 cases involving
 124 people. Forty-nine of these cases were referrals from the earlier Martial Law
 courts, and the rest were cases developed after the end of martial law. A succession
 of state security trials continued throughout 1992. These trials were observed by the
 Kuwaiti press, international human rights organizations, and foreign missions, and
 most observers commented favorably about the procedural standards applied. De.
 fense counsel were given access to the evidence against their clients. In some in-
 stances, judges dismissed cases summarily due to lack of evidence. In cases in which
 verdicts have been pronounced, some defendants have been found not guilty but in
 most cases the courts have found the defendants guilty and pronounced sentence-
 generally imprisonment followed by deportation. Under the Constitution, the Amir
 as the power to pardon and commute all sentences.
 Kuwait holds no Kuwaiti political prisoners, but there are approximately 210 Pal-
 estinian-Gazan, Iraqi, and bidoon prisoners held in longterm administrative deten-
 tion in deportation centers. Cases against them are not apparently strong enough
 to take to trial, but the Government is unwilling to free them. The Government will
 not deport them to Iraq against their will; the prisoners have nowhere else togo.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion, but this right was ignored by the authorities in some cases in 1992. Search
 warrants issued by the court or the prosecutor are required under Kuwaiti law un-
 less the police are in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or there
 is an indication of the presence of alcohol or narcotics on the premises. Search war-
 rants to enter public premises are issued by the prosecutor. During 1992 Kuwaiti
 police frequently manned checkpoints on major roads to search for weapons, infiltra-
 tors, or people without legal residence permits. The number of checkpoints varied
 depending on the Government's concerns about internal security.
 Although individuals technically could refuse to have their vehicles searched, in
 practice police at these checkpoints felt at liberty to search vehicles. There were nu-
 merous reports of foreign nationals (especially Palestinians, Jordanians, Iraqis,
 Yemenis and Sudanese as well as bidoon) being harassed or arrested at check-
 points. Foreigners without residence permits were also subject to arrest and deten-
 tion.
 In 1986 the Government restricted the right of Kuwaiti males to marry foreigners,
 decreeing that advance official approval would be required. Government officials in-
 dicated that the action was motivated by concern about meeting the State's respon-
 sibilities toward the children of non-Kuwaiti spouses residing outside the country.
 The Government and the public at large were also concerned about the growing
 number of Kuwaiti males marrying foreigners rather than Kuwaiti women. Kuwaiti
 women were publicly advised against marrying foreign nationals. The Government
 has only sporadically enforced the law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Laws exist which permit the Government to re-
 strict speech and press freedoms, and the press laws were applied on a few occa-
 sions in 1992. Nonetheless, Kuwaitis freely and openly discussed issues and offered
 their opinions in public and private without fear of official retaliation. Opposition
 viewpoints were freely discussed in public and in private meetings, although public
 meetings were subject to surveillance by Interior Ministry personnel. No one was
 allowed to publicly criticize the Amir, the ruling family, or Islam.
 On January 12, the Government rescinded the 1986 decrees which provided for
 prepublication censorship. The Kuwaiti Journalists' Association concurrently drafted
 and implemented a Code of Journalists' Ethics.
 The press law restricts the press from publishing materials that contain direct
 criticisms of the Amir, that involve official confidential communications or treaties
 and agreements with other states, or that "might incite people to commit crimes,
 create hatred, or spread dissension among the people.  With the end of
 prepublication censorship, the Kuwaiti press was required to exercise its own judg-
 ment about what to print under the press law, subject to potential government egal
 action.
 The Government occasionally used the threat of legal action to control and punish
 the press during 1992. Twice during the year, the Government detained the editor
 of an independent newspaper for questioning about the articles in his newspaper.
 
 
 1039
 In the first instance, he and a journalist were questioned and charged with reveal-
 ing classified information about promotions in the Kuwaiti military. In a second
 case he was charged as an accessory and a journalist was charged with "abuse slan-
 der, defamation, and infringement of the dignity" of the former Minister of Informa-
 tion for a series of eight articles on the Government's media policy that contained
 sharp personal criticisms of the former minister. The former minister also filed a
 civillibel suit against the editor. In another case the Government deported a non-
 Kuwaiti news correspondent for filing a report that was deemed to have insulted
 the Amir.
 Some Kuwaiti reporters complained that the repeal of the 1986 decrees led to a
 greater degree of self-censorship, because their editors feared legal reprisals from
 the Government. However, the press was free to discuss a wide variety of social,
 economic, and political issues. The Kuwaiti press extensively covered the 1992
 Chamber of Commerce elections and the election campaign for the National Assem-
 bly. The press was free to criticize government policies and officials as long as the
 criticism was not of a personal nature. However the press did launch several stri-
 dent attacks against senior Kuwaiti officials, including the Prime Minister. Foreign
 press reporting from Kuwait is uncensored, and foreign journalists have generally
 open access to the country. Newspapers must have a license from the Ministry of
 Information. By law, publishers lose this license if their publications do not appear
 for 6 months.
 Radio and television are Government owned and controlled. They remained strict-
 ly neutral in their election coverage.
 Kuwait has a Censorship Department which reviews all books, films, videotapes,
 periodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes.
 In practice, such censorship is sporadic and aimed mostly at material considered to
 be morally offensive or pornographic. In addition, the General Organization of Print-
 ing and Publishing controls the printing, publishing, and distribution of materials
 in Kuwait. Private Kuwaiti cooperative societies occasionally boycott publications
 that offend moral sensibilities or Islam. For example, a local English-language
 newspaper was removed from several local cooperative supermarkets because it car-
 ried material deemed offensive.
 Academics operate in a free and open atmosphere with no apparent censorship of
 their teaching, research, or writings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political parties are banned in
 Kuwait, as they were before the Iraqi occupation. Political activity finds its outlet
 in informal, family-based social gatherings known as diwaniyas. The Constitution
 affirms the right to private assembly and also to public meetings, processions, and
 gatherings that are peaceful and not contrary to morals." Public gatherings how-
 ever, must receive prior government approval, as must private gatherings of more
 than five people that result in the issuance of a public statement.
 During 1992 the Government denied three permits for public gatherings. In one
 instance, the Government denied permission for the Kuwaiti Graduates' Society to
 host an election seminar, saying the Society did not have a mandate to sponsor po-
 litical events. However, in the month before the Kuwaiti elections, the Government
 approved the Society's request to sponsor the same seminar. The Government also
 turned down permit applications for one large opposition rally and for an Islamic
 group's forum on Afghanistan. In practice, however, opposition groups were able to
 hold large public meetings without interference. The Government monitored large-
 scale opposition diwaniyas in the spring of 1992 but did not interfere. Each night
 during the election campaign, candidates (including opposition candidates) held
 large public rallies. They also published political platforms and operated without
 government interference.
 Professional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies operate and maintain
 international contacts without government interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is abso-
 lute" but must not conflict with public policy or morals." Kuwait's state religion is
 Islam; the Shari'a (Islamic law) is, according to the Constitution, "a main source of
 legislation." The ruling family and many prominent Kuwati families are Sunni
 Muslims. There are no restraints on worship by Shi'a Muslims, who constitute ap-
 proximately 40   rcent of all Kuwaitis. Kuwait has a tiny Arab Christian minority
 who are allowed to practie their religion freely. There are a number of legally rec-
 ognized expatriate Christian congegations and churches, including a Catholic dio-
 cese and an American-sponsored Protestant church. Foreign nationals who practice
 eastern religions (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists) are not allowed to build places
 of worship but may worship privately in their homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, Kuwaiti citizens have the right to travel freely within the
 
 
 1040
 
 country. In theory, both men and women enjoy the same freedom to travel abroad
 but there are some limitations in practice. Husbands may prevent their wives and
 minor children from leaving the country, and representatives of societies, associa-
 tions, and trade unions wishing to travel abroad and participate in international
 meetings must receive prior permission. Kuwaitis are free to emigrate and, with an
 important exception described below, to return.
 The Government's preinvasion practice of revoking citizenship contradicted the
 Constitutional provision that "no Kuwaiti may be deported from Kuwait or pre-
 vented from returning thereto." In some cases, revocation was based on the vol-
 untary acquisition by the individual of foreign citizenship, although many Kuwaiti
 citizens are dual nationals carrying U.S. passports. However, as far as is known,
 there have been no recent revocations of citizenship. A former opposition member
 of Parliament whose citizenship was revoked in the mid-1980's for his support of
 Iran during the Iran-Iraq war was allowed to return to Kuwait in 1992, and his citi-
 zenship was restored.
 An anomalous situation exists in the case of the stateless bidoon who resided in
 Kuwait prior to the Iraqi invasion and claimed not to have any-other nationality
 but were unable to document claims of Kuwaiti citizenship. While some percentage
 of the bidoon have long standing ties to Kuwait, others immigrated to Kuwait in
 the 1960's and 1970's in response to Kuwait's oil and construction booms. An esti-
 mated 100,000 of the preinvasion bidoon population of around 250,000 remained in
 Kuwait in 1992. The Government also made it difficult for bidoon who had left the
 country during the Iraqi invasion to return, either denying or delaying their entry
 visas. The Government's position imposed severe separation hardships on some fam-
 ilies.
 In 1992 the Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the number of
 Iraqis, bidoon, Palestinians, and other foreign nationals in the country. The deporta-
 tion of prominent Palestinian writer and columnist Walid Abu Bakr, a 30-year resi-
 dent of Kuwait, on February 29 appeared to underscore the Government's deter-
 mination to reduce its Palestinian population.
 Under the arrangements worked out between the Kuwaitis and ICRC representa-
 tives, the ICRC was able to interview deportees to verify that they were willing to
 return to Iraq. The Government also generally abided by its agreement not to deport
 Gazan Palestinians with Egyptian laissez passer travel documents. As of October,
 almost 40 percent of the 9,000 Gazans remaining in Kuwait had beengiven 1-year
 residence permits. The Government allowed the remainder to stay in Kuwait pend-
 ing the resolution of their status by the governments concerned. Despite the Ku-
 waiti pledge not to deport Gazans, many Gazans left Kuwait voluntarily in response
 to social and economic pressure.
 In 1991 the Government set November 15 as the expiration date for temporary
 identification documents. This expiration date was subsequently extended several
 times until August 15, 1992. After that date, foreign nationals without valid legal
 residence faced fimes and possible deportation. Certain groups, including Palestin-
 ians, Iraqis, and bidoon found it extremely difficult to find employment and main-
 tain residency. As of dctober, however, most of the remaining Palestinians and
 Iraqis had obtained residency permits. Only the Gazans and the bidoon remained
 as significant groups with unresolved status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kuwaitis do not enjoy the right to change the head of state. However, Kuwaitis
 eligible to vote choose the membership of the National Assembly. Under the Con-
 stitution, executive power is vested in the Amir and under him in an appointed
 Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister who, in the AI-Sabah family's
 tradition, has been the Crown Prince. Following the 1992 election, the Prime Min-
 ister formed a 16-member Cabinet, which included 6 elected National Assembly
 members, the largest percentage of elected Assemblymen in the Cabinet in Kuwait's
 history. The Constitution places legislative power in the hands of the Amir and an
 elected National Assembly, which was suspended from 1986 until October 1992.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir in July 1986, was
 in effect until the October elections in 1992. Although the Amir has the constitu-
 tional right to suspend the National Assembly, according to the Constitution, elec-
 tions for a new Assembly must be conducted within 2 months of the dissolution, oth-
 erwise the old Assembly regains its authority until the "new Assembly is elected."
 The 1986 decrees circumvented the election requirement by suspending the section
 of the Constitution that called for new elections. The Constitution only gives the
 Amir the authority to suspend its articles during periods of martial law. The Amir
 had previously dissolved the Assembly from 1976 to 1981. In the Assembly's ab-
 
 
 1041
 sencej the Amir rules by decrees having the force of law. The National Assembly
 has the constitutional right to review and approve amiri decrees made in its ab-
 sence. The 1992 National Assembly began to review all of the amiri decrees after
 its convocation and has the power to overturn them.
 The electoral law provides that candidates for the National Assembly be self-nom-
 inated, with multiple candidates permitted for the 50 seats. In 1992, 303 candidates
 registered for parliamentary elections. Kuwaiti law prohibits the establishment of
 political parties; however, the Government of Kuwait tacitly permitted the establish-
 ment of several opposition political groups which acted as political parties.
 Kuwaiti law limits suffrage to adult males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and
 maintained a residence there until 1959 and to their adult male descendants (21
 and over). In 1986 the National Assembly approved an amendment to the National-
 ity Law postponing until 1996 the enfranchisement of Kuwait's naturalized citizens
 who do not meet the pre-1920 qualification.
 The Nationality Law was further amended in 1987 to extend from 20 to 30 years
 the total _period that all naturalized Kuwaitis must wait before acquiring the right
 to vote. Distinctions based on parentage, length of residence, and gender limit citi-
 zenship to a fraction of the resident population. In 1992 approximately 82,000 eligi-
 ble Kuwaitis (almost the entire enfranchised male population) registered to vote.
 The first National Assembly election since 1985 took place in 1992. The Kuwaiti
 Government scrupulously adhered to the required procedures for elections and the
 subsequent convocation of the National Assembly. An activist organization, the
 newly elected National Assembly is both challenging and cooperating with the Gov-
 ernment on a wide range of issues.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The privately organized Kuwait Association for the Defense of War Victims
 (KADWV), created in March 1991, seeks to help in the repatriation of internees
 from Iraq and address the physical and psychological needs of former prisoners of
 war and torture victims of the Iraqi occupation. KADWV also seeks to curb human
 rights abuses in Kuwait and has taken special interest in alleviating the problems
 of the bidoon. The Government has not recognized the Association but has not inter-
 fered in its work, although it did censor a KADWV publication on December 10,
 1991, (Human Rights Day) which commemorated the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. The Government's grounds for censorship was that the publication
 implied criticism of the Government. Since Kuwaiti law makes no prvision for inde-
 pendent nongovernmental organizations, KADlWV's status remains legally anoma-
 lous.i
 lOThe National Committee for Missing and POW Affairs, created in May 1991, was
 entrusted by the Government with primary responsibility for leading efforts to so-
 cure the release of Kuwaiti captives still held in Iraq. The National Committee did
 not monitor the human rights situation inside Kuwait.
 For the past 2 years, the Government has permitted visits and often met with
 representatives of various international organizations and private agencies con-
 cerned with human rights. Observers from the press, the ICRC, and diplomatic mis-
 sions also monitored the state security trials.
 Government officials also coperated with international humanitarian organiza-
 tions, including the ICRC, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHICR), and the United Nations
 Relief and Works A4eny for Palestinin Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
 ICRC delegates monitored the status of "prtected persons" in detention. The Gov-
 ernment also finalized a headquarters agreement allowing the ICRC to establish its
 regional headquartrs for the Arabian Peninsula in Kuwait. The UNHCR was al-
 lowed to establish an office in Kuwait, and the IOM was given several million dol-
 lar by the Kuwaiti Government to operate its office in Kuwait.
 Section 5. Discrimination .qsd on Race, Sex, Religion. Language, or Social Status
 In the late 1980's and up to the time of the invasion, the Government promul-
 gated a series of measures which, inter alia, dropped the bideon (and other stateless
 persons) from the census roles and stripped them of civil identification cards which
 had entitled the bearer to a variety of social services. Many of these persons were
 in a legal limbo, without the legal right to work, attend school, or travel in and out
 of Kuwait. The Government established a screening process for bidon who had
 served in the Kuwaiti military and security forces and their families and for bideon
 in special catepgries (children of Kuwaiti/bidoon marriages). Those who met the
 screening requirements were iliven residency permits; others were required to re-
 turn to their "countries" of origin. By mid-1992, the Government had rehired ap-
 
 
 1042
 proximately 10,000 bidoon in the police and military. These bidoon were reportedly
 hired on 1-year contracts at the end of which they had to provide the Government
 with proof of their "actual nationality."
 In many spheres, Kuwaiti women are allowed only a subordinate role by statute
 and practice. Women are denied the right to vote and are traditionally restrained
 from freely choosing certain roles in society. Kuwaiti women are able to work, drive,
 and have access tohigher education. Particularly since liberation, a number of Ku-
 waiti women have demanded a broader role in Kuwaiti society.
 The active role that Kuwaiti women played during the Iraqi occupation translated
 into some post-liberation calls for women's suffrage, and legislation to this effect
 was introdued in October by members of the newly -elected National Assembly.
 Kuwaiti women have a number of educational and emploent opportunities.
 Women have full access to government-provided higher education and an estimated
 60 percent of women of working age are employed. Women work as doctors, engi-
 neers, lawyers, and professors. Afew women have reached senior government posi-
 tions. In July a woman was appointed to the Amiri Diwan (royal court) as Director
 of Political Affairs.
 The extent of violence against women in Kuwait is unknown; the physical and
 sexual abuse of expatriate Asian women (especially from the Philippines, Sri Lanka
 and other South Asian countries) who work as domestic servants received consider-
 able attention in the press. Some observers believed that the problem worsened
 after liberation. Both Kuwaiti and foreign women are subjected to sexual harass-
 ment, but again the extent is unknown.
 On several occasions during the spring, over 300 women were sheltered at the
 Philippine Embassy at one time. Although most of these women sought shelter due
 to contractual or financial problems with their employers, there were significant
 numbers of cases involving severe physical and sexua abuse. In one widely reported
 case, a Filipina maid was allegedly raped by her employer and his friends and then
 confined in a fourth story room. She was seriously injured when she escaped by
 jumping out of the window. In another case, two policemen were arrested and
 charged with raping a Sri Lankan maid.
 Domestic servants may take legal recourse against their employers for abuse, but
 generally do not because of fear of reprisal and a generally substantiated fear that
 the police will side with the Kuwaiti employer. The Government said it has acted
 to punish abusers  but government actionhas not effectively dealt with the problem.
 The Government has established an office to investigate crimes and complaints in-
 vlving domestics and initiated plans to establish a shelter for runaway maids.
 Before the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1986, Islamic groups within
 that body were able to secure a bar on the granting of citizenship to non-Muslims.
 Foreign nationals are prohihited from having majority ownership in virtually
 every business other than certain small service oriented businesses and are not al-
 lowed to own property. The Government continued its Kuwaitization policy, begun
 in 1991, with the result that significant labor and educational access restrictions
 continued to be applied to foreigners, especially Palestinians and other "suspect na-
 tionalities." These persons found it difficult to obtain work and residence permits.
 The Government also made it very difficult for foreign workers to sponsor their fam-
 ilies for residency by installing high minimum wage requirements for family visas.
 There was no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the administration of
 Kuwait's extensive welfare programs. Kuwait's Shi'a minority are less likely to be
 appointed to sensitive government positions, although two ministers, including the
 important Minister of Oil and a high ranking military officer, are Shi'a. The Govern-
 ment tied access to education to possession of a valid residence permit and further
 restricted access to public education, creating hardships for some foreign nationals
 with families.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocition.-Kuwaiti workers have the right to join unions, but
 Kuwaiti law prevents the establishment of more than one umon per functional area
 or more than one general confederation. Union membership in 1992 was approxi-
 mately 33,000, (roughly 7 percent of the total work force) organized in 14 unions.
 All but two of the unions, the Bank Workers Union and the Kuwait Airways Work-
 ers Union, are affiliated with the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF). Foreign
 workers, who constitute the vast majority of the work force, were permitted by law
 to join unions after 5 years' residence but only as nonvoting member. In practice,
 foreign workers interested in union membership are able to join within a year or
 less of starting employment and residency in Kuwait. However, only 15 percent of
 the unionized workers are non-Kuwaitis. Kuwait labor law stipulates that any new
 union must include at least 100 workers, 15 of whom have to be Kuwaiti. The Min-
 
 
 1043
 ister of the Interior must certify that he has no objection to any of the founding
 members before a trade union may be established.
 Although unions are legally independent organizations, in fact, the Government
 maintains a large oversight role with regard to union financial records; 90 percent
 of union budgets are in the form of government subsidies. Unions must also follow
 a standard format for internal rules and constitutions, which includes prohibitions
 of any involvement in domestic political, religious, or sectarian issues; in practice,
 these proscriptions are generally neither observed nor enforced.
 Under the law, a union may be dissolved by a court decision for violating labor
 law or laws concerning the "preservation of public order and morals'; such a court
 decision may be appealed. The Amir may also dissolve a union by decree. No union
 has been dissolved in either manner. Kuwaiti citizen union members have the right
 to elect representatives of their own choosing, provided the candidates are also Ku-
 waitis and can demonstrate that they have no criminal record.
 The right to strike is recognized but is limited by Kuwaiti labor law, which pro-
 vides for compulsory negotiation followed by arbitration if a settlement cannot be
 reached between labor and management (see Section 6.b.). The labor union for the
 Ministry of Municipalities briefly went on strike in 1992. It was not disciplined.
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) reiter-
 ated again in 1992 its longstanding criticisms of a number of discrepancies between
 the Kuwaiti Labor Code and ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association and noted
 the Government's assertion that draft revisions to the Labor Code fulfill all provi-
 sions of the Convention "except those which run counter to national security."
 The KTUF, which consists of nine civil service unions and three oil sector unions,
 is a member of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Com-
 munist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Kuwaiti workers have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, subject to the restrictions cited above
 These rights have been incorporated in Kuwaiti labor law and have, according to
 all reports, been respected in practice. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by
 law. There were no reports of discrimination against union or nonunion employees.
 Kuwaiti labor law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "labor-
 ers or their representatives" in the private sector. In practice, most agreements are
 resolved through negotiations, possibly with the assistance of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs and Labor. Some employers have wage scales set by wage surveys. If an ami-
 cable agreement is not reached, the parties may petition the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs and Labor for settlement. If no agreed solution is reached by this means, the
 dispute is referred to a labor arbitration board composed of officials representing the
 High Court of Apeals, the Attorney General's office, and the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs and Labor. ot differences do not reach arbitration.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employers. Civil service wages are administratively set
 by the Government. In practice, government workers' representatives and ministry
 officials hold coordination meetings on a periodic basis. If no agreement is reached
 between the individual ministry and its workers, the issue is raised to the Council
 of Ministers, whose chairman, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, is also chair-
 man of the Civil Service Council. Union officials are able to resolve most issues at
 the working level and enjoy free access to the Crown Prince and other senior offi-
 cials.
 There are no export processing zones in Kuwait.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor 'except in cases specified by law for national emergency and with just remu-
 neration." This prohibition appears to be respected. However, there are credible re-
 ports that foreign nationals employed as domestic servants have been denied exit
 visas if they seek them without their employers' consent.
 Foreign nationals are required to obtain a sponsor in Kuwait in order to obtain
 a residence permit and cannot change their employment without permission from
 their origiai spnsors. Domestic servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses
 from this practice, because they are not protected by Kuwaiti labor law. Sponsors
 are frequently reluctant to grant their servants permission to change jobs because
 of their financial investment in the servants. In many cases employers exercise
 some control over their servants by holding their passports. Domestic servants who
 run away from their employers can be treated as criminals under Kuwaiti law. Do-
 mestic servants frequently work long hours, greatly exceeding the 48-hour work-
 week. In some reported cases, employers withhold wages from domestic servants to
 cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait.
 
 
 1044
 The Government of Kuwait took some steps to deal with problems facing domestic
 servants by repatriating many of them at its own expense and establishing a law
 to regulate employment agencies that hire domestic servants.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age under Kuwaiti
 law is 18 years or all forms of work, both full and part-time. This law is not fully
 observed in the nonindustrial sector. Some small businessmen employ their children
 on a part-time basis, and some South Asian domestic servants are under 18. The
 Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is charged with enforcing minimum age regula-
 tions. Employers can also obtain permits from the Ministry to employ juveniles be-
 tween the ages of 14 and 18 in certain trades.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is no legal minimum wage in the private
 sector. A two-tiered labor market ensures high wages for Kuwaiti employees while
 foreign workers, particularly unskilled laborers, receive substantially lower wages.
 However, their wage rates are higher than what they could expect to earn in their
 home countries. The minimum wage in the public sector is sufficient to provide a
 decent living for a worker and family.
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor law for both the pub-
 lic and the private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Kuwaiti
 Civil Service Law also prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. Labor
 law limits the standard workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, pro-
 vides for a minimum of 14 workdays' leave per year, and establishes a compensation
 schedule for industrial accidents. In 1989, the last year for which statistics are
 available, the industrial sector employed 24 percent of the work force.
 The ILO has urged Kuwait to guarantee the weekly 24-consecutive-hour rest pe-
 riod to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and workers
 in enterprises employing less than five persons.
 Reflecting the petroleum sector's importance to Kuwait, the law governing em-
 ployment in this area is more generous than the general laws. It provides for a 40-
 hour workweek, 30 workdays' annual leave, and a generous sick leave policy which
 authorizes sick leave for up to 2 years. Laws establishing work conditions are not
 always applied uniformly to foreign workers.
 Women are permitted to work, except in "dangerous industries and trades harm-
 ful to the health.' The are promised -remuneration equal to that of a man provided
 she does the same work.
 The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is responsible for enforcing labor laws.
 The Government has issued occupational health and safety standards; however
 compliance and enforcement appear to be poor, especially with respect to unskilled
 foreign laborers. Foreign workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled South Asian
 workers, frequently face contractual disputes, poor working conditions, and some
 physical abuse (see Section 5). Most foreign workers are not well protected by Ku-
 waiti labor laws. Domestic servants, for example, are specifically excluded from the
 Private Sector Labor Law.
