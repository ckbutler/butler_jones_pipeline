 IRAN*
 The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979 after a populist revolution
 toppled the monarchy. The Government is dominated by Shi'a Muslim clergymen.
 Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the Leader of the Islamic Revolution and functions as
 the Chief of State. He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Presi-
 dent Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, first elected in a popular vote in 1989, was re-
 elected in 1993. The Constitution, approved in 1980 by popular referendum and re-
 vised in 1989, provides for a 270-seat unicameral Islamic Consultative Assembly, or
 Majles. The Government seeks to ensure that public policy is consistent with its
 view of political and socio-religious values, but serious differences exist among the
 various factions within the leadership. The Government reinforces its power by ar-
 rests, summary trials, and executions, as well as various other forms of intimida-
 tion.
 Several government agencies are responsible for internal security, including the
 Ministry of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry of Interior, and the Revolution-
 ary Guards, a military force established after the revolution which is coequal with
 the regular military. These organizations regularly commit serious human rights
 abuses. Paramilitary volunteer forces known as hezbollahis or basijis also conduct
 vigilante actions.
 Iran has a mixed economy. The Government owns the petroleum and utilities in-
 dustries and the banks. Oil exports are the primary source of foreign exchange. The
 economy has not yet recovered from the disruptions of the 1979 revolution and the
 destruction from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran remains isolated from international finan-
 cial markets. Economic performance is adversely affected by corruption and govern-
 ment mismanagement. Unemployment in 1995 was estimated at 30 percent, and the
 annual rate of inflation was about 50 percent.
 The Government continues to be a major abuser of human rights. There was no
 evidence of improvement in 1995. Systematic abuses include extrajudicial killings
 and summary executions; widespread use of torture and other degrading treatment;
 disappearances; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of fair trials; harsh prison con-
 ditions; and repression of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and
 religion. In March the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) ex-
 tended for another year the mandate of its Special Representative on Human Rights
 in Iran. In Augut the U.N.'s Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities approved a resolution condemning the "extensive and con-
 tinuing human rights abuses" by the Government.
 The ruling clerics effectively control the electoral process, thereby denying the
 people the right to change their government. The Government denies the universal-
 ity of human rights, conceals its abuses of human rights, and obstructs the activities
 of human rights monitors.
 Throughout 1995 the Government exercised a heavy hand in censorship. It
 banned satellite dishes, closed several newspapers, prevented individuals from
 speaking in public, and forcibly broke up public protests. Despite these attacks on
 freedom of expression, a lively and open debate on political, economic, and social
 issues exists. Women face legal and social discrimination, and important worker
 rights are restricted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Given the lack of basic procedural
 safeguards in political trials, most of the executions ordered in such cases amount
 to summary executions. The U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights in Iran
 has cited the Government's "extensive" use of the death penalty. Similarly, in a
 1995 report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary
 Executions noted "the persistent allegations of violations of the right to life in the
 Islamic Republic of Iran." Although the domestic press stopped reporting most exe-
 cutions in 1992, executions appear to continue at a rate of severalhundred a year.
 Exiles and human rights monitors report that many of those executed for alleged
 criminal offenses were actually political dissidents.
 The outlawed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDP-Iran) reported that the
 Government executed 10 of its members following their arrest for unspecified politi-
 cal activity. Seven of them were executed at Orumiyeh Prison in September. They

 Government sources.

 were identified as Shahabadin Taheri, Sanar Taheri, Teymour Ibrahimi, Muham-
 mad Amin, Avaz (sic), Rahiam (sic), and Rashid Abubakri. Another victim, Sayed
 Ibrahim Taheri of the village of Pirdabad, was reportedly tortured to death. His
 body was returned to his family in August. The last two victims were Khoda Karam
 Ibrahimi, who reportedly died after 2 years of torture at Kermanshah Prison, and
 Mohammad Ali Norouzi, who reportedly died after being tortured at Nagadeh Pris-
 on.
 An unidentified member of the Fedayeen, an outlawed Marxist group, was report-
 edly executed for political activity in the city of Langrud in 1995.
 Security forces reportedly used excessive force m crowd control. In April they
 opened fire on crowds of demonstrators protesting high fuel and water prices in
 Islamshahr and Akbarabad, two poor suburbs of Tehran. At least a dozen dem-
 onstrators were reportedly killed.
 According to the international human rights group, PEN, the body of Abmad
 Miralai, an author and translator, was discovered under suspicious circumstances
 in an alley in Tehran on October 24. Earlier that day, Miralai had been scheduled
 to introduce author VS. Naipaul at a lecture. Government officials initially in-
 formed Miralai's family that Miralai had died of a stroke. Following an autopsy,
 whose results have not been released, the family was informed he had died of a
 heart attack. Miralai was one of 134 prominent writers who in 1994 signed an open
 letter protesting excessive official censorship.
 Amnesty International reported in 1995 that Haji Mohammad Ziaie, a leader of
 Iran's Sunni Muslim community, died in July 1994 under suspicious circumstances
 following his interrogation by security forces in the city of Laar. Five days after re-
 ceiving a summons to report to the local security forces in Laar for questioning,
 Ziaie's body was found mutilated some 200 kilometers from the city. Ziaie was a
 critic of the Government's treatment of Iran's Sunni Muslims.
 The Government continued to assassinate political opponents abroad. On July 10,
 three members of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian group advocating the over-
 throw of the Government, were assassinated in Baghdad, Iraq. Investigations of Ira-
 nian state-sponsored terrorism abroad continued in 1995. For example, the trial of
 Kazem Darabi, an Iranian charged with murdering four Iranian Kurdish dissidents
 in Berlin in 1992 under instructions from the Iranian Government, continued in
 Germany.
 The Government took no action during the year to repudiate the religious rulin
 calling for the death of British author Salman Rushdie and anyone associated with
 publishing his book, The Satanic Verses (see Section 2.a.).
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances. However, in 1994 the UNHRC conveyed to the Government the names
 of 506 missing persons. In the period immediately following arrest, many detainees
 are held incommunicado, a situation that amounts to temporary disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicate that security forces continue to torture detainees and pris-
 oners. Common methods include suspension for long periods in contorted positions,
 burning with cigarettes, and most frequently, severe and repeated beatings with ca-
 bles or other instruments on the back and the soles of the feet. Reports of flogging,
 stoning, amputations, and public executions also are common. Government security
 forces reportedly tortured some 24 Kurds arrested in August and September (see
 Section 14.).
 Some prisoners are held in solitary confinement or denied adequate rations or
 medical care to force confessions. Female prisoners have reportedly been raped or
 otherwise tortured while in detention. In the past, prison guards have intimidated
 the family members of detainees and have sometimes tortured detainees in their
 presence. In August a credible eyewitness reported seeing several prisoners at a
 Tehran prison.  e described them as emaciated, with swollen and bodied faces.
 Throughout the year, the Governments of Iran and Iraq made little progress in
 resolving the issue of soldiers missing in action during the Iran-Iraq War. In its
 1994 report, the International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) estimated that
 the fate of almost 19,000 Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran "remained unknown."  o
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 tra arrest and detention, there is reportedly no begal time limit on incommunicado
 detention nor any judicial means to determine the legality of detention. Suspects
 may be held for questioning in jails or local Revolutionary Guard offices.
 The security forces often do not inform family members of a prisoner's welfare and
 whereabouts. Even if a prisoner's whereabouts are known, security officials may still
 deny visits by the prisoner's family members and legal counsel. In addition, families
 of executed prisoners do not always receive notification of the prisoner's deat. In
 
 
 1154
 
 cases where the families are notified, they may be required to pay expenses for the
 delivery of the deceased's body.
 According to Human Rights Watch, in July the Government arrested Java
 Rouhani, the son of the Grand Ayatollah Sadeq Rouhani, along with 24 of the Aya-
 tollah's followers in the city of Qom. At year's end, the detainees were still being
 held without charge at an undisclosed location (see Section 2.a.).
 According to KDP-Iran, in August and September the Government arrested 26
 Kurdish civilians from the regions of Orumiyeh and Salas and charged them with
 membership in that organization. The men were reportedly tortured and face the
 death penalty.
 In January 1996, the Government released Abbas Amir Entezam, a former deputy
 minister in the government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan. Entezam was ar-
 rested in 1979 on charges of espionage and sentenced to life in prison.
 Adherents of the Bahai faith continue to face arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 Government appears to adhere to a practice of detaining a small number of Baha'is
 at any time. Two Jews are believed to be in prison because of their religion, and
 a Christian leader named Beni Paul is also reportedly in detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Iran has two court systems: the traditional court
 system, which adjudicates civil and criminal offenses; and the Islamic Revolutionary
 Courts, which were established in 1979 to try "political" offenses, narcotics crimes,
 and "crimes against God." Many aspects of the prerevolutionary judicial system sur-
 vive in the civil and criminal courts. For example, defendants have the right to a
 public trial, may choose their own lawyer, and have the right of appeal. Trials are
 adjudicated by panels of judges. There is no jury system. In the absence of
 postrevolution laws, the Government advises judges to base their decisions on Is-
 lamic law. These courts are not fully independent. The Revolutionary Courts may
 consider cases normally in the jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts and also
 may overturn their decisions. Assignment of cases to either system of courts appears
 to be haphazard. The Supreme Court has limited authority to review cases.
 Defendants tried in the Revolutionary Courts are not granted fair trials. They are
 often held in prolonged pretrial detention without access to attorneys, and their at-
 torneys are rarely afforded sufficient time to prepare their defense. Defendants are
 often indicted for such vague offenses as "moral corruption," 'antirevolutionary be-
 havior," and 'siding with global arrogance." Defendants do not have the right to
 confront their accusers or the right to appeal. Summary trials of 5 minutes are com-
 mon, and some trials are conducted in secret. Others are show trials intended to
 highlight a coerced public confession.
 During 1995 the Government began implementation of a law reorganizing the
 court system. Among its provisions, the law authorizes judges to act as prosecutor
 and judge in the same case. The rights of defendants are further eroded by the fact
 that many judges retired after the revolution and others were disbarred for ideo-
 logical reasons. The Government has replaced them with judges who are regarded
 as politically acceptable to the regime.
 In 1995 the Government conducted a highly publicized show trial covicting three
 women of involvement in the 1994 murders of Reverend Mehdi Dibaj and Reverend
 Tateos Michaelian, two of three Evangelical Christian leaders murdered under sus-
 picious circumstances that year. The women were also convicted far bombing Aya-
 tollah Khomeini's tomb near Tehran in 1994 and for plotting to bomb a shrine in
 Qom. The court sentenced Farahnaz Anami to 30 years' imprisonment and Batol
 Vaferi and Maryam Shabazpour to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in
 these incidents. During the trial, the women confessed to their involvement in the
 murders and their association with the outlawed opposition grup, the Mojahedin-
 e Khalq. Foreign diplomats and members of the international press, who attended
 the trial at the invitation of the Government, were skeptical of the women's claims
 and the fairness of the trial.
 There are no available estimates on the number of political prisoners. However,
 the Government often arrests persons on trumped-up criminal charges when their
 actual "offenses" are political. In October 1994, the U.N. Special Representative is-
 sued a report which noted that he had requested the Government to provide infor-
 mation on 78 reported political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dwelling(s)" are protected
 from trespass except as "provided by law." However, security forces enter homes and
 offices, monitor telephone conversations, and open mail without court authorization.
 In April, the Government began enforcing a ban on the ownership of satellite receiv-
 ing dishes (see Section 2.a.). The move provides security forces with a pretext for
 entering private homes.
 
 
 1155
 Paramilitary volunteer forces, including the basiis and hizbollahis, and other se-
 curity forces monitor the social activities of citizens. Such organizations may harass
 or arrest women whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body excejt
 hands and face, or those who wear makeup. Enforcement of such standards of public
 morality varies with the political climate and the jurisdiction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, except when published ideas are "contrary to Islamic principles, or are det-
 rimental to public rights." In practice, the Government exerts strong control over
 most publications. Some newspapers are associated with factions in the Govern-
 ment. They reflect different views and criticize the Government but are prohibited
 from criticizing the concept of the Islamic Republic or promoting the rights of ethnic
 minorities.
 The Government exercised a heavy hand in censorship throughout 1995. In Feb-
 ruary the Government banned the daily newspaper, Jahan-e Eslam, after it had
 published editorials written by Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former Minister of Interior
 and a hard-line radical, which were critical of President Rafsanjani. The Govern-
 ment charged Jahan-e Eslam with violating Article 6 of the Press Law, which as-
 serts the "importance of honoring religious sanctities and of respecting national in-
 terests and security.
 In March the Government banned the monthly magazine, Takapu, for printing
 vutlgar poems." In May the Government banned the university student weekly,
 Payam-e Daneshjou, for "habitual defamation." The popular student paper is known
 for its criticism of government leaders, including Prsident Rafsanjam. In October
 the Government banned the daily newspaper, Tus, which is published in Mashad
 and known for its criticism of the Government. A court convicted Tus's editor,
 Mohamed Sadeq Javadi Hessar, of "slander" and "divulging secrets." Hessar was
 sentenced to 6 months in prison and 20 lashes, but was later released on bail (see
 Section I.e.). At year's end, there is no information on whether Hessar's punishment
 had been imposed.
 The Government also seized an edition of the daily newspaper, Payam, reportedly
 because the paper published articles about embezzlement at the Bank-e Saderat, a
 corruption case which involved relatives of senior overnment officials.
 The Government took other action to suppress reedm ofthe press and freedom
 of expression. In March the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance introduced
 new regulations that expanded the Govenent's supervision of the filmmnaking in-
 dustry. In response, 214 filmmakers issued a public letter in June calling on the
 Government to ease these controls.
 In June the Government introduced a revised press law which would increase gov-
 ernment control of the press. For example, it would require journalists to obtain li-
 censes from the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance. One reporter for the
 newspaper Salam said in an interview that if the draft were enacted into law, the
 result would be "legal and clear censorship." The move was opposed by both ournal-
 ists and the banned political party, the Fredom Movement. The draft law had not
 been approved by year's end.
 Those whose public comments offend the Government risk censorship and arrest.
 In January and in June, Grand Ayatollah Sadeq Rouhani, a preeminent clerical
 leader, issued two public letters criticizing the Government. His second letter criti-
 cized arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings. The Government re-
 potdly dtained 25 of his followers from the city of Qom, including his son, Javad
 Ruhani, apparently because of Rouhani's criticism. The detainees are being held
 without charge in an undisclosed location (see Section 1.d.
 In March Ayatollah Ebrshim Haj Amini-Najafabadi was prevented from complet-
 ing a sermon at a mosque after he made critical remarks about the Government.
 The following week, Ayatollah Ali Akbar Meshkini-Qomi protested: "When a person
 like Ayatollah in. .. who is pious from head to toe and loves Islam... says
 something, gives a word of advice, it is not right to censor his remarks." The Gov-
 ernment banned former Interior Minister Mohtashami from delivering a speech on
 Au rt 16 at the Teacher Training University in Tehran.
 ita1y vigilante groups known as the hezbollahi and basiji also harassed
 public speakers. In July such vigilantes incited a crowd to attack prominent Islamic
 intellectual Abdol Karim Soroush, who was delivering a speech in a msrue in
 Tebran on Shiite theologian Ali Shariati. After the attack, more than 100 professors
 signed a letter to Presiaent Rafsanjani complaining about the incident. In October
 a hezbollahi mob prevented Soroush from delivering a scheduled speech at the Uni-
 versity of Tehran. Because of these incidents, Soroush left Iran in December out of
 fear or his safety. In July a mob disrupted a memorial service held in Teran for
 
 
 1156
 
 Karim Sanjabi, a former foreign minister in the government of Mehdi Bazargan and
 a leader in the constitutionalist group the National Front.
 In March the Government released from detention Azizollah Amir Rahimi, a
 former general, who was arrested along with his son in November 1994. Before his
 arrest Rahimmi had distributed open letters and gave interviews in which he called
 on President Rafsanjani to step down and organize free elections.
 The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance is charged with pre-publication re-
 view of books to ensure that they do not contain offensive material. The Ministry
 inspects foreign printed materials prior to their release on the market. However,
 some books and pamphlets critical of the Government are published without re-
 prisal. On August 22, a hezbollahi group firebombed a bookstore in Tehran, because
 it sold a book titled "And God Laughs Only on Mondays." The author had earlier
 received permission from the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance for publica-
 tion. The Agence France Presse reported that arsonists kidnaped a bookstore em-
 ployee and severely beat the man before releasing him. Later at a Friday sermon,
 Ayatollah Abmad Jannati justified the attack, stating: "Propaganda, articles,
 speeches and books which are contrary to Islam and to public chastity and to the
 interests of the country are forbidden.' He also said that "if someone acted on the
 basis of the imam's (Ayatollah Khoemeni) guidelines he should not be reprimanded
 by anybody."
 The Government made no effort to repudiate the 1989 religious decree condemn-
 ing to death British author Salman Rushdie for his book, The Satanic Verses, which
 the Government considers blasphemous. Nor did the Government move to repudiate
 its promise of a cash award to any person who kills Rushdie or anyone associated
 with publishing his book.
 The Government owns all broadcastin facilities, and their programming reflects
 its political and socioreligious ideology. On April 22, the Government began imple-
 mentation of its law prohibiting the ownership of satellite dishes.
 Academic censorship persists, even though restrictions on academic freedom have
 eased since the immediate postrevolutionary period. According to Human Rights
 Watch, the deputy dean of the law school at the University of Tehran, Dr. Javad
 Tabatabai, was dismissed after criticizing a 1994 law reorganizing the country's
 court system.
 Government informers are said to be common on university campuses and mon-
 itor classroom material. Admission to universities is politicized; all applicants must
 pass "character tests" in which officials screen out applicants critical of the Govern-
 ment's ideology. To achieve tenure, professors reportedly must cooperate with gov-
 ernment authorities over a period of years.
 b. Freedom of Peacefd Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits as-
 semblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam." It also
 provides for the establishment of political parties, professional associations, and reli-
 gious groups provided they do not violate the principles of "freedom, sovereignty,
 (and) national unity" or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. In practice, most
 independent organizations are banned, coopted by the Government, or moribund.
 Demonstrations against economic conditions occurred in two poor suburbs of
 Tehran in April. In putting down these demonstrations, security forces reportedly
 killed a dozen individuals and arrested dozens more (see Section L.a.).
 In August the Ministry of Interior refused to grant a license to the Freedom
 Movement, a political group founded in 1961 and declared illegal in 1991. The Min-
 istrys decision effectively precludes the party from participating in the parliamen-
 tary election in 1996. The Ministry claims that it has granted licenses to nearly -150
 political formations, trade societies, expert-scientific groups, and religious minori-
 ties' associations." No major opposition faction is evident among the licensed groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-ThAe Constitution declares that the 'official religion of
 Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism." It also states that 'other Is-
 lamic denominations shall enjoy complete respect." Religion is almost inseparable
 from government. The President and many top officials, including the Speaker of
 the Parliament and many parliamentary deputies, are Shiite clergymen.
 Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly
 over 1 percent who are not Muslims, the rest of the population are Sunni Muslims,
 who include Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans, Baluchis, and other ethnic minorities. Dur-
 ing the year there were reports that Sunni Muslims in the southeastern province
 of Sistan va Baluchistan, and in the northwestern province of Kurdistan, protested
 the suppression of their religious rights by local authorities.
 The Constitution recognizes Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism. Members
 of these religions elect representatives to reserved parliamenta  seats. They are
 free to practice their religion and instruct their children, but the Government inter-
 
 
 1157
 
 feres with the administration of their schools. Harassment by government officials
 is common (see Section 5).
 Non-Muslims may not proselytize Muslims. After three evangelical Christian min-
 isters were killed in 1994, Christian Iranians reportedly are exercising greater self-
 censorship to avoid accusation of proselytization. The Government tried and con-
 victed three women for involvement in the murders of two of those ministers (see
 Section I.e.). It maintains that the investigation into the murder of the third min-
 ister, Reverend Haik Hovsepian-Mehr, is still underway.
 According to an unconfirmed report in April authorities in Tehran arrested the
 Reverend Khosrow Khodadadi, a Musim convert to Christianity and the pastor of
 the closed Pentecostal Assyrian Church in Hamadan. Although he was released in
 June, the authorities did not inform his family of his whereabouts for 3 weeks after
 his arrest. Reverend Khodadadi was reportedly mistreated while in custody. Prior
 to his arrest, Reverend Khodadadi had long een harassed for his adherence to
 Christianity. Fearing for his life and the safety of his wife and children, he fled from
 Iran to Turkey in 1994. In November of that year, he was deported from Turkey
 back to Iran, where authorities ordered him to move away from his hometown of
 Hamadan to Tehran. The Government reportedly refuses to grant Reverend
 Khodadad and his family permission to leave the country.
 The Government regards the Baha'i community, the largest non-Muslim minority
 with 300,000 to 350,000 members, as a "misguided sect." It prohibits Baha'is from
 teaching and practicing their faith and maintaining links with coreligionists abroad.
 In 1993 the Majlesa pproved legislation that prohibits government workers from
 membership in groups that deny the "divine religions." The Government uses such
 terminology to descrbe members of the Baha'i faith. The law also stipulates pen-
 alties for government workers who do not observe "Islamic principles and rules."
 The Government also denies Baha'is access to higher education.
 In January 1996, a Revolutionary Court in city of Yazd found Zabihullah
 Mahrami, a member of the local Baha'i community, guilty of apostasy after he re-
 fused to severe his ties to the Baha'i community. The court sentenced Mahrami to
 death and also ordered the confiscation of his assets, on grounds that he did not
 have any Muslim heirs. Mahrami's wife and children are Baha'is. Mahrami ap-
 pealed to the Supreme Court, which in February rejected the verdict and referred
 the case back to a civilian court, rather than a revolutionary court, for further con-
 sideration.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been trav-
 el restrictions to Kurdish areas during times of heavy fighting. People may change
 their place of residence without obtaining official permission. The Government re-
 quires exit permits for draft-age males and citizens who are politically suspect.
 me Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in short supply and who were
 educated at government expense, must post bonds to obtain exit permits. A woman
 needs permission from a male relative to obtain a passport (see Section 5).
 The Government permits Iranian Jews to travel abroad but often denies them the
 multiple-exit permits normally issued to other citizens. The Government does not
 normally permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time.
 The Government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) esti-
 mate that there are approximately 1.5 million Afghan refugees in Iran. Some 90,000
 of these have been repatriated. Others live semnomadic lives or reside in govern-
 ment settlements. The UNHCR also estimates that there are about 600,000 Iraqi
 Kurdish and Shi'a Muslim refugees displaced by the Gulf War. The Government of
 Iran has provided assistance to these refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay associates who share
 a belief in the legitimacy of a theocratic state based on the late Ayatollah Kho-
 meini's interpretation of Shi'a Islam. There is no separation of state and religion.
 The clerics dominate all branches of government. The Government represses any
 movement seeking to separate state and religion or to alter the State's existing theo-
 cratic foundation. The selection of candidates is effectively controlled by the ruling
 clerics, consequently depriving citizens of the right to change their government.
 Regularly scheduled elections are held for the President, members of Parliament
 (the Majles), and members of the Assembly of Experts, a body responsible for select-
 ing the successor to the Leader of the Revolution. The Constitution provides for a
 Council of Guardians composed of six Islamic clergymen, and six lay members who
 review all laws for consistency with Islamic law and the Constitution. The Council
 also screens political candidates for ideological and religious suitability. It accepts
 
 
 1158
 
 only candidates who support a theocratic state, but clerics who disagree with gov-
 ernment policies have also been disqualified.
 The Majles exercises a considerable amount of independence from the executive
 branch, but its decisions are reviewed by the Council of Guardians. Vigorous par-
 liamentary debates take place on various issues, and in some cases the Majleshas
 defeated laws proposed by the executive branch. Most deputies are associated with
 powerful political and religious officials but often vote independently and shift from
 one faction to another.
 Women are underrepresented in government. They hold only 9 of 270 Majles
 seats, and there are no female cabinet members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government represses local human rights groups and has been uncooperative
 with international groups. In 1995 the U.N. Special Representative on Human
 Rights in Iran, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, resigned after 9 years of service. The Gov-
 ernment had refused to permit Pohl to visit Iran since 1991; however, it granted
 permission for a visit in February 1996 to Pohrs successor, former Canadian dip-
 lomat Maurice Danby Copinthorne. The Government has also granted permission
 for visits by several human rights monitors, including the U.N.     Rapporteur
 of the Commission on Human Rights on Religious Intolerance, the U.N     Special
 Rapporteur of the Commission on Freedom of Expression, Human Rights Watch,
 and the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights. The Government also has per-
 mitted visits by the ICRC.
 The Government has established a human rights committee in the Majles and a
 human rights commission in the judiciary, but observers believe that they lack inde-
 pendence. Government officials regularly assert that Iran should be judged by Is-
 lamic, rather than Western, human rights principles, and they reject the universal-
 ity of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In general, the Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, disabiit,
 language, or social status. The Government does discriminate on the basis of reli-
 gion and sex.
 Women.-Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known about its
 extent. Abuse in the family is considered a private matter and seldom discussed
 publicly. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Discrimination against women has increased since the revolution. In general,
 women suffer discrimination in the legal code, particularly in family and property
 matters. It is difficult for many women, particularly those residing outside large
 cities, to obtain any legal redress. Although women may be educated and employed
 in the professions, social constraints tend to inhibit their educational and economic
 opportunities. Illiteracy and the lack of university degrees also affect their standing.
 The enforcement of conservative Islamic dress codes has varied considerably since
 the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989. Nonetheless, such dress codes persist and
 are enforced arbitrarily.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce, and regula-
 tions promul ated in 1984 substantially broadened the grounds on which a woman
 may seek a ivorce. However, a husband is not required to cite a reason for divorc-
 ing his wife. A 1986 law on marriage and divorce limits the privileges accorded to
 men by custom and traditional interpretations of Islamic law; it recognized divorced
 women's rights to a share of the property acquired during marriage and increased
 alimony rights.
 In 1995 the Government permitted women to attain the rank of judges. However,
 since the Government does not permit female judges to preside over legal hearings,
 it is unclear what practical effect this change in law will have.
 The Governments views on women's rights were exemplified in an 1994 open let-
 ter to the U.N. Special Representative from the Presidents Special Advisor on Wom-
 en's Affairs, Shahla Habibi. In the letter, Habibi accused "Western emancipation"
 of causing "corruption, prostitution, Lesbianism, and widespread venereal disease."
 Children.-Most children have access to education though the 12th grade as well
 as to some form of health care. There is no known societal pattern of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no available information on whether the Gov-
 ernment has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination, particularly in the
 
 
 1159
 
 areas of employment, education, and public accommodations. Muslims who convert
 to Christianity also suffer discrimination.
 University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology. Al-
 though pub ic-school students receive instruction in Islam, this requirement limits
 access of most religious minorities to higher education. Applicants for public-sector
 employment are similarly screened for their adherence to [slam.
 Religious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower
 awards in injury and death lawsuits and incurring heavier punishments than Mus-
 lims. Sunni Muslims encounter religious discrimination at the local level.
 In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of a government
 poicy directive on the Baha'is. According to the directive the Supreme Revolution-
 ary Council reportedly instructed government agencies to block the progress and de-
 velopment of the Baha'i community; epelB~aai students from universities; cut the
 Baha'is' links with groups outside Ira; restrict the employment of Baha'is; and
 deny Baha'is "positions of influene," including those in education. The Government
 claims that the directive is a forgery. However, it appears to be an accurate reflec-
 tion of current government practice.
 The persecution of Baha'is persisted unevenly in 1995. The Government continued
 to return some property previously confiscated from individual Baha'is, although the
 amount returned is a fraction of the total seized. Property belonging to the Bahal
 community as a whole, such as places of worship, remains confiscated. Othergov-
 ernment restrictions have been eased, so that Baha'is may currently obtain food ra-
 tion booklets and send their children to public schools. However, the prohibition
 against the admission of Baha'is to universities appears to be enforced. Thousands
 of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980's receive no unemploy-
 ment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pen-
 sions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison
 sentences.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Labor Code grants workers the right
 to establish unions, there are no independent unions. A national organization known
 as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole authorized national labor orga-
 nization. It serves primarily as a conduit for government control. The leadership of
 the Worker's House coordinates activities with Islamic labor councils which are or-
 ganized in many enterprises. These councils also function as instruments of govern-
 ment control, although they have frequently been able to block layoffs and dismis-
 sals. Moreover, a network of government-backed guilds issues vocational licenses,
 funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers find jobs.
 The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. In 1993 the Parliament passed a law which prohibits
 strikes by government workers. It also prohibits government workers from having
 contacts with foreigners and stipulates penalties for failure to observe Islamic dress
 codes and principles at work.
 The Revolutionary Guards, a military force established after the revolution, forc-
 ibly broke up at least two labor strikes in 1995. In July the Guards broke up a 3-
 day strike at the Benz Khavar auto manufacturing plant in Islamshahr where work-
 ers had been demanding a pa increase. The Guards placed some workers under ar-
 rest. In August the Guards  so broke up a protest over layoffs at a private textile
 factory in the city of Ghaemshahr.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize independently and negotiate collective bargaining agreements. It
 is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the export processing zones
 differ from the law and practice in the rest of the country. No information is avail-
 able on mechanisms used to set wages.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Penal Code provides that the
 Government may require any person who does not have work to take suitable em-
 ployment. This provision has been criticized frequently by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d.Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor law prohibits employment
 of minors under 15 years of age and places special restrictions on the employment
 of minors under age 18. Education is compulsory until age 11. The law exempts
 workers in agriculture, domestic service, and some small businesses. By law women
 and minors may not be employed in hard labor or, in general, night work. informa-
 tion on the extent to which these regulations are enforced is not available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to establish annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and re-
 gion. It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or enforced. The
 
 
 1160
 
 Labor Code stipulates that the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the liv-
 ing expenses of a family and should take inflation into account. Information on the
 share of the working population covered by the minimum wage legislation is not
 available.
 The Labor Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum, with 1
 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 days of paid annual leave and
 several paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health. The Council has reportedly issued 28 safety directives and oversees the ac-
 tivities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises employing more than
 10 persons. It is not known how well the Ministry's inspectors enforce regulations.
