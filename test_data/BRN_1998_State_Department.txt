 BRUNEI
 Brunei Darussalam, a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of Bor-
 neo, is a sultanate ruled by the same family for 600 years.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of political power by the
 late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin to an appointed council of state, but in 1962 the
 then Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him to assume emer-
 gency powers for 2 years. These powers have been regularly renewed, most recently
 y the current Sultan in July. In September the Foreign Minister, Prince Mohamed,
 stated that the review of the Constitution, which has been in process for several
 years, would be completed in the near future. Although not all the articles of the
 Constitution are suspended, the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's
 power. He also serves as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Minister of Finance,
 chancellor of the national university, superintendent general of the Royal Brunei
 Police Force, and leader of the Islamic faith.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime -Minister's office, which includes an Internal Security Department, and is
 firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei's large oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with its small population, give
 it a very high per capita gross national product. Lower oil prices and the effect of
 the region's economic downturn had an impact on the economy during the year.
 Some local firms have closed, including the Amedeo Group, a large holding company
 controlled by the Sultan's brother, Prince Jefri. The primary effect of these economic
 difficulties fell on the large expatriate work force.
 Human rights remain broadly circumscribed. In practice citizens do not have the
 right to change their government, and they generally avoid political activity of any
 kind. Nor, constitutional provisions notwithstanding, do they genuinely exercise the
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. Other human rights problems,
 including discrimination against women and restriction of religious freedom, contin-
 ued.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In June an assistant superintendent of police was arrested and charged with the
 manslaughter of an Indian national. The police official allegedly used police prem-
 ises to interrogate the Indian national over a personal business matter. During the
 interrogation, the police official allegedly beat-and kicked the Indian national, who
 subsequently died of internal injuries. The police official was granted bail, and the
 case was pending at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of police mistreatment of prisoners. Any report of police mis-
 treatment of prisoners would be investigated as a violation of the law. In 1988
 caning became mandatory punishment for 42 drug-related and other criminal of-
 fenses and for vandalism. Since then, sentences of caning have been handed down
 and carried out in the presence of a doctor who monitors implementation and has
 the authority to interrupt and postpone the punishment for medical reasons. Caning
 is generally included as part of the sentencing in 80 percent of criminal convictions.
 Many convicted persons reportedly prefer caning to lengthy incarceration.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There is no overcrowd-
 ing; however, there is a growing prison population, and a new facility to supplement
 the 60-year-old prison was completed. Prisoners receive regular medical checkups.
 Remand cells at police stations are Spartan.
 Human rights monitors are not known to have requested prison visits; foreign dip-
 lomats have visited prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for a prompt judicial
 determination of the validity of an arrest. However, those provisions, like the Con-
 stitution itself, may be superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation of
 the emergency powers. The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government occa-
 sionally has used the ISA to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity;
 however, information on the detainees is published only after they are released. In
 1997 two former rebel leaders were pardoned and released, after undergoing "reli-
 gious indoctrination" and swearing loyalty to the Sultan (see Section I.e.). As far
 as is known, all former rebel leaders are out of prison; there may, however, be a
 few political detainees arrested subsequent to the 1962 rebellion who are still in de-
 tention.
 In August authorities arrested several citizens under the ISA for distributing de-
 famatory letters containing allegations about the royal family and senior govern-
 ment officials connected with the collapse of the Amedeo Group, a large holding
 company headed by the former Finance Minister and Sultan's brother, Prince Jefri.
 The Government warned citizens that it would take action against anyone involved
 in such activities.
 Police officers have broad powers to make arrests, without warrants, of persons
 caught in the act of committing a crime. However, under normal circumstances, a
 magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest. Warrants are issued without this en-
 dorsement on rare occasions, such as when police are unable to obtain the endorse-
 ment in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.
 Under the colonial-era Banishment Act of 1918, any person deemed to be a threat
 to the safety, peace, or welfare of Brunei, may be forcibly exiled either permanently
 or temporarily by the Sultan. Since independence, there have been no cases of ban-
 ishment of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution does not specifically provide for
 an independent judiciary. In 1996 in a landmark legal decision, however, the appel-
 late-level, High Court ruled that the court has powers independent of the prosecu-
 tion, and ordered a discharge in a car theft case under review, which amounted to
 an acquittal under the Criminal Procedure Code. So far the Government has not
 challenged the court's finding that magistrates have the legal power to discharge
 and acquit a defendant, even when the prosecution does not request the discharge.
 The judicial system consists of five levels of courts, with final recourse in civil
 cases available through the Privy Council in London. In 1995 Brunei terminated ap-
 peal to the Privy Council in criminal cases. Procedural safeguards include the rig t
 to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter, the right to a speedy trial, and the
 right to confront accusers. There were no known instances of government inter-
 ference with the judiciary and no trials of political opponents.
 
 
 808
 The civil law, based on English common law, provides citizens with a fair and effi-
 cient judicial process. Shari'a (Islamic law) supersedes civil law in some areas, in-
 cluding divorce, inheritance, and soihe sexual crimes. Shari'a law is not applied to
 non-Muslims.
 In 1997 two "returnees" (individuals accused or convicted of participating in the
 1962 rebellion, who fled or escaped the country, and subsequently returned) were
 released after going through "religious indoctrination," and swearing loyalty to the
 Sultan. As far as is known, all former rebel leaders are out of prison; there may,
 however, be a few political detainees arrested subsequent to the 1962 rebellion who
 are still in detention (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A-
 though the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons,
 f  ii   or homes, this rarely happens. There were no reports of mail having been
 opened prior to delivery during the year. The Government at times prevents the im-
 portation of foreign newspapers and magazines (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While there are no laws restricting freedom of
 speech and freedom of the press, the Government has used its authority to protect
 public safety, morals, health, and domestic security to restrict these freedoms. Edi-
 tions of foreign newspapers or magazines with articles that are found objectionable,
 embarrassing, or critical of the Sultan, royal family, or government are not allowed
 into the country. Magazine articles with a Christian theme reportedly invariably are
 censored. However, the growing use of fax machines, the Internet, and access to sat-
 ellite transmissions make it increasingly difficult to keep such material from enter-
 ing. The independently owned local newspaper, the Borneo Bulletin, appears to
 practice self-censorship in its choice of topics to avoid angering the Government, but
 it has instituted a new feature of letters to the editor, by which citizens--some b
 name and some anonymously--criticize the Government's handling of certain social
 economic, and environmental issues. The Government's reactions to the letters have
 been mixed. On the one hand, it has ciearly been responsive to public opinion on
 some issues such as dealing with social or environmental problems. On the other
 hand, the Internal Security lepartment allegedly has been attempting without suc-
 cess to obtain the names of people who have complained to the newspaper about
 government services. In 1997 the newspaper expanded its letters column to reflect
 the increase in letters.
 Throughout the year, the Borneo Bulletin published articles and veiled com-
 mentaries on the rift between the Sultan and Prince Jefri. Muted criticism of
 Amedeo's financial dealings and Prince Jefri's statement claiming that Amedeo had
 been viable until a group of religious conservatives within the Government inter-
 fered with its operations also were published.
 Although the only Brnei-based television station is government-owned, three Ma-
 laysian television channels are also received locally. A 10-channel cable network of
 television stations is widely available. This network includes the Cable News Net-
 work, the British Broadcasting Corporation World News, and several entertainment
 channels.
 The Government's tolerance of political criticism has not been tested recently be-
 cause there is no organized opposition. Moreover, citizens generally make almost no
 criticism of their government. In the past, the Government has not hesitated to ar-
 rest those who attempted to p~ropagate unwelcome political views.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes has not been seriously tested in recent years.
 Following a 1967 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to
 form in 1985 and 1986. It disbanded one of the parties in 1988. Political parties are
 allowed but they are not to engage in activities that endanger people. Membership
 is open to all citizens, except civil servants and security force personnel, who make
 up 60 percent of all employed citizens.
 The remaining party, the Brunei Solidarity National Party (BNSP), which had
 been inactive for several years, held an assembly in February 1995, reportedly with
 the consent of the Government. About 50 people attended. In May 1995, the party
 president resigned. In a September 1995 interview in a local newspaper, he said
 that he had resigned after the Home Affairs Ministry warned him not to involve
 himself in political activity because he is a former political detainee. He told the
 interviewer that he was seeking authorization from the Government to resume polit-
 ical activity.
 In April the BNSP enjoyed a brief revival at its General Assembly. Fewer than
 50 persons attended the meeting. Since April party leaders had expressed support
 
 
 809
 for the Government's determination to investigate the Amedeo crisis, but the party
 appeared to be largely inactive. In October the Prime Minister's Office rebuked
 BNSP President Haji Mohamed Hatta over an interview he gave to a regional news-
 magazine. The Prime Minister's Office described Hatta's portrayal of Brnei as "ir-
 responsible, untrue, inaccurate, misleading, and embarrassing."
 The activities of international service organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis, and
 the Lions, continued to be constrained by the Government, which in 1995 reminded
 local leaders of these organizations that Muslims may not be members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution states that, "The religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: Provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darussalam." The Government
 sporadically voiced alarm about "outsiders" preaching radical Islamic fundamental-
 ist or unorthodox beliefs. Citizens deemed to have been influenced by such preach-
 ing (usually students returning from overseas study) have been "shown the error of
 their ways" in study seminars organized by mainstream Islamic religious leaders.
 The Government seems more concerned about these so-called Islamic "opportunists"
 than unwelcome political views. Moreover, the Government does not hesitate to in-
 vestigate and to use its internal security apparatus against these purveyors of radi-
 cal Islam.
 In 1991 the Government began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary mon-
 archy and the observance of traditional and Muslim values by reasserting a national
 ideology known as the Malayhu Islam Beraja (MIB) or "Malay Muslim monarchy,"
 the genesis of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century. The Government in
 1993 participated in issuing the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, which affirms the right
 of all persons to a wide range of human rights, including freedom of religion. De-
 spite this and constitutional provisions providing for the full and unconstrained ex-
 ercise of religious freedom, the Government routinely restricts the practice of non-
 Muslim religions by: Prohibiting proselytizing; occasionally denying entry to foreign
 clergy or particular priests, bishops, or ministers; banning the importation of reli-
 gious teaching materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permission
 to expand, repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines. However, in Feb-
 ruary the Government allowed the Catholic Church to establish the first apostolic
 prefecture in the country and to install Monsignor Cornelius Sim, a Bruneian of
 Chinese origin, as the country's first apostolic prefect.
 In September officials of the Islamic Propagation Center confiscated gold and
 other precious Buddhist and Christian icons from a number of goldsmiths in the
 capital, stating that the open display of these items "fended local sensitivities." The
 confiscations were made under the Undesirable Publications Act, which gives the
 Government wide-ranging powers. Several days later, the goldsmiths were informed
 that they could recover their property from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 In July the authorities began to raid clubs frequented by foreign residents and
 foreign workers, in order to confiscate alcohol and foodstuffs that were not prepared
 in accordance with "halal" requirements (the Islamic requirements covering the
 slaughter of animals and the prohibition on inclusion of pork products in any food).
 The Ministry of Education has also restricted the teaching of the history of reli-
 gion or other courses on religion in non-Islamic schools while requiring courses on
 Islam or the MIB in all schools. Only the Bandar Seri Begawan and Jerudong Inter-
 national Schools are exempted from these restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts the movement of former political prisoners
 during the first year of their release. Otherwise, generally, the Government does not
 restrict freedom of movement of its citizens, visitors, and permanent residents. Gov-
 ernment employees, both citizens and foreigners working on a contractual basis,
 must apply for approval to go abroad; it is routinely granted.
 Brunei has no legal provision for granting temporary refuge, first asylum, or refi-
 gee status to those seeking such refuge or asylum. Under the law, persons arriving
 without valid entry documents and means of support are considered illegal immi-
 grants and are refused entry. There were no reported cases of individuals seeking
 temporary refuge in 1998.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are unable to change their government; Brunei is a monarchy and there
 are no established democratic processes. Under the continuing state of emergency,
 there is no parliament, and political authority and control rests in the hands of the
 ruling monarch. Individuals may seek to express their views or to influence govern-
 
 
 810
 ment decisions and policies by writing letters to the local newspaper or by petition-
 ing the Sultan or handing him letters when he appears in public.
 A form of popular representation lies in a traditional system of village chiefs who,
 since 1992, are elected by secret ballot by all adults. These leaders communicate
 constituents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic meetings
 chaired by the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by the Sultan.
 In 1996 the Sultan officiated at the first General Assembly of the "mukim" (a group
 of villages) and village consultative council. Over 1,000 village chiefs from 150 vil-
 lages and 35 mukim participated as delegates. The delegates were elected from
 among individual villagers, and the Government described the Assembly as "a grass
 roots level political system." The Sultan, however, appoints all the council's advis-
 ers. The Government insists that ordinary citizens actually use these councils to
 present their grievances and to obtain redress.
 The lack of representative democratic government seriously limits the role of both
 men and women in government and politics; however, women are making progress.
 In 1997 the Sultan's sister, Princess Masna, was confirmed as the second ranking
 official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and for the first time two women were
 appointed as permanent secretaries in the Ministries of Education, and Culture,
 Youth and Sports.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations that deal specifically with the
 protection of human rights. However, in 1997, for the first time, the Government
 entered into a human rights dialog with a foreign embassy. There were no known
 allegations of abuses or requests to visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except for religion (see Section 2.c.), the Constitution does not contain specific
 provisions prohibiting discrimination based on the factors listed above.
 Women.-The extent to which spousal abuse may occur and go unreported is not
 known. However, in response to a perception that domestic violence is a serious
 problem, the police established a special unit to investigate allegations of spousal
 abuse in 1994. Approximately 16 cases of domestic abuse were reported to police in
 the first half of 1995. The Government has established a shelter for abused women,
 and reportedly there were less than 10 women and their children resident in 1998.
 In general Islamic religious authorities oppose divorce and encourage spouses to re-
 turn even to flagrantly abusive husbands. However, they recognize wife beating as
 grounds for divorce. In 1995 the Government initiated a well-publicized telephone
 hot line to report abusers.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a
 fine. An assault resulting in serious injury would be punished by caning and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 While the level of violence in society is low, beating of servants--or refusing them
 the right to leave the house on days off, sometimes on grounds that they "might
 encounter the wrong company"-is less socially unacceptable behavior. Since most
 female domestics are foreign workers who are highly dependent on their employers,
 those subject to abuse may be unwilling or unable to bring complaints, either to the
 authorities or to their governments' embassies. When such complaints are brought,
 however, the Government generally is quick to investigate allegations of abuse and
 impose fines and punishment as warranted.
 In accordance with Koranic precepts, women are denied equal status with men
 in a number of important areas, such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of chil-
 dren. Under the Brunei Nationality Act, citizenship is transmitted through males
 only. Female citizens who are married to foreigners or bear children by foreign fa-
 thers cannot transmit citizenship to their children, even when such children are
 born in Brunei. This has resulted in creation of a sizable population of stateless chil-
 dren, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who are entitled to live in the country
 and to be documented for travel by the Government, but who cannot enjoy the full
 privileges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do not have university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-to-month positions
 continue to receive slightly less annual leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterparts in permanent positions.
 
 
 811
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Muslim women to wear the tudong, a tra-
 litional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women do not, how-
 ever, and there is no official pressure on non-Muslim women to do so. All female
 students in government-operated schools are required to wear the tudong; students
 in nongovernment schools are encouraged to wear it. All public schools are secular.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women, and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. Women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in the armed forces, although they may not serve in combat. The
 number of female university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of
 Brunei University's entering class is female.
 Children.-There are no published statistics regarding the welfare of children.
 The strong commitment to family values within society, the high standard of living,
 and government funding for children's welfare provides most children a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas, nutritional standards are high, and poverty is almost unknown. There
 were 18 reported cases of child abuse in the first half of 1995. In 1996 the Brunei
 High Court convicted a father of 11 of child abuse. The Chief Justice sentenced him
 to 20 years in prison and ordered him caned with 20 strokes of the rattan for caus-
 ing the death of his 3-year-old daughter and grievous hurt to another 2 of his chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-No legislation mandating accessibility or other assist-
 ance for disabled persons has been passed. The Government is attempting to provide
 educational services for children with disabilities, although these efforts are not yet
 adequate to address the situation. Teachers are still being trained to deal with dis-
 abled children and some children have no educational opportunities. A special facil-
 ity with trained educators is needed to accommodate the disabled children who can-
 not be assimilated into normal classrooms, and the Ministry of Education is study-
 ing the problem.
 Indigenous People.-The 6 percent of the population that is composed of indige-
 nous people long has been integrated into society, and enjoys the same rights as
 other citizens.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.--Some members of non-Malay minorities,
 such as ethnic Chinese, including those born and raised in Brunei, are not automati-
 cally accorded citizenship and must travel abroad as stateless persons. Brunei's colo-
 nial-era naturalization laws are widely viewed as out of date and in need of reform.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. There are three registered trade unions, one passive
 and two generally inactive, all of them in the oil sector, and with a total member-
 ship amounting to less than 5 percent of that industry's work force. All workers,
 including civil servants other than those serving in the military and police, may
 form or join trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government.
 The Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union federations,
 but forbids affiliation with labor organizations outside Brunei. An individual con-
 tract is required between an employer and each employee, but legal trade union ac-
 tivities cannot be deemed to violate employee contracts, Local legal experts interpret
 this provision as conferring the right to strike, but there have been no strikes.
 Brunei is not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employment
 or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or nonmembership
 in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions are not con-
 ducive to the development of trade unions. There is little interest on the part of
 workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not very active. The law
 is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few industries. There are
 few industries of the kind in which unions have traditionally developed. Also, cul-
 tural tradition favors consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit packages are
 based on market conditions and tend to be generous.
 There is a free trade zone in Muara Port, known as the Muara Export Zone
 (MEZ), established in May 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor in-
 cluding forced and bonded labor by children, and it is not practiced.
 In 1997 a foreign beauty contest winner brought suit in a foreign court against
 members of the Brunei royal family alleging that she and six other women were
 brought to Brunei in 1996 and subsequently held against their will for purposes of
 sexual exploitation. A statement bythe royal family called the case "frivolous and
 
 
 812
 groundless." The Sultan's sovereign immunity was recognized, and the court accept-
 ed Prince Jefri's claim of immunity. An appeal of Prince Jefri's immunity was pend-
 ing at year's end.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Enactment Laws of 1954 prohibits employment of children below the age of
 16. Parental consent and approval by the Labor Commission is required for those
 below the age of 18. Female minors under age 18 may not work at night or on off-
 shore oil platforms. The Department of Labor (DOL), which is a part of the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, effectively enforces laws on the employment of children. There were
 no reports of violations of the child labor laws. Forced and bonded labor by children
 is prohibited and it is not practiced (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens to command good salaries. There is no minimum wage.
 The standard workweek is Monday through Thursday and Saturday, with Friday
 and Sunday off, allowing for two 24-hour rest periods each week. Overtime is paid
 for work in excess of 48 hours a week, and double time is paid for work performed
 on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety standards are established by gov-
 ernment regulations. The DOL inspects working conditions on a routine basis and
 in response to complaints. The DOL generally enforces labor regulations effectively.
 However, in the unskilled labor sector enforcement is lax, especially for foreign la-
 borers (see Section 5). The DOL is empowered to close any workplace where health,
 safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory, and it has done so in the past.
