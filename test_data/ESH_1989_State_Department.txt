 Morocco is a monarchy whose King dominates the country through
 the exercise of his wide-ranging governmental powers and his
 traditional role as spiritual leader of the country's
 predominantly Sunni Muslim population. The King makes all
 major political decisions, appoints and dismisses the Prime
 Minister and cabinet members, promulgates laws, presides over
 the Council of Ministers, may dissolve the nation's single
 legislative body (the House of Representatives), and may
 exercise powers by decree. The King often expresses his
 desire to strengthen democracy, and a few democratic practices
 and institutions in Morocco are in place. The Constitution
 provides for a pluralistic, political system and a
 parliamentary form of government, and stipulates the freedoms
 of m6vement, expression, and'association, among others.
 However, the Parliament exercises little real power, past
 elections have not been truly free, and constitutional
 freedoms are frequently ignored in practice.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, operating within a
 framework of written legal provisions designed to maintain
 public order. All of the organizations are under the King's
 ultimate control, though many are administered on a day-to-day
 basis by the Interior Minister. In recent years, especially
 after the riots of 1981-82 and 1984, Interior Ministry and
 other security officials have been placed in administrative
 posts in other ministries, such as the Ministry of Religious
 Affairs, to ensure Interior Ministry oversight throughout the
 Government.
 Private property and private investment drive the economy,
 which is based on the free-enterprise model. Morocco is
 rapidly undergoing urbanization; nearly 50 percent of the
 population now lives in cities and towns. Overall
 unemployment in urban Morocco stands at about 15 to 20 percent
 of the work force, and the creation of new jobs continues to
 lag behind population growth. New entrants to the labor force
 number more than 200,000 annually, and full-time employment is
 difficult to find outside the unskilled, manual trades, and
 lack of full-time employment is increasingly a problem for
 skilled workers and university graduates as well. Employment,
 or lack thereof, in rural Morocco is a function of the
 availability of arable land and annual rainfall. Rural
 incomes lag behind urban incomes by half.
 In general the human rights situation did not improve
 significantly in 1989, and appears to have deteriorated in
 several areas. A positive step was the release in May by the
 King of 50 political prisoners, many of whom had been held for
 14 years. For the first time, two of Morocco's human rights
 groups published lists of Morocco's political prisoners,
 estimated to number at least 225. Another favorable
 development was increased news coverage of human rights
 abuses, which reflected a growing awareness and concern by
 both Moroccan citizens and officials for human rights.
 On the other hand, reports of police brutality, torture, and
 of cruel treatment and substandard prison conditions
 continued. When promised prison reforms were not forthcoming
 following mutinies and other protests, four political
 prisoners in Rabat resumed a hunger strike in June, which
 resulted in the death of one striker in August.

 MOROCCO
 There were a number of arrests of student activists, and in
 several instances police used force to put down student
 strikes and examination boycotts at universities and schools
 in protest against study conditions, other students'
 dismissals, and arrests. Freedom of speech and press remained
 significantly restricted, and in 1988-89 three monthly
 magazines went out of business as a result of government
 harassment and seizures. The Government in November convicted
 a newspaper director of spreading false information by
 publishing a communique by two human rights groups, but the
 King pardoned the director 3 days later. Other human rights
 concerns included arbitrary arrest and detention, lack of fair
 trial in political/security cases, and restrictions on freedom
 of association and on the right of citizens to change their
 government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known instances of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been few permanent disappearances in recent years,
 and none was reported in 1989. However, temporary
 "disappearances" continue to result from the practice of
 holding persons in pretrial detention, without notifying
 families or attorneys, for significantly longer than the legal
 limit of 10 days.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Human rights activists report that the number of incidents of
 torture, whether conducted in police stations or secret
 locations, remains high and most frequently involves detainees
 suspected of politically related crimes. Torture and other
 forms of cruel treatment most often take place during
 incommunicado detention following initial arrest, and
 confessions extracted during this period are often used to
 convict the suspect. Methods of torture reportedly include
 placing prisoners naked in small, dark punishment cells;
 beatings, often on the soles of the feet; and keeping
 prisoners in chains, restricting their movement and preventing
 them from standing upright.
 While there is no indication that the incidence of torture
 increased during 1989, there was increased press coverage of
 torture and mistreatment. Based on a review of other papers
 and sources, the Socialist Party daily Al Ittihad al Ichtiraki
 reported 12 cases in 1988 of the death of persons while in
 official custody and 13 such cases in the first 8 months of
 1989. These included deaths of persons in custody of police
 or lodal government officials. Although public officials are
 largely protected from investigation and prosecution for acts
 of torture, increased press coverage and demands by human
 rights groups have led to official investigations of some
 incidents of torture leading to death, but no prosecutions or
 administration hearings are known to have resulted.
 
 
 1494
 Moroccan prisons continue to be the focus of protests by
 prisoners, their families, and human rights activists. Prison
 legislation and standards have changed little since the
 colonial period. In September 1989, a new prison was opened
 in Sale to replace Rabat's prison, and a new prison in
 Casablanca is scheduled to open in 1990; both are intended to
 meet modetn standards. In the old prisons, prisoners are held
 in degrading conditions which include unhygienic conditions in
 kitchens, cells and dispensaries, poor medical care, extremes
 of heat and cold, and lack of ventilation. Disease is
 prevalent, with a high incidence of permanent health defects,
 chronic illnesses, and ensuing mental disorders. Prisoners
 are often deprived of visitation rights and access to mail and.
 reading'materials, and their families are subject to
 haradsment. Such mistreatment has led to deaths, suicides,
 hunger strikes, and revolt among political prisoners.
 In late February, prisoners in Rabat's Lalou prison rioted and
 held the prison for 3 days before authorities'were-able to
 resume control by negotiating with the prisoners and promising
 to address prisoner complaints, including poor conditions,
 overcrowding (1,800 prisoners in a prison built for 400),
 mistreatment, and a particularly abusive prison director.
 When the prisoners' complaints were not rectified, four
 prisoners undertook hunger strikes which ultimately resulted
 in the death of one striker in August. The other three were
 sent to the Rabat hospital in serious condition.
 Other hunger strikes took place in prisons throughout Morocco
 during the year. Three persons on a hunger strike since April
 1985 in Casablanca are still being held incommunicado in
 Averroes hospital. Authorities claimed in August that one,
 Moulay Tahar Douraldi, had requested transfer back to prison
 and had ended his strike, but his family, denied visitation
 rights, has been unable to'confirm this.
 Prison conditions and the hunger strikes were the focus of
 numerous bommuniques and demarches on Justice Ministry
 officials'by Morocco's three human rights organizations. In
 September the Government issued a "clarification" which
 claimed that none of the four persons on hunger strikes were
 political prisoners (although it admitted all were condemned
 for belonging to illegal organizations), that all had received
 fair trials and the right to counsel, and that further
 inquiries in these cases would be considered "interference in
 the internal affairs of the Kingdom."
 d." Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government often ignores guarantees of procedural due
 process. Moroccan law requires that a detainee be brought
 before a judge within 4 days of detention and informed of the
 charges against him. For political crimes, a detainee can be
 held'8 days, with a 4-day extension. These minimal legal
 requirements are widely disregarded. Detainees-are often held
 up to several weeks or longer'before appearing before a judge,
 frequently without notice or access to an attorney or to
 families. It is largely during these periods of initial
 incommunicado detention that torture and other inhumane
 treatment occurs.
 Most persons are arrested in public view, but police sometimes
 refuse to identify themselves, and warrants are not always
 used. Arrests are frequently made only on the basis of
 suspicion. Moroccan law requires that a lawyer be in
 
 
 1495
 
 attendance after initial presentation of the detainee before
 the review court, but no such right exists for the prior
 period of police custody. Morocco does not have an extensive
 system of bail, although defendants are sometimes released on
 their own recognizance. Moroccan law does not provide for
 habeas corpus or its equivalent. Under a separate code of
 military justice, military personnel have been detained in
 past years without warrants or announcement of trial. No such
 incidents were confirmed in 1989.
 Although reliable estimates of the number of arbitrary arrests
 and incommunicado detention are not available, an outbreak of
 student strikes in the spring of 1989, primarily in Kenitra,
 Fez, Oujda, Meknes, and Tetouan, resulted in the detention of
 several hundred students and many arrests. According to press
 and human rights aources, many were arrested arbitrarily,
 roughed up, and released without being charged. Others,
 charged with disturbing public order and illegal
 demonstrations, were tried, often without counsel or with
 inadequate notice to counsel, and received sentences of 5
 months to 1 year plus fines. The Government ignored the
 protests of all three of Morocco's human rights groups
 concerning the arrests. Lawyers attempting to intervene on
 behalf of the students were often denied access to them.
 There are no known instances of political activists sentenced
 to exile, although there are activists who prefer to remain
 abroad rather than risk arrest on their return to Morocco. In
 March Mohamed Ait Kadour, a Socialist Party member who was
 sentenced to death in absentia after the 1972 assassination
 attempt against King Hassan, was arrested upon his return to
 Morocco from voluntary exile in France although he holds a
 French travel document as a political refugee. In November,
 after serving 8 months in prison, Ait Kadour was pardoned by
 the King. According to some reports, the Government has
 refused to issue passports which might enable exiles to
 return. As of the fall of 1989, there was no sign that other
 political activists living in exile would be able to return to
 Morocco without fear of arrest.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Morocco has a well-developed judicial system which
 includes courts of original jurisdiction, appellate courts,
 and a supreme court, those accused of politicallsecurity
 offenses often do not enjoy.the procedural~safeguards needed
 to ensure a fair trial. Most cases are handled by
 civilian/secular courts based in part on French legal
 tradition, but a parallel judicial system exists which uses
 Islamic legal principles to deal with marriage, divorce, child
 custody, and inheritance for Muslim Mqroccans. In the Islamic
 courts, Western legal practices are not applicable, and
 Koranic principles govern the limited kinds of cases heard.
 In general, cases are brought before an initial review court--
 the court of first instance in Morocco--which can call for a
 hearing quickly to bring cases to trial. The detainee is
 informed of charges and questioned by the judge to decide if
 they have merit. If not, or if the infraction is minor, the
 judge may release the detainee or impose a light sentence.
 If a lengthy investigation is required, the judge may release
 detainees on their own recognizance. In cases of political
 
 
 1496
 crimes, detainees are often held for long periods before
 trial. There are reports of detainees convicted on the basis
 of forced confessions extracted under duress.
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered
 susceptible to political intervention and control in cases
 viewed as challenggs to royal authority or state policy.
 Human rights activists claim that only a minority of lawyers
 dare to take cases of defendants involved in political issues,
 and some defense lawyers are intimidated or persecuted.
 Activists claim that trials involving political issues are
 held in an atmosphere of harassment designed to confuse both
 defendants and their attorneys. Because of overcrowded court.
 dockets and the lack of judicial resources, defendants often
 receive only cursory hearings, and judges depend on police
 reports to decide cases. Although the State provides an
 attorney at public expense for serious crimes (when the
 sentence is over 5 years), appointed attorneys often provide
 inadequate representation. For lesser crimes, needy
 defendants usually are not represented by counsel.
 In May King Hassan released 50 prisoners, some of whom had
 served up to 14 years for activities considered subversive.
 Because they were not amnestied from their "crimes," however,
 they have been unable to find employment or to obtain
 passports or other government documents. The former prisoners
 have complained of continued police harassment and
 surveillance.
 The Government denies that it has any political prisoners.
 King Hassan explained in September that political detainees
 are in prison because of their "treasonous" opposition to
 Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara.
 For the first time in 1989, two of Morocco's human rights
 groups provided documentation on political prisoners in
 Morocco, listing names, charges, sentences, and prisons. They
 estimated that, following the release of 50 political
 prisoners in May, about 225 political prisoners remain.
 However, the groups believed their lists to be incomplete,
 since many students arrested in 1989 were not accounted for,
 and not all Islamic fundamentalists or persons imprisoned for
 involvement in the two coup attempts in the early 1970's were
 included. All three Moroccan human rights organizations asked
 the Government for a general amnesty of all political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary government interference in the private lives of
 citizens is relatively infrequent. The Constitution states
 that the home is inviolable and that no search or
 investigation may take place without a search warrant. This
 stipulation is not always observed, however, and there are'
 continuing allegations of illegal searches of the homes and
 offices of suspected political activists. It is widely
 accepted that the government security services selectively
 monitor certain individuals and organizations, including their
 telephones and mail. The university campuses are under close
 surveillance, and an informant system exists, especially on
 the campuses and in the inner cities.
 The Government does not generally interfere with the private
 beliefs of the individual, and there is no forced membership
 
 
 1497
 MOROCO
 in political organizations. The Government remains concerned
 about the spread of what it considers Islamic radicalism and
 carefully monitors activities in the nation's mosques.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression; however,
 political meetings are closely watched, criticism of the
 monarchy and Islam is not tolerated, and, in the opinion of
 most observers, neither foreign policy nor domestic politics
 iF fully open to free discussion. The Government has made it
 clear that any challenge to Morocco's claim to the Western
 Sahara is not subject to public debate.
 There is no truly independent daily Moroccan press. The
 dailies primarily present the opinions of the palace or the
 officially recognized political parties. The Ministry of
 Information, headed by the Minister of Interior, owns and
 controls the Arabic daily Al Anbaa as well as the Moroccan
 press agency, the Maghreb Arab Press, which disseminate
 official views. All newspapers receive government subsidies,
 with the three dailies in the propalace Le Matin group--Le
 Matin and Maroc Soir in French and Assahra in Arabic--
 receiving a disproportionate share. All other dailies are
 owned and controlled by Moroccan political parties and serve
 as party organs.
 There was considerable press criticism of the Government and
 some discussion of political and socioeconomic issues during
 the year, though there was no serious discussion of the
 Government's 1988-92 planning objectives, priorities, or
 strategy. Investigative reporting is severely limited, and
 journalists are under government pressure to conform to
 government policy through self-censorship. For example,
 newspapers and journal publishers and editors are frequently
 called to the Ministry of Information to explain articles
 considered objectionable by the palace and warned to
 discontinue coverage of certain topics. The Socialist Party
 daily Al Ittihad al Ichtiraki and the Communist Al Bayane were
 threatened with closure numerous times in 1989. Mohammed
 Idrissi Kaitouni, editor of the Istiqlal Party daily
 L'opinion, was tried for publishing the joint communique of
 two Moroccan human rights groups concerning the deaths of four
 persons in August, allegedly while in police or official
 custody, because the Government considered the report a
 "falsification." The editor's trial lasted 1 month and was
 covered by the Moroccan and international press. On November
 9, he was convicted and sentenced to 2 years in prison and
 fined the equivalent of $250. Three days later King Hassan II
 pardoned the editor, but the conviction created uncertainty
 among journalists-and human rights activists about what they
 can safely publish on sensitive human rights issues.
 There are a number of privately owned periodicals and
 journals. Without the protection of vested interests, such as
 political parties, publication of social criticism in these
 periodicals often has proved fatal to such independent
 journals. Three publications closed in 1988-89 because of
 government harassment and seizure. According to informed
 observers, Lamaalif, a well-respected French-language monthly,
 closed down in the summer of 1988 after 20 years of
 publication because of continued.threats and complaints by the
 Ministry of Information about material it had published.
 
 
 1498
 Kalima, a popular French-language monthly, stopped publication
 in April following government seizure of an issue devoted to
 freedom of the press in Morocco. A letter to its readers
 explained that after three seizures and one suspension in a
 year, it could no longer afford to continue. Finally, Al
 Massar, an Arabic-language weekly with extensive human rights
 coverage, closed in December 1988 in the face of an $18,500
 fine and suspended prison sentence for its publisher on the
 charge of defamation. Human rights activists claimed that the
 lawsuit, brought for publishing an article critical of a local
 official, was designed to intimidate the paper and put it out
 of business. It did.
 Officials have regularly seized foreign publications entering'
 the country from abroad. Distribution of some issues of
 international papers, including the International Herald
 Tribune, Le Monde, and the London Times, was prevented in 1989
 when they included articles deemed highly sensitive by the
 Government. For the most part, foreign publications are
 available to the public.
 The Government-owhs and controls the sole radio and television
 station received by viewers throughout Morocco. Parts of the
 country receive programs from southern Europe. In 1989 a
 second Moroccan television channel, owned by a private holding
 company controlled by the royal family, began operation. -
 Radio Mediterranee International, coowned by the palace and
 the French company Sofirad, has a more independent voice and
 an audience in Algeria and Tunisia as well as in many parts of
 Morocco       -
 There is a limited measure of academic freedom. Although
 there are strictures against scholarly investigation of the
 monarchy and Islam, limited research and publishing on Islam
 and Islamic fundamentalism goes on.
 b.., Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of assembly and
 association, but these rights are carefully controlled to the
 point of abrogation. Two decrees dating from 1935 and 1939
 enable the Government to suppress popular manifestationsof
 dissent, peaceful or not.
 Groups seen as threatening the political stability of the
 regime, such as declared radical leftists and Islamic
 fundamentalist organizations, are outlawed. Private,
 nonpolitical associations are usually-permitted after they
 register with the Government, and professional, religious,
 business, and cultural associations are active. Permits are
 required for public meetings, and if the requesting group is a
 legally registered association, permission is usually--but not
 always--granted. For example, in 1988 a new organization, the
 Moroccan Organization for Human Rights, was denied permission
 to hold its inaugural meeting on three occasions but finally
 met on December 15, 1988. It continued to meet without
 interference in 1989.
 There were student disturbances, including strikes and
 examination boycotts on many university campuses again in
 1989. while most demonstrations were peaceful, a few resulted
 in bloody clashes with security agents. A student
 organization, the Union Nationale des Etudiants Marocains
 (UNEM), banned in 1973, was legalized in late 1988 by the
 Interior Ministry. Many youth activists complained the new
 
 
 1499
 MOROCCO
 UNEM was co-opted by government authorities and was no longer
 the independent, representative, broad-based student
 organization it had been. UNEM is becoming increasingly
 factionalized and paralyzed by an emerging radical anarchist
 group, who accuse the mainstream UNEM members of being
 co-opted. Most students choose not to belong to UNEM (which
 entails being listed on a roster) for fear of being arrested
 and jailed in the event of riots on campus. Some students
 also fear that UNEM has been infiltrated by security forces.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and Islam is
 the official religion. The King bears the title "Commander of
 the Faithful," and he is the religious as well as secular
 leader of the Moroccan people. The Constitution provides for
 freedom of worship, although proselytizing is prohibited by
 law. Islamic tenets and ingrained popular attitudes strongly
 discourage conversion from Islam to another faith, and
 Moroccan converts to Christianity are occasionally subject to
 rough treatment and arbitrary arrest by police. Some African
 Christian foreign students on government scholarships reported
 pressure by university officials to convert to Islam, but
 African diplomats do not confirm such reports.
 There are organized communities of Christians and Jews in
 Morocco. There are from 7,000 to 10,000 Jews, most of whom
 live in Casablanca and several other major cities. The Jewish
 community operates private schools and social institutions as
 well as a number of synagogues. Publications in Hebrew are
 permitted, and rabbis serving the Jewish community are trained
 in Morocco. Jews are active and influential in the business
 community. They are also represented in the Government.
 The Government adheres to a pledge by the King to guarantee
 the Roman Catholic Church's right to conduct both religious
 and charitable work. Catholic clergy, who come exclusively
 from abroad, minister to some 100,000 foreign residents with
 parishes in most cities. As a result of the Pope's visit in
 1985, a resident apostolic nunciature was established in
 1986. As in past years, there continued to be reports of
 administrative harassment and surveillance of members of the
 Baha'i community, including the continuation of the 1983 ban
 on the holding of any meetings or religious ceremonies and the
 sealing off of the Baha'i cemetery in Rabat.
 The King and other religious leaders continue to oppose
 "radical" religious beliefs, and a number of Muslim
 fundamentalists (see Section I.e.) have been imprisoned.
 Interior Ministry officials monitor what is taught in the
 mosques and report deviations from orthodox Sunni Islam.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As
 the administering authority in the Western Sahara, however,
 the Moroccan Government restricts movement in areas of the
 territory which are militarily sensitive. There were no
 reported cases of restrictions on foreign travel for political
 reasons in 1989, although persons.imprisoned for political
 reasons in the past have had difficulty obtaining passports.
 
 
 1500
 MOROCCO
 While there are no formal restrictions on foreign travel and -
 emigration, it often, takes an ordinary citizen months, good
 connections, and even well-placed bribes to obtain a
 passport. In some cases, a passport may not be issued at
 all. The Minister of Interior undertook to expedite the
 process, but delays and difficulty in passport issuance remain
 the norm rather than the exception. In August the Ministry of
 Interior announced that the procedures for obtaining passports
 woul be streamlined, and it appears that for most Moroccans
 passports are somewhat easier to obtain. However, there are
 human rights activists who are still unable to travel outside
 Morocco because they have not been able to. get passports.
 A woman is obliged to have the permission of her father or, if
 mar'ied, her husband to obtain a passport. A divorced woman
 must receive her father's permission, for a passport and, it
 she h s-custody of children, she must have the children's
 father's permission for passports to be issued to children.
 There are no known instances of the Government depriving any
 citizen of Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life. Many Moroccans hold dual nationality and travel on
 passports from two countries; while in Morocco, however, they
 are, regarded as. Moroccan citizens. As a result, the
 Government has often refused to recognize the right of foreign
 embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals, or even to
 receive information concerning their arrest and imprisonment.
 This has .been a major proble, for some Western European
 embassies. Moroccan law encourages voluntary repatriation for
 Jewish community members. who have emigrated from Morocco. It
 also encourages the return ofSaharans who have opposed
 Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict. Returning former
 Polisario members deemed to pose no security threat are
 reintegrated into Moroccan life.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Moroccan citizens cannot change their Government since the
 Parliament.has little or no authority to effect change. All
 executive power is vested in a government appointed by the
 King which serves at his pleasure. Moreover, the.Constitution
 may not be amended without the approval of the King, who would
 be unlikely to abolish or modify the monarchy or the current
 system of government. The King's messages to the House of
 Representatives and the nation are not open to debate. The
 King's Prime Minister shaKes Fith Parliament the
 responsibility for initiating legislation, although in
 practice he initiates all legislation, thus controlling the
 legislative process. The Parliament passes the annual budget
 and other items-of legislatione However, many measures of
 importance are promulgated as government decrees or by royal
 proclamation. Opposition politicians frequently complain that
 the Government, which must approve the introduction of
 legislative bills into the Parliament, does not give the body
 sufficient work, both in terms of the volume of the
 legislation referred to it and of the importance of the
 legislation. Opposition party leaders also complain that the
 Government fails to keep the Parliament advised of
 developments relating to key issues. Parliamentary
 absenteeism continues to be high.
 While government legislative proposals are rarely rejected
 outright, the Parliament is sometimes able to modify the bills
 
 
 1501
 it passes and, on occasion, persuade the Government to delay
 or withdraw legislation. For example, the Government
 introduced legislation authorizing a sweeping privatization
 program in the fall of 1988. The Parliament passed the
 Government's privatization bill in December following the
 introduction of some modifications in response to opposition
 complaints.
 Nonetheless, the system allows some space for political
 parties which represent factions that developed during the
 independence movement. More than a dozen political parties,
 representing a spectrum of political philosophies from far
 left to conservative, competed in the municipal elections of
 1983 and the 1984 parliamentary elections. Some of the
 results were challenged, with widespread accusations--which
 persist today--of government tampering, both in terms of the
 selection of the candidates and in the tallying of the
 results. In a number of cases, these challenges were upheld
 in court. The Moroccan Constitution requires a referendum in
 order to extend the term of Parliament, and in December the
 people approved by referendum the extension of the current
 Parliament's term for 2 years. The King may extend the term
 of municipal councils by decree, and in November he did so for
 two years. Consequently, the next parliamentary and municipal
 council elections will now occur by September 1992.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is very sensitive to human rights inquiries and
 international publicity and does not welcome inquiries from or
 cooperate with nongovernmental organizations. In September
 1989, representatives from the International Association of
 Democratic Jurists and from the International Commission of
 Health Professionals visited Morocco to inquire about the
 political prisoners on hunger strike in Rabat and Casablanca
 (see Section l.c.). The Government refused to meet with the
 visitors or allow them to see the hunger strikers. The
 Government later published a warning that further inquiries
 about the hunger strikers would be considered "interference in
 the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Morocco." The
 Government is often slow to respond to inquiries from
 embassies into alleged human rights cases; many inquiries have
 gone unanswered for up to 2 years.
 Morocco has three human rights groups; two are affiliated with
 opposition political parties, and the third is nonpartisan.
 The Moroccan League for Human Rights is affiliated with the
 Istiqlal Party, and the Moroccan Association for Human Rights
 is affiliated with one wing of the Socialist Party. Since
 June 1988, these two organizations have formed a coordinating
 committee and often issue joint communiques. The Moroccan
 Organization for Human Rights, formed in December 1989, is
 nonpartisan.
 -All three groups were active throughout 1989 in protesting
 government actions, especially in the area of prison
 conditions, official abuse of prisoners (including political
 prisoners and the hunger strikers), and government
 interference with the press. All three issued numerous
 communiques, met with government officials, and corresponded
 with the Government. Although the three groups were not
 effective in changing government policy, they claim some
 success in popularizing human rights and sensitizing public
 opinion.
 
 
 1502
 MOROCCO
 Morocco's human rights groups report that Morocco has
 neglected in recent years to submit reports to the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission in Geneva, as part of the U.N. process.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution affirms the legal equality of all Moroccans.
 In the professions, women have made progress in law, medicine,
 and teaching, but progress in professional fields has not been
 matched in the society at large. Many women also work in
 government. The Government does not have any special programs
 to eraiicate discrimination or to promote women, especially ip
 the area of private law.
 Divorce is permitted, but a husband can simply repudiate his
 wife while a wife cannot repudiate her husband. A man is
 permitted four wives according to Islamic tradition, although
 multiple marriages are rare (perhaps 1 to 4 percent of the
 population). Serial marriages have become more common owing
 to the ease of divorce for men. Segregation of the sexes is
 common, especially in social settings. However, among the
 urban poor, as well as increasingly among middle and upper
 class families, women work outside the home and contribute to
 family income. Women have begun to dominate clerical jobs in
 the city. The woman's role in rural areas is traditional; it
 is.the women who live in more urban areas who are seeing some
 degree of liberalization of their roles.-
 Moroccan laws and social practices governing violence against
 women reflect Morocco's Islamic culture and the importance
 Islam places on the honor of the family as reflected in the
 sexual conduct of its women. For example, the Moroccan penal
 code includes severe punishment for men who are convicted of
 raping or violating a woman or girl, and the burden of proof
 is on the defendant. However, because of the terrible stigma
 attached to not being a virgin, sexual assaults often go
 unreported. Furthermore, to protect the social status of
 young girls who have been violated, the law permits the
 perpetrator to contract a marriage with his young victim after
 the fact. These marriages often occur while the perpetrator
 is in preventive detention.
 Moroccan law excuses the murder or injury of a wife who is
 found in the act of committing adultery if the husband
 surprises her and her lover. A woman would not be excused
 .after committing violence under similar circumstances.
 Domestic violence occurs in some Moroccan homes, particularly
 in rural areas and the poorer quarters of the cities, where
 wives are frequently beaten by their husbands and sisters are
 often hit by their brothers as a form of discipline. Beating
 and slapping are believed by some Moroccans to be sanctioned
 by Islamic tradition, and so are accepted. Although a woman
 has the right to complain to the police in the case of a
 severe beating, as a practical matter she would not generally
 do so unless she is prepared to file for divorce and leave her
 husband's home.
 Some Berber spokesmen claim that Moroccan institutions do not
 reflect the Berber character of the population and that, as a
 result of the lack of Berber-language schools, the Berber
 identity is not adequately maintained. A popular intellectual
 monthly review, largely dedicated to questions of Berber
 identity, was suspended in 1983 and has not reappeared. Even
 
 
 1503
 so, Berbers continue to play a significant role in national
 and local affairs. Some state-owned radio stations broadcast
 several hours daily in the Berber language. Two political
 parties, both part of the governing coalition, represent
 largely Berber areas, and Berbers continue to be well
 represented in the officer corps of the military.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to organize trade unions is provided for in the
 Constitution. Workers are free to form and join unions
 throughout the country. The right is exercised widely, but
 not universally. On occasion, tne selection of union officers
 and their ability to carry out their duties is subject to
 government pressure. In November 1989, the ILO's Committee on
 Freedom of Association, considering allegations that the
 transfer of newly elected officers by the state drinking water
 agency was an antiunion measure, recalled its earlier warhings
 to the Government and reminded it of the principles of
 noninterference in union elections.
 Some 1 million of Morocco's 7.5 million workers are
 organized. Three of the 13 existing trade union federations
 dominate the labor scene; all are independent of the
 Government. They are the Union Marocain du Travail (UMT), the
 Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT), and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). Each has a
 leadership elected democratically. The U14T has no political
 affiliation, the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of
 Popular Forces (USFP), and the UGTM to the Istiqlal Party.
 Both the USFP and Istiqlal are currently opposition parties.
 Unions in Morocco have the right to strike and do so often.
 Most of the-work stoppages are intended to advertise
 grievances and last 24 hours or less. The December
 1988-January 1989 strike at the Jerada parastatal coal mines
 led by the CDT, however, lasted nearly 2 months and attracted
 international attention. The firm eventually settled with the
 CDT, agreeing to a 5-percent wage increase and other
 concessi6ns, which were far below original demands. A second
 long strike began in August at an American firm in
 Casablanca. This dispute, complicated by rivalry between the
 UMT and the UGTM, was still unresolved at year's end, although
 the company had returned to full production.
 Unions in Morocco belong to regional labor organizations and
 maintain ties with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. The multiplicity of trade union
 federations creates competition to organize workers. Any
 group of eight workers can organize, and it is easy for a
 worker to change trade union affiliation. Thus a single
 factory may contain several independent locals or locals
 affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In both the process of organizing and during collective
 bargaining, labor laws are honored most often in the
 industrial sector of the economy, in which government
 mechanisms to promote worker-employer negotiations are more
 easily applied. In the informal and underground economies,
 
 
 1504
 especially the recently burgeoning textile sector, and in the
 artisanal field, labor laws and regulations are not only less
 carefully observed but are often ignored entirely. To some
 degree, the state of the economy, with widespread'youth
 unemployment, hinders protection of the organizing and
 collective b~rgaining process. Because of constitutional
 guarantees of the right to organize and bargain collectively,
 the principle of collective bargaining is implicit rather than
 explicit in the labor codes themselves.
 In Morocco, collective bargaining agreements are often invoked
 in legal disputes when a worker claims to have been
 reprimanded or dismissed for trade union activity. Employers.
 usually cite work-related reasons for the dismissals. An
 employer intending to fire wvnkers without replacing them must
 apply in advance to the provincial governor through the labor
 inspector's office. In the more usual cases where employers
 plan to feplace fired workers, however, the labor inspector
 provides 'replacements and mediates the cases of workers who
 protest their dismissal. Any worker fired for a serious
 infractionistch as sabotage, is entitled by law to a court
 hearing. An employer found to have dismissed a worker
 unjustly is liable for fines or even imprisonment. Because
 inspectors are overburdened, workers have turned increasingly
 to the court procedure for the resolution of complaints.
 Moroccan labor law applies equally to the small Tangier Export
 Zone. Tje proportion of unionized workers there is about the
 same as in Morocco as a whole.
 Despite constitutional protection, unions complain regularly
 that emp.l6yers suspend or dismiss their members for trade
 union activity with6ut .penalty, although the law entails fines
 or imprio'ment for some labor law violations. Under Moroccan
 law, labour lnspecto s serVe as investigator, judge, and jury
 and carry heavy workloads and are not very effective. Workers
 thus have turned increasingly to  he courts for the resolution
 of complaints.
 See,;ial allegafi6ps of antiunion discrimination in Morocco
 havd been considered by the ILO in recent years. Again in
 1989'the ILd's Comnmil-tee of Experts (COE) remarked on the
 sortcomings of Morocco's laws protqcting worker.5 against
 antiunion discrimination., While nbtinq that the new draft
 Labgr Code would kring Morocco into conformity with ILO
 Cdnv'tibn 98 on 'the Right to Orgahize and Bargain
 Collgectively, the COE regretted that the new Code has still
 not entered into force.
 c. "'Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Morocco has ratified both the International Labor
 Organization's conventions against fotced labor, although
 there appears to be no Moroccan legal or constitutional
 prohibit-i6n against such labor. As far as is known, there is
 no forced'or' compulsory labor in Morocco.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under Moroccan law, children cannot be employed or apprenticed
 before age 12. Special regulations govern the employment of
 children between the ages of 12 and 16. In artisanal work,
 however, children are often apprenticed before age 12; the
 argument is made that they need to acquire skills, such as
 weaving or rug-making, at an earlier age. Five years of
 
 
 1505
 MOROCCO
 primary education is compulsory, starting at age 7, but
 enforcement in the countryside and poorer urban areas is lax.
 Safety and health conditions as well as salaries in
 enterprises employing children are often substandard.
 Children are also employed informally as domestics and usually
 receive little or no wages. In 1989 Moroccan and
 international sources highlighted abuses of minors in the
 rug-making industry. Detection of abuses-of the child labor
 laws is complicated by the fact that many abuses occur.in the
 countryside or in private homes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum industrial wage was raised in May 1989 by 10
 percent to about 56 cents an hour. Agricultural workers also
 received a 10-percent increase in May 1989 to about $2.90 per
 day. Despite subsidies, a family cannot maintain a decent
 standard of living on the minimum wage of a single worker. In
 many cases, several members, some of them working in the
 informal economy, combine their income to support the family.
 The informal sector provides a safety net fon those who would
 otherwise be unemployed or underemployed. Most industrial
 workers in the modern sector of the economy earn more than the
 minimum wage. Moreover, workers are customarily paid between
 13 and 16 months' salary for every 12-month .year.
 Moroccan law provides a 48-hour maximum workweek (with not
 more than 10 hours for any single day), premium pay for
 overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and minimum
 conditions for health and safety, including the prohibition of
 night work for women and minors. As with other regulations
 and laws, these are observed unevenly and have little meaning
 in the informal sector. Labor inspectors endeavor to monitor
 working conditions, accidents, and labor disputes, but lack
 sufficient resources and authority to investigate many
 complaints and assure compliance with the law.
