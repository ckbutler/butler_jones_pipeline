 KIRIBATI
 The nation of.Kiribati comprises some 66,000 people occupying
 33 small islands widely scattered across 3.5 million square
 kilometers of the central Pacific. The nation's population is
 primarily Micronesian, with a significant remainder of
 Polynesian origin. Kiribati gained full independence from the
 United Kingdom in 1979 and became a republic within the
 Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected
 president and a 35-member legislative assembly elected by
 universal suffrage. Local affairs are handled in a manner
 similar to that followed in New England town meetings.
 The only security apparatus is a small police force,
 responsible to and effectively controlled by civilian
 authority.
 The economy is very small; most people are engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and farming. The islands' isolation
 and meager resources, including poor soil and limited arable
 land, severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of
 human rights. There were no reports of specific human rights
 abuses in 1990, but in the traditional culture women have
 occupied a subordinate role with limits on job opportunities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances, and no evidence of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or other such
 treatment are forbidden by the Constitution, and there were no
 reported instances of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional safeguards against arbitrary arrest and
 detention are observed in practice. There is no exile,
 internal or external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is assured by law and
 observed in practice. The Constitution provides that an
 accused person be informed of the nature of the offense with
 which he is charged and be provided adequate time and
 facilities to prepare a defense. The right to confront
 witnesses, present evidence, and appeal convictions is
 enshrined in law. Procedural safeguards are based on English
 common law and are generally similar to thobe in Western
 democracies. The judiciary is independent and free of

 KIRIBATI
 governmental interference. Kiribati has no political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the home is protected in law and respected by
 the Government. There is no arbitrary intrusion by the State
 or political organizations into the private life of the
 individual. Membership in political organizations is entirely
 voluntary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for in the
 Constitution and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio
 station and sole newspaper are government owned. Churches
 publish newsletters and other periodicals. Academic freedom
 is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, including the right to form or belong to
 associations for the advancement or protection of the group's
 interests. There are no significant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Complete freedom of religion prevails in Kiribati. There is
 no state or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek
 converts and actively do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad.
 There are no restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati has no
 refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is chosen by the people in free and open
 elections. Executive authority is exercised by the President,
 who is elected by the people. Three presidential candidates
 are nominated by the elected House of Assembly from its
 members. Under the Constitution, the President is limited to
 three terms. Thus, President Tabai, who has been in power
 since independence in 1979, will be required to leave office
 in 1991. While the President does not represent a political
 party, his recent attempts to restrict budgetary increases by
 containing wages in the public service sector have led to the
 formation of a small party, the Christian Democratic Party, in
 opposition to this policy. Public debate, however, is muted,
 given the country's small and scattered population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights
 violations by the Government and no known requests for
 
 
 919
 KIRIBATI
 investigations. There are no local nongovernmental
 organizations.that concern themselves with human rights. The
 Government has not taken an active interest in international
 human rights matters. Kiribati is not a member of the United
 Nations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 race, creed, or national origin but not on the basis of sex.
 The traditional culture, in which males are dominant, has been
 an impediment to women taking a more active role in the
 economy. This is slowly changing, and more women are finding
 work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. Women have
 full and equal access to education. Statistics on the
 participation of women in the work force and comparative wages
 are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and
 inheritance of property. Violence against women does not
 appear to be a major problem in this isolated, rural society.
 Rape is a crime under the law and the law is enforced when
 charges are brought to bear. If wife beating exists, it has
 not become a notable public concern. There were no reports of
 discrimination in the provision of social services by the
 Government. Kiribati has no significant discrimination based
 on race, religion, language, or social status. Kiribati
 society, being fundamentally egalitarian, does not have the
 privileged chiefly class of some other Pacific island
 societies.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own
 representatives, and Kiribati has a relatively strong and
 effective trade union movement. Over 90 percent of the work
 force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming. The
 Government does not control or restrict unions. In 1982 the
 seven trade unions registered in Kiribati merged to form the
 Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). It has approximately
 2,500 members, most of them drawn from the public service.
 The KTUC is affiliated-with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions.
 The right to strike is provided for by law. However, strikes
 are rare, the last one having taken place in 1980. This is
 probably due to the small size of the cash economy.
 Kiribati does not belong to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).'
 b. -The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is provided for in the Constitution.
 Government wage setting is the rule in the large public
 sector. Negotiations are generally nonconfrontational, in
 keeping with Kiribati tradition. There have been no reports
 of antiunion discrimination. Mechanisms exist, however, for
 resolving any complaints of antiunion discrimination.
 Kiribati has no export processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Kiribati.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Kiribati law prohibits the employment of children under age
 14. Children age 15 are prohibited from industrial employment
 and employment aboard ships. Children are rarely employed
 outside the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Although legislation authorizing the Government to set minimum
 wages exists, it has not yet been implemented. The Government
 has had under consideration since 1986 an ILO-funded study on
 procedures for establishing minimum wages. Employment laws
 provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the
 workplace. Employers, for example, must provide an adequate
 supply of clean water for workers and must ensure the
 existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Information was not
 available as to whether there is a legislatively prescribed
 workweek. Employers are liable for the expenses of workers
 injured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is constrained by a lack of qualified
 enforcement personnel, a lack it is attempting to remedy by
 improvements in training of the relevant personnel. Women may
 not work at night except under specified circumstances
 (generally in service jobs such as hotel clerks). Women are
 provided up to 12 weeks of maternity leave and are entitled to
 not less than 25 percent of their regular salaries during such
 leave. Nursing women are allowed one-half hour twice a day
 during working hours to nurse a child.
