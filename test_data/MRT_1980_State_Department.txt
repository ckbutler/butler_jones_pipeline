 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania's ruling military Committee for National Salva-
 tion (CMSN) has had to cope with continual political and
 economic instability since taking power in a coup d'etat in
 July 1978. The CMSN inherited a series of problems stemming
 from an economy weakened by drought and war in the Western
 Sahara and from internal political and social difficulties.
 During the past two years, Mauritania's military government
 has devoted most of its energies to finding a way to remain
 neutral in the Western Saharan conflict. It signed a peace
 treaty in August 1979 with the Polisario Front (Popular
 Front for the Liberation of Sakiet Al-Hamra and Rio de Oro)
 and has since maintained a technically neutral position
 despite pressure from both sides.
 The country also has been plagued by internal political
 difficulties. Mauritania's dominant Moors and ethnic black
 population have clashed over the issue of Arabization of the
 schools. Renewed efforts to abolish slavery and introduce
 the Sharia Islamic law in criminal cases have been similarly
 contentious; both constitute ambitious efforts to reshape
 the bases of Mauritanian society. By attempting to end
 vestiges of slavery, the government hopes to reduce ethnic
 tensions between the blacks and Moors. By introducing a
 strict and simple criminal code, relying on corporal punish-
 ment to deter crime, the government hopes to reinforce the
 government's identification with Islam and reduce common
 crimes substantially.
 Mauritania's serious economic difficulties place a severe
 burden on the impoverished majority. Although iron ore
 production has been restored to levels attained before the
 Saharan war began and government spending has been reduced,
 persistent drought conditions in most of West Africa have
 raised the cost of food imports. Increased energy costs
 have added substantially to Mauritania's international debt.
 In the face of these critical problems, the government has
 imposed firm controls over the country and has restricted
 political activity. It has forbidden all assemblies organized
 for the purpose of political discussion, whether in public
 or private dwellings. This has been strictly enforced.
 Opposition groups are not permitted and the media are govern-
 ment controlled. A midnight to six a.m. curfew in effect.
 since 1979, however, has been lifted.
 The government has generally adhered to sections of Mauritanian
 law that guarantee the integrity of the person. There is no
 evidence of mass arrests, brutality or torture. The adminis-
 tration of justice is based both on the French Declaration of
 the Rights of Man and the Universal Declaration on Human
 Rights. The ruling CMSN has declared that it will return
 Mauritania to civilian rule when the political and economic
 situation has been stabilized. No specific time frame,
 however, has been set.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 
 170
 a. Torture
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture and there is
 no evidence that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no record of either summary executions or of
 degrading treatment of prisoners. Following adoption of
 the Sharia Islamic Code, a murderer convicted by Islamic
 courts after a public trial was executed publicly by firing
 squad, and three convicted thieves were punished by having
 their right hands cut off. Public flogging of convicted
 thieves also took place on one occasion.
 The government's announcement in July that slavery was
 abolished in Mauritania drew international attention to
 this complex social and economic phenomenon. The institu-
 tion persists largely in southern Mauritania, where it
 originated in conflicts between nomadic Moors and the
 settled blacks. The Moors gradually exerted their domina-
 tion over some black groups, most of whom originally
 inhabited the Senegal River basin, reducing them to various
 forms of servitude. French colonial administrators out-
 lawed slavery in the early part of this century. It also
 was prescribed in the constitution promulgated at
 independence in 1960. The July 2, 1980 declaration of the
 abolition of slavery is thus the second time that the
 Mauritanian government has declared the institution of
 slavery to be illegal.
 Slavery in Mauritania is not identifiable with chattel
 servitude of the American historical experience. There is
 no well-developed market for slaves. Their value is deter-
 mined by owners' needs and local norms and traditions.
 Slaves usually are not compensated for their labor with
 wages or salaries, and often live the nomadic lifestyle of
 their masters. Some are regarded as an integral part of
 their owner's family; others are consciously kept apart and
 treated as servants. Many desire to be free but some wish
 to remain with their masters. Some slaves have been able to
 gain their freedom and become teachers or civil servants.
 In today's Mauritania, the status of slaves and the large
 class of descendents of slaves and freed slaves is regulated
 by complex social obligations. Slave owners, for instance,
 provide food and clothing and sometimes guarantee employment.
 On the other hand, many freed slaves must still give part of
 their harvest or wages to their former masters. Slavery has
 been an impediment to government efforts to achieve social
 equality and national unity. Slavery also contradicts
 Islamic law. President Haidalla emphasized Islam's opposition
 to slavery in his July speech announcing abolition of the
 institution. Many Moors fear that its extirpation will
 cause economic hardship and serve as a catalyst for the
 overthrow of other traditional institutions.
 Muted public reaction attended President Haidalla's announce-
 ment. The government has formed a national committee of
 government officials, religious leaders and economists to
 determine the nature of compensation promised to slave
 
 
 171
 owners. Some observers estimate that as many as 200,000
 Mauritanian slaves and their masters could be-affected
 by the formal end of slavery.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that official security forces have
 authorized or participated in abductions, secret arrests,
 or clandestine detentions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A lav& passed under the former civilian government permits
 authorities to detain anyone whom they judge to be a threat
 to national security. This power of preventive detention
 is an administrative measure which exists outside the
 defined system of law. Detention has no time limit and
 there is no right of habeas corpus. Detainees are usually
 confined to their residence. Mauritania's ruling military
 leaders continue to make use of this power. Approxi-
 mately 15 former civilian and military officials are held
 under what is, in essence, a form of strict surveillance.
 Other officials have been banished to a remote part of the
 country under orders to refrain from political activity.
 In the fall of 1979 the government allowed the most import-
 ant member of the previous regime, ousted President Mokhtar
 Ould Daddah, to travel to France for medical reasons. He
 reportedly remains in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The government is generally committed to providing prompt
 judicial proceedings. An inadequate and underfinanced
 judicial system means that suspects sometimes are held for
 long periods before trial.
 The government instituted the Sharia Islamic code in 1980.
 Sharia law as adopted in Mauritania covers three types of
 crime: adultery, personal theft and murder. A Muslim
 judge presides over a jury chosen by the governor of the
 region with jurisdiction over the case. The defendant has
 a right to counsel and can appeal a guilty verdict to the
 Supreme Islamic Court within 15 days. Circumstantial
 evidence cannot be admitted as proof of guilt. In practice,
 all convicted criminals admit their guilt, which in itself
 establishes the necessary proof. All sentences must be
 approved by the president. Mauritanian authorities hope
 that Sharia law will deter crime, and President Haidalla
 has said that the institution of Sharia is "a first step
 towards application of the precepts of Islam in all areas"
 of Mauritanian life.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The law prohibits such intrusions and there is no evidence
 that violations have occurred.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Mauritania's economy has been in very poor condition for
 several years. The country's three year involvement in
 
 
 the Saharan war resulted in decreased iron ore production
 because of Polisario raids on mining facilities. Bloated
 government expenditures marred Mauritania's efforts to
 fight the war. The war and the severe drought which plagued
 Sahelian Africa in the early 1970s nearly crippled the
 economy.
 Since 1978, the econbmy has been put on more stable footing.
 Iron ore, Mauritania's most valuable resource', will reach a
 production figure of an estimated nine million metric tons in
 1980 -- equal to prewar figures. Investment in new iron
 mines will assure mining beyond the year 2000. Government
 spending has been reduced and sufficient foreign financial
 assistance has materialized to deflect a major economic
 crisis in 1980. The government is trying to harness
 the country's enormous fisheries resources and plans to
 reinvigorate industrial policy.
 Mauritania thus far has been able to exploit successfully
 few of its resources, however. Iron ore still accounts for
 85 percent of the country's exports. Economic growth
 also has been hindered by poor planning; increasing debt,
 and high import prices for food and energy. The severe
 drought of the 1970s also has contributed to a rapid
 population shift to urban areas. Cities are overcrowded,
 meager government services cannot meet the elementary needs
 of the people, and industrial development lags far behind
 the size of the labor force. Education and health services
 are limited,, as reflected in an 11 percent literacy rate
 and a 17 percent infant mortality rate.
 Rural Mauritanians must battle the drought and cope with
 the slow disappearance of their traditional nomadic life-
 style. Government attempts to provide more services to the
 rural sector are hampered by the country's very low population
 density. Strong nomadic family traditions continue to
 provide the basis for support of the unemployed and elderly.
 Small business enterprises are an important part of Mauritania's
 economy; small food stands and shops flourish in the towns.
 The government dominates large-scale industry, however, and
 nearly all major services and utilities are run by parastatal
 firms.
 There is a large difference in income between rich and poor
 and between the traditional (small farming and herding)
 and modern sectors (mining, commercial fishing and govern-
 mental employees). The tax system is progressive, although
 few Mauritanians pay their true tax assessments. Private
 property rights are respected.
 In education, the government's task is complicated by the
 very sharp divisions between the Arabic speaking Moorish
 population and the Blacks, who have traditionally preferred
 to be educated in French and local languages rather
 than in Arabic. The government recently abandoned plans
 for total Arabization of the educational system after
 encountering widespread opposition.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press and assembly is restricted.
 Mauritania's only newspaper, news agency and radio station
 are government-operated. The editorial content of each is
 controlled and criticism of government policies is not
 permitted. Foreign newspapers and magizines are
 sold in the major towns and rarely are censored.
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since the military
 assumed control of the country in July 1978. Following
 the reorganization of the military committee in April 1979,
 the government warned that political assembly, whether
 in public or in individual dwellings, would not be tolerated.
 At that time, it imposed a curfew to discourage public
 gatherings. The curfew has since been lifted.
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually
 all citizens are Muslim and the country's official name is
 the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. However, there are
 no restrictions on other religious expression and practice.
 Several Catholic churches operate freely.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Free movement is allowed within Mauritania. Foreign travel
 requires an exit visa from the national police office.
 Some members of the former government have been refused
 permission to leave the country and, in some cases, have
 had their passports confiscated.
 No refugee groups have been resettled or granted a safe
 haven in Mauritania. A small number of Mauritanians have
 left the country because of political opposition to the
 present regime.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process has been
 abridged since 1978 when the military abolished Mauritania's
 only political party. At the present time, there are no
 elected representatives. Opposition groups are not tolerated.
 In the spring of 1980, the government launched a national
 voluntary movement to encourage Mauritanians to organize on
 a regional and village basis in the fight against desertific-
 ation and economic misery.
 Claiming that blacks constitute a majority of the population,
 many blacks charge that the Moors are substantially over-
 represented in government and religious institutions. They
 point to the fact that only 5 of 19 members of the ruling
 military commission and that prior to December 1980 6 of
 17 members of the Council of Ministers were blacks. The
 government insists that a substantial majority of
 Mauritanians are Moors, but few reliable figures exist to
 buttress the arguments of either group.
 
 
 174
 In August 1980 the government held a five day economic
 seminar for the government officials of all levels.
 President Haidalla encouraged open criticism of his govern-
 ment's economic policies. The officials attending responded
 with a torrent of comments, both positive and negative.
 In December 1980, President Haidalla announced the
 first step in restoring democratic government in Mauritania.
 A civilian prime minister was appointed, major changes were
 made in the composition of the government, and a new
 constitution promulgated.
 Traditional cultural and social values limit the role of
 Mauritanian women in government and business. Some women
 have risen to prominent positions in the field of health
 and education, and many women are employed as teachers and
 middle or low-level government bureaucrats. The government has
 recommended the establishment of an office for women's affairs.
 The Union of Mauritanian Workers (UTM) is Mauritania's
 sole labor union. Prior to the 1978 coup d'etat, the union
 was tied to the government's political party. It is
 independent now but receives a small subsidy from the
 military government and continues to work closely with the
 various ministries.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Amnesty International has requested the government of
 Mauritania to provide information concerning the dis-
 appearance of several former members of the government.
 There has been no response to these appeals. A July 1980
 proclamation ending slavery has generated international
 attention.
