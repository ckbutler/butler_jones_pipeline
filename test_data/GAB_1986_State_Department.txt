 GABON
 Gabon has a single-party political system in which effective
 political power is concentrated in the presidency. That office
 has been held since 1967 by President Omar Bongo, who is also
 head of the party. A March 1983 amendment to the party
 constitution restricts candidacy in future presidential
 elections to the "Secretary General-Founder of the Democratic
 Party of Gabon," thus reserving presidential candidacy for
 President Bongo. He was reelected President on November 9,
 1986. In practice, presidential power is limited by the
 complexity of the governmental structure and the diffusion of
 power through 60 cabinet-level officials led by a Prime
 Minister. A 120-member National Assembly is elected from
 slates chosen by the single party and meets regularly, but it
 has little real power.
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has one of the
 highest per capita incomes ($3,400 in 1986) in sub-Saharan
 Africa due to its significant petroleum and mineral resources
 and its small population. While income distribution is skewed
 in favor of the modern urban sector as opposed to the
 traditional, agricultural sector, most Gabonese have benefited
 in some measure from the country's strong economy.
 Nevertheless, the drop in world oil prices beginning in late
 1985 has led to a sharp contraction in the economy which will
 likely continue in 1987, and the country's 140,000 immigrant
 workers have been accused of taking jobs from the local work
 force. In general, economic performance has benefited from
 longstanding government policies supporting private enterprise
 and encouraging foreign investment.
 The country's 1961 Constitution guarantees protection of the
 individual and respect for the integrity of the person, and,
 with isolated exceptions, these rights are respected in
 practice. Political rights, however, are not guaranteed under
 the Constitution, and active political opposition to the sole
 legal party is not permitted. Public criticism of particular
 government actions and policies is allowed and occurs with some
 regularity within the context of the single party, although
 direct attacks on the President are prohibited. There is no
 evidence of systematic police or other'repression of the
 population. Gabon released the last of its political
 prisoners in 1985.
 On January 21, 1986, Gabon signed the 1984 United Nations
 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or
 Degrading Treatment or Punishment. On June 26, 1986, Gabon
 completed the process of signing, ratifying, and publishing
 adherence to the Organization of African Unity's Human Rights
 Charter.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions or hostage-taking by
 government or any other groups. The authorities are sometimes
 slow to advise the families of accused criminals or detainees

 GABON
 who are arrested, but there has been no evidence of attempts to
 suppress news of an arrest.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In past years the political opposition group, the Movement for
 National Recovery (MORENA), based in Paris, alleged that
 several people detained in the Libreville prison on political
 charges were mistreated or kept in degrading conditions.
 However, family members reported no serious mistreatment, and
 these allegations were not repeated in 1986. Police are
 believed to be rough but not brutal in their treatment of
 suspected criminals. Prison conditions are harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In Gabon, "acts against the security of the state" and "actions
 against the Chief of State," which can include advocating a
 multiparty system, are punishable crimes. There were no
 reports in 1986 of detention without trial of persons accused
 of violations of criminal law. Gabonese law, amended in
 September 1983 and ratified by the National Assembly early in
 1984, provides guarantees against arbitrary detention according
 to clearly articulated judicial procedure which is observed in
 practice. Previously, there were no legal protections against
 arbitrary detention.
 Forced labor is not used as a means of political coercion or
 racial or social discrimination. Some prison sentences for
 serious crimes include hard labor as part of the sentence
 during incarceration.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system, based upon French law, customary law, and the
 1961 Constitution, gives the President a powerful role and
 functions fairly effectively. The right to a fair public trial
 is guaranteed by the Constitution and has generally been
 respected in practice in criminal cases. In security/political
 cases, however, there has been more controversy and
 inconsistency. A 1982 trial of 29 alleged members of MORENA
 took place in public with representatives of the international
 press and Amnesty International present, while a 1983 trial of
 4 political dissidents took place in secret. The charges
 leveled against the accused were basically the same in both
 cases, namely, printing and distributing antigovernment tracts
 and encouraging the Government of France to use its influence
 in Gabon to bring about a multiparty political system. No
 known political prisoners are currently being held. All those
 convicted in the 1982 trial were granted full pardons by
 President Bongo on June 19, 1986.
 The Gabonese court system is modeled on the French judicial
 system. Trial courts hear questions of fact and law in civil,
 commercial, social, criminal, and administrative cases. A
 second level of appeals courts is divided into two general
 appellate courts, with a separate appeals court for criminal
 cases. Gabon's highest judicial body, the Supreme Court, is
 divided into four chambers. There are also three exceptional
 coUrts: a military tribunal which handles all military
 offenses, a state security court, and a special criminal court
 which deals with fraud and embezzlement of public funds by
 officials.
 
 
 115
 GABON
 The judiciary is implicitly susceptible to executive influence,
 since Gabon's Constitution gives the President the authority to
 appoint, transfer, and dismiss judicial officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The various police and security units monitor alleged dissident
 political activity, including dissident telephone
 conversations, but interference in the daily life of the
 populace is relatively rare.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are limits on these rights in Gabon. No direct public
 criticism of President Bongo is permitted, and no advocacy of a
 multiparty political system by the media or individuals is
 tolerated. The country's single daily newspaper, which is
 government owned, regularly prints columns attacking alleged
 inefficiency or corruption in various government offices.
 Foreign magazines and newspapers, notably French publications
 and magazines printed elsewhere in Africa, which sometimes
 criticize the President and the one-party system, generally
 circulate freely in Gabon, although occasionally particular
 issues of publications are seized by the police and a few
 publications are banned. Journalists are considered to be
 state employees and are expected to expound on themes as
 directed by the Government. The policies of the Government are
 sometimes debated in public forums. The President sometimes
 holds press conferences, and his ministers have submitted to
 lively direct questioning on television on a broad range of
 domestic policy issues such as education, public housing, and
 transportation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political activity outside the Democratic Party of Gabon is
 illegal. The Government does not interfere in the affairs of
 nonpolitical organizations. In some sectors, for example,
 sports clubs and social service organizations have been
 formed. Many have national programs under government auspices,
 but diverse private groups and events sponsored by private
 companies also exist.
 Labor unions may organize but must be affiliated with the
 government-sponsored Labor Confederation of Gabon (COSYGA),
 which is considered a specialized organ of the Democratic Party
 of Gabon and the sole labor federation. The Labor Code (1978)
 and the General Convention of Labor (1982) govern general
 working conditions and benefits for all sectors. Unions in
 each sector negotiate with management over specific pay scales,
 working conditions, and benefits applicable to their industry.
 Representatives of labor, management, and government meet
 annually to agree on the minimum wage, which is determined
 within guidelines provided by the Government. Under Gabonese
 law, all strikes are illegal which occur before remedies
 prescribed under the Labor Code have been exhausted. No
 strikes were reported in 1986, although in previous years
 workers have organized strikes or job actions over wages and
 working conditions. The Labor Confederation of Gabon is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 
 
 116
 GABON
 It is estimated that over half of Gabon's 90,000 salaried
 private sector workers are unionized. Government employees are
 not permitted to belong to unions. Agreements reached between
 labor and management in each sector also apply to nonunion and
 expatriate labor. According to the Labor Code, workers may
 individually or collectively take complaints of code violations
 to arbitration and may appeal to labor and national courts.
 These provisions are respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees religious freedom and tolerance.
 However, proselytizing has sometimes been discouraged, and in
 1985 four small syncretistic sects were banned because of
 alleged intolerance of antigovernment activities. Nonetheless,
 Christian, Muslim, and animist religions all flourish in Gabon,
 and public worship is unrestricted. A number of different
 religious groups operate schools. There is no political or
 economic discrimination because of religious preference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and return to Gabon from abroad are
 normally not restricted by the Government. Government
 employees, however, must obtain permission to travel abroad,
 and private citizens must obtain exit permits. Immigration
 laws and presidential decrees promulgated in mid-1986 imposed
 heavy monetary guarantee requirements on non-French expatriates
 working in Gabon and levied $100 exit visa fees for each
 departure from the country. Since mid-1983, the Government has
 slightly tightened restrictions on the entry and resettlement
 of displaced persons, but many individuals who have been deemed
 to have a "well-founded fear of persecution" in their country
 of origin have been given permission to stay in Gabon. There
 have been no reported cases of involuntary repatriation. Those
 refugees or displaced persons who wish to repatriate
 voluntarily are allowed to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Gabon is governed by a centralized, single-party regime in
 which President Omar Bongo exercises most political power.
 Major political and economic decisions are made by the
 President, usually in consultation with cabinet-level
 officials. This group of 60 includes representatives of all
 the country's major ethnic, geographic, and political groups.
 Through this mechanism, Gabon's varied interest groups are
 heard, given access to political patronage, and consulted on
 national resource distribution. The Fang, an ethnic group
 comprising about 35 percent of the population, feel themselves
 to be underrepresented. Fear of Fang dominance by the
 remaining 65 percent has contributed to the President's
 political control. The need to maintain the balance of
 interests represents, therefore, the major check on
 presidential power. The very size and complexity of the
 government structure is another significant factor. Opposition
 political parties are not permitted. Membership in the single
 political party is open to all Gabonese but is not required.
 Elections below the presidential level are sometimes contested,
 but all candidates must be approved by the Democratic Party of
 Gabon. The central committee of the ruling party was expanded
 in September 1986 and for the first time included two former
 members of the MORENA opposition group.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 President Bongo has invited representatives of Amnesty
 International and other human rights organizations to visit
 Gabon. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 functions in Gabon under the aegis of the United Nations
 Development Program.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In recent years, women have played an increasing role in the
 economic, political, and cultural life of the country,
 particularly in urban areas. The Government and party have
 promoted women's rights, including formation of the National
 Commission for the Promotion of Women in 1984, which called for
 increased support for health care, nutrition, and literacy
 programs for women. Although no women are among the top 40
 full government ministers, 4 women occupy cabinet positions as
 secretaries of state, and 9 others are in junior minister
 positions. In September 1986, five women became members of the
 political bureau of the Democratic Party of Gabon, the first
 women to serve at this level of the party. Women are also
 represented in the judiciary and occupy 13 seats in the
 National Assembly.
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Gabonese citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor legislation provides broad protection to workers. The
 minimum wage for unskilled labor since April 1985 has been
 about $200 per month for Gabonese and about $150 for
 foreigners. Owing to labor shortages, most salaries are much
 higher. There has been little unemployment for Gabonese
 wishing to enter the wage economy, though it is increasing as
 the economy reacts to the drop in oil prices.
 No minor below the age of 16 may work without the authorization
 of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Education. It
 is rarely granted and few employees are below the age of 18.
 Work over 40 hours per week must be compensated with overtime,
 and the workweek must include a minimum rest of 48 consecutive
 hours. Pregnant women have a right to 14 weeks of leave during
 pregnancy, including 6 weeks before delivery. The Labor Code
 describes enforcement of occupational health and safety
 standards, which are established by decree of the Minister of
 Health.
