 UNITED KINGDOM
 Traditions of law and individual rights in the United
 Kingdom are well-known and their leading places in the
 development of western democratic institutions and human
 rights practices are widely recognized. As a matter of
 government policy reflecting the will of the British
 people, the United Kingdom seeks to ensure better obser-
 vance of human rights practices in all their aspects,
 both domestically and internationally.
 The long traditions of the British people in matters of
 fair play, legal safeguards and individual rights are
 brought to a test by the situation in Northern Ireland,
 where the British Government is striving to preserve public
 safety and combat political violence within a sharply
 divided community.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includinq
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 British law forbids mistreatment or torture of prisoners,
 and provides penalties for such abuse.
 In 1971, Ireland brought a case against the United Kingdom
 before the European Commission on Human Rights, alleging
 that British security forces in Northern Ireland were
 responsible for ill treatment of persons held in cases of
 suspected terrorism, especially through use of five sensory
 deprivation interrogation techniques. In this suit,
 Ireland cited Article 3 of the-European Convention for the
 Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (to
 which the United Kingdom and Ireland are signatories),
 which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment. After four years of investigation, the
 European Commission on Human Rights concluded that some
 of the allegations set forth in the Irish suit had merit.
 The Irish Government then brought the case to the European
 Court of Human Rights, which in a January 1978 decision
 rejected the specific charges of torture.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 During the deliberations of the European Court of Human
 Rights, the British Attorney General announced that the
 United Kingdom would not contest the Commission's adverse
 findings, but emphasized that the interrogation techniques
 under contention had been voluntarily and publicly aban-
 doned in March, 1972, with substantial compensation awarded
 to those involved. He stated that these techniques would
 no longer be used, under any circumstances, by the British
 Government. The Attorney General also pointed out that
 the British Government was strengthening military and
 civilian directives against the use of police measures
 which might be considered mistreatment or torture. He
 recalled to the Court that the British Government had
 prosecuted 218 members of British security forces stationed
 in Northern Ireland on assault charges between April 1972
 and January 1977; 155 were convicted. The Attorney General
 emphasized the United Kingdom's intention to do anything
 reasonably possible to ensure observance of the Human Rights
 Convention. He concluded by voicing the hope that, in
 view of these actions, the Court would simply take note
 of the Commission's adverse conclusions against the United
 Kingdom and recognize the unambiguous British action in
 response to the charges brought in the Irish suit. Ireland
 did not accept a British request that the suit be dropped
 before final judgment. The Court found, at the same time
 that it rejected charges of torture, that the sensory dep-
 rivation interrogation techniques had constituted a breach
 of Article 3 of the Convention in that they amounted to
 inhuman and degrading treatment.
 In June 1978, Amnesty Interhational issued a report of
 its mission which visited Northern Ireland from November 28
 to December 6, 1977. The mission was primarily concerned
 with allegations of mental and physical maltreatment by
 the Royal Ulster Constabulary of persons under interrogation
 as suspected terrorists. On the basis of considering the
 cases of 78 out of the 3,444 arrested by the Constabulary
 as suspected terrorists in 1977, Amnesty International con-
 cluded that maltreatment had taken place "with sufficient
 frequency to warrant the establishment of a public inquiry
 to investigate it." Amnesty International recommended
 that, "for reasons relating to protection of suspects and
 
 
 police officers alike, a public and impartial inquiry be
 established to investigate the allegations of maltreat-
 ment", including consideration of "the rules relating to
 interrogation and detention, admissibility of statements,
 and the effectiveness of machinery for investigating com-
 plaints against the police of assault during interview."
 Pending such an inquiry, Amnesty International recommended
 that "immediate steps should be taken to ensure that
 suspects being interviewed by the Royal Ulster Constabu-
 lary on suspicion of terrorism are protected against pos-
 sible maltreatment", including such measures as "access to
 lawyers at an early stage of the detention."
 After publication of the Amnesty International report, the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Roy Mason,
 responded on behalf of the British Government in the House
 of Commons on June 8. He stated that the British Govern-
 ment did not authorize and would not condone the ill
 treatment of persons held in custody. He noted that the
 Chief Constable of Northern Ireland had pledged that such
 activity would be dealt with in accordance with law.
 Mr. Mason also announced that, apart from the existing
 channels for handling complaints of irregular police be-
 havior, the British Government would establish an independ-
 ent committee of inquiry to consider police practice and
 procedures in Northern Ireland relating to interrogation.
 The full report of the committee would be made public. On
 June 16, Mr. Mason announced the membership of the committee,
 which is chaired by a judge and has as the other members
 a retired chief inspector of constabulary and a professor
 of clinical neurology.
 The problem of confinement conditions in Northern Ireland,
 particularly at the Maze prison, also received increased
 attention during 1978. The basic issue is whether prisoners
 convicted of "politically-motivated" crimes should be
 entitled to "special status" within the prison. Beginning
 in 1972, the British Government granted "special status"
 to those serving sentences for politically-inspired violence.
 Immediately prior to this decision, prisoners who were
 members of the Irish Republican Army had engaged in a
 hunger strike for such status, while, at the same time, the
 Northern Ireland prison system had been unable to cope
 with the increasing number of prisoners convicted of ter-
 rorist crimes. All such prisoners -- Republican and
 Loyalist -- were thereafter put into segregated compounds
 
 
 where they wore their own.clothes, did no prison work,
 and were responsible for their own internal discipline.
 In March 1976, following expansion of conventional
 prison facilities, the then Secretary of State for
 Northern Ireland announced that persons convicted of
 terrorist crimes committed thereafter would be treated
 as common criminals but that those who already had
 "special status" would be allowed to serve out their
 sentences accordingly. Loyalist and Official Irish
 Republican Army prisoners convicted after the cutoff date
 at first would not acknowledge the new rule, but then
 dropped their opposition. However, the majority of
 prisoners who were members of the Provisional Irish Re-
 publican Army or of the Irish Republican Socialist Party
 refused to acknowlege their criminal status or to abide
 by prison regulations regarding such matters as clothing,
 work routines and personal hygiene. Prison authorities
 responded by restricting routine privileges, e.g.,
 mixing with other prisoners, family visits and mail, food
 parcels and allocation of tobacco and reading materials,
 and denied striking prisoners any "remission" of sen-
 tences (normally one day off for each day of good behavior).
 Despite the protests and the publicity generated by them,
 the British Government has declined to reinstitute "special
 status". This position is supported by Parliament and
 both major political parties.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The absence of a written constitution and the supremacy
 of Parliament allows for the suspension of individual
 rights on a temporary basis. Continuing political vio-
 lence in Northern Ireland has presented the Government
 with a serious problem of protecting the rights and safety
 of the province's population as a whole. Acting on the
 premise that the fundamental "right to life" was in serious
 jeopardy in Northern Ireland, the British Government pro-
 posed and Parliament adopted two acts to deal with the
 threat: the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act
 of 1973 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Pro-
 visions) Act of 1976. Although both these acts empower
 the restriction of personal liberties, they are subject
 to Parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at fre-
 quent intervals. Detention without trial under the 1973
 Act was discontinued in December 1975, although the Act
 itself remains in force. In its September 1976 report,
 
 
 the European Commission on Human Rights found that such
 detention had been justified as "strictly required by
 the exigencies of the situation" under Article 15(i) of
 the European Convention on Human Rights. The European
 Court of Human Rights upheld this view in its January 1978
 decision. The 1973 Act empowers police to arrest with-
 out warrant a person suspected of involvement in terrorism
 and to detain him or her up to 72 hours on their own
 authority. The 1976 Act allows such detention for 48 hours
 but also provides that suspected terrorists can be held
 for up to seven days on specific authorization by the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Under the 1973
 Act, members of the armed forces on duty may also arrest
 suspected terrorists without warrant and hold them for
 up to four hours, after which they must be transferred to
 police custody. There have been no allegations that these
 limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed
 forces. After arrest under either the 1973 or 1976 Act,
 immediate re-arrest under the other Act is forbidden by
 law.
 In a formal review of the operation of the 1976 Act, under-
 taken at the request of the Home Secretary and published
 in August 1978, Lord Shackleton concludes: "The powers
 of arrest and detention of Section 12, including the
 extended detention, are regrettably necessary if the police
 are to be enabled adequately to prevent acts of terrorism
 of the kind we have experienced ... Although it is not
 for me to judge what measures may, in the longer term,
 be necessary to deal wi-th terrorism, I hope-that the tem-
 porary concept of this legislation will not diminish. It
 would be highly regrettable if the view were to gain ground
 that these powers should in some way slide into part of our
 permanent legislation."
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is no evidence of such a practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 508
 The traditions of due process and concern for individual
 liberties at all levels of society are matched in Britain
 by a deep interest in the fulfillment of basic economic
 needs. In recent decades this concern has been reflected
 in the strong influence of trade unionism and the Labour
 Party in British politics. However, the differences
 between the major parties are no lonqer over objectives
 but over means, and Britain has become a leading proponent
 of the welfare state. Public discussions and governmental
 actions from the national to the local level emphasize
 the impact of political decisions on employment and the
 enlargement of economic and social benefits. Thus the
 country enjoys a heavy but progressive tax structure,
 extensive legal protection of individual and collective
 workers' rights, and well-developed schemes for .such state-
 supported benefits as those for old age and health care.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect. British law bars discrimi-
 nation on the basis of sex, race, religion or ethnic
 origin. Equal status for women is provided in the Sex
 Discrimination Act of 1975. There is equal opportunity
 for women in the professional fields. Informal discrimi-
 nation against women does not appear to be widespread,
 although British society as a whole tends toward a rather
 restrained approach to equal rights. There have been
 occasional and well-publicized disturbances arisinq from
 racial frictions. However, racial discrimination in
 employment and education is effectively barred and there
 is no major distinction between legal norms and practice
 in Britain regarding minority rights. Effective adminis-
 trative and judicial remedies are available to those with
 grievances.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigra-
 tion, with some minor restrictions on freedom of movement
 in Northern Ireland occasioned by potential terrorist
 activity.
 
 
 c. Freedom to participate in Political Process
 Political liberties are well-protected in the United
 Kingdom. Britain is a party to the United Nations Cove-
 nant on Civil and Political Rights. The United Kingdom
 differs from many democracies in having no written
 constitution or basic law defining the powers of govern-
 ment and the rights of the governed.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Britain's strong commitment to the improvement of human
 rights practices at home and throughout the world has
 been made clear by government leaders.- Speaking in
 February 1978, Foreign Secretary David Owen stressed:
 "Those in the West who seek to put pressures on others
 in the field of human rights should not show any reluc-
 tance to discuss their own record in these matters, and
 that of their friends. The British Government's practice
 is to be fully ready to listen to any comment from others
 on its record on human rights matters, to accept criticism
 where it is fair, and to rebut it firmly where it is
 unjustified. This attitude was maintained, for instance,
 throughout the recent Irish State case brought against
 us by the Irish Government. We have always made it plain
 that if the facts show us to be in the wrong we are
 willing to accept the verdict against us and to take any
 necessary remedial action."
