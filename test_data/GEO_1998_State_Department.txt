 GEORGIA
 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Multiparty par-
 liamentary elections followed a short-lived military coup in 1992 that ousted the
 elected government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The 1995 Constitution, as adopted by
 Parliament, provides for an executive branch that reports to the President and a
 legislature. In 1995 Eduard Shevardnadze was elected President, and a Parliament
 was selected in elections described by international observers as generally consistent
 with democratic norms, except in the autonomous region of Ajara. The President ap-
 points ministers with the consent of the Parliament. The Constitution provides for
 an independent judiciary; however, it is subject to executive pressure.
 Internal conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia that erupted in the early 1990's
 remain unresolved. Cease-fires are in effect in both areas, although sporadic inci-
 dents of violence occur in Abkhazia. These conflicts, together with problems created
 by roughly 283,000 internally displaced persons (IDP's), pose a significant threat to
 national stability. In 1993 Abkhaz separatists won control of Abkhazia, and most
 ethnic Georgians-a large plurality of the population-were expelled or fled the re-
 gion. In 1994 Russian peacekeeping forces representing the Commonwealth of Inde-
 pendent States (CIS) deployed in the conflict area with the agreement of the Gov-
 ernment and the Abkhaz separatists. Despite the presence of peacekeepers, there
 has been oniy very limited repatriation of ethnc Georgian IDP's during the year,
 apart from about 53,000 spontaneous returnees to the Gali region of Abkhazia. how-
 ever, in May fighting broke out again in Ga, resulting in at least 239 casualties.
 Abkhaz forces burned an estimated 50 percent of houses in some areas, and 40,000
 of the residents of Gali who had fled their homes have not yet returned. A Russian
 peacekeeping force also has been in South Ossetia since 1992. Repatriation to South
 Ossetia also has been slow. The Government has no effective control over Abkhazia
 or much of South Ossetia.
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Procuracy have primary responsibility for law
 enforcement, and the Ministry of State Security (MSS, formerly the KGB) plays a
 significant role in internal security. In times of internal disorder, the Government
 may call on the army. On October 19, army forces put down a small scale mutiny
 led  by  Colonel Akaki Eliava, a supporter of deceased former President
 Gamsakhurdia. The mutiny resulted in the deaths of one soldier and two mutineers
 and generated almost no popular support. Reformist, elected, civilian authorities
 maintain inadequate control of the law enforcement and security forces. Members
 of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses, although slightly
 fewer than in the previous year.
 The economy continued to grow during the year but was affected by the Russian
 financial crisis, which reduced exports to Russia and the value of ruble-denominated
 remittances from Georgians working in Russia. Agricultural production and hydro-
 power production suffered from the worst drought in 50 years. These factors, cou-
 pled with low government revenues, created a fiscal crisis and pressure on the lari,
 which was allowed to float on December 7. Key exports are manganese, wine, min-
 eral water, and agricultural products.
 The Government continued efforts to improve its uneven human rights record, but
 serious problems remain. Police and security forces continued to torture, beat, and
 
 
 1262
 abuse prisoners and detainees, force confessions, and routinely fabricate or plant
 evidence. Security force abuses, along with inhuman prison conditions, led to several
 deaths in custody. However, local human rights groups reported that the extent of
 such abuse declined slightly. Nonetheless, government promises of reform of prison
 conditions remained unfulfilled. Authorities continued to use arbitrary arrest and
 detention. Senior government officials acknowledged serious human rights problems,
 especially those linked to law enforcement agencies, and sought international advice
 and assistance on needed reforms. However, while structural reforms designed to
 improve respect for human rights continued to be passed by the reformist Par-
 liament, law enforcement agencies have been slow to adapt their practices to demo-
 cratic norms.
 The Government delayed implementation of the new Criminal Procedures Code,
 passed in November 1997, until May 1999. Corrupt and incompetent judges seldom
 displayed independence from the executive branch, leading to trials that were nei-
 ther fair nor expeditious. However, the Government began serious implementation
 of.the 1997 Law on the Courts with the first judicial examinations, which are de-
 signed to identify and remove corrupt and incompetent judges. Law enforcement
 agencies and other government bodies illegally interfered with citizens' right to pri-
 vacy. The Government constrains some press freedoms. The Government limits free-
 dom of assembly, and security forces continued to disperse some peaceful rallies vio-
 lently. Discrimination and violence against women are also problems.
 However, increased citizen awareness of civil rights and democratic values and
 the continued evolution of civil society provided an increasingly effective check on
 the excesses of law enforcement agencies. The number, variety, and sophistication
 of independent nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) grew, as did their ability to
 speak out for, and defend the rights of, individual citizens. Criticism from the press
 and the NGO community played an important role in reducing the incidence of pris-
 oner abuse. It also led to the ouster of the corrupt Minister of Communications, who
 had violated privacy laws routinely.
 * Independent newspapers continued to criticize government policies and actions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government agents.
 Government authorities reported that 88 persons died While in prison or pretrial
 detention, compared with 92 deaths in 1997. These deaths were caused in part by
 physical abuse, torture, and inhuman prison or pretrial detention conditions. Au-
 thorities attributed eight such deaths to suicide, including that of Gulchora
 Dursunova, who in June supposedly threw herself from a sixth floor window in the
 Ministry of Interior where she was being questioned. A local human rights group
 filed a lawsuit in the case, noting that this was the fourth instance in the past 2
 years in which an individual fell to his or her death from the sixth floor of the MOI
 building while being interrogated. In none of these cases, including the death of
 Akaki Iacobashvili in 1997, have any MOI officials been punished. In a case that
 came to light during the year, another young woman, Eka Tavartkiladze, fell to her
 death in August 1997 under similar circumstances. Police officers were questioning
 her in the home of an officer. The police claimed that the woman was a prostitute
 who had stolen from the officer in question. Officially the police called the death a
 suicide. They offered no explanation as to why she was interrogated in a home rath-
 er than in a police station, and the Procuracy declined to launch an inquiry into
 the incident. Parliament briefly held hearingF on the Tavartkiladze case, but there
 has been no official investigation. Human rights groups also filed a lawsuit in this
 case, which asks that three other allegedly wrongful deaths be investigated as well.
 It has yet to be heard.
 In December, following a peaceful sit-down demonstration by supporters of former
 President Gamsakhurdia, the badly beaten corpse of one of the demonstrators,
 Nuzgar Levasha, Deputy Energy Minister in Gamsakhurdia's government, was
 found near the site by his friends. An investigation is underway, with the police
 claiming that Levasha fell out of a nearby tree. Independent examiners who saw
 the body say that the wounds were the result of a beating (see Section 1.c.).
 Political killings were committed by elements on either side of the separatist con-
 flict in Abkhazia, including by partisan groups and by Abkhaz separatists. The par-
 tisan groups in the past have received government support and training. However,
 the Government claims that it can no longer control the partisans. These killings
 and-other abuses on either side are not being investigated, prosecuted, or punished.
 
 
 1263
 On July 13 five CIS peacekeepers were killed and three were wounded as the re-
 sult of a remote-controlled bomb explosion in western Gali. Members of either the
 White Legion or the Forest Brothers, Georgian partisan groups, are believed to have
 been responsible.
 A sweep by opposition Abkhaz forces through southern Gali in May involved the
 killing of civilians, looting, burning of homes, and killing of livestock on a large
 scale. While the bulk of the fighting was between Abkhaz militia and partisans,
 some Georgian MOI units reportedly entered Gali to help returnees get across the
 Inguri River. According to government authorities, 239 persons, including 25 civil-
 ians, were killed in clashes. Some incidents involved kidnaping, others involved gun-
 fire, and still others involved mines or other explosive devices.
 As a result of the fighting in this region, Abkhaz miitiamen, civilians, and mem-
 bers of the CIS Peacekeeping Force (PKF) have died. The perpetratrs included
 Georgian partisans, criminal gangs, and Abkhaz militiamen. For example in early
 December, two Abkhaz militiamen were killed by gunfire. Responsibility was attrib-
 uted to a group that was described in the Georgian press as more criminal than par-
 tisan. (There is collusion and rivalry among Abkhaz officials and criminal gangs,
 usually Georgian, in the Gali region for control of the lucrative nut and fruit har-
 vests, for which they depend on the labor of those Gal residents who risk return-
 ing.) In an incident a few days earlier, a mine wounded six civilians traveling on
 a minibus. On September 15, seven Abkhaz police officers were killed and five
 wounded in an ambush in Gali. In an incident in December, CIS PKF fire killed
 a Georgian militiaman after Abkhaz and Georgian units had exchanged fire. The
 Georgian Government and the Abkhaz asked the PKF to investigate.
 In February between 10 to 15 assailants unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate
 President Shevardnadze. During the exchange of gunfire, two of his bodyguards and
 one of the attackers were killed, and four bodyguards were wounded seriously. The
 police finished their investigation in early December, but the 13 defendants have
 not been brought to trial. Ten defendants are still at large. Human rights NGO's
 have not had access to the defendants. The defendants' lawyers were appointed by
 the State. One lawyer complained of "press interference" with the trial. The trial
 was expected to begin in February 1999. According to human rights NGO's, there
 are often delays of several months between the end of an investigation and the be-
 ginning of a trial.
 According to press reports, in April, apparently as a result of political infighting
 among supporters of deceased former President Gamsakhurdia, five mourners were
 killed and eight wounded when gunmen fired on a funeral procession of Gocha
 Esebua, an opposition leader. Esebua, who took four U.N. officials hostage in March
 and is believed to have participated in the Febrary assassination attempt on Presi-
 dent Shevardnadze, was killed during a shoot-out with police near Zugdi  on March
 31.
 b. Disappearance.--Georgian and Abkhaz commissions on missing persons report
 that the fate of over 1,000 Georgians and several hundred Abkhaz who disappeared
 as a result of the war in Abkhazia is still unknown. No progress has been made
 in determining their whereabouts. Georgian partisan groups active in Abkhazia,
 which in the past have received government support and training, periodically take
 hostages, usually to exchange for captured compatriots. The Government has con-
 sistenty claimed it is unable to control them and asserts that the partisans in re-
 ality are bandits and number no more than 20 to 30 individuals.
 Hostages occasionally are taken by both sides (and by criminal gangs) for ex-
 changes or simply to ralse money. On February 19, approximately 20 terrorists kid-
 naped 4 members of the U.N. observer mission in Zugdidi. The terrorists claimed
 to be supporters of former President Gamsakhurdia. All the hostages either escaped
 or were released unharmed.
 c. Torture anid Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids the use of torture, but serious abuses occur. Members of
 the security forces continued to tortre, beat,  andbuse prisoners and detainees,
 usually to extract confessions. However, according to local human rights groups,
 there was a slight decline in the incidence of such abuse during the year. These
 groups attributed the reduction to a more open society, increased intolerance of po-
 lice misconduct, greater public awareness of civil rights, and pressure from the
 international community. Nonetheless, abuses and police misconduct continue, and
 corruption and criminality, such as the fabrication or planting of evidence, remain
 problems. The MO took as an invitation variousstatements made by the President
 in late November and December on the need to crack down on tax evaders and other
 economic criminals to bear down on all perceived threats to public order (see Section
 l.a.). The most serious incidents of abuse occur in the investigative stage of pretrial
 detention when suspects are interrogated by police. Those who suffer such abuse
 
 
 1264
 routinely are held for lengthy periods in pretrial detention to give their injuries time
 to heal (see Section i.e.).
 A number of policemen have been arrested or disciplined for physical abuse. How-
 ever, this action tends to occur only in extreme cases, such as those resulting in
 death, and even then it is rare (see Section l.a.). For example police beat Yosef
 Topiridze following an altercation over an alleged traffic violation. He subsequently
 went to the headquarters of the traffic police to complain, where he was again beat-
 en, this time by the senior official to whom he complained, Roland Nachkebia, who
 broke Topiridze's jaw. None of the police officers in this case were disciplined, al-
 though Nachkebia was transferred to another position.
 Amnesty International reported many cases in which security forces used torture
 to extract confessions. Methods used included electric current.
 In the past, security forces have tortured some defendants in politically sensitive
 cases, such as members of the former Gamsakhurdia government and members of
 the paramilitary Mkhedrioni (see Section I.e.). Local human rights observers report
 that abuse most commonly occurs in two pretrial detention facilities, Isolator 5 in
 Tbilisi and the facility in Kutaisi. Isolator 5 is located in the basement of the MSS
 headquarters and is the facility in which detainees suspected of a serious crime, or
 whose cases have political overtones, are incarcerated. According to local human
 rights observers, despite calls by senior law enforcement officials for investigators
 to show restraint, many persons who are detained in Isolator 5 afterwards report
 that they were beaten or otherwise abused. Often the threat of incarceration in this
 facility is sufficient to induce a confession..
 According to reliable sources, the defendants arrested on suspicion of trying to as-
 sassinate President Shevardnadze in February reportedly were not mistreated, in
 contrast to those arrested in connection with the 1995 assassination attempt, who
 suffered torture and beatings (see Section i.e.).
 Government officials acknowledged that members of the security forces in the past
 have beaten and abused prisoners and detainees on a routine basis. Government of-
 ficials continue to claim that a lack of proper training, of supervision of investiga-
 tors and guards, and of equipment often resulted in abuse. For example investiga-
 tors were trained to obtain confessions rather than use physical evidence to assem-
 ble a case. Law enforcement agencies expressed concern that the safeguards con-
 tained in the new Criminal Procedures Code (see Section i.e.) would make it dif-
 ficult for them to combat crime but promised to take corrective action against abuse.
 Members of Parliament's Committee on Human Rights and Ethnic Relations and
 local human rights groups independently investigate claims of abuse. Despite fear
 of retaliation, many individuals file claims. The National Security Council's human
 rights advisor also has a mandate to investigate claims of abuse. In November 1997,
 the constitutionally mandated Office of Human Rights Defender, or ombudsman,
 created in 1995, finally was filled. The ombudsman so far has focused his attention
 on social and economic rights and has not been active in defending individuals from
 abuse by law enforcement agencies (see Section 4).
 Abkhaz authorities beat, detained, and tried a member of Jehovah's Witnesses
 (see Section 2.c.).
 Prison authorities admit that conditions -are inhuman in many facilities. They
 blame inadequate cells, medicine, and food on a lack of resources. Overcrowding has
 been reduced in Isolators 1 and 5, but there are reliable reports that in other facili-
 ties cells contain so many inmates that prisoners and detainees still are required
 to sleep in shifts. The lack of proper sanitation, exercise, medical care, and food
 poses a serious threat to the life and health of prisoners. Tuberculosis is a particular
 problem and was responsible for many of the deaths of individuals in custody.
 Government authorities reported that 88 persons died while in prison or pretrial
 detention, compared with 92 in 1997. According to local human rights monitors, the
 prison mortality rate would be higher except that the authorities often release pris-
 oners who are terminally ill. Most of the deaths during the year were attributed offi-
 cially to medical causes, many of them to tuberculosis. According to the Inter-
 national Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC), tuberculosis is widespread in the
 prison system, in recognition of which the ICRC continued with the authorities a
 joint program begun in 1997 to reduce its incidence. However, torture and physical
 abuse of prisoners also played a role in such deaths in custody.
 Government plans announced in 199 5 to build new prison facilities remain
 unfulfilled.
 The ICRC had full access to detention facilities, including those in Abkhazia, in
 accordance with its customary procedures, which include meetings with detainees
 without the presence of third-party observers and regular repetition of visits. The
 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission, whose man-
 date includes prison visits, reported bureaucratic delays but no serious problems in
 
 
 1265
 
 obtaining access to visit prisoners and detainees. However, local human rights
 groups report that they still encountered obstacles in visiting detainees, especially
 those whose cases have political overtones.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes provisions to
 protect citizens against arbitrary arrest and detention; however, authorities fre-
 quently violated these provisions. The Constitution provides for a 9-month period of
 maximum pretrial detention, mandated court approval of detention after 72 hours,
 and restrictions on the role of the prosecutor (see Section-i.e.). The Soviet criminal
 code, still in force, was amended to implement these constitutional safeguards in
 November 1997. These amendments are generally, although not always, observed,
 as prosecutors continue to maintain undue influence over criminal procedures.
 Judges now follow the amendments made to the old Soviet code. They now issue
 warrants and detention orders, and suspects have to be charged within 3 days. Pre-
 trial investigatory detention is limited to 9 months in accordance with the Constitu-
 tion, instead of 18 months as allowed by the old Soviet code. Judges may extend
 pretrial detention at 3-month intervals up to 9 months. Human rights NGO's state
 that the amendments to the old Soviet code have made the pretrial detention period
 less arbitrary. As of June 1, there were 8,332 prisoners serving sentences, and 2,016
 held in detention. There has not been a noticeable decrease in the number of people
 held in pretrial detention since the reduction of the limit from 18 to 9 months.
 A new Criminal Procedures Code, along with other legislation to implement Con-
 stitutional protections and restrict the powers of the Procuracy and the police, was
 passed by Parliament in November 1997, but implementation was delayed until
 May 1999 (see Section i.e.).
 According to observers, including the OSCE and the Association of Former Politi-
 cal Prisoners for Human Rights, police continue frequently to treat individuals in
 their custody with brutality, but correct legal procedures are being observed more
 often. Authorities often continued to hold prisoners who were tortured and abused
 in pretrial detentions for lengthy periods in order to give their injuries time to heal
 (see Sections 1.c. and I.e.).
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary often does not exercise independence. Prior to
 adoption of the Constitution, the courts often were influenced by pressure from the
 executive branch. This pattern continues, with judicial authorities frequently defer-
 ring to the executive branch, particularly at lower levels of the court system. Inves-
 tigators routinely plant or fabricate evidence and extort confessions in direct viola-
 tion of the Constitution. Judges generally are reluctant to exclude evidence obtained
 illegally over the objection of the Procuracy. Local human rights observers also re-
 ort widespread judicial incompetence and corruption, including the payment of
 ribes to investigators, prosecutors, and judges, which also leads to denial of justice.
 A new Law on the Courts, designed to enhance judicial independence, was passed
 by Parliament in 1997. Under the new law, the country retains a three-tier court
 system. Implementation of the law has been slow. At the lowest level are the district
 courts, which hear both routine criminal and civil cases. However, the next level,
 the regional courts of appeal, which serve as appellate courts for the district courts,
 are not yet functioning. Once set up, the regional courts are also to try major crimi-
 nal and civil cases, review cases, and either confirm verdicts or return cases to the
 lower courts for retrial. The Supreme Court, the highest level, eventually is to act
 exclusively as an appellate court, but in the absence of the regional courts, it contin-
 ues to try major cases.
 A separate Constitutional Court was created in 1996. Its mandate includes arbi-
 trating constitutional disputes between the branches of government and ruling on
 individual claims of human rights violations. The Court chose to interpret this latter
 function narrowly, agreeing to rule only on cases in which the complaint alleges that
 the violation was sanctioned by law. The Court rejected numerous complaints that
 alleged that an illegal violation of human rights had occurred. In addition the Court
 only considers one case at a time, with the result that since its inception, it has
 ruled on only 35 cases. However, the Court's rulings have demonstrated judicial
 independence.
 Administration of the court system was moved from the Ministry of Justice to a
 new Council of Justice in 1997. The Council has 12 members, 4 selected from within
 each branch of government. The law established a three-part testing procedure for
 current and prospective judges to be administered by the Council. The testing proce-
 dure, which includes a multiple choice section, an essay section, and a character and
 fitness interview, is designed to reduce judicial incompetence and corruption. The
 first examination was administered in March, when 34 individuals, (approximately
 15 percent of the candidates) passed the examination and are to be sworn in as
 
 
 1266
 
 judges in January 1999. Another examination took place in October when 105
 judges passed. However, the Constitutional Court ruled on November 3 that sitting
 judges could not be removed, thereby hampering the Government's attempts at judi-
 cial reform. The Parliament replied with a law stating that judges' terms would not
 be renewed beyond 2001 if they did not take and pass the examination, thereby ob-
 serving the decision of the Constitutional Court, yet forcing the judges to qualify
 themselves through examination. The new judges' salaries are to be raised substan-
 tially when the new Criminal Procedures Code goes into effect in April 1999 in
 order to reduce incentives for corruption.
 Supreme Court justices also are required to take the examination, but have re-
 sisted the requirement, arguing that it is an infringement on judicial independence
 and that, since they are confirmed by Parliament, they already are subject to public
 scrutiny and review. The August appointment of Lado Chanturia, the individual re-
 sponsible for the testing procedure, as Minister of Justice, was a significant step for-
 ward for the advocates of judicial reform.
 According to the Constitution, a detainee is presumed innocent and has the right
 to a public trial. A detainee has the right to demand immediate access to a lawyer
 and to refuse to make a statement in the absence of counsel. The detaining officer
 must inform the detainee of his rights and must notify the detainee's family of his
 location as soon as possible. These rights mark a significant departure from legal
 practice of the Soviet era, but they are not observed fully. Defense attorneys some-
 times have difficulty obtaining permission from investigators to visit clients. Inves-
 tigators seldom inform individuals of their rights. A local NGO prepared a brochure
 to explain to detainees their legal rights but to date has not received permission
 from the Ministry of Interior to distribute the brochure in the detention facilities.
 The legislation required to implement constitutional protections was passed by
 Parliament in 1997. The implementing legislation included a Criminal Procedures
 Code and a Law on the Procuracy. The laws are designed to create a legal system
 with adversarial trials by reducing the pervasive powers of the Procuracy, increas-
 ing the rights of defense attorneys, and enhancing the independence and authority
 of the judiciary. However, until the new code is implemented, Soviet law continues
 in force, although in practice it is not always applied. Under Soviet law, prosecutors
 are vested with powers greater than those of judges and defense attorneys. Prosecu-
 tors direct criminal investigations, supervise some judicial functions, and represent
 the State in trials. Trials are not conducted in an adversarial manner. Most crimi-
 nal trials continue to follow the Soviet model and, in many cases, such as the trial
 of Jaba Joseliani and his codefendants, prosecutors continue to wield disproportion-
 ate influence over outcomes.
 Under Soviet law, the State must provide legal counsel if the defendant is unable
 Sprovide one. In fact the State provided virtually all criminal defense attorneys,
 who were employees of the State. This system began to break down during the year.
 Individuals who could afford to pay were able to obtain the attorney of their choice
 in both criminal and civil cases. In instances where defendants were unable to af-
 ford legal counsel, attorneys were assigned to a case by the Office of Legal Assist-
 ance, a part of the state-controlled Bar Association upon the recommendation of the
 Procurator's Office. In certain cases, defendants were pressured to accept a state-
 appointed attorney, as were the defendants in the Joseliani trial.
 The trial of Joseliani, the head of the Mkhedrioni, and 14 other alleged conspira-
 tors in the 1995 assassination attempt on President Shevardnadze was character-
 ized by the same violations found in other recent trials with political overtones. The
 Government consistently violated due process both during the investigation and the
 trial. Torture, use of forced confessions, fabricated or planted evidence, denial of
 legal counsel, and expulsion of defendants from the courtroom took place. Ten of the
 defendants claimed to have been beaten or tortured and coerced to confess during
 the investigative stage of the case. According to local human rights groups, four of
 the defendants were tortured seriously, including former Security Service Captain
 Guram Papukashvili. Despite the claims of torture, the judge in the case allowed
 the confessions to be entered as evidence. The court-appointed physician who in-
 spected the defendants claimed that too much time had passed to establish whether
 the defendants had been tortured. The alleged conspirators were held in pretrial de-
 tention for 27 months before the trial began, well in excess of even the Soviet legal
 limit. According to local human rights groups, the delay was meant to give their in-
 juries time to heal, reportedly a common practice on the part of the law enforcement
 agencies (see Section 1.c.). On November 10, the Supreme Court sentenced Joseliani
 to 11 years' imprisonment for his role in the attempted assassination of President
 Shevardnadze. Other defendants received sentences of 7 to 15 years. Former Secu-
 rity Chief Captain Papukashvili received a sentence of 10 years.
 
 
 1267
 
 International and local human rights groups agree that there are political pris-
 oners but disagree about the number. In 1997 Russian human rights activist Sergei
 Kovalev visited 17 prisoners and detainees and concluded that all were being held
 for political reasons. Local observers disagreed with this view, noting that many of
 these individuals had committed violent acts during the civil war or the period of
 near anarchy   that followed. Although   these individuals-members of the
 Mkhedrioni, Gamsakhurdia supporters, and MSS personnel-may have had political
 objectives, they committed criminal acts and were tried and sentenced on criminal
 grounds. However, according    to some local observers, there are several
 Gamsakhurdia supporters who never took up arms and should be considered politi-
 cal prisoners. One of those individuals, Nugzar Molodinashvili, was pardoned and
 released from prison in September. However, several other individuals, including
 Valter Shurgaia, Zviad Dzidziguri, and Zaur Kobalia, are still in prison. These indi-
 viduals-political leaders of Gamsakhurdia's movement-were tried and convicted
 on poorly substantiated charges of treason, banditry, and illegal possession of weap-
 ons. They are serving sentences ranging from-7 to 12 years. However, in November
 President Shevardnadze pardoned Zviadist Viktor Domukhovsky, who had been held
 since 1993. There are increasing calls domestically for President Shevardnadze to
 issue a general amnesty to those convicted for their actions, including those involv-
 in violence, during the period of civil war and social chaos from 1991 to 1995.
 f Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution forbids the tapping of telephones and other forms of interference in an
 individual's private life without court approval or legal necessity. However, in prac-
 tice law enforcement agencies and other government bodies, especially the Ministry
 of Communications, monitor private telephone conversations without obtaining court
 orders. Following the February attack on President Shevardnadze, the Ministry of
 Security requested and received court permission to monitor several telephone num-
 bers. However, then Minister of Communications Pridon Injia illegally authorized
 the tapping of additional numbers at the same time. State security police and state
 tax authorities also enter homes and places of work without legal sanction. Police
 regularly stop and search vehicles without probable cause to extoit bribes. The high
 level of unregulated police- misconduct and corruption has undermined public con-
 fidence in government, especially the law enforcement agencies.
 Georgians still residing in Abkhazia are considered Abkhaz "citizens" and liable
 for military service.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 press law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press; however, although the independent press increasingly
 was active, the Government constrained some press freedoms. According to journal-
 ists, security and law enforcement authorities attempted to intimidate the press
 through public comments and private admonitions. There is no law providing public
 access to government information, and government officials are sometimes unwilling
 to answer press inquiries. Journalists lack effective legal protection, and this cir-
 cumstance hinders investigative journalism.' The Civil Code and other legislation
 make it a crime to insult the honor and dignity of an individual and place the bur-
 den of proof on the accused. Parliament is considering several draft laws on the
 media, some of which would further restrict press freedoms, and these bills include
 truth as a defense against defamation.
 Some 200 independent newspapers operate, and the press increasingly serves as
 a check on government, frequently criticizing the performance of high-level officials.
 However, no independent newspaper as yet has a large national audience, although
 several have emerged as serious and reputable sources of information. High printing
 costs and general poverty, especially in the countryside, limit the circulation of most
 newspapers to a few hundred or a few thousand. The Government finances and con-
 trols two newspapers and a radio and television network, which have a national au-
 dience and reflect official viewpoints. Most persons continue to get their news from
 television. The Government's monopoly on broadcast news was broken when
 Rustavi-2, the Tbilisi member station of the fledgling independent television net-
 work, TNG, successfully resisted government attempts for 2 years to shut it down
 and emerged this year as an important alternative to state television. Independent
 newspapers and television stations continued to be harassed by state tax authori-
 ties.
 In April two journalists from the independent newspaper Orioni reported allega-
 tions of homosexuality and sexual harassment in the armed forces that had led to
 several suicides. Government and military officials reportedly responded by threat-
 ening the reporters with arrest, demanding the names of sources, and filing a civil
 law suit that charged defamation. One of the two journalists, Amiran Meskheli, was
 
 
 1268
 
 detained for allegedly having evaded military service, subsequently was conscripted,
 and was assigned to the unit on which he had reported. Human rights monitors con-
 sidered this action a transparent attempt at intimidation and filed a lawsuit to over-
 turn his conscription. The trial has been postponed, and Meskheli is out on bail.
 In May the independent newspaper Kavkasioni published allegations of graft and
 misconduct by the Abkhaz government-in-exile, a quasi-official body that claims to
 be the genuine government of Abkhazia and to speak for refugees from Abkhazia.
 In July two members of the Abkhaz government-in-exile filed a defamation suit
 against Kavkasioni. The trial was still under way at year's end. The newspaper was
 trying to have the case dismissed.
 Academic freedom is respected widely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly without prior permission from the authorities; how-
 ever, national and local governments restrict the right in practice. A 1997 law on
 freedom of assembly requires political parties and other organizations to give prior
 notice and obtain permission from local authorities if they intend to assemble on a
 public thoroughfare. Members of the local NGO community believe that the law vio-
 ates the Constitution and are seeking to have it overturned by the Constitutional
 Court. Most permits for assembly generally are granted without arbitrary restriction
 or discrimination, although this is not the case for the Zviadists, the supporters of
 former President Gamsakhurdia. The Zviadists never have accepted any successor
 to the Gamsakhurdia government as legitimate and frequently hold demonstrations
 demanding that the present Government resign. The Government views the fre-
 quent public rallies of the Zviadists as a threat because of the publicity they gen-
 erate for themselves and against the Government. The police invariably break up
 or restrict the rallies, regardless of where they are held. For example, the dem-
 onstration on May 26, Georgian Independence Day, again was broken up forcibly
 by police and troops from the Ministry- of the Interior. Two NGO's issued official
 statements protesting the forcible break-up of the demonstrations, and other human
 rights groups protested.
 A participant in the 1997 rally, Mara Shukvan, who had been arrested for carry-
 ing a placard 'insulting" President Shevardnadze, was found guilty in late 1997, but
 her 2-year sentence was suspended. Leila Tsomaia and Tamila Nikoldaze, Zviadists
 who were arrested, tried, convicted, and incarcerated on charges of civil disorder for
 attempting to stage a rally in front of Tbilisi University in 1997, were pardoned and
 released from prison in March.
 In June an opposition political party, the Traditionalists, began gathering signa-
 tures for a petition that demanded that a referendum be held on whether President
 Shevardnadze should resign. In July the MOI and the MSS stopped the Traditional-
 ists' campaign by arresting and intimidating party members. The security services
 claimed the petition drive was a threat to national security. The Procurator General
 called for a  w that would criminalize "insults to the President," like the petition
 campaign.
 In December following a peaceful sit-down demonstration by supporters of former
 President Gamsakhurdia, the badly beaten corpse of one of the demonstrators,
 Nuzgar Levasha, Deputy Energy Minister in Gamsakhurdia's government, was
 found near the site by his friends. An investigation is underway (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice. Authorities grant permits for registration of associa-
 tions without arbitrary restriction or discrimination.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. The country has a tradition
 of religious tolerance. However, the local police and security officials at times har-
 assed foreign missionaries (see Section 5). The Georgian Orthodox Church has lob-
 bied Parliament and the Government for laws that would grant it special status and
 restrict the activities of missionaries from "nontraditional" religions. Various draft
 laws, some modeled on the Russian law on religion, have been rejected by Par-
 liament.
 The Catholic Church and the Armenian Orthodox Church have been unable to se-
 cure the return of churches closed during the Soviet period, many of which were
 later given to the Georgian Orthodox Church. A prominent Armenian church in
 Tbilisi remains closed, and both churches, as is the case with Protestant denomina-
 tions, have had difficulty obtaining permission to construct new churches, reportedly
 in part as a result of pressure from the Georgian Orthodox Church.
 Abkhaz authorities reportedly detained Maxim Harizia, a local representative of
 Jehovah's Witnesses, and five other members of Jehovah's Witnesses in April for
 violating a 1995 decree of Abkhaz president Vladislav Ardzimba that specifically
 banned Jehovah's Witnesses. They were released in early May after their counsel
 
 
 1269
 argued that their detention violated a freedom of conscience clause in the Abkhaz
 constitution. However, one member of Jehovah's Witnesses, Atgura Ashuba, subse-
 quently was rearrested, beaten, tried, and sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment for
 deserting the Abkhaz military forces.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution, the 1993 Law on Migration, and other legislation
 generally provide for these rights and, with some exceptions, the Government re-
 spects them in practice. Registration of an individual's place of residence no longer
 is required, nor are internal passports. However, old Soviet passports bearing
 "propiskas" (proof of legal residence in a particular locality) were accepted as proof
 of identity in the November local elections because passports and identity cards
 were expensive and difficult for many members of the electorate to obtain, especially
 in the poorer and more remote rural areas.
 In principle the Government respects the right of repatriation, although approxi-
 mately 275,000 Meskhetian "Turks" (primarily Muslim), who were expelled from
 southern Georgia to Central Asia by Stalin in the 1940's, still face official and public
 opposition to their return. Many of the Meskhetians later were expelled a second
 time from Central Asia at the time of the break up of the Soviet Union. They are
 currently living as stateless persons in southern Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan.
 In 1996 President Shevardnadze issued a decree authorizing the return of 1,000
 Meskhetians per year for 5 years. The decree has never been implemented and, to
 date, only a few hundred Meskhetians have returned, none as a result of the decree;
 all came as illegal immigrants. The Government had provided housing for most of
 them, but because they are to be the subject of a separate law, not yet passed, they
 were deprived early in the year of their refugee status and consequently, their hous-
 ing subsidy. Theynow live without any regularized status.
 In December 1997, Parliament passed a law titled, "Recognizing Georgian Citi-
 zens as Political Victims and Social Protection of the Repressed." The law, intended
 to help rehabilitate victims of the Soviet era, specifically excludes the Meskhetians,
 whom it identifies as the subject of a possible separate law, Observers believe that
 the Parliament will adopt such a law in 1999. In September several hundred
 Meskhetians, some with Georgian citizenship, assembled in front of Parliament to
 agitate for their return. The demonstration was broken up by the MOI, and the
 Meskhetians, some without permanent status in Georgia and some with Georgian
 citizenship, were deported to Russia. Those with Georgian citizenship were allowed
 to return after a few days; those without Georgian citizenship have not been allowed
 to return.
 The 1994 quadripartite agreement between Russia, Georgia, Abkhazia, and the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on repatriation in
 Abkhazia called for the' free, safe, and dignified return of displaced persons and ref-
 ugees to their homes. The Abkhaz separatist regime prevented virtually all official
 repatriation and unilaterally abrogated the agreement in late 1994. In negotiations
 to end the confict,'the Abkhaz separatists continue to resist the right of Georgian
 IDP's to return to their homes. Over the past 4 years, the UNHCR estimates that
 more than 53,000 of the 283,000 IDP's and refugees from Abkhazia returned sponta-
 neously, most to the southern part of the Gali district. However, in May the unsta-
 ble security situation in Gall deteriorated into open warfare between the Abkhaz mi-
 litia and Georgian partisans and MOI troops. The partisans were routed and, in the
 aftermath, almost all of the Georgian returnees fled once again as their homes were
 burned and looted by the Abkhaz. Reportedly 40,000 remain in and near Zugdidi
 on a more or less permanent basis. Only a few thousand subsequently have re-
 turned, many of them for short stays to look after their property.
 The 1992 ethnic conflict in South Ossetia also created tens of thousands of IDP's
 and refugees. Ethnic Georgians from South Ossetia fled to Georgia proper and
 Ossetians from South Ossetia and other Georgian regions largely fled to Russia. In
 1997 the UNHCR began a program to return the IDP's and refugees to their homes.
 Both sides have created obstacles that have slowed implementation. To date only
 a few thousand Ossetian refugees have been returned, all to South Ossetia from
 Russia. The South Ossetian separatists continue to obstruct the repatriation of eth-
 nic Georgians to South Ossetia. For demographic reasons, they continue to press for
 the return of all Ossetian refugees to South Ossetia rather than to their original
 homes in other Georgian regions. The Government publicly recognized the right of
 Ossetian refugees to return to their homes in Georgia in 1997, but has taken no
 action to facilitate their return. Persistent opposition, especially at the local level,
 over the return of illegally occupied homes has prevented the organized return to
 Georgia proper of any Ossetian refugees.
 There is no effective law concerning the settlement of refugees or the granting of
 political asylum, including first asylum. Parliament passed an asylum law in March,
 
 
 1270
 but it is not fully consistent with international standards as set out in the 1951
 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. According
 to the UNHCR, only one asylum case was processed in 1997 and none in 1998.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution and the 1995 election law provide citizens with the right peace-
 fully to change their government. Citizens exercised this right in elections in 1992
 and 1995. A democratically elected President and Parliament govern most of the
 country. The 223-member Parliament and President Eduard Shevardnadze were
 elected in multiparty elections in 1995. Despite some violations, international ob-
 servers judged these elections to meet international standards. There was no voting
 in these elections in the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which
 were outside of government control.
 In a parliamentary by-election in Lagodekhi, East Georgia on June 7 to replace
 a deceased Member of Parliament, there were widespread allegations of electoral
 fraud since no identification was required to vote and no record was kept of who
 had already voted. The Central Election Commission held a revote in two polling
 stations on June 21. This election was even more contentious than the first vote and
 was marred by an outbreak of fighting between members of the Citizens' Union
 Party (CUG) and the Socialist Party.
 President Shevardnadze's party won a majority of the seats in Parliament in
 1995. Only two other parties qualified for representation in Parliament. However,
 the parliamentary opposition is active and outspoken, as is the nonparliamentary
 opposition.
 The country's first local elections were held November 15. Elections originally
 were to have taken place in 1997, but were postponed while the Government and
 the opposition debated the structure of local government. The opposition criticized
 the Government and the ruling CUG for retaining the appointment of the mayors
 of the largest cities and regional chairmen. Local officials appointed by the Presi-
 dent are often not from the area they serve, thereby limiting the scope of local self-
 government. The local governments elected in November were expected to have
 more authority over how local government is run, though inadequate funding, cor-
 ruption and the absence of legislative guidelines are expected to make it difficult
 for locally elected bodies to exercise authority for tome time.
 One team of international observers evaluated the elections as "not perfect," but
 constituting a "very positive step in Georgia's nascent election reform movement."
 Other international observers indicated that the elections demonstrated a need for
 such improvements as better funding, more voter education, and an improved proc-
 ess for selecting election committee officials at all levels. A Georgian human rights
 group asserted that there were numerous violations, including incidents of missing
 ballots, missing seals, ballot-box stuffing, multiple voting, and fraudulent names on
 voter lists. In one region, elections were suspended because of suspected fraud. The
 authorities -also declined to permit displaced persons from Abkhazia and Ossetia to
 participate in the November local elections on the grounds that they were not resi-
 dent in the areas where they had taken refuge, but of Abkhazia or Ossetia, where
 elections could not be held.
 The division of power between the central Government and local governments re-
 mains a key issue in the country's transition to democracy. The largely autonomous
 region of Ajara was at the center of this debate during the year. Ajara's
 postindependence relationship to the rest of the country still is undefined and, in
 matters such as elections, Ajara's authorities claim that regional laws take prece-
 dence over national laws. Revival, the dominant political party in Ajara, led by
 Aslan Abashidze, the president of the Autonomous Ajaran Republic, boycotted the
 national Parliament for much of the year in a dispute with the CUG over the degree
 of autonomy in Ajara. The Government has been reluctant to challenge illegal and
 undemocratic activity by the Ajaran authorities, purportedly because it seeks to
 avoid open separatism in this ethnic Georgian, but historically Muslim, region.
 Ajara held regional elections in 1996, for which it denied monitoring requests from
 international as well as Georgian organizations. In addition the most serious viola-
 tions noted during the 1995 elections occurred in Ajara. The Ajaran government,
 along with much of the opposition, alleges fraud in the 1995 national elections. It
 also criticized as undemocratic the Government's refusal to allow directly elected
 local officials and announced that officials in Ajara would be elected directly. In the
 November local elections, the mayor of Batumi was elected by a direct vote. The Re-
 vival Party won all contests. Observers reported various forms of indirect intimida-
 tion rather than outright fraud.
 
 
 1271
 Women are poorly represented in Parliament. Only 16 women were elected to the
 223-member Parliament in 1995, and only 2 women hold ministerial posts. National
 minorities are also poorly represented in Parliament. There are 4 Armenian rep-
 resentatives and 3 Azeris, representing populations which in 1995 constituted 11
 percent and 3.8 percent of the population, respectively.
 Local elections were held on March 14 in Abkhazia. Georgian authorities criticized
 them as having no legal basis since a majority of the population has been expelled.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally respects the right of local and international organiza-
 tions to monitor human rights but continues to restrict the access of local human
 rights groups to some prisoners (see Section 1.c.).
 There are an increasing number of credible local organizations that monitor
 human rights. Although there are still some local human rights groups that are ex-
 tensions of partisan political groups, these groups have little credibility or influence.
 Local human rights NGO's report that the Government has become more responsive
 to them during the year. They continue to view the Parliamentary Committee on
 Human Rights as the most objective of the Government's human rights bodies. The
 National Security Council's human rights advisor is seen as a government spokes-
 person on human rights rather than as an independent actor. The constitutionally-
 mandated Office of Public Human Rights Defender, or ombudsman, created in 1995,
 has been a disappointment to both local and international human rights groups.
 David Salaridze, the former head of the State Revenue Service, who was appointed
 to the position in November 1997, has chosen to focus his office's attention on social
 and economic issues, especially the status of the country's refugees, rather than on
 defending political and civil rights. Local human rights groups claim that the om-
 budsman's agenda is dictated to him by the executive branch. They note that the
 ombudsman has legal standing with the Constitutional Court and can bring individ-
 ual violations of human rights to the Court for consideration. However, he has cho-
 sen not to do so, and the NGO community now is seeking this status for itself in
 order to circumvent his inaction. NGO's can, and do, bring suits to courts of the first
 instance on behalf of persons whose rights have been abused.
 In 1997 the UNHCR and the OSCE mission established a joint human rights of-
 fice in Sukhumi, Abkhazia, to investigate security incidents and human rights
 abuses. The office, which has operated sporadically because of changing security
 conditions, provides periodic findings, reports, and recommendations. Its influence
 appears to be marginal.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution recognizes the equality of all citizens without regard to race, lan-
 guage, sex, religion, skin color, political views, national, ethnic, or social affiliation,
 orign, social status, land ownership, or place of residence. The Government en-
 erally respects these rights. The Constitution provides for Georgian as the state an-
 guage, but not all minorities prefer to use Georgian. As a practical matter, the ap-
 proximately 400,000 Armenians and 300,000 Azeris prefer to communicate in their
 own languages. The Abkhaz, Ossetian, and Russian communities prefer to use Rus-
 sian. Georgian and Russian both are used for interethnic communication.
 Women.-According to a poll conduted by the NGO Women for Democracy,
 younger women reported that spousal abuse occurs with some frequency and, as it
 is a social taboo to go to the police or otherwise to raise the problem outside the
 family, it is reported or punished only rarely. Spousal abuse reportedly is one of the
 leading causes for divorce. Police do not always investigate reports of rape. Women
 for Democracy, in conjunction with an international NGO OXFAM, opened a shelter
 for abused women in the spring. The Government has no support services for
 abused women. There are no laws concerning trafficking in women. Sexual harass-
 ment is reportedly a problem in the workplace and is not investigated.
 A number of women's NGO's, including the women's group of the Georgian Young
 Lawyer's Association and Women for Democracy, promote women's rights. Women
 for Democracy conducted a poll of women that found a gap between the perceptions
 of older and younger women. Older women tended to view their place in traditional
 society as an honored one, but younger women were less sanguine. They reported
 that although there were no real barriers to a professional life or to a good edu-
 cation, discrimination and harassment in the work place were problems. However,
 younger women also reported that the economic balance had shioed in their favor
 with many traditionally male jobs having disappeared as a result of the depressed
 economy. Nonetheless, women's access to the labor market is improving but remains
 
 
 1272
 primarily confined, particularly for older women, to low-paying and low-skill posi-
 tions, frequently despite high professional and academic qualifications. Equal pay
 for equal work generally is respected, but reportedly men are given preference in
 promotions.
 Children.-There is no societal pattern of abuse of children, but difficult economic
 conditions have broken up some families and increased the number of street chil-
 dren.
 Government services for children are extremely limited. The 1995 Health Reform
 Act withdrew free health care for children over the age of 1 year. While education
 is officially free, many parents are unable to afford books and school supplies, and
 most parents have to pay for-their children's education.
 The private voluntary organization, Child and Environment, noted a dramatic rise
 in homeless children following the collapse of the Soviet Union. It estimates that
 there are now more than 2,500 street children in Tbilisi due to the inability of or-
 phanages and the Government to provide support. The organization opened a shel-
 ter in 1997. The Ministry of Education opened a second shelter in July. However,
 even together, the two shelters can accommodate only a small number of the street
 children. The children increasingly survive by turning to criminal activity, narcotics,
 and prostitution. Despite the cultural tradition of protecting children, the Govern-
 ment has taken little official action to assist street children due to a lack of re-
 sources.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislated or otherwise mandated provision
 requiring accessibility for the disabled. The Law on Labor has a section that in-
 cludes the provision of special discounts and favorable social policies for those with
 disabilities, especially disabled veterans.
 Many of the state facilities for the disabled that operated in the Soviet period
 have been closed because of lack of government funding. Most disabled persons are
 supported by family members or by international humanitarian donations.
 Religious Minorities.-The Georgian Orthodox Church has argued that foreign
 Christian missionaries should confine their activities to non-Christian areas. For-
 eign missionaries continued to report some incidents of harassment in rural areas
 and small towns on the part-of Orthodox priests and their supporters, local police,
 and security officials. Jehovah's Witnesses indicate that they have experienced no
 problems in Tbilisi and only occasional problems in rural areas.
 There is no pattern of anti-Semitism. Jewish leaders attribute isolated acts of
 anti-Semitism, including the publication of anti-Semitic newspaper articles and the
 destruction of Jewish communal property, to general instability and disorder. In De-
 cember vandals toppled and shattered 60 gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in
 Tbilisi. President Shevardnadze made a public statement criticizing that act of van-
 dalism. At year's end, there were no suspects.
 The Jewish community also experienced delays in the return of property con-
 fiscated during Soviet rule. A former synagogue, rented from the Government by a
 theater group, was ordered by the courts to be returned to the Jewish community
 in 1997. The theater group refused to comply and started a publicity campaign with
 anti-Semitic overtones to justify its continued occupation of the building. In Decem-
 ber 1997, President Shevardnadze promised Jewish leaders that the synagogue
 would be returned before the 2,600-year celebration. However, the President's order
 was not enforced, and the building remains in the hands of the theater group.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government generally respects the
 rights of members of ethnic minorities in nonconflict areas but limits self-govern-
 ment in the ethnic Armenian and Azeri enclaves (see Section 3). The Government
 reportedly provides less funding for schools in these areas than in other parts of the
 country but allows instruction in non-Georgian languages. Violence in Abkhazia and
 South Ossetia reflects historic ethnic tensions and the legacy of Soviet policy, which
 was designed to pit ethnic minorities against one another.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1997 Law on Trade Unions
 provide for the right of citizens to form and join unions. The Law on Collective
 Agreements was passed in 1997.
 The principal trade union is the Amalgamated Trade Unions of Georgia (ATUG).
 The ATUG is the successor to the -official union that existed during the Soviet pe-
 riod. The union broke from the central Soviet labor union in 1989. Its present struc-
 ture was established in 1992, after the union had resisted efforts first by the
 Gamsakhurdia government and later by the State Council to bring the union under
 government control. The ATUG consists of 33 sectoral unions. Representatives to
 the ATUG congress elected its leadership indirectly for a period of 5 years in 1995.
 The organization officially claims 850,000 members but acknowledges that the num-
 
 
 1273
 ber of active, dues-paying members is considerably lower. The union has no affili-
 ation with the Government and receives no government funding. The union sees its
 primary role as defending the economic and social interests of workers, a departure
 from its Soviet predecessor, which was essentially an administrative body concerned
 with property and finance rather than with worker rights. The ATUG supported
 public sector strikes by teachers, medical service employees, and energy sector work-
 ers. In each case, the issue was unpaid wages. There was no retaliation against
 workers who participated in strikes. The ATUG also is suing the Interior Ministry
 for illegally firing 220 employees in the MOI's visa office.
 There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in inter-
 national organizations. The ATUG works closely with the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Law on Trade Unions allow workers to organize and bargain collectively, and this
 right is respected. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members. Employers may be prosecuted for antiunion discrimination and be
 made to reinstate employees and pay back wages. The Ministry of Labor inves-
 tigates complaints but is not staffed to conduct effective investigations.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and provides for sanctions against violators. The Government
 prohibits forced or bonded labor by Children and there were no reports of its use.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Ernployment.-According
 to current legislation, the minimum age for employment of children is 16 years;
 however, in exceptional cases, the minimum age can be 14 years. The Ministry of
 Labor enforces these laws, and they generally are respected. The Government pro-
 hibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this prohibition effectively
 (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The nationally mandated minimum wage was
 abolished in 1995 and replaced by a wage scale that sets salaries for various grades
 in the public sector, the lowest of which, according to exchange rate fluctuations,
 was $10.40 to $7.80 (13 lan) per month. There is no state-mandated minimum wage
 for private sector workers; such wages can be as low as $7.20 to $5.40 (9 lari). Sala-
 ries and pensions are usually insufficient to meet basic minimum needs for a worker
 and family. The ATUJG has called for a rise in the lowest wage scale to $13.60 to
 $18.36 (17 lari).
 The law provides for a 41-hour workweek and for a 24-hour rest period. The gov-
 ernment workweek often is shortened during the winter due to the continuing en-
 ergy crisis. The Labor Code permits higher wages for hazardous work and permits
 a worker in such fields to refuse duties that could endanger life.
