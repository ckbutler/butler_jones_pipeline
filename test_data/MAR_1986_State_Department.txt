 MOROCCO*
 Morocco is governed by a monarchy which has expressed its
 determination to develop and strengthen parliamentary,
 judicial, and governmental institutions. The King retains
 wide-ranging authority both as temporal Head of State and as
 spiritual leader of the country's Muslim community, which
 comprises virtually the entire Moroccan population. The King
 can intervene in any question and set policy if he so
 desires. Policy on most questions, however, is formulated by
 the Government, consistent with palace guidelines, and in many
 cases requires the formal approval of Parliament.
 The Moroccan political system is relatively open and active.
 The institution of Parliament and the periodic turnover of
 legislative power through elections are major strengths of the
 political system. Eight political parties are represented in
 Parliament, which was elected in September 1984. Within the
 parameters of public discussion established by the
 Constitution and the King, the Moroccan press offers a range
 of viewpoints on foreign policy, the economy, and social
 issues.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, operating within a
 framework of legal provisions designed to protect public
 order. All of the organizations are under the King's ultimate
 control, though many are administered on a day-to-day basis by
 the Interior Minister. In recent years, especially after the
 riots of 1981-82 and 1984, Interior and Surete Nationale
 officials have been reassigned to administrative posts outside
 the Ministry of Interior, for example to the Ministry of
 Religious Affairs.
 Private investment and private property play a large role in
 the economy, although a number of key industries are in
 government hands. Morocco is a predominantly rural country,
 with over 50 percent of the population resident outside urban
 areas. The Government continues to place high priority on job
 creation and continued development of the agricultural
 sector. However, the country's tight financial situation and
 pressures from its international creditors have forced cuts in
 many development plans.
 In 1986 there were no major outbreaks of political unrest such
 as occurred in January 1984. Two major political trials were
 held during the year. In January the courts convicted
 15 leftists of belonging to an illegal organization,
 disturbing public order, and distributing illegal tracts.
 Seven were sentenced to 4-year terms, the others to 3-year
 terms. In February 27 leftists were tried on a charge of
 undermining national unity on the Sahara conflict; all were
 found guilty and received sentences of 5-10 years.
 There are continuing questions about harsh police methods, the
 integrity of the legal process in political cases, and the
 legal status and physical condition of political prisoners in
 Moroccan jails. Although the Government asserts that all
 prisoners in Moroccan prisons are common prisoners, certain
 prisoners in categories considered to be "political" continue
 to receive separate treatment. While some receive more
 favorable treatment, there have been, as in previous years,
 *A separate section on the Western Saharan is appended to this
 report.
 
 
 1239
 MOROCCO*
 reports of cruel treatment and torture of some political
 detainees. There were numerous hunger strikes during the
 year, and families of prisoners convicted in the January 1984
 riots circulated a petition in opposition circles calling for
 specific reforms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1986 there were no known instances of political killing.
 None of the death sentences fcr Moroccans convicted of
 involvement in Islamic fundamentalist activities in 1985 or
 1984 were carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 Given the frequent Moroccan practice of holding pretrial
 prisoners for long periods without notification of families or
 attorneys, it is difficult to arrive at an exact number of
 those who may have permanently--rather than temporarily--
 disappeared. In a 1985 report, the New York-based Lawyers'
 Committee for Human Rights indicated that up to 500 persons
 may have disappeared over the last decade. Although that
 number cannot be verified, persons in several categories
 appear to have disappeared during that time. These include
 military prisoners accused of involvement in the 1971 and 1972
 coup attempts; those arrested near the war zone in the Western
 Sahara; and other political activists, including a number of
 students.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are frequent charges of prisoner abuse in Moroccan
 prisons. The local press in 1986 charged torture or
 maltreatment at numerous prisons throughout the country.
 There were also reports in the local press of increased
 attempts at suicide, in many cases as a response to poor
 prison conditions. There were also repeated hunger strikes by
 prisoners to protest poor prison conditions. In October
 prisoners protested conditions at Rabat's El Alou prison and
 the arrest and removal from the prison of an already convicted
 prisoner. The protesters, including both political and common
 prisoners, were tried on October 29 on a charge of disturbing
 the public order. There are persistent charges and reports of
 the systematic use of torture by security forces from both
 foreign groups and sources within the country. Some observers
 claim to have witnessed various forms of physical and
 psychological torture by police to extract information or to
 intimidate detainees, especially in the pretrial period.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International continued to express
 concern about the conditions of detention of approximately 100
 military prisoners arrested following the 1971 and 1972
 attempts on King Hassan's life. It said it had received
 reports that these individuals had been held in a secret
 detention center since 1973 in "filthy, windowless cells, with
 inadequate food and medical care," and that they were
 "subjected to beatings and other harsh punishments." Amnesty
 International indicated that it had received reports that
 around 20 had died because of the conditions.
 
 
 1240
 MOROCCO*
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that a detainee be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours of detention and informed of the charges
 against him. The police can request a 48-hour extension of
 that period. This practice is, however, widely abused, and
 detainees are often held for up to several weeks or longer
 before appearing before a judge. Most persons are arrested in
 public view, but police sometimes refuse to identify
 themselves, and warrants are not always used. Arrests are
 frequently made only on the basis of suspicion. Moroccan law
 requires that a lawyer be present after the initial
 presentation of the detainee before the review court, but no
 such requirement exists for the prior period of police
 custody. Morocco does not have an extensive system of bail,
 although defendants are sometimes released on their own
 recognizance. Moroccan law does not have specific provision
 for habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 Under a separate code of military justice, military personnel
 have been detained in past years without warrants or
 announcement of a trial. No such incidents were substantiated
 in 1986.
 Most prisoners are allowed family visits once a week and on
 religious holidays, and family members are permitted to bring
 food to supplement the prison diet. However, prisoners
 convicted of involvement in the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts
 continue to be held without family visitation rights or the
 right to respond to mail received. A number of Moroccan
 detainees, including many considered informally to be
 "political prisoners," are allowed to receive Moroccan
 newspapers, have access to radio and television, and pursue
 studies while in prison (though there have been complaints
 that the latter privilege was in some cases denied during
 1986).
 There have been allegations that prisoners have been held
 incommunicado for extended periods. At the same time, family
 or friends have learned, usually through their own efforts, of
 the detainees' general location.
 There were no known instances of political activists being
 exiled by the Government. However, some activists prefer to
 remain in voluntary exile, including a number of leading
 Islamic fundamentalists (of 57 fundamentalists tried in 1985,
 25 now live abroad). In at least two instances in 1981 and
 1984, leaders of the left-wing Union Nationale des Etudiants
 Morocains (UNEM) were arrested after returning to Morocco for
 a UNEM conference, but no such cases were reported in 1986.
 While prisoners are regularly used on work crews, forced labor
 is not used as a means of political coercion or other sanction.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered fair and,
 in most cases not involving challenges to royal authority or
 state policy, is independent of political control. Cases are
 brought before an initial review court, which can call for a
 hearing. The detainee is informed of charges and questioned
 by the judge to decide if they have merit. If not, or if the
 infraction is minor, the judge can release the detainee or
 impose a light sentence. If a lengthy investigation is
 required, the judge can release detainees on their own
 
 
 1241
 MOROCCO*
 recognizance. In cases involving serious crimes, courts
 generally move quickly to bring cases to trial. If convicted
 by the court of first instance, a defendant has the right to
 appeal. The 1985 Lawyers' Committee report and some lawyers
 charge that these criteria are not always met in political
 cases. They claim that trial transgressions in such cases
 include: no notification of charges, intimidation of defense
 lawyers, and ignoring defense arguments. However, capable and
 committed attorneys do accept the defense of detainees in
 political cases and provide an active defense.
 Although most cases are handled by civilian/secular courts
 based in part on French legal tradition, Morocco has a
 parallel judicial system using Islamic law principles to deal
 with marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance for
 Muslim Moroccans. Although Western legal norms are not
 applicable in the Islamic courts, Koranic principles and the
 limited kinds of cases heard reduce the possibility of abuse.
 There were no specific charges of judicial corruption in 1986,
 though general allegations of growing corruption in both the
 judicial and criminal administrative branches continued to be
 heard.
 Although the Government has stated that there are no political
 prisoners, most observers and Moroccan human rights groups
 estimate that there remain approximately 100 prisoners held
 for political activities dating as far back as the early
 1970's and sentenced to long terms up to life imprisonment.
 In addition, there are approximately 125 Moroccans convicted
 of Islamic fundamentalist activities, although some sources
 insist that the number held could be as many as several
 hundred. Human rights groups in Europe assert that nearly
 1,600 persons were tried and sentenced following the riots in
 January 1984. Many have been released after completing their
 terms, but estimates of those still in prison range in the
 hundreds. In early 1986, the Government released 15 to 20
 long-term leftist prisoners, and in December it released four
 more, including Mohamed Lamine Mechbal and three other former
 members of the left-wing Ila Al Amam. Another long-term
 prisoner and leftist intellectual, Abraham Serfaty, was
 permitted to be married in prison in December to a French
 citizen. Permission for the marriage had been held up after
 Serfaty published an article in the spring of 1985 which
 graphically described Moroccan prison conditions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the Government does not often interfere
 arbitrarily in the private lives of its citizens. The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no
 search or investigation may occur without a judicial warrant.
 This is not always observed in practice. It is widely
 accepted that the Government selectively monitors certain
 persons, including their telephones and mail. At times of
 heightened agitation in the past, the authorities are alleged
 to have searched homes and offices without warrants.
 The Government does not generally interfere with the private
 beliefs of the individual. There is no forced membership in
 political organizations. The Government is sensitive to the
 spread of fundamentalist religious beliefs and plays an active
 role in administering the nation's mosques, but there are no
 reported instances of interference with parents' teaching of
 religious beliefs to their children.
 
 
 1242
 MOROCCO*
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, including
 freedom of the press, except for criticism of the monarchy and
 Islam. King Hassan has made it clear that any challenge to
 Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara is also off-limits as a
 subject for public debate. There is lively discussion of
 almost all other issues, including criticism of the
 Government, administrative officials, and political and
 socioeconomic problems. Several dailies actively report on
 selected human rights issues.
 There is a broad measure of academic freedom. Strictures
 against scholarly investigation of the monarchy and Islam
 exist, but there is in fact growing research and publishing on
 Islam and Islamic fundamentalism.
 The Arabic language daily Al Anbaa, as well as the Moroccan
 press agency Maghreb Arab Press, are government owned. All
 other newspapers and journals are privately owned, although
 several are subsidized by the Government and reflect official
 views to varying degrees. Others are controlled by political
 parties or private groups. In 1986 the Government occasionally
 intervened to delay publication of newspapers carrying material
 which, it was feared, would inflame public opinion.  Although
 Moroccan newspapers have in the past been permanently or
 temporarily closed, no newspaper has been permanently shut
 down since 1983. In June, however, the director of the
 far-left newspaper Anoual was detained and questioned for
 2 days, while in October a reporter for the Communist Party
 newspaper Al Bayane was detained for several hours by the
 police. The French- and Arabic-language dailies of the
 Communist Party of Progress and Socialism assert that they are
 regularly subjected to prior censorship.
 Publication of Al Bayane also was halted for several days in
 October. Officials have frequently seized banned publications
 entering the country from abroad through the mail.
 Television and radio are government owned, and the views
 expressed conform with the Government's. For a short period
 in early 1986, French and Italian television broadcasts were
 blocked. This was apparently a protectionist measure, i.e.,
 an attempt to increase the audience for Moroccan television,
 rather than a purposeful restriction on the right to receive
 information. The blocking was terminated after some months,
 however, and King Hassan publicly reaffirmed the right to
 receive foreign television broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and
 association. Private associations are permitted, after
 registering with the Government, and professional, business,
 religious, and cultural associations are active. Groups seen
 as threatening the political stability of the regime, such as
 declared radical Islamic fundamentalist organizations, are
 outlawed. Permitsare required for public meetings, but if
 the requesting group is a legally registered association,
 permission is normally--though not always--granted. Following
 talks between King Hassan and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
 Peres in July, the breaking of Morocco's union with Libya in
 August, and the well-publicized arrest of four non-Moroccan
 
 
 1243
 MOROCCO*
 terrorists in August, police in several cities conducted
 numerous, often large-scale sweeps in public places. Crowds
 outside mosques and other public buildings were searched and,
 in some cases, taken to police stations for questioning. The
 local press reported a limited number of student arrests in
 September, a traditional time for campus activism, and arrests
 of some labor and political organizers. The number and
 intensity of police sweeps appeared to drop after mid-October.
 Public security measures, however, remained more than usually
 tight.
 There are three major trade union federations: the Union
 Marocaine du Travail (UMT); the Confederation Democratique du
 Travail (CDT); and the Union Generale des Travailleurs
 Marocains (UGTM). Each has a democratically elected
 leadership. The UMT is politically independent. The CDT is
 affiliated with the Socialist Party, and the UGTM with the
 nationalist Istiqlal Party. Of the total workforce of 7.5
 million, about 1 million are unionized, mainly in the
 industrial and commercial sectors. The Moroccan federations
 are members of regional labor organizations and maintain
 informal contacts with the international trade secretariats.
 The UMT, CDT, and UGTM have all participated in annual
 conferences of the International Labor Organization (ILO)..
 Morocco's Constitution and laws fully recognize the right of
 association in labor unions and provide protection to
 workers. These guarantees, including the right to be
 represented in the settlement of disputes and the right to
 protection against interference, are widely observed in the
 modern sector of the economy but are less well observed, and
 sometimes totally ignored, in the informal and underground
 economy. The right to strike is guaranteed by Article 14 of
 the Constitution, but a detailed law defining this right has
 never been drafted. Legislation governing settlement of labor
 disputes was enacted in 1946, but the mandated procedures,
 which are lengthy and complicated as well as in conflict with
 later constitutional guarantees of the right to strike, are
 customarily ignored as each dispute is handled on an ad hoc
 basis by the Government. During strikes and work protests,
 workers are sometimes arrested and prosecuted under criminal
 law statutes that outlaw picketing and damage to employers'
 property. Criminal law dating from the eve of World War II
 also outlaws strikes in sectors deemed to affect national
 security. This law is ill-defined and has been used in recent
 years to stop teachers' strikes, among others.
 There were a number of small-scale strikes during 1986 and a
 major month-long strike involving several thousand miners at
 the phosphate mine in Youssoufia. The latter was resolved in
 the owners' favor after protracted negotiations involving the
 provincial government. There were reports of police
 intimidation by the local authorities, including the arrest of
 a number of union activists. Moroccan trade unions complain
 that workers are frequently dismissed or suspended for union
 activity and that the legal system too rarely punishes
 employers for arbitrary dismissals and lockouts. The UMT has
 several complaints pending with the ILO on these and other
 alleged infractions of the ILO Conventions on Freedom of
 Association and Collective Bargaining. These cases are not
 always resolved to the unions' satisfaction, and employers
 sometimes do not heed ILO recommendations. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors investigate complaints, and employers are subject
 to fines--and in serious cases even imprisonment--for labor
 law violations.
 
 
 1244
 MOROCCO*
 The Constitution also guarantees the representation of workers
 in Parliament. There are 10 seats reserved for trade union
 organizations in the current 306-member Parliament. In the
 1984 elections, the UMT elected 5 members, the CDT 3, and the
 UGTM 2.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Muslim, and Islam is the
 official religion. The King bears the title "Commander of the
 Faithful" and is the religious as well as secular leader of
 the Moroccan population.
 The Constitution provides guarantees for freedom of worship,
 but proselytizing is forbidden. Conversion to another faith
 from Islam is not banned in the civil code but the Islamic
 faith and engrained popular attitudes strongly discourage it.
 There are two non-Islamic religions with organized communities
 in Morocco: Judaism and Christianity. There are some 10,000
 Jews, living mainly in Casablanca and several other major
 cities. The Jewish community operates schools and social
 institutions as well as a number of major synagogues.
 Publications in Hebrew are permitted, and rabbis serving the
 Jewish community are trained in Morocco. Moroccan Jews serve
 in leading positions in the business community. The President
 of the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is Jewish,
 as is one parliamentary deputy. In July 1986, King Hassan met
 publicly with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres at Ifrane,
 in northern Morocco. In September he met with a delegation of
 Jews of Moroccan origin, including a prominent Israeli
 political figure, reaffirming his openness not only to the
 Jewish community in Morocco but to those abroad as well.
 There are also institutional links between the Moroccan
 Government and the Roman Catholic Church. In a 1983 letter to
 the Pope, Hassan pledged to guarantee the Catholic Church's
 right to conduct both religious and charitable work, and that
 pledge is adhered to in practice. The letter also formally
 recognized the work of the Catholic clergy, who come
 exclusively from abroad, to minister to some 100,000 foreign
 residents with parishes in most cities. In 1985 the Pope
 visited Morocco at the invitation of King Hassan, at which
 time he met with Morocco's Islamic leaders and delivered an
 address to 80,000 Muslim youths.
 There were no incidents affecting the Protestant community in
 1986. The Moroccan Protestant community is small, numbering
 less than a hundred. There are also several thousand
 expatriate Christians.
 There were no substantiated arrests in the small Baha'i
 community in 1986, although there were reports of
 administrative harassment of community members. The Supreme
 Court appeal of the 1985 convictions of nine Baha'is is still
 pending. The nine are not in prison pending the outcome of
 the appeals, however.
 The King and other religious leaders continue to counsel
 against radical religious beliefs. Interior Ministry
 officials monitor what is taught in the mosques and report
 deviations from Orthodox Islam. There were unconfirmed
 reports of the detention of unorthodox imams following the
 King's July meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Peres, as well
 as reports of police roundups around mosques.
 
 
 1245
 MOROCCO*
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As
 the administering authority in the Western Sahara, the
 Moroccan Government restricts movement in areas of the
 territory which are militarily contested. There were no
 reported cases of restrictions on foreign travel for political
 reasons in 1986, although some persons who have been
 imprisoned for political reasons in the past have had
 difficulty obtaining a passport. For the ordinary citizen,
 obtaining a passport often takes several months, though there
 are no formal restrictions on emigration. A woman is obliged
 to have the permission of her father, or, if she is married,
 her husband, to obtain a passport. A divorced woman must
 receive her father's permission for a passport. If she has
 custody of children, she must have the father's permission for
 the children's passports.
 There are no known instances of the Government depriving any
 citizen of Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life. There were no known instances of the Government
 refusing reentry in 1986. Morocco specifically encourages
 voluntary repatriation for Jewish community members who have
 emigrated from Morocco. It also encourages the return of
 Saharans who have opposed Morocco in the Western Sahara
 conflict. Returning former Polisario members deemed to pose
 no security threat have been reintegrated into Moroccan life.
 Morocco adheres to the 1951 Convention on Refugee Status. It
 currently has some 500 refugees, mainly from African countries
 and Eastern Europe. Most of the Eastern European refugees
 came to Morocco in the 1940's and 1950's. For a grant of
 refugee status, the Government requires that the requester be
 able to care for his needs. Although there were reports,
 denied by Moroccan authorities, of Libyan expatriates being
 forced to return to their country in 1984, there were no such
 reports in 1985 or 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, executive power is vested in the King and
 exercised by a government designated by him. The King
 generally gives some consideration to the proportional
 strength of parties--as determined by elections--in naming the
 Government.
 Parliament participates in the formulation of overall policy,
 including the review of the annual budget and other major
 legislation. However, many measures of lesser importance are
 promulgated as government decrees or occasionally by royal
 proclamation. Several layers of directly or indirectly
 elected officials--including members of Parliament, provincial
 assemblies, and municipal councils--participate in formulating
 decisions.   The Government in 1986 emphasized its commitment
 to the continued decentralization of power.
 More than a dozen political parties, representing a spectrum
 of pol'itical philosophies from far left to conservative,
 competed in the municipal elections of 1983 and the 1984
 parliamentary elections. Representatives of many parties were
 elected, although some results were challenged. On April 17,
 1986, partial elections (for 5 parliamentary and 92 municipal
 
 
 1246
 MOROCCO*
 council seats) were held in a number of electoral districts.
 Some of the seats had been vacated because the original 1983
 or 1984 elections had been disallowed by court decision.
 In Parliament there is frequently lively debate on many
 subjects, and often split votes. In Parliament's 1986 autumn
 session, one party broke the precedent of electing
 parliamentary officers by consensus. While government
 proposals in Parliament are rarely rejected outright, specific
 measures are often modified. Political pressure on occasion
 has persuaded the Government to delay or withdraw legislation.
 The Government occasionally uses a direct referendum on major
 questions affecting the Constitution and the state structure.
 In 1984 the voters were asked to approve the Moroccan-Libyan
 Treaty of Oujda, and the Government announced that 97 percent
 of those casting ballots voted for the union. In 1986 King
 Hassan abrogated the Treaty without recourse to a referendum.
 Virtually all points of view are represented in Parliament.
 Ethnic and tribal distinctions remain, fostered by the
 country's mountainous terrain.
 The Constitution provides that "men and women enjoy equal
 political rights." Women occupy responsible government
 positions, including at the ministerial staff level. Women's
 role in political life remains restricted, however. No woman
 holds a seat in the 306-member Parliament, although women have
 run in parliamentary elections. Of 15,500 city council
 members in Morocco, only 17 are women. Women serve on the
 executive committees of several of the major political parties
 and on the Saharan Consultative Council, a body created in
 1981 to advise the King on Western Saharan issues.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights.
 In recent years, Morocco has not refused any formal
 international or nongovernmental investigation of human
 rights, though the Government is sensitive to such
 investigations and cooperation may be slow. In a March 1986
 interview with the Paris journal le Nouvel Observateur, King
 Hassan said he would accept a visit by Amnesty International
 representatives and committed himself to provide them with all
 facilities. He also received an appeal on a long-standing
 human rights case from the wife of French President Mitterand.
 There are two major human rights associations: the Moroccan
 Association of Human Rights (AMDH) and the Moroccan League for
 the Defense of Human Rights (LDDH). The LDDH is affiliated
 with the Istiqlal party (the major political party at the time
 of independence), while the AMDH has less clearly defined
 links with leftist political parties. Both were active
 thoughout 1986, particularly regarding prisoners on hunger
 strike and in calling for the release of political prisoners.
 Some human rights groups are occasionally subject to police
 surveillance and harassment. AMDH leaders are closely
 monitored by the Government. In past years, several AMDH
 leaders have been detained for human rights activism.
 The Government closely follows international organizations'
 interest in human rights issues involving the Western Sahara.
 One external organization, the Paris-based Association for
 Human Rights (ASDHOM), is particularly active in reporting on
 
 
 1247
 MOROCCO*
 Morocco. ASDHOM does not have active chapters in Morocco but
 regularly informs the French press of Moroccan human rights
 developments. In addition, in late 1985, the New York-based
 Lawyers' Committee on Human Rights issued a 90-page report on
 human rights in Morocco. There has been no indication that
 the Government has responded.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution reaffirms the legal equality of all
 Moroccans. In the professions, women have made great progress
 in law, medicine, and teaching. Progress in professional
 fields-has not always been matched in the society at large.
 There are areas where traditional standards prevail,
 especially in the area of private law. Divorce is permitted,
 but a husband can repudiate his wife while she cannot
 repudiate him. A man is permitted four wives according to
 Islamic tradition, although multiple marriages are
 increasingly rare. Segregation of the sexes is common,
 especially in social settings. However, in rural areas and
 among the urban poor, as well as increasingly among middle and
 upper class families, women are employed outside the home and
 contribute to family income.
 The Government actively supports labor and family planning
 projects designed to improve the condition of women and has
 organized employment programs for them. However, religious
 opposition and social resistance to such efforts remain strong.
 Some Berber spokesmen claim that Moroccan institutions do not
 reflect the Berber character of the population and that, as a
 result, for example, of a lack of Berber-language schools, the
 Berber identity is not sufficiently maintained. A popular
 intellectual monthly review, largely dedicated to questions of
 Berber identity, was suspended in 1983 and has not
 reappeared. However, Berbers continue to play a significant
 role in national and local affairs. Some state-owned radio
 stations broadcast several hours daily in the Berber language.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Morocco's basic legislation on working conditions dates from
 the 1930's and 1940's and is fairly widely respected, at least
 in the modern sector of the economy. These laws provide for a
 maximum 48-hour workweek with a full 24-hour rest day; for a
 specified annual paid holiday; and for minimum conditions for
 the protection of the safety and health of workers, including
 prohibition of night work for women and children. Children
 may not be employed or apprenticed before age 12, and there
 are special regulations governing employment of children
 between the ages of 12 and 16. However, in the traditional
 sector of the economy, children are often apprenticed earlier
 than age 12, especially in areas where school enrollment is
 not available. Safety and health conditions in many
 enterprises are substandard. Labor inspectors are charged
 with monitoring compliance with the law but cannot do so
 effectively because of inadequate resources. Minimum wage
 legislation exists and minimum wages are raised periodically
 by the Government according to a two-tier system for
 agricultural and industrial workers. The most recent raises
 were in 1985.
 
 
 1248
