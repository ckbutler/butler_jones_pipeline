 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The
 coalition Government (Socialist Party and Freedom Party)
 formed after the 1983 national election has remained in
 office, and the (right-of-center) People's Party has remained
 in opposition.
 The 1985 human rights situation in Austria was essentially
 unchanged from the conditions which prevailed in previous
 years. Human rights are respected in Austria. Individuals
 enjoy the right to associate freely, express their views
 without governmental restrictions, hold private property, and
 pursue private interests. Elections are free and regularly
 draw high levels of participation. No charges of human rights
 violations came to light during 1985.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asylum for nearly 2 million refugees from Eastern Europe.
 During periods of crisis and upheaval in Eastern Europe,
 refugee arrivals rise significantly. In 1981, for instance,
 more than 29,000 Poles used Austria as their country of first
 asylum. During "normal" years, Eastern European refugee
 arrivals average 5,000 to 6,000 (calendar year 1984 saw a
 slight rise to 6,483). Austria spent approximately $30
 million in 1984 on refugee reception, care, and maintenance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1985 of politically motivated
 killings either by Government authorities or opposition groups.
 An Arab terrorist group, however, killed four persons and
 injured many more in an attack on the Israeli airline
 passenger ticket counter in Vienna airport in December. Two
 terrorists were captured.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions by authorities in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture in Austria is banned by Article II of the European
 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
 Freedoms, which is incorporated into the Austrian
 Constitution. There is no evidence of any violation of this
 provision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. The
 law provides for investigative detention for 72 hours,,by
 which time an investigative judge-must decide on the legality
 of the detention. Provided the investigative judge agrees,
 the accused may be held in detention pending completion of an
 investigation for up to a maximum of 2 years. Grounds for
 investigative detention are enumerated in the law, as are
 conditions for release on bail. A law which went into effect
 on July 1, 1983, reforms the provisions concerning detention

 AUSTRIA
 by shortening pretrial procedures, restricting the number of
 detentions, except in the case of persons who have or are
 alleged to have committed major crimes, and providing better
 legal protection for detainees. There are no allegations that
 these provisions for investigative detention have been
 violated.
 Detention for minor infractions of administrative law may be
 imposed by the administrative authorities but is subject to
 court appeal. The Government is considering legislation
 requiring increased judicial control of such proceedings. In
 1984, a total of 1,957 persons were held for varying periods
 of time in investigative detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Austrian judiciary is independent from the executive and
 the legislative branches of government. Trials are public.
 Judges are appointed for life and cannot, in principle, be
 removed from office. Jury trials are prescribed for major
 offenses, and those convicted have the right of appeal.
 Written charges must be presented to the accused, who have the
 right of representation by a lawyer. Detention pending
 investigation is restricted to only certain cases.
 Concerned about the possibility of executive interference in
 the Austrian judicial system, critics argue that the public
 prosecutors' lack of independence from the Ministry of Justice
 opens the way for possible governmental meddling. To rectify
 this possible defect, the Government is considering
 introducing a law which would require that directives issued
 by the ministry to the public prosecutors be made public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A 1978 law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and
 telephone.
 The privacy of family life is respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent,
 and multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Austria's well-established democratic political system, its
 active and independent press, and its effective judiciary
 combine to assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 
 
 AUSTRIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955, though, makes
 an exception to this principle in the case of Nazi
 organizations and activities. The constitutional law of 1945
 also prohibits Nazi organizations. The law on the formation
 of associations stipulates that permission to form an
 association may be denied if it is apparent that the
 organization will pursue the illegal activities of a
 prohibited organization.
 Public demonstrations require a permit by the police
 authorities. In processing such applications, the police may
 consider only the public safety aspect of the proposed
 demonstration and not its political purpose. Permits are
 routinely issued.
 Trade unions have an important voice in the country's
 political life due to their role in the social partnership, an
 unofficial system by which Austria's economic policies are
 determined by labor and management representatives. Labor is
 organized in 15 national unions, each of which is a member of
 the Austrian Trade Union Federation. This organization has a
 strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual unions
 and the Federation are independent of government or political
 party control. Unions have the right to organize workers, to
 negotiate wage agreements, and to strike, although strikes in
 Austria during the postwar period have been rare. Two members
 of the present Cabinet are presidents of national unions, and
 the current president of the lower house of Parliament is also
 the president of the Federation. Nearly 60 percent of the
 work force is organized in trade unions. The Federation is a
 member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 and also provides the worker delegate for Austria's
 International Labor Organization delegation.
 By law, most employees must be members of the Chambers of
 Labor. This organization, which is unique to Austria,
 represents workers' interests vis-a-vis the Government whereas
 the unions represent the workers vis-a-vis the employers. The
 leadership of the trade unions as well as of the Chambers of
 Labor is elected through democratic balloting. A large number
 of trade associations and other professional groupings are
 further testimony to freedom of association in Austria.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, religious groups register with the Government.
 Although 85 percent of the Austrian population is Roman
 Catholic, most of the world's major religions are represented
 in Austria. Despite its dominant position in the country, the
 political influence of the Catholic Church has steadily
 diminished since 1945 and is no longer considered a major
 political force. Although anti-Semitism has practically
 disappeared from public view, several recent surveys suggest
 it is still latently present among significant numbers of
 Austrians.

 AUSTRIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel or to
 emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the right
 to return. No area of the country is closed to travel.
 Austria serves as a country of first asylum for refugees from
 Eastern Europe, and as a transit point for Soviet-Jewish
 emigrants on their way to Israel or other third countries.
 Once in Austria, refugees are not forcibly returned to their
 country. of origin. The Government has drastically limited the
 issuance of work permits to non-Austrians in an effort to
 reduce domestic unemployment. -Austria's guest worker
 population, which averaged 226,400 in 1973, stood at 146,871
 as of September 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary
 system. Under the Constitution, elections must be held at
 least every 4 years. The 1983 national elections resulted in
 a change of government in Austria. The Socialist Party lost
 its absolute majority in the Parliament and went into
 coalition with the Freedom Party. Several small parties also
 contested the elections, including the Communist Party, but
 they did not receive sufficient support to elect candidates to
 the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No charges of human rights violations were brought by
 international or nongovernmental organizations during 1984.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Representatives of
 oppressed groups frequently visit Austria and meet with
 Government officials and political leaders to explain their
 views. Because of Austria's geographic position, such
 meetings frequently focus on the human rights situation in
 Eastern Europe. Austria hosted a Council of Europe conference
 on human rights in March 1985.
 Amnesty International is the major nongovernmental human
 rights organization active in Austria. Austrians also provide
 financial support for the "Bruno Kreisky Foundation," which
 was formed in 1976 to honor distinguished human rights
 activists. Amnesty International did not mention Austria in
 its 1985 Report. Freedom House rated Austria "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Austria has a population of 7,556,000 with an annual growth
 rate of minus 0.3 percent. Per capita gross national product
 in 1984 was $8,502. Austria has a developed economy and
 enjoys a high standard of living.
 
 
 919
 AUSTRIA
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. These programs provide pensions for the retired,
 health benefits, and payments during periods of unemployment.
 Life expectancy at birth was 69 years for men and 76 for women
 in 1984. The infant mortality rate for 1984 was 11.5 per
 1,000 live births. The literacy rate is nearly 100 percent.
 There is no minimum wage in Austria, but anyone whose income
 falls below the official poverty line (approximately $3,500
 per year) is eligible to receive social welfare benefits.
 According to official statistics, 289,600 Austrians were
 living below the poverty line in 1984.
 Since 1975, the legal Austrian workweek has been established
 at 40 hours, although workers in several key branches have
 attained reductions below this level recently. The minimum
 working age in Austria is 15. The Labor Codification Law and
 the Labor Protection Law are among the more important legal
 instruments for ensuring workers' rights and decent working
 conditions. A labor inspectorate attached to the Justice
 Ministry conducts routine inspections of health and safety
 conditions at the workplace.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been
 abolished. Women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward economic
 equality in the postwar era. Nevertheless, significant
 inequality in practice still exists in political, economic,
 and social fields despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979
 to reform family law. In 1984, approximately 40 percent of
 the work force was composed of women. Men, however, earned 49
 percent more than women overall. Among men and women with
 equal training and education, men earned one-third more than
 women. Women participate fully in the electoral process and
 constitute 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. Since 1983,
 a state secretary, a woman in the Chancellor's office, has
 been responsible for women's issues within the Government.
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are respected, but the
 Slovene minority in the province of Carinthia is concerned
 about the future of Slovene-language instruction in local
 elementary schools. The Slovenes fear that changes in the
 province's bilingual education system, which some
 German-speaking groups advocate, would effectively eliminate
 Slovene from most provincial elementary schools. The three
 major political parties, however, oppose the proposed changes,
 and it appears that bilingual education in Carinthia will
 continue in its present form for the foreseeable future.
