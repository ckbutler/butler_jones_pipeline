 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia continued its transition from a unitary to a federal system of govern-
 ment. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi leads the Government of the Federal Demo-
 cratic Republic of Ethiopia, which was elected in 1995 to replace a transitional gov-
 ernment that was established following a long and brutal civil war. Most opposition
 groups boycotted the elections, and candidates affiliated with the dominantparty
 within the transitional government, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Demo-
 cratic Front (EPRDF), won a landslide victory in national and regional elections.
 The principal faction within the EPRDF remains Prime Minister Meles' Tigray Peo-
 ples' Liberation Front (TPLF). The judiciary is weak and overburdened, but contin-
 ued to show signs ofindepndence
 Federal regions, orgamzed along ethnic lines, are increasingly autonomous, hav-
 ing greater local control over fiscal and political issues. However, the relationship
 between the central Government and local officials and among the various judi-
 ciaries has not yet been finalized. A history of highly centralized authority, great
 poverty, the civil conflict, and unfamiliarity with democratic culture combine to coi-
 piaeteimplementation of federalism. The federal Government has sinificant
 protecting constitutional rights at the local level, especially when ocal au-
 thorities are unwilling or unable to do so. Local administrative, police, and judicial
 systems remain weak in many regions.
 Responsibility for internal security continued to shift from the military forces to
 the police in most regions. Throughout the year, military forces conducted low level
 
 
 111
 operations against the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) in parts of the Oromia re-
 gional state. The nilitary forces also conducted operations against the Somalia-
 based Al'ittihad terrorist organization and elements of the Ogaden National Libera-
 tion Front (ONLF). The national police organization is subor-dinate to the Ministry
 of Justice. Despite increased professional training during the year, some local of i-
 is and members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is based on smaliholder agriculture, with more than 85 percent of
 the population of 58.5 million living in rural areas under very poor conditions. Per
 capita gross national product is estimated at $135 per year.Real economic growth
 in 1997 was 6 percent. Coffee accounts for about 60 percent of export revenues. The
 Government continued to implement an internationally supported economic reform
 program designed to liberalize the economy, attract foreign investment, and bring
 state expenditures into balance with revenues.
 Despite promises by the Government to improve its human rights practices, seri-
 ous problems remain. An opposition figure suspected of terrorism was killed while
 reportedly trying to avoid arrest. Security forces sometimes beat or mistreated de-
 tainees, and arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. Prisons are seriously over-
 crowded, and prolonged pretrial detention remains a problem. The judiciary lacks
 sufficient staff and funds; consequently, most citizens are denied the full protections
 provided for in the Constitution. In response the Government sought to strengthen
 the judiciary; it trained additional civil and criminal judges and prosecutors and as-
 signed them to regional courts, while it dismissed many others in an effort to elimi-
 nate judicial malfeasance. The law regarding search warrants is widely ignored. The
 Government restricts freedom of the press and continued to detain or imprison jour-
 nalists. At year's end, 13 journalists were detained, two were imprisoned, and five
 were awaiting trial. Most were accused or convicted of inciting ethnic hatred, libel,
 or publishing false information in violation of the 1992 Press Law. Nevertheless, the
 private press is active and flourishing. Many publications are unprofessional and
 print inaccurate and untrue articles.
 The Government limits freedom of association and continued to refuse to register
 several nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), but otherwise did not prevent them
 from operating. The Government remains skeptical of NGO's, and the registration
 process is slow and tedious. However, in the latter half of the year, the pace of reg-
 istration improved considerably. Societal discrimination and violence against women
 and abuse of children remain problems; female genital mutilation is widespread de-
 spite active government support for groups opposed to the practice. Child labor is
 pervasive. Societal discrimination against disabled persons is a problem. On several
 occasions, the Government took active measures to protect religious freedom.
 The Government continued its efforts to create a national, apolitical army by re-
 placing thousands of demobilized Tigrayan soldiers with recruits from other ethnic
 groups. It expanded its training programs in military justice and undertook pro-
 grams to enhance the professional capacity and improve the performance of military
 personnel. The Government sought to enhance transparency and accountability by
 continuing to publish in state media several detailed reports on officials who were
 arrested or dismissed for abuse of authority, corruption, and violations of human
 rights. These included two EPRDF members of Parliament who were removed from
 office in July and indicted for war crimes committed during the former Menistu
 regime. The former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, indicted for
 abuse of authority and embezzlement in 1996, are now facing trial. Governmental
 transparency, however, remains limited.
 Preliminary hearings and aai    nents of the first group of defendants accused
 of war crimes under the brutal Marxist regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam
 (1974-1991), which began in December 1994, continued through the year. Many of
 the accused have been held in detention for more than 6 years without formal
 charge.
 By February the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO), which is in charge of war
 crimes investigations and indictments, had completed its lengthy investigation proc-
 ess and brought charges against 5,198 persons; however, more than half of those
 accused were not in custody and were charged in absentia.
 Radical Ahmara groups, the OLF, and the Islamic extremist group Al'Ittihad
 Al'Islamia were responsible for a number of grenade attacks, bombings, shootings,
 and ambushes that killed and injured a number of persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were unconfirmed reports of
 extrajudicial killings by government security forces; however, the very high numbers
 
 
 claimed by human rights activists and ethnically based NGO's, could not be sub-
 stantiated. Two incidents drew international attention: The death of teacher and
 OLF sympathizer Wako Tola, apparently of natural causes while in police custody;
 and the shooting death by police of Assefa Maru, assistant secretary of the Ethio-
 pian Teachers Association and an executive committee member of the Ethiopian
 Human Rights Council (EHRCO), who security officials suspected was a member of
 a terrorist organization. Police officials reported that Assefa Maru was shot while
 trying to resist arrest. The Government declined to make public the results of an
 internal investigation into Assefa's death.
 On October 8, Addis Ababa police killed three men who were allegedly involved
 in an OLF attack in July; reportedly, the victims were resisting arrest. Two other
 persons were arrested.
 Preliminary hearings and arraignments continued of persons charged with com-
 mitting genocide and war crimes during the Mengistu regime (see Sections 1.d. and
 i.e.).
 Police blamed the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) for a series of grenade attacks
 in Addis Ababa in mid-April that killed left two persons and seriously injured 75
 others. Other deadly grenade attacks, attributed to the Islamic extremist group
 Al'ittihad al'Islami and the OLF, occurred in Dire Dawa and Harar. The police
 blamed OLF members for the March 28 ambush and killing of the mayor of Dolo
 Mena, a Danish missionary nurse, and a passing motorist.
 On July 13, 150 to 200 suspected OLF militants attacked the Jeldu Wereda police
 station, killing 3 policemen and wounding 5.
 Banditry remained a serious problem in some parts of the country. Bandits, often
 heavily armed, killed civilians, police, and soldiers during robberies that they at-
 tempted. While authorities frequently ascribed political motives to bandit activity,
 most evidence suggests that their motives were primarily economic.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports, but numerous unsubstan-
 tiated reports, of alleged disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Never-
 theless, there were numerous credible reports that security officials sometimes beat
 or mistreated detainees. Government media published occasional reports of officials
 who were jailed or dismissed for abuse of' authority and violations of human rights.
 The Government provided additional police training to combat this problem.
 Prison overcrowding remains a serious problem. Prisoners are often allocated less
 than 2 square meters of sleeping space in a room that may contain up to 200 people.
 Prison food is adequate. Prisoners are typically permitted daily access to prison
 yards. Visitors are permitted, and many prisoners receive regular deliveries of food
 and other supplies from family members. Female prisoners are housed separately
 from men, and rape does not appear to be a problem.
 The International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) reported that the army
 sometimes used military camps for the temporary detention and interrogation of
 OLF fighters and alleged supporters. These camps are located near Goba in Bale
 zone, Oromiya.
 The Government permitted independent monitoring of prison conditions, military
 camps, and poice stations and som tmes by diplomatic missions during the year.
 The ICRC had routine access to prisons and civilian detention facilities throughout
 the country. ICRC visits to federal prisons are irregular, but regional authorities
 routinely permit the ICRC to visit prisons and police stations. The ICRC has only
 restricted access to military detention facilities in eastern regions, where suspected
 OLF fighters are held.
 There were several diplomatic visits to prominent prisoners accused of war crimes
 ythe SPO or charged with plotting violent insurrection against the Government.
 ey included: Abera Yemane-ab,Mamo Wolde, Dr. Alemayehu Tefera, Dr. Taye
 Wolde Semayat, Mekonnen Dori, and Professor Asrat Woldeyes. International ob-
 servers, among them a delegation ion International, were also granted
 access to prisoners. There were no reports that these prisoners had been mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and both the Criminal
 and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but the Government does
 not always respect these rights in practice.
 Under the Crisial Procedure Code, any person detained must be charged and
 informed of the charges within 48 hours and, in most cases, be offered release on
 bail. Those persons believdd to have committed serious offenses may be detained for
 15 days while police conduct an investigation, and for additional 15-day periods
 while the investigation continues. Some offenses, such as murder and treason, are
 not bailable. In practice, and especially in outlying regions, authorities often detain
 persons without a warrant, frequently do not charge them within 48 hours, and--
 
 
 113
 if persons are released on bail-never recall them to court. Nationwide, thousands
 of criminal suspects remained in detention without charge or trial at year's end.
 Most of the 7,000 detainees are suspected OLF supporters or guerrilla fighters.
 Often these lengthy detentions are due to the severe shortage and limited training
 of judges, prosecutors, and attorneys.
 In March police detained several of the organizers of an off-campus university stu-
 dent demonstration (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.). Federal and regional authorities ar-
 rested and detained hundreds of persons without charge or trial for activities alleg-
 edly in support of armed opposition groups. The vast majority of these incidents
 took place in the Oromiya and Somali regional states. In typical cases, security
 forces arrested and held these persons incommunicado for several days or weeks be-
 fore eventually releasing them. Most detainees were accused of participating in
 armed actions by the OLF or ONLF. Some 93 persons who were among a large
 group of OLF fighters detained in 1994 continued to be held.
 On November 5 authorities arrested three alleged OLF terrorists, who confessed
 to hotel and restaurant bombings in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. On November 6,
 the Federal Police arrested 17 OLF supporters, most of them members of Tulema,
 a longstanding Oromo self-help organization that the Government asserts is a politi-
 cal organization. Six were founding members of the newly registered Oromo Human
 Rights League. A total of 31 OLF activists were arraigned on various terrorism and
 illegal weapons possession charges on December 2. Although the OLF is an illegal
 organization, due to its refusal to renounce violence and accept the Constitution,
 simple membership is not necessarily cause for arrest. OLF members travel abroad
 for negotiations with the Government without hindrance. The Government draws a
 distinction, however, between the OLF's rank and file and its leadership.
 In September the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa began arraignment and
 prosecution of the 5,198 persons charged with genocide and other war crimes under
 the previous regime. Some defendants had spent 6 years in pretrial detention. Of
 that total, 2,246 are in detention, while the remaining 2,952 are charged in
 absentia. The defendants are mainly charged with genocide and war crimes, except
 for 25 who are charged with aggravated homicide. Of the 5,198 persons indicted,
 2,658 have had preliminary hearings. All defendants who are in custody are sched-
 uled to appear before courts of justice in 1998. Some defendants have  en in re-
 trial detentioni for 6 years. In July the SPO removed parliamentary immunity from
 two EPRDF Members of Parliament, arrested them, and indicted them for war
 crimes. The SP0 trials of Olympic marathon champion Mai Wolde and former
 Addis Ababa university president, Dr. Alemayehu Tefera began.
 The authorities arrested the Federal Sports Commissioner in late December be-
 cause of his affiliation with the previous regime's "reign of terror."
 Authorities arrested Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat, chairman of the Ethiopian Teach-
 ers' Association (ETA) in August 1996 upon his return from a trip abroad. Taye has
 been formally charged with forming an Amohara extremist organization that alleg-
 edy planned and carried out attacks against foreigners, including the attempted
 murder of a diplomat and a grenade attack on a diplomatic compound in Addis
 Ababa. The Government's case against Taye is not linked to his activities on behalf
 of the ETA. Charges linking Taye to the grenade attacks were dropped, but his trial
 on other charges continued
 Opposition groups allege that some of the persons detained by the SP0, as well
 as some other detainees, are held for political reasons. The Government denies that
 it holds persons for political reasons.
 Exile is ilegal and is not used.
 e. Denial ofFair Public Trial .-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Federal and regional courts continued to show signs of judicial inde-
 pendence. In practice, however, severe shortages of adequately trained personnel in
 many regions, as well as serious financial constraints, combine to keep the judiciary
 weak and overburdened and to deny most citizens the full protections provided for
 in the Constitution.
 Consistent with the Constitution, the Government continued to restructure and
 decentralizeme judiciary along federal lines with the establishment of courts at the
 district and regional levels. The federal High Court and federal Supreme Court ad-
 judicate cases involving federal law, transregional issues, and national security and
 hear both original and aptal cases. The regional judiciary is increasingly autono-
 mous; district (Woreda), High and Supreme Courts mirror the structure of the fed-
 eral judiciary. The Government delegated some of the war crimes trials to the su-
 preme courts in the regions where the crimes were allegedly committed.
 The Government continues its sweeping overhaul of the military justice system.
 Foreign assistance is being used to train officers and noncommissioned officers in
 
 
 topics including judicial and nonjudicial punishment, human rights, and the conduct
 of soldiers during military operations.
 The Government's goal is a decentralized judicial system that brings justice closer
 to the people.
 Authorities detained hundreds of persons without charge during the year, espe-
 cially in the Oromiya and Somali regions, for supposed involvement with the 012
 and ONLF. Many were ultimately released without an appearance before aJudge.
 Such cases often reflect arbitrary actions by local officials, but also result rom a
 shortage of trained and competent prosecutors and judges. In May 1996, the Gov-
 ernment appointed 56 federal court justices to help address this shortage. Regional
 offices of the federal Ministry of Justice monitor local judicial developments, but the
 federal judicial presence in the regions is limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
 some local officials interpret decentralization to mean that they are no longer ac-
 countable to any higher authority, even within their own regions.
 On November 5 authorities arrested three alleged OLF terrorists, who confessed
 to hotel and restaurant bombings in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.
 To remedy the severe lack of experienced staff in the judicial system, the Govern-
 ment continued to identify and train lower court judges and prosecutors, although
 officials acknowledge that the pay scale offered must be significantly increased to
 attract significant numbers of competent professionals. Senior government officials
 charged with judicial oversight estimate that the creation of a truly independent
 and skilled judicial apparatus requires decades. The Government has welcomed for-
 eign financial and technical assistance.
 Pending passage by regional legislatures of laws particular to their region, all
 judges are guided exclusively by the federal procedural and substantive codes. Trials
 are public, and defendants have the right to a defense attorney. The public defend-
 er's office provides legal counsel to indigent defendants, although its scope remains
 severely limited, especially with respect to SPO trials. The law does not allow the
 defense access to prosecutorial evidence before the trial.
 The Constitution provides legal standing to some preexisting religious and cus-
 tomary courts and gives federal and regional legislatures the authority to recognize.
 other courts. By law both parties to a dispute must agree before a case may be
 heard by a customary or religious court. Shari'a (Islamic) courts may hear religious
 and family cases involving Muslims. In addition some traditional courts still func-
 tion. Although not sanctioned by law, these courts resolve disputes for the majority
 of citizens who live in rural areas and who generally have little access to formal
 judicial systems.
 The SPO was established in August 1992 to create an historical record of the
 abuses during the Mengistu regime and to bring to justice those criminally respon-
 sible for human rights violations. Trials began in 1994 and continued through the
 year. The federal High Court has considered the cases of 2,658 defendants accused
 of genocide, war crimes, and aggravated homicide. Court dates are scheduled for
 1998. Court appointed attorneys represent many of the defendants, following claims
 that defendants could not afford an adequate defense. Of the 5,198 defendants, the
 Government is trying 2,952 in absentia, including Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam,
 the former dictator, who is now in exile in Zimbabwe. Senior government officials
 expressed growing frustration with the slow pace of the work of the SPO, but the
 special prosecutor and the vice president of the federal High Court announced in
 August that all the defendants would appear before court in 1998. Legal observers
 expect relatively few additional cases to be brought, with many defendants charged
 and tried collectively in each instance.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 All Amhara People's Organization (AAPO) chairman professor Asrat Woldeyes
 and four other AAPO leaders were convicted in 1994 of planning armed action
 against the Government at a 1993 meeting in Debre Berhan. Asrat was also con-
 victed of "incitement to war" in connection with a speech he made in 1992. He was
 sentenced to a total of 5 years' imprisonment. Asrat currently faces charges stem-
 ming from a May 1994 prison escape in Debre Berhan in which several guards were
 killed. Asrat is reportedly in good health.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial search warrants but, in practice, they are seldom obtained outside
 Addis Ababa.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1992 Press Law pro-
 vide for the right to free speech and press; however, the Government used legal and
 other mechanisms to restrict press nghts in practice. The Government continued to
 prosecute journalists and editors for publishing articles that violated the Press Law.
 
 
 115
 The Government uses provisions of the Press Law concerning publishing false in-
 formation or inciting ethnic hatred to arrest journalists, and some journalists prac-
 tice self-censorship. A total of 15 journalists were either detained or imprisoned, by
 the Government at year's end; 13 of them were awaiting trial. Most were accused
 or convicted of inciting ethnic hatred or publishing false information in violation of
 the Press Law. At year's end, two journalists were serving sentences of 1 year. Of
 the 13 awaiting trial, 5 were arrested for publishing reports in Urjii, a newspaper
 that is openly supportive of the OLF, which accused the police of executing three
 alleged OLF operatives in the Mekanissa area of Addis Ababa on October 8. Two
 others were unable to produce guarantors for bail. One journalist was released after
 completing a 12-month sentence; another charged withlibel was xeleased on bail in
 August.
 Despite the threat of legal action, however, the private press is very active. Many
 private  newspapers   continue   to  publish  false  information   and  harshly
 antigovernment articles without any official sanction. While the private press often
 reports that government forces or regional officials commit human rights abuses,
 most private press accounts are unsubstantiated and extremely difficult to verify.
 However, The Government has not banned any newspaper or publication.
 The Government continued to deny access by private journalists to government
 p rss onferenes, despite the fact that the Press Law requires the Government to
 be accessible to those seeking information. The Government typically ignores this
 provision and denies access to information even to government journalists. Both pri
 vate and government journalists wrote extensively about problems of access to infor-
 mation. Most, but not all, government officials refuse to speak with the private and
 official press.
 Citizens are generally free to discuss publicly any topic they choose. A number
 of groups critical of the Government held press conferences and public meetings
 without retribution.
 Only about 1 percent of citizens regularly read any newspaper or magazine, and
 citizens outside Addis Ababa have extremely limited access to the print media. As
 a result of poor management, -market forces, and government enforcement of the
 Press Law, only about 20 weekly newspapers appear regularly. Foreign journalists
 continued to operate freely and often wrote articles critical of government -policies.
 They or their local affiliates were granted greater access to government officials
 than were local journalists.
 While much of the private press continues to lack professionalism in its reporting,
 some print media are developing into more responsible publications. Others are ac-
 tually oppositionist newsletters that often purvey unsubstantiated criticism of the
 Government. Several are tied to distinct ethnic groups, especially Amhara and
 Oromo, yet severely criticize the Government for being ethnocentric and a party to
 national dissolution. Newspapers critical of government leaders and their policies
 are widely available in the capital, but scarce elsewhere.
 Radio remains the most influential medium in reachingthose who live in rural
 areas. The Press Law allows for private radio stations, hut the only nongovern-
 mental radio liense granted so far is Radio Fana, a station controlled by the ruling
 EPRDF party. The Government operates the sole television station. Ownership of
 private satellite receiving dishes, facsimile machines, and modems is permitted.
 Internet access is unrestricted, but private satellite transmission uplinks are not al-
 lowed, even for international organizations.
 The official media, including broadcast, wire service, and print media, are legally
 autonomous and responsible for their own management and partial revenue genera-
 tion, although they continue to receive government subsidies. Government reporters
 practice self-censorship but have, at times, questioned official policies. The Govern-
 ment's Press and Information Department acts as official spokesperson and imple-
 mented a 1996 information policy to guide contacts among the Government, the
 press, and the public.
 Academic freedom is respected. Students at Addis Ababa University (AAU) formed
 a student council for the first time since 1993. In general, however, political activity
 is not encouraged on university campuses. In March authorities detained a number
 of student activists for several days after they staged a demonstration outside the
 AAU campus without a permit. The students demonstrated in support of farmers
 in the Arnhara region fol owing the regional government's implementation of a new
 land poicy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally permitted groups to
 assemble during the year. Organizers of large public meetings or demonstrations
 must notify the Government in advance and obtain a permit. Permits appear to be
 routinely granted. A number of large public demonstrations protesting various gov-
 
 
 116
 ernment actions took place in Addis Ababa. However, the police stopped demonstra-
 tions held without permits. Addis Ababa shopkeepers and businessmen, protesting
 announced rent increases, went on strike May 17, only to have a number of their
 shops sealed by the police and some of their business licenses revoked. A university
 student demonstration against the Government's land reform policy resulted in the
 arrest of several organizers. On the other hand, a major All Amhara Peoples Party
 demonstration was-held on May 3 to protest the continued detention of Professor
 Asrat without incident. The Addis Ababa municipal government granted permits for
 all but one of the major demonstrations that took place in the capital.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and the right to engage in
 unrestricted peaceful political activity. Government procedures for registration of
 NGO's were changed m 1996, but a number of problems regarding NGO's remain
 unresolved. NGO representatives complain about the slowness of the registration
 process, including arrangements for work permits. Primary authority for NGO reg-
 istration rests with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) which has still not issued com-
 prehensive written procedures. Nonetheless, at mid-year the pace of registration im-
 proved. In 1995 the Government revoked the registration certificates of 47 domestic
 and international NGO's. It has refused to rant new registration to several of these
 NGO's despite their attempts to obtain it. EHRCO, which the Government asserts
 is primarily a political organization, has not been granted registration as an NGO.
 The Action Professionals' Association for the People was reregistered in November.
 The Government requires political parties to register with the National Election
 Board (NEB). Parties that do not participate in two consecutive national elections
 are subject to deregistration. There are about 60 organized political parties. Of
 these, eight are national parties and the remainder operate oniy in specific regions.
 The All Anihara People's Party (AAJPO) is a leading opposition party. Although the
 AAPO is registered with the NEB, its activists often complain that the Government
 limits their ability to campaign for popular support. In July 1996 the NEB granted
 registration to the Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethio-
 pia (CAFPDE) as a national party. The CAFPDE has established branch offices in
 several regions and launched its own newspaper, Amaratch, which is highly critical
 of government policies. The NEB also registered the opposition Oromo National
 Conress as a political party in 1996.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the right of conversion, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Pentecostals complain that police do not prtect them adequately during instances
 of conflict with orthodox Christians (see Section 5). In interreligious disputes, the
 Government tries to be an impartial arbitrator.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, including the right
 of domestic and foreign travel, emigration, and repatriatin. Citizens can and do
 freely change their residence or workplace. Citizens and residents are required to
 obtain an exit visa before departing the country. Exit visas are issued routinely, ex-
 cept to persons with pending court cases or unpaid debts.
 Ethiopian Jews (Falashas and Beta Israel) who wish to emigrate to Israel may
 do so if qualified under Israeli law. The status of several thousand Feles Mora (Ethi-
 opians who claim forced conversion to Christianity from Judaism during the past
 100 years or more) is under review by the Israei government on a case-by-case
 basis. There are 110 to 120 departures per month under prvisions of Israeli law
 pertaining to family reunification.
 According to both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and foreign
 diplomats, the Government treats asylum seekers fairly and cooperates with the
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and returning
 citizens. It provided first asylum to more than 360,000 persons in 1996, and contin-
 ues to host approximately 270,000 refugees; most are from Somalia and Sudan. The
 Government, in cooperation with the UNHCR, continues to provide first asylum to
 persons from Sudan and Somalia. Negotiations between the Government and the
 UNHCR concerning the status of 8,000 refugees from Djibouti living in Afar re-
 gional state began during the year. There were no reports of forced expulsion of in-
 dividuals having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right for the first time in the country's history in 1995.
 However, most opposition groups chose to boycott the elections, despite a wide-
 spread finding that opposition participation was possible. Boycotting parties claimed
 at The Government impededtheir ability to participate in the political process.
 Concerted efforts by foreign governments to promote dialogue and political reconcii-
 
 
 ation between the Government and several key opposition groups leading up to the
 elections were not successful. Nevertheless, observers organized by foreign donor
 governments, the Organization of African Unity, and a coalition of domestic NGO's
 judged the elections to be generally free and fair, although they cited numerous
 irreglarities. The boycott was one factor that lead to an overwhelming victory by
 candidates of the better funded and better organized EPRDF over candidates of the
 relatively weak and poorly organized opposition parties and independent candidates.
 Political participation remains closed to a number of organizations that have not
 renounced violence and do not accept the Government as a legitimate authority.
 These groups include Medhin, the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the
 Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, the OLF, some elements of the ONLF, and
 several smaller Somali groups.
 Neither law nor practice restricts the participation of women in politics. While
 women's status and political participation are greater than ever, women are mini-
 mally represented in the Council of Ministers and among the leadership of all politi-
 cal organizations. Only 1 of the 15 members of the Council of Ministers is a woman;
 2 other women hold ministerial rank; and a number of others hold senior positions.
 There are only 13 women among the 545 members of the lower House of Peoples'
 Representatives; in the upper house, the House of Federation, 7 of 108 members are
 women, including the speaker. Among the 23 judges on the federal High Court, 4
 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations include the Ethiopian Human Rights and Peace Cen-
 ter, the Ethiopian Congress for Democracy, the Ethiopian Women's Lawyers Asso-
 ciation, the Ethiopian Human Rights League, and the Inter-Africa Group. These
 groups are primarily engaged in civic and human rights education, legal assistance,
 and trial monitoring. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council, a self-proclaimed
 human rights monitoring organization, continues to operate without legal status as
 an NGO because the Government considers some of its activities as primarily politi-
 cal.
 The ICRC conducts regular visits to detention centers throughout the country.
 ICRC access during the year improved measurably with the opening of new regional
 offices in Gode, a town in the Ogaden area of Somali state, and Assosa, near the
 border with Sudan in Benishangul state.
 The Government continues to encourage international human rights groups and
 foreign diplomats to observe the war crimes trials, which began in 1994. Delegations
 from Human Rights Watch/Africa, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters
 sans Frontieres, Amnesty International, Education International, the Lawyers Com-
 mittee for Human Rights, and various international labor organizations all visited
 during the year. Representatives from these organizations held substantive discus-
 sions with a number of senior government officials, including Prime Minister Meles.
 Officials of the Federal Security Authority have generally been responsive to re-

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law. The law pro-
 vides that all persons should have equal and effective protection without discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, na-
 tional or social origin, wealth, birth or other status. The Government, however, has
 not yet put fully into place mechanisms for effective enforcement of these protec-
 tions.
 Women.-The Constitution provides for the equality of women, but these provi-
 sions are often not applied in practice. Culturally based abuses, including wife beat-
 ing and rape, are pervasive social problems. While women have recourse to the po-
 lice and the courts, societal norms and limited infrastructure inhibit many women
 from seeking legal redress, especially in remote areas. Social practices obstruct in-
 vestigations into rape and the prosecution of the rapist.
 Although women played a prominent role (including service in combat) during the
 civil war, in practice women do not enjoy equal status with men. The law considers
 men and women equal, but tradition and cultural factors place the husband as head
 of the household. All land belongs to the State. However, land reforms enacted in
 March stipulate that women may lease land from Government. Discrimination is
 most acute in rural areas, where 85 percent of the population lives. In urban areas,
 women have fewer employment opportunities than men, and the jobs available do
 not provide equal pay or equal work. Women's concerns have been factored into the
 
 
 Government's development planning since 1993. There are women's affairs desks in
 each of the ministries. To enhance further the status of women, the Government for-
 mally adopted a "National Program of Action" in June. The program seeks to ex-
 pand women s access to health care, and educate women concerning maternal
 health.
 Children.-The Government has encouraged the efforts of domestic and inter-
 national NGO's that focus on children's social, health, and legal issues. However,
 direct government support beyond efforts to provide improved health care and basic
 education remains limited.
 Societal abuse against young girls continues to be a serious problem. The great
 majority of girls undergo some forn of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health. Reports place percentages of women and girls whohave under-
 gone FGM at 90 percent. Clitorectomies are typically performed 7 days after birth,
 and the excision of the labia and infibulation, the most extreme and dangerous form
 of FGM, is performed at any time between the age of 8 and the onset of puberty.
 Excision is the most common form of FGM practiced. The law does not specifically
 probibit FGM, although it is officially discouraged, and the Government has been
 very supportive of the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia,
 which is dedicated to eradicating FGM. The Government is also working to discour-
 age the practice of FGM through education in the public schools.
 The Constitution defines the age of consent as 15 for females and 18 for males.
 Nevertheless, early childhood marriage is common in rural areas, with girls as
 young as age 9 being party to arranged marriages. Especially in the Afar region,
 young giris continue to be married to much older men, lbnt this practice is coming
 under greater scrutiny and criticism. The maternal mortality rate is extremely high,
 due in part to food taboos for pregnant women, early marriage, and birth complica-
 tions related to FGM, especially infibulation.
 Many thousands of street children live in Addis Ababa. These children beg, some-
 times aspart of a gang, or work in the informal sector in order to survive. Govern-
 ment andprivately run orphanages are unable to handle the number of street chil-
 dren, and younger children are often abused by older children. Due to financial con-
 straints, abandoned infants are often overlooked or neglected at hospitals and or-
 phanages. There are credible reports that children are occasionally maimed or blind-
 ed by their "handlers," in order to increase their earnings from begging.
 Child prostitution is a problem. There were many press reports of the large-scale
 employment of children, especially underage girls, as hotel workers, barmaids, and
 sex workers in resort towns and truckstops south of Addis Ababa. According to the
 head of the Labor and Social Affairs Ofice of East Shoa zone, children are being
 bought or stolen from the countryside by "child vendors" and sold to bar and liquor
 store owners in Shashemene and Nazareth. The going price for a child is reportedly
 about $36. More that 3,000 young girls are working as dancers, barmaids, and pros-
 titutes in the town of Shashemene. There are also credible reports that poor rural
 families sell their young teenage daughters to hotel and bar owners on the main
 truck routes. Social workers note that these girls are prized because their clients
 believe that they are free of sexually transmitted diseases. Some families send their
 unemployed, out-of-school, underage daughters to work in Middle Eastern countries
 as house servants and nannies, some of whom are kept in sexual bondage (see also
 Sections 6.c. and 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution stipulates that the state allocate re-
 sources to provide rehabilitation and assistance to the physically and mentally dis-
 abled. Limited government resources restrict action in these areas. The Amhara De-
 velopment Association operates a project to provide vocational training to disabled
 war veterans in Bahir Dar. A similar center has been established by the Tigray De-
 velopment Association in Mekele. The Government has not yet put into place mech-
 anisms to enforce a 1994 law mandating equal rights for the disabled. The Govern-
 ment does not have sufficient resources to mandate access to buildings or govern-
 ment services for persons with disabilities, and people with minor disabilities some-
 times complain of job discrimination. An official at the Government's rehabilitation
 agency estimated that, partly as a result of the long civil war, there are more than
 5 million disabled persons in the population of 58.5 million.
 Religious Minorities.-Despite the country's broad level of religious freedom and
 tolerance for established faiths, there have been instances of open conflict among
 religious groups, most noticeably between Orthodox Christians and Pentecostals. In
 most sections of the country, Orthodox Christians and Muslims participate in each
 other's religious observances, and there is a level of tolerance for intermarriage and
 conversion in certain areas, most notably in Welo. However, newer faiths encounter
 problems. Jehovah's Witnesses and Pentecostals have sometimes encountered overt,
 
 
 even violent, opposition from the public. On two occasions Orthodox Christians dis-
 rupted Pentecostal revivals in Debre Zeit and Arba Minch, apparently incited by Or-
 thodox clergy. Orthodox members inflicted injuries and destroyed property before
 police intervened to restore order. While some Pentecostals complain that the police
 o not do enough to protect them, most observers assert that the Government strict-
 ly enforces the constitutional right to freedom of religion, and that the police strive
 to maintain impartiality in all interreligious disputes. Muslims and orthodox Chris-
 tians complain about proselytization by Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses. Mus-
 lims complain that some Pentecostal preachers disparage Islam in their sermons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are more than 80 ethnic groups. Al-
 though many of these groups have influenced the political and cultural life of the
 country Amharas and Tigrayans from the northern highlands have played domi-
 nant roles. Some ethnic groups such as Oromos, the largest single group, were sub-
 jugated during the nineteenth century. In an attempt to address ethnic concerns,
 the Government has established a federal system with political boundaries drawn
 along major ethnic lines. With federalism, for example, citizens of the Oromiya re-
 gion now have a greater say over their own affairs and resources. Primary school
 students are taught in their local languages, consistent with the new Constitution.
 The military services continued their efforts to recruit ethnic minorities at all lev-
 els. All new recruits are screened as potential officer candidates, and those who
 qualify are offered officer training. The military services have integrated 7,000 sol-
 diers who served under the previous regime and have important technical skills.
 These soldiers and former militia members are often permitted to retain their pre-
 vious grade, up to the rank of colonel. Seven of the military's nine generals are non-
 Tigrayans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.--Only a small percentage of the population is in-
 volved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in urban areas. Ap-
 proximately 85 percent of the work force live in the countryside, engaged in subsist-
 ence farming.
 The Constitution and the Labor Law provide most workers with the right to form
 and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, but only about 300,000 workers
 are unionized. In general, employees of the civil and security services (where most
 wage earners are found), judges, and prosecutors are not allowed to form unions.
 Workers who provide an "essential service" also are not allowed to strike. Essential
 services include a large number of categories such as air transport, railways, bus
 service, olice and fire services, post and telecommunications, banks, and phar-
 macies. There is no requirement that unions belong to the Confederation of Ethio-
 pian Trade Unions (CETU), which was established in 1993, decertified in 1994 be-
 cause of internal management disputes, and officially reestablished and recertified
 in April. The CETU includes eight federations organized by industrial and service
 sector rather than by region. With the reemergence of the CETU, the Center for
 International Labor Solidarity, the AFL-CIO's Nairobi regional office, has reestab-
 lished a working relationship with it, including democracy and human rights edu-
 cation.
 The Labor Law stipulates that a trade organization may not act in an overtly po-
 litical manner. It explicitly gives workers the right to strike to protect their inter-
 ests, but it also sets forth restrictive procedures that apply before a legal strike may
 take place. These apply equally to an employer's right to lock out workers. Strikes
 must be supported by a majority of the workers affected. The Labor Law prohibits
 retribution against strikers. Both sides must make efforts at conciliation, provide at
 least 10 days notice to the Government, include the reasons for the action, and in
 cases already before a court or labor board, the party must provide at least a 30-
 day warning. If an agreement between unions and management cannot be reached,
 the Minister of Labor may refer the case to arbitration by a Labor Relations Board
 (LRB). The Government has established LRB's at the national level and in some re-
 gions. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs appoints each LRB chairman, and
 te four board members include two each from trade unions and employer groups.
 Some efforts to enforce these regulations are made within the formal industrial sec-
 tor.
 In a strike by shopkeepers-and businessmen in May, police closed some strikers'
 shops and revoked their business licenses.
 Independent unions and those belonging to the CETU are free to affiliate with
 and participate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law and under the Constitution, and it is practiced freely
 throughout the country. Collective bargaining agreements concluded between 1975
 
 
 and the promulgation of the 1993 Labor Law are covered under the 1975 labor code
 and remain in force. Labor experts estimate that more than 90 percent of unionized
 workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Wages are negotiated at
 the plant level. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers. There are grievance procedures for hearings on alle-
 gations of discrimination brought by individuals or unions. Employers found guilty
 of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, which was officially abolished in 1942, and involuntary servitude. There are no
 reports of slavery within Ethiopia, but there were numerous anecdotal accounts of
 young people, especially girls, being sent by their families into involuntary servitude
 in Saudi Arabia and other Arabian Peninsula states to work as house servants and
 nannies, some of whom are kept in sexual bondage. There is reportedly a network
 of sex smugglers based in the tourism and import-export sectors who are heavily
 involved in soliciting potential clients, recruiting young girls, arranging travel, and
 fabricating counterfeit work permits, travel documents, and birth certificates. More
 than 40 travel agents and import-export operators have been indicted for these il-
 licit activities (see also Sections 5 and 6.d.).
 The Criminal Code specifically prohibits forced labor, but it can be used by court
 order as a punitive measure. It does not apply to children age 15 or younger.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Labor Law, the minimum age for wage or salary employment is 14 years; children
 between the ages of 14 and 18 years are covered by special provisions. Forced or
 compulsory labor by children is illegal. However, there are reports that children are
 sent into involuntary servitude abroad, and that children are stolen from the coun-
 tryside and sold to bar and liquor store owners (see Sections 5 and 6.c.). Children
 may not work more than 7 hours per day; work between the hours of 10 p.m. and
 6 a.m.; work on public holidays or rest days; or perform overtime work. Authorities
 make some efforts to enforce these regulations within the formal industrial sector.
 Social welfare activists, civic organizers, government officials and entrepreneurs
 agree that child labor is pervasive throughout the country, especially in the informal
 sector. Large numbers of children of all- ages grow and harvest crops outside most
 government regulatory control in the countryside, or work as street peddlers in the
 cities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the private sec-
 tor. However, since 1985 a minimum wage has been set and paid to public sector
 employees, by far the largest group of wage earners. This public sector minimum
 wage is about $18 (120 birr) per month, which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. According to the Office of the Study of
 Wages and Other Remunerations, a family of five requires a monthly income of $61
 (414 birr).
 The legal workweek, as stipulated in the Labor Law, is 48 hours, consisting of
 6 days of 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest period. However, in practice, most em-
 ployees work a 40-hour workweek, consisting of 5 days of 8 hours each.
 The Government, industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. However, the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs enforces these standards ineffectively due to a lack of human and fi-
 nancial resources. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
