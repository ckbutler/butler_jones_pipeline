 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (F.R.G.) is a vigorous and
 modern parliamentary democracy. The population is well
 educated, and its highly industrialized economy provides one
 of the highest standards of living in the world. The
 Government scrupulously protects human rights. It does not
 subordinate women or any other social group.
 On the national level, power is divided among executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. There is also division of
 governmental authority between national and state
 governments. The latter retain significant autonomy,
 especially in matters relating to law enforcement and the
 courts, culture and education, the environment, and social
 assistance. The head of the Federal Government. the
 Chancellor, is elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of
 Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and of the
 Parliament, which are substantial, are set down in the Basic
 Law, the F.R.G.'s constitution, which was adopted in 1949.
 The Bundestag is elected through a mixture of direct
 constituency candidates and party lists. Members of the
 second house of Parliament, or Bundesrat, are appointed by the
 state governments.
 The Federal Republic has been ruled since its creation by
 governments headed by one of the- two major parties, the
 Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the Social Democratic
 Party (SPD), usually in coalition with a third party, the Free
 Democratic Party (FDP). The current Government, which was
 returned to office in the January 25 national elections, is
 led by a coalition of the CDU. joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free
 Democratic Party (FDP), The SPD is the leading opposition
 party. A second opposition party, the Greens, has been
 present in the Bundestag since the election of March 1983.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the police are well
 trained, disciplined, and scrupulously respectful of
 citizens' rights. In dealing with hostile elements, including
 terrorists, special care is taken to respect the rights of the
 accused.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by legal
 political organizations is unknown. Terrorist groups on the
 far left (the Red Army Faction, or RAF) and the far right
 (neo-Nazi groups) and Middle East terrorists continue to
 sanction or engage in political violence, particularly
 bombing. There were several politically motivated attacks
 resulting in deaths during 1986, including the Libyan
 terrorist bombing of the West Berlin discotheque "La Belle" on
 April 5, resulting in 3 dead and 191 injured; the RAF bombing
 attack against Siemens manager Karl Heinz Beckurts and his
 driver in Munich on July 9, killing both individuals; the car
 bomb attack against the Federal Office for the Protection of
 the Constitution in Cologne on September 8, resulting in one
 injury; and the RAF murder of senior German diplomat Gerold
 von Braunmuehl on October 10 in Bonn.

 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons. There have
 been no kidnapings by political terrorist groups for several
 years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture. Prison conditions are adequate.
 In its 1986 Report (covering 1985), Amnesty International
 expressed concern about instances in which convicted
 terrorists have been placed under special restrictions in
 prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested in the Federal Republic except on
 the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial
 authority. Any person detained by the police must be brought
 before a judge and charged no later than the end of the day
 following the day of apprehension. There is no preventive
 detention except that a prisoner may be held in custody no
 longer than 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there
 is evidence that he might seek to flee the country to avoid
 prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel has
 been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who are
 thought to have used contacts with lawyers to promote and
 continue terrorist activity even while in prison.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 over the length of pretrial detention spent in isolation by
 persons detained on suspicion of terrorism. Only judges may
 decide on the admissibility or continuation of any deprivation
 of liberty. Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is
 seldom employed. There is no exile.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 or monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after
 authorization by a court order.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law regarding an independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic
 
 
 929
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and
 press. Criticism of the government is unrestricted. The
 media and artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom
 is complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic
 books.
 Newspapers and magazines are privately owned. Radio and
 television networks and stations are government owned but
 governed by independent boards made up of representatives of
 churches, political parties, and other organizations. A few
 privately owned radio stations, experimental private
 television cable stations, and local television cable networks
 have been set up. Legislation is under consideration in some
 German states to facilitate and encourage private television
 stations using cable, satellites, and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are guaranteed by the
 Basic Law and fully respected, as is the right to
 demonstrate. Organizers of street demonstrations are required
 to obtain police permits beforehand and may be asked to pay a
 deposit to cover the repair of any damage to public
 facilities. When demonstrators have not obtained the required
 permits, police have exercised considerable restraint, showing
 concern ultimately only for the continued functioning of
 public facilities and for the safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" can be outlawed. Under
 this constitutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court in the 1950's declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely in the Federal Republic. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 34 percent of the eligible work force
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation represents over
 80 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their
 historic role as the protector of workers' rights and a
 bulwark of the democratic system. They actively participate
 in the International Labor Organization (ILO) and in
 international and European trade union organizations.
 In regard to the practice of excluding political extremists
 from employment in the civil service, there is an outstanding
 complaint lodged with the ILO by the World Federation of Trade
 Unions, claiming that the Federal Republic's practice violates
 ILO Convention 1il. An ILO-appointed Commission of Inquiry is
 conducting an investigation. A final report is expected in
 February 1987. The F.R.G. practice is based on the special
 oath of allegiance of civil servants actively to defend the
 State, its institutions, and laws and stems from a 1972 joint
 resolution by the Federal and state governments. A suit on
 this issue brought before the European Court of Human Rights
 was decided in favor of the Federal Republic in August 1986.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The full practice of religion is allowed. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system.
 The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools. Personal
 
 
 930
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 religious affiliation today plays an insignificant role in
 politics and in other walks of life. Members of all religions
 can be found in all political parties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive in
 the Federal Republic from the German Democratic Republic
 (G.D.R.) are treated as German citizens and therefore may take
 up residence without restrictions. In 1986 the number of
 G.D.R. citizens arriving in the Federal Republic was about
 25,000.
 The right of asylum is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 respected in practice. Once formally granted asylum status
 and to a lesser extent while being processed, asylees have
 essentially the same access to social welfare benefits as
 F.R.G. citizens. Short of the right to vote, they also enjoy
 complete civil rights.
 In 1979-80 and again in 1986, the number of asylum seekers has
 threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the F.R.G. to process
 and adjudicate requests. As a result of the explosion in
 numbers of applications, the Government will reportedly enact
 a number of "peripheral measures" designed to speed up
 processing of requests by those with well-founded claims and
 to make emigration to the Federal Republic less attractive for
 so-called "economic refugees", fully 80 percent of all who
 apply. Denial of political asylum does not automatically
 result in deportation. Eighty percent of those whose
 petitions are denied are typically allowed to remain in the
 country for other, humanitarian reasons. Persons from East
 European countries are normally allowed to remain whether or
 not they officially receive asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the stable and liberal parliamentary democracy
 established by the Basic Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by
 a government chosen by the people through orderly elections
 based on universal suffrage. Up to 90 percent of voters
 normally participate in national elections, although local
 contests attract significantly lower participation.
 Candidates for public office are usually members of political
 parties but are not required to be. The Basic Law and the
 state constitutions contain provisions that only parties
 achieving at least 5 percent of the vote can be represented in
 the Federal and state parliaments. New political parties are
 free to form and enter the political process, as evidenced by
 the rise of the Green Party in the early 1980's. Although
 party discipline plays an important role, voting on issues in
 the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of individual decision.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty
 International, and other human rights organizations operate
 freely. The Government considers the international promotion
 of human rights one of its highest priorities.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no discrimination in the extent to which shelter,
 health care, and education are available to all inhabitants,
 regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background,
 political opinion, or citizenship. The social welfare system
 is of long standing and provides generous benefits. The
 budgetary austerity of the past few years has resulted in some
 marginal reduction of basic social welfare benefits, which
 include old age and disability pensions, unemployment
 compensation, and medical care.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal employment in the workplace. They
 play significant roles in all political parties and are
 increasingly rising to management and leadership positions in
 the private and public sectors. In organized labor, about
 20 percent of union members are women, and a woman has served
 as president of the second largest trade union since 1982.
 Most women do not work outside the home. The rate of
 participation of women in the labor force, about 38 percent,
 is below the average in the European Economic Community, and
 most working women are employed in traditional fields.
 Moreover, protective legislation bars women from working in
 certain heavy industrial occupations and also generally bans
 night work. Young women experience difficulties in gaining
 access to training in some traditionally male fields. Recent
 court rulings and government pilot programs, however, have
 helped break down some attitudinal and institutional barriers.
 Treatment of foreigners has become a much-discussed social
 question. Around 4.4 million foreigners live in the Federal
 Republic. Of these, 1.4 million are Turkish citizens, and
 1.1 million are citizens of European Community countries.
 Over 1 million are under the age of 16 years.
 Due to increased unemployment, the Government has pursued a
 three-pronged policy with regard to foreign workers:
 integration of longtime residents, limitation of further
 entries, and repatriation aid for those willing to return to
 their home countries. A 9-month special program of
 repatriation aid to unemployed foreign workers, in the form of
 repatriation bonuses and reimbursement of social security
 contributions, stimulated the departure of about 300,000
 persons, both workers and family members. A national debate
 has been under way over whether the rights of guest workers
 should be broadened to permit unlimited residence and the
 right to vote or be reduced by limiting the right of entry for
 dependent children.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under age 15 with a few specific exceptions. Children aged 13
 and 14 may engage in farm work for up to 3 hours per day or
 may deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours per day. Children
 aged 3 through 14 may take part in cultural performances under
 stringent conditions with regard to number of hours, time of
 day, and form of activity. In the absence of minimum wage
 legislation, wages generally conform to the pattern set in
 collective bargaining. Federal legislation governs the hours
 of day young persons may work and sets occupational safety and
 health standards.
