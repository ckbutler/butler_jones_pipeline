 NIGER
 ,Niger's constitution has been suspended since the military
 'overthrew the civilian government in 1974, claiming that
 corruption was widespread and that emergency measures.were
 necessary to deal with the critical food shortages resulting
 from the Sahel drought. The freedoms of expression, assembly
 and political activity remain restricted, and the government
 -rules by decree. The authority traditionally accorded
 chiefs and the pre-independence French legal system con-
 stitute-the basis for the administration of justice in civil
 and criminal cases. However, the authorities occasionally
 .disregard judicial-procedures to treat perceived offenders
 summarily.
 In 1981, Niger's military regime continued its initiative of
 1980 to encourage greater public participation in government.
 The government commission charged with defining new political
 institutions, to be known as the national development society,
 completed the first stage of its work and its report received
 ithe approval of the. council of ministers. It proposes means
 .of.improving-communication between government and the people
 and of providing the latter with an established means of
 expressing popular will.
 Efforts to liberalize the political climate were impeded by
 the menace posed to Nigeriean stability by Libya's leader
 Colonel Qadhafi. Qadhafi has openly declared his intention
 to turn his attention to Niger in the wake of Libya's
 intervention in Chad. An active campaign of anti-government
 radio broadcasts has been directed at Niger from Libya.
 Niger's fears of subversion appear largely justified.
 The'Nigerien government has reacted with intensified security
 measures. Both Nigerians and non-Nigeriens have been
 detained for varying periods of time, sometimes without
 due process, on suspicion of complicity in subversive
 activities. This general atmosphere has resulted in some
 excess by security officials, but this has usually been
 corrected when brought to the attention of higher authority.
 President.Kountche retains the view that it is not desirable
 for Niger to return to civilian rule because in his opinion
 the past experience was disastrous. He believes the Diori
 regime's incompetence and corruption aggravated the effects
 of the Sahel drought. Kountche also has expressed the view
 that conventional western or eastern forms of civilian govern-
 ment have not worked in African settings where tribalism
 remains strong, educational standards low and escape from
 grinding poverty the focus of national energies.
 The-government has continued to accord highest priority to
 economic development, with particular emphasis on food
 self-sufficiency. Revenues from minerals exploitation and
 foreign assistance have been applied almost exclusively to
 the most pressing needs of the Nigerien people. The govern-
 ment's efforts are motivated both by a desire to improve the
 living standard of Nigerians and by a belief that the best
 defense against subversion is economic growth equitably
 distributed. Niger's economic circumstances over the past
 year have not favored economic progress. Mineral revenues

 184
 have fallen seriously due to the general decline in world
 uranium prices and less favorable rainfall resulted in food
 production significantly below the level of the past two
 years. Living standards remain among the lowest in the
 world. President Kountche has frankly and repeatedly warned
 Nigeriens of more difficult times ahead and has actively
 pursued a program of austerity to deal with the government's
 reduced resources.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Niger. However,
 no specific legal or constitutional prohibitions against the
 use of torture exist.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment in
 Niger under the current regime. Nor is there evidence of
 summary execution. Prisons are over-crowded and facilities,
 including medical facilities, are generally inadequate.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of "disappearances" in Niger.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 With the constitution suspended, there is no specific protect-
 ion against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. Instances of
 arrest and imprisonment without due process do occur. Most
 have involved members of the previous regime or of the Sawaba
 Party, which has been banned since independence, or non-
 Nigerians suspected of involvement with Libyan efforts to
 undermine Nigerien security. Former President Hamani Diori
 remains under house arrest in Niamey but is free to receive
 visitors. Some former members of his administration as well
 as opposition leader Djibo Bakary and other Sawaba members
 remain in detention. An estimated 18 Nigerien political
 prisoners were being held in Niger as of September 1981
 without charge or trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a public trial is observed for civil and
 criminal cases not involving political acts (comprising
 attempts to overthrow the state by force and/or assassinate
 its leaders, as well as participation in conspiracies with
 these objectives). Legal counsel is provided for indigent
 defendants accused of felonies or other major offenses if
 they are under 18 years of age, handicapped or faced with a
 possible sentence of 10 years or more. There is no evidence
 that courts are subject to political influence or pressure
 in ordinary criminal and civil cases. Cases involving
 political acts, such as those of the plotters executed in
 connection with a March 1976 attempted coup, are handled by
 specially designated military courts.

 f. Invasion of the Rome
 The inviolability of the home is respected but not guaranteed
 by law, given the suspension of the constitution.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is rarely
 voiced, largely because the institutions which might make
 its articulation possible do not exist, e.g., a legislature
 or private media. There are no evidentlopposition groups
 either inside or outside Niger. Some forms of voluntary
 association and expression, such as trade unions, churches,
 and other religious groups function freely, on the under-
 standing they will remain nonpolitical or support government
 policy. Although the population is over 90 percent Muslim,
 Christian churches operate and are given free access to
 Niger's radio service to broadcast weekly religious programs.
 Several Christians hold high government offices. The right
 to strike exists and is fully exercised without government
 supervision or permission. The news media are government-
 controlled. Journalists have been imprisoned briefly
 for articles mildly critical of the government. There is no
 censorship of the foreign press or books. Government
 approval is required for all research proposals by foreign
 scholars.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Niger. Nigeriens
 wishing to travel abroad or emigrate must obtain exit visas,
 which are granted routinely. During 1981 a few thousand
 refugees from the Chadian conflict entered eastern Niger.
 They were resettled, usually with family members, but were
 encouraged to remain in areas near the border in the hope
 they will return to Chad when conditions there permit.
 There are no restrictions on repatriation of Nigerian
 nationals.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is limited
 by the nature of the political system. Niger is governed by
 the supreme military council (SNC), which is composed of the
 army officers who organized the 1974 coup. most of the
 members also serve as ministers or prefets (governors) of
 Niger's seven departments. The other members of the 18-man
 cabinet are civilian technocrats, including most of those
 directly concerned with development.
 Government leaders maintain contact with the population
 through regular personal visits. The president spends
 approximately 20 percent of his time traveling around
 Niger investigating local conditions. Cabinet members,
 prefets and sous-prefets are even more peripatetic.
 Nigeriens also have an opportunity to communicate with
 government leaders through the hierarchy of traditional
 chiefs, which reaches into every village and is in regular
 contact with the administration. The Niger government
 
 
 186
 plans to establish a political structure to be known as the
 national development society. The national commission
 appointed to draft the constitution for this institution has
 a two-year mandate which expires at the end of 1981. Its
 members are drawn from all social, economic and ethnic
 groups. Subordinate commissions have been created at the
 departmental level in an effort to elicit grass roots
 opinions. In July, the report of the national commission
 was approved by the council of ministers but its contents
 have not yet been published.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 There have been no requests for outside investigations of
 human rights in Niger. Amnesty International has in the
 past stated that officials of the government have answered
 their inquiries about human rights and that these replies
 have been prompt and forthcoming. However, in its 1981
 report, Amnesty International stated that its April 1981
 appeal to the government to bring to trial or release detainees
 has gone unanswered. There are no domestic organizations
 which focus on human rights issues. Niger has not been an
 active participant in international and regional human rights
 bodies.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Economic development is the first priority of the Niger
 government. Average growth in per capita income has been
 nine percent in recent years. However, 1981 is expected to
 be a year of little or no growth. With uranium as the
 largest single source of government revenue, the precipitous
 drop in world uranium prices has had a dramatic negative
 impact on the government's ability to pursue its development
 program. Almost all uranium income and foreign assistance
 is devoted to financing projects identified in the national
 development plan. The emphasis is on projects in health,
 agriculture and rural infrastructure. Defense spending
 declined from 6.3 percent of government expenditures in 1978
 to the current level of under five percent.
 Despite these efforts, living standards in Niger remain
 very low. Annual per capita income was estimated at $270
 in 1979 (the last year for which data was available), and
 education, health care and shelter are all at low levels.
 The factors principally responsible are Niger's meager
 resource base and the critical shortage of trained person-
 nel, e.g., the adult literacy rate is less than 10 percent.
 The government is committed to the economic rights outlined
 in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but because of
 Niger's extreme poverty is not yet able to provide them to
 the Nigerien people.
 At present only 20 petcent of school age children are
 receiving some education, but this is at least twice as many
 as 10 years ago. During the 1979-1983 five-year plan,
 the ministry of education will receive 13 percent of the
 public sector spending. Niger's rural health program
 currently reaches less than a third of the population.
 The average life expectancy is 42 years, and the infant
 
 
 187
 mortality rate is 16 percent in the first year. For this
 reason, the ministry of public health budget will receive
 five percent of total public spending during the five-year
 plan. There is substantial seasonal unemployment, which is
 an inevitable consequence of limited local agricultural
 base.
 The Niger government is attempting to spread the benefits
 of development as broadly as possible. As previously
 noted, the emphasis is on investment in the rural sector,
 where most Nigeriens live. Special programs including
 livestock improvement, range management, well drilling,
 veterinary posts, special schools and mobile health teams
 have been designed to reach the country's nomadic groups.
 The public healthand veterinary programs for nomads are
 considered to be among the best in the Sahel. One of the
 regime's first steps once uranium revenues began to flow in
 was to abolish the head tax and tax on livestock, which were
 the only direct taxes paid by the country's poorest classes.
 Access to educational opportunities is by competitive
 examination. Salaries of government officials are modest.
 Instances of corruption have been rare, and when discovered,
 are followed by stiff punishment of those involved. There
 is little private ownership of land in rural areas, as
 most is held communally. However, farmers enjoy secure
 usufruct rights. Wages and working conditions in the cities
 are regulated by the government In an effort to eliminate
 exploitation. The government also attempts to control
 the prices of basic commodities to insure that they remain
 within the reach of the urban poor majority.
 Although the trend is an improving one, women do not enjoy
 equal rights or opportunities in Niger. The persistence
 of traditional attitudes gives boys a better chance than
 girls to be educated. The property rights of women are
 circumscribed, and in the event of divorce, custody of all
 but children under eight years of age is given to the hus-
 band. The government is making an effort to improve the
 social and economic position of women. Some have been
 promoted to management positions within the administration.
 The government has fostered the establishment of the Associa-
 tion of Nigerien women. The government also has established
 an Office of Women's Affairs in the ministry of youth, sports,
 and culture. In the government controlled media, issues of
 special concern to women, e.g., the practice of polygamy, are
 debated, and significant attention is given to women who have
 been successful in non-traditional careers.
