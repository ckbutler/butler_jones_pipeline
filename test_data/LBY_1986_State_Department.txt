 LIBYA*
 The disregard of human rights traditionally displayed by the
 Libyan regime of Colonel Qadhafi became even more apparent in
 1986 with the evidence of Libyan support for, or direction of,
 attacks or attempted attacks on civilian targets in Austria,
 Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Sudan, Tunisia,
 North Yemen, United Kingdom, Togo, Lebanon, Turkey, Cyprus, and
 Chad. As a result of these'terrorist activities, all members
 of the European Community and the Tokyo Economic Summit
 declared that they could not have normal relations with the
 Libyan regime and would take measures to isolate it until it
 altered its behavior.
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as "popular democracy." In theory political
 power is vested in "the masses" with the guidance of the
 People's Congress and its executive arms, the People's
 Committees; in practice the country is dominated by an erratic
 military dictator, Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi. He is aided by
 extragovernmental "Revolutionary Committees" which operate at
 his behest.
 The governing principles of the society are expressed in
 Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather than in the Constitution.
 Qadhafi has created a political system borrowing from
 pan-Islamic and pan-Arab sources and purporting to establish a
 "third way" superior to both capitalism and communism. His
 philosophy on human rights is summed up in his statement that
 "it is an honor to jail or liquidate the enemies of the
 authorities." Indeed, he has instigated the assassination of
 his enemies abroad, and he controls enemies at home in a
 variety of summary and judicial proceedings which are employed
 wherever popular resistance exists. While ethnic minorities
 are allegedly allowed full exercise of their human rights, in
 practice such groups as the Berber population are tightly and
 systematically controlled.
 Libya's security apparatus operates at multiple levels,
 involving not only Qadhafi's personal bodyguards and the
 official police and security establishment, but also the
 Revolutionary Committees and People's Committees which act
 independently of other authorities, sometimes encouraged
 directly by Qadhafi. The result is a complex of multilayered,
 tight controls over individual activities and freedoms.
 Conservative religious and social attitudes further restrict
 the freedoms and rights of such groups as women and
 professionals. Qadhafi has sought to provide greater equality
 for women in education and employment but has faced serious
 resistance from his conservative countrymen.
 Qadhafi has diverted substantial sums, generated from Libya's
 rich petroleum resources, to the acquisition of large
 quantities of weapons and to foreign military adventures,
 e.g., intervention in Uganda and two invasions leading to the
 current occupation of northern Chad. Further, the recent
 decline in oil revenues has forced retrenchment; significant
 parts of Libya's 1981-85 development plan have been dropped;
 foreign exchange controls have been tightened; and imports
 have been restricted. Qadhafi's move to expel some 70,000
 foreign workers in 1985 hit directly at key public services,
 *Since the U.S. has no official observers present in Libya and
 since Libya's media is totally controlled, this report draws
 heavily on unofficial sources.

 and he requested the population to return to the days of
 self-sufficiency and even of nomadic existence. Libya has used
 its oil income to finance internal development (new schools,
 hospitals, roads) but much has been wasted.
 Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking inside Libya
 except for minimal guarantees for minorities and women. There
 is no right of peaceful association and assembly, no freedom
 of speech, no right to express opposition to the Government in
 any form, to form trade unions, or to strike. There are no
 legal or judicial rights such as the right to be considered
 innocent until proven guilty, the right to a public or speedy
 trial, to be secure in one's home or person, or even to hold
 property.
 Libya's human rights record worsened in 1986. There were
 continued reports of torture and abuse. Although Qadhafi has
 urged a reduction in the number of offenses subject to capital
 punishment, he made it clear that such sentences would continue
 to apply to political acts against the regime, and he also
 reiterated his call for the searching out and "physical
 liquidation" of the regime's "enemies abroad." In statements
 made in the autumn of 1986, Revolutionary Committees urged,
 and carried out in some cases, the total expropriation and
 burning of the homes of "enemies of the revolution."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 It is not known how many political killings were carried out
 in 1986.
 In 1984 the Government directed resumption of assassinations
 of Libyan exiles and announced the formation of "suicide
 squads" to hunt down and kill Libyan dissidents abroad. In
 1985 Qadhafi stated that the death penalty was still
 appropriate for individuals who refused to return and "repent";
 he reiterated his call that "stray dogs" be searched out and
 killed. In addressing a school group in April 1986, Qadhafi
 reportedly asked students to "slaughter" members of the Muslim
 Brotherhood and the Islamic Liberation Party.
 b. Disappearance
 It is not known how many persons disappeared in 1986. Sixteen
 persons tried in 1980 on charges of forming a political
 organization have disappeared but are believed to be still
 under detention. In April 1985, Libyan authorities replied to
 appeals from Amnesty International about these prisoners,
 stating that the names mentioned "were unknown to the authority
 concerned." However, one of these prisoners, Redwan Bu
 Shwesha, a short story writer, was subsequently released.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International reported that in
 June 1985 two students, Abd al-Wahid al Zanqi and Rafiq
 al-Bishti, allegedly died under torture while in the custody
 of members of the Revolutionary Committees. Detainees in
 criminal and security cases reportedly are regularly beaten
 
 
 1226
 LIBYA*
 during interrogation. In some prisons, conditions reportedly
 are tolerable, but the conditions of detention for political
 prisoners have reportedly worsened, including transfer to
 overcrowded cells and confiscation of reading and writing
 materials.
 While Shari'a (Islamic) law is practiced in Libya, physical
 mutilation is not used as a form of punishment. Amnesty
 International has expressed concern about the large number of
 offenses, including political offenses, which are punishable
 by death under Libyan law. For example, membership in an
 illegal organization is a capital offense. Qadhafi explicitly
 reaffirmed application of the death penalty in 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Elements of the Revolutionary Committees and the Peoples
 Committees continue to carry out arrest and detention of
 suspected opponents of the Government, with the encouragement
 of Qadhafi. Under Libyan law, detainees may be held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to would-be
 opponents of the regime. In security cases in particular,
 there are many reports of prisoners being held without trial
 for long periods. While undergoing interrogation, sometimes
 for periods of several months, they are given no access to
 legal representation.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were then "no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Reports
 from a variety of sources, however, assert that the prisons
 contain increased numbers of persons convicted of, or held
 for, political offenses, including large numbers of persons
 arrested in 1984. Qadhafi has justified imprisonment on
 political charges. Although he has claimed to be opposed to
 arrests in secrecy, there is no evidence that his exhortation
 has resulted in any improvement in practice. Foreigners are
 not immune from arbitary arrest; clerics from Italy, Malta,
 the Philippines, and Poland, who had been arrested by Libyan
 authorities, were reportedly released in late April in an
 apparent effort to stem an exodus of security-conscious
 Westerners.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying
 abroad to return to Libya. Libya does, however, engage in the
 arbitrary expulsion of noncitizens. The International Labor
 Organization has sent a team to Libya to investigate such
 actions, and a report is pending. In general, forced labor is
 not practiced, but paid labor is mobilized for major projects
 under conditions similar to conscription.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civilians may be tried in the regular courts, in less formal
 "people's courts," or by military or revolutionary courts,
 depending on the arbitrary decision of the security forces.
 Security forces have the power to consider persons guilty
 without trial, particularly "traitors to the people." Trials
 are also held in private or in the absence of the accused.
 The traditional courts have also been bypassed to a significant
 extent by people's courts and revolutionary courts which
 sometimes conduct "show trials" on television, followed by
 public executions. These various trial systems provide few
 
 
 1227
 LIBYA*
 safeguards. Freedom House notes, howeves, that some acquittals
 have occurred in political cases.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Secretariat of Justice. The Union
 of Arab Lawyers, located in France, has expressed concern for
 the ability and freedom of attorneys simultaneously to provide
 legal defense for political prisoners and to serve as
 government employees. Libya claims that it "guarantees
 prisoners all necessary means of defense and safeguards of
 justice adequate to the principles contained in the
 Declaration of Human Rights" and provides for legal assistance
 "as soon as possible with respect to the exigencies of
 interrogation," but there are numerous reports that these
 rights are frequently denied.
 Alleged political offenses are increasingly tried before ad
 hoc "revolutionary courts" rather than under the normal
 judicial procedure, with the opportunities for defense
 severely restricted. Moreover, a number of these "trials"
 have been held in secret. There is no precise estimate of the
 number of political prisoners in Libya.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not recognize the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home is reportedly often disregarded.
 Local and international phone calls are routinely monitored.
 The informer network is very extensive, encouraged by both
 security agencies and revolutionary committees. Individual
 privacy is disregarded. Libyan exiles claim that mere family
 ties to suspected regime opponents can result in harassment or
 even persecution by the authorities. Property can be seized
 and burned if it belongs to "enemies of the people" or those
 who cooperate with foreign powers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's
 Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, in
 general freedom of speech is severely limited, particularly
 with regard to any criticism of Qadhafi or his regime. Freedom
 of speech and other basic civil and political freedoms are
 further restricted during periods of internal security crises.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is
 only one daily newspaper, which has a circulation of only
 40,000. JANA, the official news agency, is the designated
 conduit for politically acceptable opinions. It is impossible
 to publish opinions contrary to government policy. Foreign
 publications, if not banned outright, are severely censored.
 There is an underlying climate of fear and mistrust at all
 levels of society which further restricts freedom of speech.
 Book-burning has reappeared in the wake of Qadhafi's decree
 that English can no longer be taught.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the regime. Public assembly is repressed
 unless it is government controlled and supportive of regime
 positions. Organizations such as independent trade unions and
 
 
 1228
 LIBYA*
 professional associations are viewed as threats by Qadhafi,
 who has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between the
 revolution and its working forces."
 Unions are organized under government control and are
 administered through the popular committee system. There is
 no collective bargaining; there have been no reports of strikes
 (except by students) for years and presumably strikes are not
 permitted. An exiled opposition group in June 1983 appealed
 to the International Labor Organization to investigate "the
 oppressive record of the Qadhafi regime with regard to its
 treatment of workers and laborers and employees in Libya, with
 particular emphasis on violations of human rights agreements
 and conventions governing labor and labor unions." This group
 also charged that Libya has forced foreign workers and
 employees into military training with the intention of coercing
 them into military and subversive activities against their own
 countries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Some minority religions (e.g.
 Christians) still are allowed to conduct services, but Islamic
 groups differing from the state-sanctioned one are banned. In
 September the closure of all Koranic schools allegedly was
 ordered to reduce the influence'of the mosques and to integrate
 all children into the public system. In October the regime
 arrested as a threat to state security members of an "enemies
 of God" or "godless" clique. In an apparent effort to
 eliminate any alternative power bases, the regime has banned
 the once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious following.
 Restrictions were placed on the operation of the organization's
 Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was appointed for
 Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored Islamic University
 was merged with the University of Libya.
 Services are permitted in Christian churches, which are
 attended exclusively by the foreign community. There is a
 resident Catholic bishop and a small number of priests. Nuns
 reportedly are permitted to wear their habits.
 Nearly all of the formerly sizable Jewish community has
 emigrated, and no information is available on the status of any
 Jews who may remain. Qadhafi has stated that he is opposed to
 Zionism, not Judaism, and that Arab nations should welcome Arab
 Jews who wish to return to their countries of origin. But in a
 speech in June 1985 he cited the Prophet Muhammad as stating
 that Judaism and Islam cannot coexist in the land of the Arabs,
 and in September 1985 anti-Jewish broadcasts on Libyan radio
 called virulently for anti-Jewish violence in areas of Tunisia
 and Morocco within broadcast range.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, internal freedom of
 movement is monitored but not usually restricted for Libyan
 citizens. An exit permit is required for travel abroad, and
 currency controls are imposed to restrict travel. During most
 of 1986, it was extremely difficult for Libyans to travel
 abroad because of the unavailability of exit permits or of
 permission to obtain foreign exchange. Military conscription
 regulations deny the issuance of exit permits to potential
 inductees. Under Libyan Islamic law, wives may not leave the
 country without their husbands' permission; children may not
 
 
 1229
 LIBYA*
 travel without their fathers' consent. The right of return of
 Libyan nationals is fully protected and theoretically extends
 to include opponents of Qadhafi, so long as they are prepared
 to "repent." However, this "right" often appears to be more
 of an obligation or threat, with calls for students, often
 under government subsidy, and others working abroad to return
 on little or no notice and without regard to the impact on
 their studies or work.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major government decisions are controlled by Qadhafi or by
 committees acting in his name. He makes appointments of
 military officers and official functionaries down to a junior
 level. Power flows through a small circle of trusted
 associates, whose own authority is a reflection of their
 proximity to Qadhafi. Corruption in administration has
 assumed major proportions, with adverse effects on government.
 Participation in elections is mandatory, and the candidates
 are cleared by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates,
 election-brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969) government
 or people who have been attacked by the power of the
 revolution." Political parties and tribal or local groupings
 are prohibited, and involvement in such activities remains
 punishable by death. Aside from these constraints, Freedom
 House notes that local elections are relatively fair.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International (AI) noted in its 1986 Report that it
 has registered repeated protests, calls for investigations,
 and appeals for the respect of human rights with the Libyan
 authorities. Responses were received in only two cases, and
 no visits by human rights groups were reported. In March 1985,
 AI sought urgent clarification of reports that a number of
 detainees, including two prisoners of conscience originally
 sentenced to life imprisonment and four political prisoners
 allegedly detained without trial, were to be executed. The
 Foreign Liaison Office replied, expressing "deep regret" that
 AI had "fallen victim to a misleading campaign," stating that
 the reports were untrue, but failing to provide any more
 details upon Amnesty International's further inquiry.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent allegations of discrimination based on
 tribal status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. In recent
 speeches, Qadhafi has complained about the continued power of
 tribal and other antisocial groups. In past years, he sought
 unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers married only non-Berbers,
 presumably to diminish their tribal identity.
 The traditional, conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's
 Islamic society serve to restrict the rights of certain groups,
 most notably women. Within the confines of Islamic beliefs,
 Qadhafi has taken a leadership role in efforts to change the
 status of women and expand their access to educational and
 employment opportunities. Women currently receive basic
 
 
 1230
 LIBYA *
 military training and are subject to a draft. However, they
 are imprisoned for adultery. The husband's permission is
 necessary for women or children to travel abroad, and female
 circumcision is still practiced in remote areas of the south.
 Discrimination on the basis of religion also exists. The State
 is opposed to Islamic fundamentalism.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Libya maintains a work force of around I million workers in a
 population of 3.7 million. As many as 300,000 of these are
 foreign workers whose permission to stay in Libya extends only
 for the duration of the contracts under which they are
 employed. Although much of the economy is dependent upon
 expatriate skills, many foreign workers have been terminated
 in recent years, resulting in a significant decline in the
 quality of life and availability of services in Libya. No
 information is available on Libyan regulations governing
 workers' rights. In general, there is no evidence that child
 labor is a problem in Libya.
 Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures such as
 changes in work rules and contracts with little option but to
 accept or to depart the country, often without full
 compensation for work already performed. The Government
 places significant restrictions (currently 50 percent) on the
 amount of earnings that may be repatriated. Foreign worker
 contracts typically are made in the country of origin and the
 pay reflects wage levels in home countries more than the cost
 of living in Libya. Large-scale expulsions of foreign workers
 in 1985 and a continuing exodus in 1986 in effect shifted much
 of the burden of the economic downturn to the foreign workers.
