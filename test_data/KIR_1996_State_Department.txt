 KIRIBATI
 Kiribati comprises some 78,400 people occupying 33 small islands widely scattered
 across 3.5 million square kilometers of the central Pacific. The population is pri-
 marily Micronesian, with a significant component of Polynesian origin. Kiribati
 gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a republic
 within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a popularly elected president and a
 legislative assembly with 39 members elected by universal adult suffrage, and 2
 who are members by virtue of their office.
 A police force of about 250 personnel is effectively controlled by civilian authority.
 Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The is-
 lands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and limited arable land,
 severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There were no
 reports of specific human rights abuses, but in the traditional culture women occupy
 a subordinate role with limited job opportunities.
 RESP LT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kdlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are forbidden
 by the Constitution, corporal punishment is permitted under traditional mores for
 criminal acts and other transgressions. On some outer islands, the island councils
 occasionally order strokes with palm fronds to be administered for public drunken-
 ness and other minor offenses such as petty thievery.
 The authorities strive to meet minimum international standards for prisons but
 have limited financial resources. Food and sanitation are limited. Family members
 and church representatives are allowed access to prisoners. The question of monitor-
 
 
 689
 ing of prison conditions by local human rights groups has not arisen, and no policy
 concerning such monitoring has been formulated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and free of govern-
 mental interference. The right to a fair public trial is provided by law and observed
 in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person be informed of the na-
 ture of the offense for which he is charged and be provided adequate time and facili-
 ties to prepare a defense. The right to confront witnesses, present evidence, and ap-
 peal convictions is enshrined in law. Procedural safeguards are based on English
 common law.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famly', Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities respect these provisions, and viola-
 tions are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects this right in practice. The radio station
 and the only newspaper are government owned but offer a variety of views. Church-
 es publish newsletters and other periodicals. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group's interests, and the Govern-
 ment does not impose any significant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion prevails. There is no state or pre-
 ferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and
 Repatriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. There were no reports of refugees. The Government has not formulated
 a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by the people in periodic free and open elections. Exec-
 utive authority is exercised b the  rident, who is elected for a 4-year term. No
 less than three and no more than four presidential candidates are nominated by the
 elected Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the Constitution the
 President is limited to three terms.
 The snap general election of August 1994 saw the formation of Kiribati's first real
 political party, the Maneaban Te Mauri Party (MTM), as opposition forces united
 to bring down the National Progressive Party (NPP). (The NPP, the group which
 had led Kiribati since independence in 1979, has never been organized as a political
 party.) In those elections, the MTM won 19 of the 39 seats (2 more are ex officio),
 and an MTM leader, Teburoro Tito, was elected President.
 Women are underrepresented in politics and government. No women hold ministe-
 rial or permanent secretarial positions, and none hold national elective office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to date none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and the Government generally observed this prohibition in practice.
 Kiribati society fundamentally egalitarian, has no privileged chiefly class.
 Women.-Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem in this
 isolated, rural society. Rape is a crime under the law, and the law is enforced when
 charges are brought to court. To the extent that it exists, wife beating is dealt with
 informally and in a traditional way, frequently, communal pressure is brought to
 bear.
 The traditional culture in which men are dominant has been an impediment to
 women taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly changing, and more
 women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. There are also
 
 
 690
 
 signs of increased government hiring and promotions to redress this culturally
 based inequity. Women have full and equal access to education.
 Statistics on the participation of women in the work force and on comparative
 wages are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of
 property.
 Children.-Within the limited resources of the Government, adequate expendi-
 tures are made for child welfare. If child abuse exists, it is rare and has not become
 a source of societal concern.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence or complaint of discrimination in
 employment, education, or provision of other state services. Accessibility for the dis-
 abled has not been mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. Over 90 percent of the work
 force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but the small wage sector has
 a relatively strong and effective trade union movement. In 1982 the seven registered
 trade unions merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC). Ithas ap-
 proximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector. The KTUC is af-
 filiated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The law pro-
 vides for the right to strike. However, strikes are rare, the last one having taken
 place in 1980.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for under the Industrial Relations Code. The Government sets wages in the
 large public sector. However, in a few statutory bodies and government-owned com-
 panies, employees may negotiate wages and other conditions. In the private sector
 employees may also nego tia                                iations are generally
 nonconfrontational, in keeping witl Kiribati tradition. There have been no reports
 of antiunion discrimination. However, mechanisms exist for resolving any such com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of children under the age of 14. Children through the age of 15 are prohibited from
 industrial employment and employment aboardships. Labor offiers from the Min-
 istry of Commerce, Industry, and Employment normally enforce these laws effec-
 tively, given the rudimentary conditions of the economy and its industrial relations
 system. Children are rarely empoyed outside the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement longstanding legislation authorizing establishment of minimum wages.
 There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. The Government is the major em-
 ployerin the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers must, for example, provide an adequate supply of clean water for
 workers and ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers inured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified personnel. Women may not
 work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in service jobs such
 as hotel clerks).
