 BAHAMAS
 
 The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is a practicing democracy
 with a good human rights record. Its political, cultural
 and legal traditions are similar to those of Great Britain.
 The governmental structure is patterned after that of
 Great Britain, with a Prime Minister, a Cabinet, a Par-
 liament, an independent judiciary and free national and
 local elections.
 The dominant political party is the Progressive Liberal
 Party (PLP), which achieved independence for the country
 in 1973. The PLP has grown stronger ever since and now
 holds 30 of the 38 seats in Parliament. Two small oppo-
 sition parties to the right of the PLP hold the other
 eight seats. A minor party on the left has no seats.
 Although the PLP observes basic political freedoms, personal
 freedoms, property rights and due process of law, it
 does not shrink from using its authority and power of
 office to strengthen its political position.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of torture, which is legally prohibited.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is prohibited by, law. There
 are occasional reports of the use of excess force by
 Bahamian police while making arrests. The judiciary
 has taken note of this and has dismissed at least one
 case against an arrested suspect because of improper
 police procedures. There are no summary executions.
 Capital punishment is permitted; the last execution oc-
 curred in 1976. Several convicted criminals are now
 on death row awaiting completion of the appeals process.
 Prison conditions are austere. The downtown Nassau holding
 cells, where persons can be confined 48 hours or more
 awaiting preliminary hearing, are small, crowded and
 unsanitary. Access to prisoners by legitimate visitors
 is routine.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arrest and imprisonment procedures follow standard British
 legal and constitutional practices, which prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest or imprisonment. There are no political
 prisoners.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public, as provided for in the constitu-
 tion. Defendants are entitled to counsel, who enjoy
 free access. There are no military courts.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and custom
 and is respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 According to World Bank statistics, The Bahamas has a
 per capita annual income of $3,450. If foreign residents
 are excluded from the calculations, the per capita income
 is around $2,000. The economy of The Bahamas is mixed,
 with the private sector dominant. The literacy rate
 is 93 percent, and life expectancy is 66.8 years. Housing,
 health care and education standards are generally adequate,
 although improvement is needed. For example, a large
 percentage of the low income population lives in substan-
 dard housing. Free health services are limited and class-
 rooms in many government schools are over-crowded and
 poorly equipped. The Government, in outlining its social
 program for the 1980's, identified housing and education
 as requiring priority attention and improvement. The
 Government and ruling PLP stated its intention to commit
 sufficient financial resources in these areas, where
 in the past expenditures have been relatively low. There
 is no income tax, and import duties provide 60 percent
 of public revenue. Most of the rest comes from license
 fees and property taxes. The tax structure is not, there-
 fore, progressive. The Government deals promptly and
 openly with allegations of official corruption when they
 arise.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Full freedom in all of these areas exists under the protec-
 tion of the law.

 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement, travel or emigra-
 tion. With regard to illegal aliens, during 1979 the
 Government instituted an orderly, humane repatriation
 system to replace the roundups and expulsions of earlier
 years.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All sectors of society have access to the open political
 process. Political activity by members of the traditional
 white, Bahamian elite, while permitted, is not always
 welcomed by the black majority; however, this group con-
 tinues to hold high civil service and political posts,
 including elective office. Legally and in practice women
 enjoy equal status. Several elective offices, including
 the presidency of the Senate, are held by women. Key
 judicial and civil service posts are held by women.
 Women are represented in the professional and private
 sectors; the president of the Chamber of Commerce, for
 instance, is a woman. Labor unions are active and are
 completely free to organize, bargain and strike.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-govermental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 There have been no requests to investigate human rights
 conditions in The Bahamas. The Bahamas is not a member
 of the OAS and, therefore, not a party to the American
 Convention on Human Rights.
