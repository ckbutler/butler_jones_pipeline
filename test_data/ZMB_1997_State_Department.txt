 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president, a unicameral national assembly,
 and a constitutionally independent judiciary. After two decades of one-party rule,
 free and fair multiparty elections in November 1991 resulted in the victory of the
 Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and the election of President Frederick
 J.T. Chiluba, a former trade unionist. In the November 1996 elections, President
 Chiluba was reelected, and his party won 131 of 150 seats in the National Assem-
 bly. Constitutional amendments enacted in May 1996 had disqualified former Presi-
 dent Kenneth Kaunda, the main opposition leader, from seeking the presidency. The
 MDD's use of government resources, including the state-owned media, put the fair-
 ness of the elections into question, although, despite some voting irregularities,
 there was no evidence of substantial or widespread vote-rigging or vote-counting
 fraud. The Government generally respected the independence of the judiciary.
 Early in the morning of October 28, an army captain took control of the national
 radio station and announced a coup. By 10 a.m., government troops had regained
 control of the facilities, the captain and his allies were arrested, and the coup at-
 tempt was over. Several days later, the President proposed and Parliament ap-
 proved legislation establishing a 90-day State of Emergency, which was scheduled
 to end in February 1998, if not extended. The State of Emergency allowed the Gov-
 ernment to detain suspects for 28 days without charge. By year's end, the Govern-
 ment had detained 86 persons, including former President Kenneth Kaunda.
 The police, divided into regular and paramilitary units operating under the Min-
 istry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and order.
 They are highly politicized. The Zambia Intelligence Security Service, under the of-
 fice of the President, is responsible for intelligence and internal security. Police con-
 tinued to commit numerous, and at times serious, human rights abuses.
 Throughout the year, the Government continued its free market economic reform
 program, halving the inflation rate, maintaining the budget under control, and
 pressing forward with the privatization of parastatal companies. The revenue au-
 
 
 377
 thority contributed to the good budgetary results through increased collections, de-
 spite cutting tax rates at midyear. Erratic rainfall and delayed delivery of fertilizer
 contributed to a below average 1996-97 maize crop, the staple food of most citizens.
 Agreement in principle was reached with international mining companies to pri-
 vatize the major elements of the copper industry, a move to stem generally declining
 production and continued losses. Nonmetals exports continued growing strongly, in-
 creasing diversification and jobs and making up for reduced foreign exchange earn-
 ings from copper.
 The Government took steps to address some human rights problems, but serious
 abuses continued in several areas. The police committed extrajudicial killings and
 beat and otherwise abused criminal suspects and detainees. Harsh prison conditions
 deteriorated further, posing an increased threat to the health and lives of inmates.
 Arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention, and long delays in trials remain problems.
 Police infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Police authorities continued steps to ad-
 dress police brutality, including community-based policing methods, human rights
 training in the curriculum of the poalice training ollege, and human rights seminars
 for midlevel and senior officers. However, a lack of professionalism and discipline
 in the police force remains a serious problem.
 The Government persisted in attempts to limit freedom of the press and continued
 to control two of the country's three daily newspapers, contrary to its 1991 promises
 to privatize government-owned mass media. TheGovernment restricted citizens'
 right of peaceful assembly and association. Citizens' right to change their govern-
 ment also was restricted in 1996. In May the Government established the autono-
 mous Zambian Human Rights Commission (ZHRC). Despite initial doubts about its
 effectiveness, the Commission obtained access to the coup detainees and exposed the
 fact that seven of them were tortured.
 The Commission also took effective steps to press the Government to release a
 number of prisoners. Women continued to experience discrimination in both law and
 fact. Wife beating, rape, and denial of widows' inheritance rights remained wide-
 spread. Discrimination against people with disabilities is a problem. Child labor ex-
 ists in rural subsistence occupations and in some urban occupations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-There were no reports of political
 killings during the year, but police continued to use excessive force that at times
 resulted in extrajudicial killings. According to police spokesmen, one suspect died
 in jail when officers failed to provide necessary medical attention, and there may
 have been other deaths.
 In December 1995, army recruits near Kapiri Mposhi went on a rampage in retal-
 iation for the death of a comrade at the hands of local villagers. The rampaging
 army recruits destroyed an estimated 100 village houses and killed two villagers.
 After 2 years, no disciplinary action has been reported.
 There were many deaths of inmates due to harsh prison conditions (see Section
 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-Press accounts report that in May former Rwandan Legal Af-
 fairs Minister Agnes Ntangibyaliro Rutugwera, who was living in the copperbelt,
 was abducted by unknown persons believed to be Rwandan state security agents.
 Her whereabouts are unknown. Immigration authorities denied involvement.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the 1991 Constitution prohibits torture, police regularly used excessive
 force when apprehending, interrogating, and detaining criminal suspects or illegal
 aliens. In most such instances, detaining officers beat suspects. In March police at
 the Chawama station severely beat a suspect, denied him necessary medical atten-
 tion, and then released him without charges. In May police crushed the testicle of
 a detainee. No officers have been disciplined or arrested for these acts.
 The ZHRC confirmed that police tortured seven of the persons detained after the
 October coup attempt. There were reports that state agents tortured two of the
 seven in order to make them falsely implicate former President Kaunda and other
 politicians in the coup attempt. There were also no reports of any government inves-
 tigation of the torture of the coup detainees.
 On August 23, _police fired on an opposition party vehicle, slightly wounding
 former President Keneth Kaund    and seriously wounding opposition leader Dr.
 Rodger Chongwe. Calls for an independent international inquiry were dismissed.
 The police force promised to undertake its own investigation. The ZHRC was also
 investigating the Kabwe shooting. No results of the investigations have been an-
 nounced.
 
 
 378
 Throughout, the year, government officials, nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), and the press closely scrutinized police involvement in human rights
 abuses, criminal activity, and corruption. Inspector General of Police Francis
 Ndhlovu continued to exercise his mandate to reform the force. Ndhlovu has insti-
 tuted a variety of measures designed to restore discipline and professionalism, in-
 cluding police training in respect for human rights. The effectiveness of such reform
 efforts was called into question during public disturbances in Lusaka's main com-
 mercial area in August when police used excessive force to disperse street vendors
 and later attacked vendors and opposition party members on Cairo Road. Ndiovu's
 admission in open court in 1996 that he had illegally wiretapped The Post news-
 paper's telephone lines also raised questions about his commitment to protect
 human rights.
 Police corruption is also a problem. Police often detain citizens in private debt dis-
 putes in exchange for a portion of the payment owed (see Section 1.d.). Police some-
 times committed extortion at roadblocks (see Section 2.d.).
 The police undertook investigations of instances of police use of excessive force,
 disciplining officers who committed human rights abuses. Middle-ranking and senior
 police officers were enrolled in human rights training seminars at the police acad-
 emy. According to statistics provided by the police command, at least 8 police offi-
 cers were the subjects of internal investigations or prosecutions. Authorities ar-
 rested some police officers on-such criminal charges as robbery and possession of
 illegal narcotics.
 An earlier human rights commission, chaired by prominent attorney Bruce
 Munyama, aggressively examined police human rights abuses in public hearings
 held throughout 1995. In September 1995, the commission submitted its final report
 to the President, including recommendations to improve the human rights perform-
 ance of the plice. The Government released the report to the public in September
 1996.
 At year's end, the Government had not disciplined or prosecuted any of the indi-
 viduals allegedly involved in the torture of persons detained in connection with the
 1993 State of Emergency.
 Prison conditions are harsh and continued to deteriorate, posing an increased
 threat to prisoners' lives. According to official statistics, prisons designed to hold
 6,000 prisoners held over 12,000. This severe overcrowding, combined with poor
 sanitation, inadequate medical facilities, meager food supplies, and lack of potable
 water resulted in serious outbreaks of dysentery and other diseases, including tu-
 berculosis, at various prisons throughout the year. In a report submitted to Par-
 liament in 1996, the Director of Prisons said that 975 prisoners had died in prison
 between January 1991 and December 1995, due to illness and harsh conditions. The
 death rate of prison inmates remained about the same in 1997.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government permits prison visits by
 both domestic and international human rights monitors.:
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are still problems. Criminal suspects are often ar-
 rested on the basis of flimsy evidence or an uncorroborated accusation. In criminal
 cases, the law requires that a detainee be charged and brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours. Attorneys and family members are allowed access to pretrial de-
 tainees. In practice, the authorities hold most detainees for more than I month from
 commission of an offense to first appearance before a magistrate. In many cases, an
 additional period of 6 months elapses before the magistrate commits the defendant
 to the High Court for trial. Following committal, preparation of the magistrate court
 record for transmittal to the High Court takes months-in some cases as long as
 a year. Once a case reaches the High Court for trial, court proceedings last an aver-
 age of 6 months.
 Detention is often prolonged. Approximately 2,000 of the 12,000 prisoners are
 awaiting trial on criminal charges. n some cases, defendants have been awaiting
 trial for as long as 4 years. There was some progress in holding trials; in past years
 some defendants had waited as long as 10 years for their trials. These long delays
 are the result of inadequate resources, inefficiency, lack of trained personnel, and
 broad rules of procedure that give wide latitude to prosecutors and defense attor-
 neys to request adjournments. In 1996 the High Court Commissioner began releas-
 ing detainees if police failed to bring the case to trial.
 Although there is a functioning bail system, overcrowded prisons reflect the large
 number of detainees who have committed serious offenses for which bail is not
 granted. These include treason, murder, aggravated robbery, and violations of the
 narcotics laws. Also, indigent detainees rarely have the means to post bail. The gov-
 ernment legal aid office is responsible for providing legal representation for indigent
 detainees and defendants in criminal or civil cases. In practice, few receive assist-
 
 
 379
 ance. In 1997 the office had 14 attorneys to cover the entire country and a budget
 of $110,000.
 Police stations frequently become "debt collection centers," where plice officers
 acting upon unofficial complaints, detain debtors without charge indefinitely until
 they pay the complainants. In return, the police receive a percentage of payents.
 The authorities held approximately 500 foreigners, principally from neighboring
 countries. At times, these detentions last months or years (see Section 2.d.).
 The State of Emergency imposed in October allowed the Government to detain
 suspects for 28 days without charge. As of year's end, the Government had detained
 86 persons. On Christmas day, the Government detained former President Kenneth
 Kaunda on suspicion that he was involved in the coup. (Kaunda had been out of
 the country since shortly before the coup, returning to Zambia on December 21.) He
 was moved from prison to house arrest on December 31. At year's end, the Govern-
 ment held a number of political detainees, including ZDC President Dean
 Mung'omba and UNIP President Kaunda. They have not been charged but the in-
 vestigations continued. The Government must release them or present Formal crimi-
 nal charges and bring them to trial before the State of Emergency expires in Feb-
 ruary 1998 or ask Parliament for an extension of the State of Emergency.
 In 1996 the Speaker of the National Assembly ordered the indefinite incarceration
 of Post newspaper reporters Fred Mmembe, Bright Mwape, and Lucy Sichone for
 contempt of the House. The High Court later quashed the sentences, ruling that the
 Speaker had no authority over private citizens. The Government appealed the case,
 seeking to reinstate the detentions of the three reporters. The case was pending at
 year's end.
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes. However, it has used
 deportation and the threat of deportation for political purposes against persons
 whose claims to Zambian citizenship it had refused to recognize.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Government generally respected the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary during the year. In April 1996, the Government introduced
 constitutional amendments that would have virtually eliminated the independence
 of the high courts and the Supreme Court. The amendments would have granted
 the President the power to dismiss judges, subject only to concurrence by the Na-
 tional Assembly. The President alone would have been able to decide what con-
 stituted grounds for dismissal. Following strong public protest, the Government
 withdrew the amendments the following month.
 The President nominates and the National Assembly confirms the Chief Justice
 and the other eight members of the Supreme Court. The Court has appellate juris-
 diction for all legal and constitutional disputes. The High Court, which holds regular
 sessions in all nine provincial capitals, has authority to hear criminal and civil cases
 and appeals from lower courts. Magistrate courts have original jurisdiction in some
 criminal and civil cases, while local, or customary, courts handle most civil and
 petty criminal cases in rural areas.
 Local courts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely through-
 out the country. Lawyers are barred from participating, and there are few formal
 rules of procedure. Presiding judges, who are usually prominent local citizens, have
 great power to invoke customary law in rendering judgments regarding marriages,
 divorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and minor criminal matters. Judg-
 ments are often not in accordance with the Penal Code; for example, they tend to
 discriminate against women in matters of inheritance (see Section 5).
 Trials in magistrate courts are public, and defendants have the opportunity to
 confront accusers and present witnesses. Many defendants, however, are too poor
 to retain a lawyer and the poor state of the Government's legal aid department
 means that many citizens entitled to legal aid find it is unavailable.
 There were no reports of political prisoners (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for respect for privacy and the inviolability of the home; how-
 ever, the authorities did not always respect these rights in practice. Except during
 a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may enter a home;
 police routinely ignored this requirement, and often arrested alleged criminals at
 their homes without having first obtained an arrest warrant. The Constitution
 grants the Drug Enforcement Commission and the Zambian intelligence Security
 service authority to wiretap telephones. In September 1996, the Inspector General
 of Police admitted in open court that he had ordered illegal wiretaps on a telephone
 at the offices of The Post, an independent daily newspaper. At year's end, he still
 had not been charged for this illegal action.
 Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued. Accord-
 ing to the Government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empow-
 ered under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, the penal code lists various prohibited activities that
 may be broadly interpreted so as to restrict these freedoms. In response to headlines
 and stories that alleged corrupt practices on the part of government officials, the
 Government or its appointed officials have brought numerous libel actions against
 the Post newspaper. At year's end, over 80 cases filed over the course of the last
 3 years remained to be adjudicated.
 The law includes provisions for investigative tribunals to call as witnesses jour-
 nalists and media managers who print allegations of parliamentary misconduct.
 Failure to cooperate with a tribunal may result in charges of contempt punishable
 by up to 6 months in jail. This is seen by the media as a clear infringement on press
 freedom and a means for parliamentarians to bypass the clogged court system in
 dealing with libel suits against the media. In 1996 the Speaker of the National As-
 sembly ordered the indefinite detention of three journalists for contempt of the
 House (see Section 1.d.).
 In February the Government published the draft of a media bill that would have
 limited press freedom severely. After considerable criticism and protest, the Govern-
 ment withdrew the bill. Partly in an effort to forestall any future government at-
 tempts to regulate the media, the Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA)
 formed its own media council to establish ethical standards and handle complaints.
 A number of independent newspapers question government actions and policies
 and circulate without government interference. For the last 2 years, the leading
 independent daily, The Post, has had an Internet home page that has attracted over
 15,000 readers per month. State House and the government-controlled Times of
 Zambia and Daily Mail also have home pages, established in April 1996.
 The Government owns the two most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the
 sole television station, the Zambia National Broadcast Corporation (ZNBC). In addi-
 tion to the government- controlled radio -tation, there are two church related sta-
 tions and one private commercial station operating in Zambia. The Government
 pressured the commercial. station to refrain from carrying the British Broadcasting
 Corporation (BBC). Multi-Choice, based in South Africa, provides both Direct Sat-
 ellite Television and analog wireless subscriber television service. In addition to
 many entertainment channels, the DSTV service provides Cable News Network
 (CNN), BBC World, and Sky Television News. It also provides three BBC, one Radio
 France International, and Voice of America (VOA) radio news broadcasts. The ana-
 log wireless system carries BBC world news and several entertainment channels.
 Neither of the services provides local news coverage. The Government exercised con-
 siderable influence over the government-owned media, which continued to follow the
 government line on important issues. A second wireless television service, CASAT,
 began operations in December.
 On January 6, Masautso Phiri, senior editor at the independent newspaper, the
 Post, was summoned by the Supreme Court to answer charges of contempt of court
 relating to statements he had made alleging that each justice had accepted a
 $750,000 (1 billion kwacha) bribe from the MMD-led Government to throw out the
 opposition petitions against Chiluba's presidential eligibility. He admitted in court
 that he had no proof of these allegations, and was subsequently sentenced to 3
 months imprisonment. Phiri maintains that the court acted unfairly, noting that
 three of the justices should have recused themselves due to their personal involve-
 ment. In mid-April, Health Minister Katele Kalunba banned the Central Board of
 Health from advertising in The Post.
 In February editor Lweendo Hamusankwa and reporter Boyd Phiri of the inde-
 pendent weekly Chronicle were picked up by police and detained at Woodlands po.
 lice station in connection with a story that reported a break-in at an army armory.
 They were charged with "publishing false news with intent to cause fear and alarm"
 and criminal libel. The case remained open, and no trial date had been set by year's
 end. On February 15, state agents seized Chronicle reporter George Jambwa at gun-
 -point following the publication of a story that headlined a presidential aide driving
 a stolen vehicle. Jambwa was detained for 10 hours at Lusaka Central prison and
 asked to reveal the source of his story. He then was released.
 In December 1996, police charged the opposition's legal counsel, Mainza Chona,
 with "publishing false news with intent to cause alarm among the public". This fol-
 lowed a statement that Chona made in the Supreme Court that a suspected bomb
 had been planted at former president Kaunda's house. The magistrate set him free
 after finding the statement to be privileged information made in official court pro-
 ceedings. Most attorneys believe that the police action was politically motivated, in-
 tended to intimidate opposition lawyers.
 
 
 All undergraduate and a few professional program classes at the University of
 Zambia were canceled starting in November 1996 following a stone-throwing inci-
 dent. Although the university senate took this action, public statements by the Min-
 ister of Education led most observers to believe that it did so at the behest of the
 Government. The motivation for the closure was a combination of political, adminis-
 trative, and financial problems at the university. The university reopened in Octo-
 ber.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, but the Government restricted this right in practice.
 The law requires rally organizers to notify the police 7 days in advance. The police
 may advise the organizers that the time or venue is inopportune. In practice, the
 police did not interfere with most peaceful rallies whose leaders had followed the
 prior notification rule; however, authorities often denied permission to proceed for
 rallies planned by the political opposition, particularly the United Independence
 Party (UNIP).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, on occasions the
 Government has harassed and arrested NGO leaders. Following their detention of
 several hours in November 1996, NCO leaders Alfred Zulu (ZIMT) and Ngande
 Mwanajet (AFRONET) were released. They were charged with receiving financing
 from foreign governments at the beginning of the year. There has been no further
 action on either charge. Both remain active and free (see Section 4).
 All organizations must apply formally for registration to the Registrar of Societies.
 In most cases the authorities routinely approved these applications. During the
 year, there were 37 political parties in operation and dozens of nongovernmental or-
 ganizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-A 1996 amendment to the Constitution declared Zambia
 a Christian nation while providing for freedom of religion. The Government respects
 the rights of al faiths to worship freely in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to move freely
 throughout Zambia, to reside in anypart of the country, and to depart and return
 to the ountry without restriction. Te authorities generally respected these rights
 during the year, but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued, and po-
 lice sometimes extorted money and goods from motorists. In September the Minister
 of Local Government forbade the Npezeni, the Chief of the N'goni (a group related
 to South Africa's Zulus), from leaving the country to attend a meeting of Zulu and
 Zulu-related chiefs in South Africa.
 Several days after UNIP President Kenneth Kaunda was detained, the passports
 of his son Wezi Kaunda, Wezi's wife, and a UNIP Central Committee member were
 confiscated when they tried to cross the border into Zimbabwe.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 120,000 refugees, mainly Angolans, in Zambia in 1997.
 The Government cooperated with the UNHCR in processing applications for refugee
 status.
 A steady trickle of persons from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC)
 continued to cross into Zambia during the year. In response to alleged criminal ac-
 tivities of many Congolese in the border region, the Government rounded up, ar-
 rested, and deported many Congolese and other illegal aliens throughout the year.
 The deportation of illegal aliens is lawful, but those who had been accorded refugee
 status by the UNHCR were sometimes picked up and held for varying lengths of
 time before being released. In several cases, the Government deported refugees who
 were registered with the UNHCR.
 The authorities held a number of foreigners who were not registered with the
 UNHCR as illegal aliens (principally from neighboring countries) until they could
 be deported. They also held approximately 500 former Zairian soldiers, who are reg-
 istered with the UNHCR, in a camp in Northern province.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens voted in multiparty elections in November 1996; however, constitutional
 amendments barred the best known opposition candidate, former president and
 UNIP leader Kenneth Kuanda and his deputy, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, from run-
 ning for the presidency in 1996, thereby restricting the right of citizens to change
 their government. The amendments accepted in 1996 require both parents of presi-
 dential candidates to be Zambian citizens by birth and disqualify tribal chiefs from
 running for the presidency.
 Eleven political parties contested presidential and national assembly elections in
 1996. Approximately 50 percent of eligible voters registered. Of these almost 70 per-
 
 
 cent cast ballots. While the MMD's use of government resources-including the
 state-owned media during campaigns- probably did not affect the final outcomes,
 their fairness was put into question. The Government's failure to implement a
 transparent registration project raised doubts about the Government's willingness
 to have an open electoral process.
 Local elections, originally scheduled for 1995, had still not taken place by year's
 end.
 Under the Constitution, the President wields broad authority. Although the Na-
 tional Assembly ratifies major appointments and has other powers, in practice it
 continued to provide only a limited check on executive authority.
 The number of women in politics and government is increasing, but remains
 small. There are 13 women inParliament (1 minister, and 2 deputy ministers) and
 3 Asians (1 minister). There is also one mixed-race (African-European) minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights and civic organizations generally operated without serious govern-
 ment hindrance; however, police arrested the leaders of the Zambian Independent
 Monitoring Team (ZIMT) and the Committee for a Clean Campaign (CCC) in No-
 vember 1996 after the two organizations described the 1996 electoral process as nei-
 ther free nor fair. Although these detentions were brief, the ZIMT, the CCC, the Af-
 rican Human Rights Network (AFRONET), and the Foundation for Electoral Proc-
 esses have claimed that official harassment, including the blocking of their bank ac-
 counts, has continued. Other human rights organizations in Zambia include the Law
 Association of Zambia, Women for Change, the Catholic Commission for Justice and
 Peace, and the Zambia Civic Education Association.
 In May the Government established an autonomous Human Rights Commission.
 A Supreme Court justice chairs the Commission; other members are drawn from
 throughout society and include the former head of the Foundation for Democratic
 processes (FODEP) and a University of Zambia lecturer on human rights. The Com-
 mission interceded on behalf of persons who it concluded had their rights denied by
 the Government. While there were doubts, at first, about its autonomy and effective-
 ness, the Commission aggressively sought and received access to the coup detainees,
 exposed the torture of seven of them, and demanded and obtained better medical
 care for them. The Commission spoke out on behalf of detainees and prisoners, and
 the Government responded. At year's end, a number of seriously ill prisoners were
 released at the Commission's request.
 The Government continued to be receptive to criticism from human rights and
 civic organizations in general, but on occasion, government officials accused human
 rights monitors of abetting crime and thwarting the work of the police through their
 focus on the victims of police brutality. The Government did not interfere with in-
 quiries or visits by international human rights organizations.
 The Government continued to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal
 (ICTR) for Rwanda in detaining and sending to Arusha those persons whom the
 ICTR identified as suspected war criminals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of origin,
 marital status, political opinion, color, or creed. Constitutional amendments barring
 native-bern Zambians of partial or full foreign ancestry from the presidency appear
 to violate the prohibition on discrimination based on place of origin. These amend-
 ments also prohibit traditional chiefs, who are accorded authority and privileges as
 chiefs, from running for political office unless they resign their chieftainships. A
 legal challenge to these amendments was unsuccessful.
 omen.-Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife beating and
 rape were widespread. According to official statistics, over 4,000 rape cases were re-
 ported to the plice between 1991 and 1997. Of these, approximately 30 percent re-
 sulted in conviction and 5 percent in acquittal. The remainder were either dismissed
 or remain unresolved. Defendants convicted of rape normally were sentenced to
 hard labor. Since many rapes are not reported to police, the actual number is con-
 sidered much higher. Domestic assault is a criminal offense, but in practice police
 are often reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating, preferring to broker a reconcili-
 ation. The Government and nongovernmental organizations expressed increasing
 concern about violence against women, and the media devoted considerable publicity
 to it during the year.
 Both the Constitution and law entitle women to full equality with men in most
 areas. In practice, women are severely disadvantaged compared with men in formal
 
 
 383
 employment and education. Married women who are employed often suffer from dis-
 criminatory conditions of service. For example, women have little independent ac-
 cess to credit facilities; in most cases, they remain dependent on their husbands,
 who are required to sign for loans. As a result, few women own their own homes.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and legislative
 provisions. Polygamy is permitted if the first wife agrees to it at the time of the
 first wedding. nder traditional customs prevalent in most ethnic groups, all rights
 to inherit propery rest with the deceasedman's family. The 1989 Intestate Succes-
 sion Act was designed to provide women with a share of the joint estate. Under the
 act, the children of a deceased man equally share 50 percent; the widow receives
 20 percent; the parents, 20 percent; and relatives, 10 percent. A 1996 "reform" of
 the act places the widow's share at 20 percent to b divided equally with any other
 women who can prove a marital relation with the deceased man, thus granting in-
 heritance rights to other wives, mistresses, and concubines.
 In practice, "prperty grabbing" by the relatives of the deceased man continues
 to be rampant, particularly when local customary courts have jurisdiction. These
 courts often use a different law, the Local Courts Act, to distribute inheritances
 without reference to the percentages mandated in the Succession Act. As a result,
 many widows receive little or nothing from the estate. Fines for property grabbing
 mandated by the Intestate Succession Act are extraordinarily low.
 Children.-The Government seeks to improve the welfare of children, but scarce
 resources and ineffective implementation of social programs adversely affected the
 welfare of children. Due to harsh economic conditions, both rural and urban children
 often must work in the informal sector to help families make ends meet (see section
 6.d.).
 There was no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education. The Government has taken steps to ame-
 liorate their hardships, including establishing a national trust fund to provide loans
 to the disabled to help them start businesses, but its efforts are limited by scarce
 resources. The Government has not legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility
 to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Ri ht of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form trade unions, and approximately 60 percent of the 300,000 formal sector
 workers are unionized. Fourteen of the country's 19 large national unions, organized
 by industry or profession, are affiliated with the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions
 (ZCTU). The ZCTU is democratically operated and, like its constituent unions, is
 independent of any political party and the Government. The Mine Workers Union
 of Zambia and four other ZCTU constituent unions broke from ZCTU and have es-
 tablished a rival umbrella organization.
 The 1993 Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA) reestablished the "one indus-
 try, one union" principle. The Bankers Union of Zambia was duly registered with
 the Government in 1993 but has been unable to operate because the employers rec-
 ognize the existing Zambia Union of Financial and Allied Workers. In November
 1993, the Ndola High Court ordered the Government to register the Secondary
 School Teachers Union of Zambia. The Government continues to argue that the
 Zambia National Union of Teachers represents secondary school teachers and has
 administratively delayed recognition of the new secondary teachers union.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services,
 the Zambia Defense Force, the judiciary, the police, the prison service, and the In-
 telligence Security Service. The ILRA defines essential services as power, medical,
 water, sewerage, firefighting, and certain mining occupations essential to safety. It
 permits strikes only after all other legal recourse has been exhausted, and in prac-
 tice all work stoppages during the year were illegal. The ILRA prohibits employers
 from retribution against employees engaged in legal trade union activities. Workers
 engaged in illegal strikes do not enjoy this protection.
 Bya majority vote of its members, a union may decide on affiliation with the
 ZCTU or with trade unions or organizations outside Zambia. The ZCTU is a member
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Labor leaders travel with-
 out restriction to international conferences and to visit counterparts abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively-The ILRA provides for the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. Employers and unions in each industry
 negotiate collective bargaining agreements through joint councils in which there is
 no government involvement. Civil servants and teachers, as public officials, nego-
 tiate directly with the Government. Collective disputes are first referred to a concil-
 
 
 384
 iator or a board of conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve the dispute, the parties
 may refer the case to the Industrial Relations Court or, in the case of employees,
 vote to strike. In practice, the industry joint councils function effectively as collec-
 tive bargaining umts.
 The ILRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union mem-
 bers and organizers. An employee who believes that he has been penalized for union
 activities may, after exhausting any existing administrative channels for relief, file
 a complaint with the Industrial Relations Court. This Court has the power to order
 appropriate redress for the aggrieved worker. The complainant may appeal a judg-
 ment of the Industrial Relations Court to the Supreme Court. In practice, the Court
 often orders employers to reinstate workers found to have been the victims of dis-
 crimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 and involuntary servitude, but it authorizes the Government to call upon citizens
 to perform labor in specific instances, for example, during national emergencies or
 disasters. Moreover, the Government can require citizens to perform labor that is
 associated with traditional civic or communal obligations, as when all members of
 a village are called upon to assist in preparing for a visit by a traditional leader
 or other dignitary. In practice, bonded or forced abor by adults or children is not
 permitted, and the labor authorities enforce the legal proscriptions when cases vio-
 lating the law are brought to their attention (see section 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labior Practices and Minimum Age for Employmen.-The legal
 minimum age for employment of children is 16 years. The Labor Commissioner ef-
 fectively enfos this law in the industrial sector, where because of high adult un-
 employment, there are no jobs available to children. The law is not enforced, how-
 ever, for those who work in the subsistence agricultural, domestic service, and infor-
 mal sectors, where children under age 16 are often employed. In urban areas chil-
 dren commonly engage in street vending. Forced or bonded labor by children is not
 permitted, and authorities enforce legal proscriptions when cases of violations are
 brought to their attention (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for nonunionized workers
 is set at $0.05 (70.30 kwacha) per hour. based on a 48-hour workweek, the legal
 maximum for nonuonized workers, a worker earning the minimum wage would re-
 ceive $10.70 (14,600 kwacha) per month. The minimum wage covers nonunionized
 workers in categories such as general workers, cleaners, office orderlies, and watch-
 men. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a worker and family with a de-
 cent standard of living, and most minimum wage earners must supplement their in-
 comes through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the extended family.
 With respect to unionized workers, each industry sets its own wge scales and
 maximum workweek limits through collective bargaining. In practice, almost all
 unionized workers receive salaries considerably higher than the nonunion minimum
 wage. The minimum workweek for full-time employment is 40 hours and is, in prac-
 tice, the normal workweek. The law requires 2 days of annual leave per month of
 service.
 The law also regulates minimum health and safety standards in industry, and the
 Department of Mines is responsible for enforcement. Factory safety is bandied by
 the Inspector of Factories under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chron-
 ically limit enforcement effectiveness. There are no legislative provisions to protect
 a worker who refuses to work on safety grounds.
