 LATVIA
 Latvia regained its independence in 1991 after some 60 years of Soviet occupation.
 Latvia's form of government is a parliamentary democracy. The highest legislative
 authority is the Supreme Council whose Chairman serves as Head of State. The
 Prime Minister, elected by the Supreme Council, is the chief executive official. Day-
 to-day government operations are the responsibility of the Council of Ministers
 elected by the Supreme Council and directed by the Prime Minister. The Council
 of Ministers is nominated by the Prime Minister and approved by the Parliament,
 and Parliament is able to remove individual ministers from their posts. Pending the
 adoption of a new constitution, the Supreme Council in December 1991 adopted a
 Constitutional Law providing for basic rights and freedoms.
 Latvian authorities are gradually replacing or retraining the police and members
 of the security forces. Some Soviet-trained police are being dismissed, mostly for not
 knowing how to speak Latvian. Latvian authorities continue to insist that all Rus-
 sian military forces leave the country as soon as possible, with a deadline of the
 end of 1993. Latvia and the Russian Federation have not reached agreement on a
 timetable for the withdrawal of these troops, which remain a cause of tension both
 in bilateral relations and domestically. Latvia's borders are patrolled by the Latvian
 Home Guard and Border Guards.
 Latvia's economy deteriorated in 1992. Trade with Russia collapsed, while trade
 with the West and foreign investment did not absorb the decline. Industrial output
 was estimated to have fallen by as much as 40 percent in 1992, and unemployment
 rose steeply. Economic reform continued apace in 1992. Collective farms were abol-
 ished, and private farmers are cultivating most farmland. Urban property is being
 returned to its legal owners. In March the Parliament passed a framework privat-
 ization law and in November approved privatization by voucher. In mid-year, Latvia
 successfully introduced a transitional currency to isolate it from external inflation-
 ary pressures.
 The current Parliament was elected before Latvia regained its independence in
 1991 and it has sought to put off decisions in a variety of fields such as naturaliza-
 tion law, preferring to leave them to a parliament elected under Latvian laws. This
 has slowed progress in codifying human rights protections.
 The unresolved questions of citizenship and naturalization were the most signifi-
 cant issues related to human rights. Due to a policy of Russification during the So-
 viet occupation, ethnic Latvians now make up only 52 percent of the total popu-
 lation, and none of Latvia's seven largest cities boasts an ethnic Latvian majority.
 The possibility that non-Latvians who entered the country during the occupation
 could control the balance of political power made citizenship and naturalization is-
 sues particularly contentious. The continued failure to resolve these issues exacer-
 bated tensions between ethnic Latvians and other ethnic groups, mostly ethnic Rus-
 sians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Inregrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrojudicial Killing.-No such killings by Latvian authori-
 ties are known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of political abductions or dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited under the Constitutional Law, and there were no indications
 that such abuses occurred.
 Latvian officials have moved to end the human rights abuses that occurred in Lat-
 vian prisons during the Soviet era. There were no reports of physical abuse of per-
 sons, and conditions generally have improved despite economic hardships and short-
 
 
 826
 ages of blankets, food, and medical care. The press obtained access to and reported
 on conditions in Latvian prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There are no known 'instances of arbi-
 trary arrest or exile. Arrests are made on the basis of a prosecutorial warrant. The
 law requires the prosecutor's office to make a formal decision within 72 hours after
 arrest whether to charge or release a detainee. Charges must be filed within 10
 days of arrest. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any time.
 Currently, the court reviews fulfillment of these requirements at trial. Parliament
 passed a court reform law on December 15 as part of the reorganization of the court
 system. In general, the Latvian judiciary is independent of improper government in-
 fluences.
 During the Augst 1991 oup attempt, former Latvian Communist party chief Al.
 fred Rubiks proclaimed himself head of the so-called Salvation Committee. He was
 subsequently arrested, and his case (along with that of six of his colleagues) is still
 being investigated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Local courts are comprised of three judges, only
 one of whom is a professional jurist. Particularly heinous crimes are heard in the
 first instance by the Supreme Court. Latvia is moving to reorganize its court system
 according to Western standards. There are no reports of judges having been improp-
 erly influenced by the Government.
 Trials may be closed if state secrets may be revealed, but there is no known in-
 stance of this provision being used for political motives since Latvia regained inde-
 pendence in 1991. All defendants have the right to hire an attorney, and the State
 will lend funds to destitute defendants for this purpose. Defendants have the right
 to read all charges and confront all witnesses. Defendants may offer witnesses and
 evidence to support their case.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitutional Law provides for privacy of communications and residence, except
 when a person is being detained at the scene of a crime or the lives of other persons
 are endangered. A judge's order must be obtained to intercept the mail, telephone
 calls, or other forms of communications. Latvian authorities abolished almost all of-
 fices and dismissed almost all substantive employees of the former Soviet state secu-
 rity structure in Latvia that are under their control.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Latvia generally enjoyed freedom of speech
 throughout 1992, and both Latvian and Russian-language papers printed a wide
 range of criticism. The Constitutional Law contains provisions on free speech and
 press, and the 1991 Latvian press law prohibits censorship of the press and other
 mass media.
 On September 14, the Government seized that day's edition of the Latvian nation-
 alist newspaper, Pilsonis, for advocating disobedience of the government require-
 ment that all residents of the country register with the Government. (Final registra-
 tion figures on the percentage of nonethnic Latvians in Latvia may be a factor dur-
 ing parliamentary debate of laws on citizenship and naturalization.) The suspension
 of the paper lasted 1 day. This action came after the Government warned the paper
 about its alleged support for violent overthrow of the Government. On October 22,
 the Government won a court order shutting down the paper indefinitely for libeling
 a number of people, including Latvian officials, as former agents of the Soviet Com-
 mittee for State Security (KGB). Within a few days, the paper reopened under a
 new masthead.
 As of the end of 1992, most major newspapers had been privatized or were in the
 process of being privatized. The Government sold newsprint at subsidized prices
 until the end of 1992. Due to the general economic crisis, over half of all newspapers
 may have to cease publication in 1993.
 In May a new law on broadcasting abolished the old Soviet State Committee on
 Broadcasting, limited the amount of government-produced programming, and for-
 bade state censorship. Broadcast media were free of government censorship
 throughout 1992.
 Independent radio and television were broadcasting in late 1992, but all broadcast
 media, including the state radio and television, faced financial difficulties that
 caused a reduction in the amount of Russian-language programming that Latvia
 buys from Russia. There is private Russian-language radio and television in Latvia.
 Several cable and satellite television companies have sprung up throughout Latvia,
 and the number of privately owned satellite dishes is growing rapidly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Latvian authorities legally do
 not have the power to prohibit public gatherings but may change the time and
 
 
 place, for example, on the grounds of rear of public disorder. In 1992 numerous mass
 meetings and public gatherings took place without government interference.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. As a
 result of the failed Soviet coup in August 1991, however, the activities of the Com-
 munist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as of other organizations that actively
 supported the coup (e.g., the political organization Interfront), were officially banned
 in 1991. In September Communists in Latvia formed a public Union of Latvian
 Communists, which has been free of government interference.
 The Russian community has not been a unified political bloc, and, although some
 small groupings have formed, it has not coalesced around a single political move-
 ment.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not interfere in the exercise of reli-
 gious freedom. The dominant faiths are Lutheran and Eastern Orthodox. Foreign
 evangelists are permitted to hold meetings and proselytize. Religious groups are not
 required to register with the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens. The number of Latvians travelingabroad has
 increased dramatically over the past 3 to 4 years. Legal residents must have a nota-
 rized invitation to obtain a document to travel outside the country. There is no evi-
 dence that persons with invitations were denied exit visas.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides for a universal, secret ballot and the right to establish political
 parties. An increasing number of political parties and organizations represent a
 wide array of views. The failure to resolve the citizenship and naturalization ques-
 tions delayed the scheduling of elections and resulted in interim legislation. Impor-
 tant legislation that would implement basic human rights guarantees has not been
 passed. The right of citizens to change their government remains, therefore,
 untested.
 The Communist Party and Interfront were officially banned in 1991 (see Section
 2.b.). The reconstituted Union of Latvian Communists may field candidates for elec-
 tion. Following an investigation by a parliamentary committee into the events sur-
 rounding the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, the Latvian Parliament in 1992
 ejected 15 members who had participated in or directly supported the 1991 coup.
 hese seats remain vacant and will be filled during national elections planned for
 1993. Parliamentary representation in Latvia is not based on ethnic identity, and
 many ethnic Russians are deputies in Parliament.
 Under the resolution on citizenship passed by Parliament in October 1991, only
 those who were citizens prior to June 17, 1940, and their direct descendants were
 able to claim citizenship. The citizenship status of other residents of Latvia, includ-
 ing those who arrived or were born in Latvia during the Soviet occupation, was un-
 resolved. The resolution also suggested principles for a future law on naturalization,
 establishing five criteria-residence for at least 16 years in Latvia, a conversational
 knowledge of Latvian, a knowledge of the Latvian Constitution, renunciation of
 former citizenship, and a loyalty oath-in addition to excluding several groups, such
 as members of the former Soviet army, alcoholics and drug addicts, and criminals,
 as a class. While a majority of the Russians living in Latvia would meet the 16-
 year residency requirement, less than 25 percent of the nonethnic Latvian residents
 speak Latvian. (In fact, Russian speakers outnumber Latvian speakers in the coun-
 try.) The Russian Government and some international human rights organizations
 criticized these criteria as discriminating against ethnic Russians and other Slays.
 Parliament had passed a law that Latvia would not naturalize new citizens until
 the Russian army had left. This law stands as a political barrier to early action on
 a citizenship law.        .1
 A fact-finding delegation from the United Nations Human Rights Commission vis-
 ited Latvia in October at Latvia's request. The summary of its report suggested that
 Latvia adopt a citizenship law at an early date so residents may regularize their
 status and that non-Latvians not be excluded from the privatization process. The
 report further recommended that the domicile qualification could be changed from
 16 to 5 years.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government welcomes visits by human rights organizations and has received
 delegations from, among others, the Council of Europe and the United Nations.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitutional Law provides that all persons are equal under the
 law regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social status, or other grounds, and
 Frants equal rights to work and wages to al nationalities, the Supreme Council's
 aw on human rights and civic obligations says that only citizens may occupy state
 positions, establish political parties, own land, choose a place of abode on Latvian
 territory, leave Latvia, or return to it. As noted in Section 3, citizenship and natu-
 ralization criteria have yet to be adopted. Furthermore, the Latvian language law
 requires that employees of the State and of all "institutions, enterprises, and insti-
 tutes" know Latvian as well as is required for their profession, the degree of knowl-
 edge to be determined by statute. It also requires most of such groups to be able
 to deal with the public in Latvian. There are charges that these laws have been
 used to discriminate against nonethnic Latvians, especially Russians. While all stu-
 dents must study some Latvian in primary school, in practice the Latvian Govern-
 ment has agreed to allow the main language of instruction to remain Russian in
 public primary public schools for Russian speakers. State-funded technical and voca-
 tional secondary education and state university education after freshman year is in
 Latvian.
 Some ethnic Russians have complained of de facto discrimination resulting from
 Latvia's property laws. Most people in Latvia live in government-owned apartments,
 which have not yet been privatized. Compensation offered by the Government for
 state apartments is not enough for departing Russians to purchase any type of
 apartment in Russia. Active-duty military personnel have no right to sell or swap
 their apartments under any circumstances. These circumstances discourage emigra-
 tion and also Russian troop withdrawals. The Government has argued that to pay
 departing Russian military personnel for the apartments the Soviet Government
 had assigned them in Latvia would legitimate the Soviet military presence in Lat-
 via. Some officials point out that, without settling citizenship and residency ques-
 tions, Latvia cannot give Russians the right to ownership.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men and, in addition, have significant
 day-care and maternity benefits. While the law requires that women receive equal
 pay for equal work, in practice, as a result of the extreme competition for jobs, par-
 ticularly in the emerging private sector, women sometimes face discrimination in
 hiring and pay.
 Reliable statistics on domestic violence against women are unavailable. Cultural
 factors and the current economic crisis suggest, however, the existence of domestic
 violence, often associated with alcohol abuse. Some observers suggest that police are
 sometimes reluctant to arrest in such cases since charges are often later dropped.
 These observers also suggest that some judges are reluctant to impose sufficient
 penalties. Some women's groups are beginning to form in Latvia, but their member-
 ship is relatively low. Their main concerns are to improve enforcement of child sup-
 port and public assistance for families headed by women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under a 1991 Latvian law, workers have the legal
 right to form and join trade unions of their own choosing. At the end of 1992, about
 70 percent of the work force belonged to unions. Union membership, though, is fall-
 ing as workers leave Soviet-era unions that include management or are laid off as
 Soviet-style factories fail.
 Unions are nonpolitical, although some union activists advocate endorsing or
 forming a political organization. Unions have the right to strike, with some limits,
 and regularly exercise this right. Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are
 developing contacts with European trade unions and international trade union orga-
 nizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threatened to
 fire union members; these businesses usually paid better salaries and benefits than
 were available elsewhere. A Government-employer labor council now exists to advise
 the Government on social and economic policies.
 No export processing zones exist in Latvia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is
 banned and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 16. This minimum age law is, by all accounts, enforced
 by state authorities through inspections.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-
 hour maximum workweek, 4 weeks of annual vacation, and a program of assistance
 to working mothers with small children. The minimum wage is now set at a figure
 that is estimated by the Latvian authorities to be below the poverty line. Latvian
 laws establish minimum occupational health and safety standards for the work-
 place, but these standards seem to be frequently ignored.
