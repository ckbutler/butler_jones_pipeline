 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 
 The Federal Republic of Germany, established in 1949, is a
 modern and stable parliamentary democracy, with executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches of government. The country
 has a highly industrialized economy, which is particularly
 strong in traditional, heavy industries such as steel, coal,
 automobiles, machine tools, heavy equipment, and chemicals. The
 Federal Republic scrupulously respects human rights. It does
 not subordinate women or any other social group.
 The head of government, the Chancellor, is elected by the
 Bundestag, or lower House of Parliament. He enjoys a powerful
 position, approaching that of an American President. Based on
 the experience of the old Reichstag Parliament during the Weimar
 period, the Constitution (the Basic Law, adopted in 1948)
 strengthened substantially the position of the Chancellor and
 the capacity of the Parliament to function effectively. The
 Bundestag is elected through a mixture of direct constituency
 candidates and party lists.
 With the exception of the period from 1957 to 1961, the country
 has always been governed by a coalition of parties, led by one
 of the two major parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
 or the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). The Greens, a
 new party in the Bundestag since the national elections of March
 1983, challenge the legitimacy of the political system
 established under the Basic Law as not being sufficiently
 democratic. Despite this claim, however, the party campaigns
 mostly on other issues, particularly opposition to nuclear
 weapons and protection of the environment. The Greens are
 supported by only approximately five to eight percent of the
 electorate. Between 85 and 90 percent of all qualified voters
 participate in elections, and the vast majority of the
 electorate supports democratic parties.
 The West German police are organized essentially at the state,
 or Land, level and operate under the direction of state
 governments. The police are highly disciplined and scrupulously
 respect human rights. In dealing with hostile elements,
 including terrorists, special care is taken to respect the
 rights of the accused.
 The rise of a "peace movement" in the country has posed new
 challenges to the police in recent years, particularly at the
 end of 1983. Demonstrations for peace in the Federal Republic,
 while most often, and characteristically, peaceful in nature,
 sometimes also include violent fringe elements seeking to
 disrupt normal life, damage property, and provoke extreme police
 reaction. However, the police are skilled in avoiding such
 confrontations.
 During 1983, there was some political sentiment, both in and out
 of the Government, in favor of strengthening police authority to
 deal with demonstrators. Various recommendations, such as a
 rule forbidding demonstrators to wear masks, have been rejected
 or opposed by the Bundestag, however, out of respect for
 individual liberties.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by political
 organizations is unknown, with the exception of occasional acts
 of violence carried out by terrorist groups on the far left
 (Baader-Meinhof and its successor groups), the far right
 (neo-Nazi groups), and among some groups of resident
 foreigners. While terrorists of the extreme left and extreme
 right continue in existence underground, there have been no
 instances of assassination or attempted assassination in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly
 arrest, or otherwise clandestinely detain persons. Nor have
 there been, for several years, political kidnappings by
 terrorist groups.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no physical or mental torture of prisoners by police
 authorities. Nor is there cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment short of torture. Prison conditions are comfortable.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 All arrests in the Federal Republic are conducted on the basis
 of arrest warrants issued by competent judicial authorities.
 Persons are not detained, punished, or tried for the expression
 of views critical of the Government. Any person arrested by the
 police must be brought before a judge within 24 hours (or 48
 hours under exceptional circumstances). With the exception of
 some terrorists, who have used contacts with lawyers to promote
 and continue terrorist activity even while in prison, prisoners
 have full access to legal counsel. There is no preventive
 detention, except that a prisoner may be detained no longer than
 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is evidence
 that he might seek to flee the country to avoid prosecution.
 Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is seldom
 employed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. A prisoner must be charged within 24
 hours after arrest and must be informed of the reasons for his
 detention. The judiciary is free of both governmental
 interference and intimidation by terrorists. There are no
 political prisoners in the country.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed under Article 13 of the
 Basic Law and is fully respected in practice. A warrant issued
 by a judge (or in an emergency by a public prosecutor) must be
 
 
 998
 issued prior to forcible entry by police into a home.
 Electronic surveillance also requires a court warrant. There is
 no monitoring of correspondence. Membership in non-governmental
 organizations of all types, including political parties, is
 completely free, neither coerced nor prohibited. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic," however, can be outlawed.
 Under this constitutionally based provision, the German
 Constitutional Court declared illegal both a neo-Nazi and a
 Communist Party in the 1950's. The private use of languages
 other than German is completely free.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Basic Law guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.
 Any political point of view may be expressed in print.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted and quite common.
 There is no censorship of the media or artistic works. Academic
 freedom is complete. There is no censorship of foreign or
 domestic books.
 Newspapers and magazines in Germany are privately owned. Radio
 and television networks and stations exist, for the most part,
 as corporations under special public laws. They are governed by
 independent boards made up of representatives of churches,
 political parties, and other organizations. Legislation is
 under consideration in some German states and in the Bundestag
 to facilitate and encourage private television stations using
 cable, satellites, and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly and association is fully respected, as is
 the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street demonstrations
 are required to obtain police permits beforehand. Occasionally,
 they have not done so, but even in these cases the police
 exercise considerable restraint, showing concern ultimately only
 for the continued functioning of public facilities and the
 protection of the general public.
 In 1983, the "peace movement" reached a high point of activity.
 In contrast to previous years, these activities included not
 only large public demonstrations but also acts aimed directly
 against both German Government installations and American
 military facilities. In some cases, there were deliberate
 breaches of the law.
 As a modern industrial state, the Federal Republic has a
 long-established and highly organized labor movement, including
 17 major national unions. They are generally focused on labor
 problems, but also they venture into the political domain from
 time to time. There has been considerable pressure,
 particularly from younger activists, to involve the German labor
 unions in active support for the "peace movement." While
 organizing and promoting a great many peace demonstrations of
 their own, German labor unions in 1983 resisted other more
 radical proposals, such as a general strike or temporary work
 stoppages. The single exception was a five-minute work stoppage
 in early October.

 The Federal Republic has a great panoply of trade associations,
 professional groupings, and organized interest groups. Their
 activities are unfettered.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The practice of religion is completely free. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system. The
 government subsidizes church-affiliated schools. To this
 degree, established religions indirectly enjoy state support.
 Although there are certain historical associations in West
 Germany between major religious groups and certain political
 tendencies, personal religious affiliation today plays an
 insignificant role in politics, and no role in other secular
 walks of life. Members of all religions can be found in all
 political parties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country and
 to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive from the
 German Democratic Republic are regarded as sharing the same
 German citizenship and therefore, may take up residence in the
 Federal Republic'at any time. The Federal Republic also regards
 itself as the homeland of all ethnic Germans and actively
 promotes the immigration of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe.
 In recent years, the Federal Republic has become an increasingly
 favorite destination for both political refugees and other
 immigrants claiming refugee status. Under complex procedures,
 only about 10 percent of asylum seekers are recognised as true
 political refugees. Since the end of 1982, the Government has
 sought to restrict more effectively illegal immigration and
 abuse of political asylum status. The number of asylum seekers
 dropped from 107,000 in 1980 to 49,000 in 1981, to 37,000 in
 1982, and to an estimated 20,000 in 1983.
 Efforts to reduce nonpolitical incentives to persons claiming
 political refugee status have on occasion adversely affected the
 material well-being of true refugees. A number of complaints
 have been made against the handling, mostly by state-level
 authorities, of asylum seekers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Under the stable and liberal parliamentary democracy established
 by the Basic Law, changes of government occur through orderly
 elections based on universal suffrage. At the end of 1982, as a
 result of a change in coalition alinement in the Bundestag, the
 SPD, which had been the major governing party since the election
 of 1969, moved into the opposition. The CDU, its Bavarian
 sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the small Free
 Democratic Party, formed a new governing coalition. National
 elections in March 1983, confirmed this change.
 Candidates for public office are usually members of political
 parties but are not required to be. Because of the Weimar
 experience with splinter parties, the Basic Law and the state
 constitutions contain provisions that only parties achieving at
 least five percent of the vote can be represented in the Federal
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 64
 
 
 1000
 and state Parliaments. New political parties are free to form
 and enter the political process. Voting on most issues in the
 Bundestag is split, but usually the position supported by the
 governing coalition parties prevails. On occasion, however,
 defections from the ranks of governing parties bring about
 failures even of legislative efforts proposed by the Government.
 The Greens, still more a protest movement than a political
 party, gained Bundestag representation as a result of the March
 1983 elections. In the name of "basic democracy," their
 approach to parliamentary politics is ambivalent but emphasizes
 a collegial decisionmaking process closely tied to public
 opinion.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty Inter-
 national, and other smaller organizations exist and conduct
 their activities freely in the Federal Republic. The two major
 organizations have a number of local chapters. Amnesty
 International's 1983 report expressed concern about several
 cases in which conscientious objectors were sentenced to jail.
 Freedom House rates the Federal Republic "free."
 Amnesty International in the country explicitly excludes itself
 from investigation of violations of human rights by
 non-governmental groups, such as guerrilla or revolutionary
 organizations.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Federal Republic has a long-established and generous social
 welfare system. The Government pursues an activist economic
 policy which seeks to promote economic growth and to minimize
 inflation and unemployment. Basic social welfare programs, such
 as pensions, unemployment compensation, and medical care, are
 well provided for. In addition, the Government provides
 extensive additional social benefits, including grants-in-aid to
 pregnant women and, until recently, to students. Neither laws
 nor customs governing civil rights, social benefits, and
 employment opportunities discriminate between men and women.
 Hitler's Germany bequeathed to the Federal Republic a legacy
 which glorified racism and deadly contempt fcr human rights on
 an unprecedented scale. By contrast, the Federal Republic has
 enshrined in both law and practice scrupulous protection of
 human rights, and it has paid out millions of dollars in
 compensation to victims of the Nazi regime.
 The population of the Federal Republic, now 61,500,000, is not
 increasing. Per capita gross national product in 1981 was
 $13,500. Life expectancy at birth (1980) was 72 years. The
 infant mortality rate (1983) was 11 per 1,000. Virtually the
 entire adult population is literate. Everybody has access to
 safe water. All children, both male and female, are enrolled in
 primary school. The calorie supply as a percent of requirements
 in 1977 was 127. There is no discrimination in the extent to
 which shelter, health care, or education are available to all
 inhabitants, regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, political opinion, or citizenship (except for asylum
 seekers, as noted in Section 2 above).
