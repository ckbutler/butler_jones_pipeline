 LIBERIA
 Liberia remained a nation divided g  ahically and factionally as a result of the
 1989-1990 civil war. Despite sustained efforts, peace initiatives of the Economic
 Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to break the complicated political
 stalemate remained without success. In late August renewed fighting between
 Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United Libera-
 tion Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO), a Sierra Leone-based group of
 anti-NPFL Liberians and former civilian and military officials, broke a cease-fire
 which had prevailed for over 20 months and led to a resumption of more generalized
 violence. On October 15 the NPFL attacked the capital city of Monrovia, which was
 defended by the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and adminis-
 tered by the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) under President Amos
 Sawyer. The attack disrupted life in the city and its suburbs as fighters of the war-
 ring factions, especially the NPFL, committed many serious human rights viola-
 tions, including killing innocent Liberians and foreign nationals. ECOMOG eventu-
 ally was able to reestablish order in and around the city.
 Presidential and national legislative elections could not be scheduled because of
 continuing unsettled conditions. Consequently, as in 1991, Liberia was not ruled by
 a constitutionally elected, unified government. The IGNU, a coalition of political
 parties, headed by President Amos Sawyer, administered only Monrovia and its im-
 mediate environs. Roughly half of the country's current population was believed to
 reside in this area within the defensive perimeter of ECOMOG. Following the Au-
 gust fighting in Cape Mount and Bomi Counties, approximately 20,000 additional
 persons sought refuge in Monrovia. Most of the displaced, including a large number
 of Sierra Leoneans, remained in the city. The Charles Taylor-led National Patriotic
 Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG), based on and militarily supported
 by the NPFL, initially controlled the remaining national territory. However, in Au-
 gust ULIMO captured and occupied the country's two southwestern counties. There
 were two other warring factions, the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia
 (INPFL), led by Prince Johnson, and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), the rem-
 nants of former President Samuel Doe's army. Both of these factions were encamped
 in Monrovia where they retained arms within their respective camps. Many AFL
 soldiers reportediy joined forces in September with ULMO to fight the NPFL. Sev-
 eral units of the AFL performed professionally in assisting ECOMOG defend Monro-
 via when the NPFL attacked. However, renegade AEL elements committed serious
 abuses. The INPFL was effectively dissolved as a result of the attack on Monrovia.
 One INPFL faction returned to the NPFL while fighters loyal to Prince Johnson
 joined him in surrendering to ECOMOG.
 ECOMOG assumed a large portion of the police responsibility in Monrovia be-
 cause the IGNU police force, reconstituted in 1991, remained mostly unarmed and
 ineffective. However, the IGNU reactivated an armed special security unit in 1992.
 NPFL military and police forces were responsible for security in territory under
 NPFL control, and to a large extent, both the INPFL and AFL carried out this func-
 tion within their camps. Liberia's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed
 analysis, were $58 million.
 The civil war-ravaged economy, which is based primarily on iron ore robber, tim-
 ber, diamonds, and gold also reflects the political division between IGU and NPFL
 areas. There was slight economic recovery in 1991 and incrementalprogress in 1992
 until widespread hostilities resumed. However, the year's gross domestic product
 was estimated at only 40 percent of the prewar levels. The economic division was
 further exacerbated in January, when the IGNU introduced new currency, which
 the NPFL outlawed in its area. The IGNU also imposed an embargo, which lasted
 for several months, on transport of nonessential goods into NPFL territory.
 ECOWAS/ECOMOG imposed strict sanctions on NPFL territory during the last
 quarter of the year, effectively cutting off exports and foreign exchange earnings to
 the NPFL. Massive emergency operations by the United Nations, as well as by the
 United States and other Western-based relief agencies and nongovernmental organi-
 zations, brought food or other humanitarian assistance to a majority of Liberians.
 These operations continued throughout 1992 but were periodically suspended in
 areas outside of Monrovia because of intermittent ULIMO-NPFL fighting as well as
 by harassment of relief workers, primaiily by the NPFL.
 Before the Aug st hostilities, human rights, although widely circumscribed, were
 not abused on the massive scale experienced during the height of the civil war.
 However, the ULIMO-NPFL fighting in western Liberia and the October 15 attack
 on Monrovia rekindled memories of the brutal incidents witnessed during the war-
 
 
 136
 torn period of 1989-1990. While all parties professed to honor the Constitution,
 which is modeled on that of the United States, the document's human rights provi-
 sions were often selectively ignored and unevenly applied. Some IGNU security per-
 sonnel, including members ol the Special Antiterrorist Unit, and, to a much lesser
 extent, individual ECOMOG soldiers, committed excesses while responding to the
 wave of violent crimes which affected Monrovia during the year. All of the warrin$
 factions-the NPFL being the most frequent and egregious offender-were impli-
 cated in serious human rights violations, e.g., use of excessive force, arbitrary deten-
 tions, forced conscription, torture, or summary executions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Numerous cases of extrajudicial kill-
 ing were reported. While professing adherence to the rule of law, the NPFL leader-
 ship permitted and even encouraged such acts. Credible reports indicated that
 scores of IGNU officials and employees were summarily executed because of their
 affiliation with the Interim Government when the NPFL attacked Monrovia's outly-
 ing suburbs in October. During this period, five American citizen nuns were killed
 by NPFL troops in a Monrovia suburb. The NPFL was also accused of executing ci-
 vilians who had been forcibly moved from the Monrovia suburbs to military camps
 in NPFL territory. In August NPFL leader Charles Taylor was widely reported to
 have ordered approximate  50 NFL members to be summarily executed following
 an aborted coup attempt. There were frequent and credible reports throughout the
 year that the NFL summarily executed dozens of men alleged to be ULIMO infil-
 trators. Several NPFL soldiers, including four or five high-ranking officers, were ex-
 ecuted without trial in September for desertion or suspicion of collaborating with
 ULIMO. At Buchanan in March, thousands protested the execution of six men by
 NPFL troops.
 Few NPFL soldiers were arrested in 1992 for committing extrajudicial killings,
 and reportedly most of those were released without trial or punishment. However,
 one high-ranking NPFL officer, Sam Larto, was executed in February after being
 convicted in a secret court martial for killing a captured INPFL soldier. INPFL lead-
 er Prince Johnson admitted executing at least two soldiers of his own movement,
 including INPFL Deputy Chief of Stf Gbomi Toma, for possessing IGNU five-dollar
 notes which Johnson declared illegal on his Caldwell base. There were unconfirmed
 reports that Johnson killed several other soldiers for relatively minor infractions of
 "military law" or insubordination. However, the INPFL leader maintained that sol-
 diers were executed only after having been tried and found guilty under INPFL
 military procedures. Nonetheless, details of the purported trials were never made
 public.
 The IGNU publicly condemned all forms of extrajudicial and political killings.
 However, afer the NFL attacked Monrvia in October, renegade elements in the
 AFL (which is under some degree of IGNU control), sometimes in cooperation with
 ULIMO, formed vigilante squads which reportedly engaged in ethnic score-settling
 by summarily executing several members of the Nian ommunity susted o 
 NPFL or   FL affiliations. (Nimbans were beieved to predominate in the NPFL
 and INPFUL.) Two AFL soldiers faced courts-martial for killing civilians in Novem-
 ber. One of the soldiers was executed after being convicted in a 1-day trial and the
 trial of the other was delayed. When ULIMO captured Bomi County from the NPFL
 in August, ULIMO irregulars summarily executed several civilians for allegedly
 being   NPFL collaborators or housin F soldiers. In many instances the civil-
 ians had been intimidated into assisting or providing quarters to the NPL fighters
 when its fighters controlled the area.
 b. Disappearance.Disappearances were not believed to be common during the
 itarst 9 months of 1992, but t ere were several reports (of varying degrees of credibil-
 ity) of young men disappa.ing while in the custody of the NPFL or ULIMO, pos-
 sibly victims of forced conscenption or execution. Very little new information surfaced
 about persons missing as a result of the war. Incidents of disappearance signifi-
 cantly increased after the October 15 NPFL attack on Monrovia. Hundeds of subur-
 ban residents could not be led   ee     are credible reports that numbers were
 unwillingly moved to sites in NPFL territory. Others are feared to have been killed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-N
 The Liberian Constitution prohibits torture an d degrading treatment. While not at-
 taining the same level as that of the civil war period, serious incidents of inhuman
 treatment persisted in 1992. NPFL troops, during the attack on Monrovia in Octo-
 ber, were reported to have forcibly abducted scores of Monrovia area residents, in-
 cluding several hundred orphaned children, relocating them  in NPFL military
 
 
 137
 camps. Human rights activists reported that escapees from these camps have al-
 leged physical and psychological mistreatment and squalid conditions--inadequate
 food, shelter, and medical care. Credible reports indicated that several persons may
 have died of starvation or lack of medical care at these locations.
 NPFL soldiers were widely accused of severely beating and torturing persons sus-
 pected of being ULIMO operatives. Civilian travelers were frequently the victims of
 mistreatment and extortion at the hands of NPFL fighters at the numerous NPFL
 checkpoints along the country's major roadways. Civilians, even several high rank-
 ingNPRAG officials, were harassed or physically abused at these checkpoints, often
 by teenage or younger boys attempting to extort money or confiscate property. Some
 civilians were beaten or forced to disrobe; many others suffered threats of violence
 or other forms of intimidation.
 There were credible reports that NPFL personnel operated involuntary labor
 camps in Grand Gedeh County and subjected inmates to severe beatings for refusing
 to work or for attempting to escape. NPFL leader Charles Taylor publicly con-
 demned harassment of civilians, but there is evidence that many guilty NPFL sol-
 diers were not disciplined for these abuses. The NPFL leadership seemed to have
 the capacity to deter excesses but chose to discipline offending troops only when ex-
 pedient. NPFL leaders, after a ma or conference of their supporters in late April at
 which attendees complained of NPFL harassment of civilians, arrested two generals
 and demoted other officers for mistreating inhabitants of Grand Gedeh County. It
 is unclear whether the two generals were tried.
 In January INPFL leader Prince Johnson detained Isaac Bantu, President of the
 Press Union of Liberia, and another journalist for several days. The journalists were
 held in a crude, unlit one-room cell without sanitary facilities. They were shackled
 and subjected to physical and psychological abuse; Johnson reportedly aimed a pis-
 tol at Bantu's head, threatening to kill him. The journalists were released onl a  r
 pressure from prominent Liberians and the international community. In another in-
 cident, credible sources claim that Prince Johnson shot a young INPFL soldier for
 wearing a red bandana, a color which Johnson associated with the rival NPFL.
 Reliable sources claimed that, in several instances, IGNU police beat criminal sus-
 pects in their custody. Credible sources also allege that ECOMOG soldiers were oc-
 casionally seen mistreating criminal suspects as well as harassing individuals at
 ECOMOG checkpoints in Monrovia. Methodist Bishop Arthur Kulah, a Nimban, was
 beaten on at least two occasions, publicly humiliated, and harassed by AFL troops
 who alleged he was collaborating with the NPFL.
 Conditions in the nation's jails were hazardous to life and health prior to the civil
 war and were even more dismal in the mostly makeshift jails of 1992. Prisoners
 were often denied medical care or contact with family; cells or rooms were small,
 crowded, and filthy. Detainees were often housed with convicted criminals. Inad-
 equate diet and lack of time outside cells were widespread problems. The IGNU has
 not given prison reform a high priority, and there has been little, if any, attempt
 to discipline the guard force. owever, prison conditions on the INPFL Caldwell
 Base and in NPFL territory were more severe, according to credible sources. The
 INPFL held its prisoners in makeshift, substandard cells; cell guards and senior
 INPFL officials, including Prince Johnson, allegedly tortured them frequently. Some
 prisoners were held incommunicado, and access to medical attention was often de-
 nied. Similar allegations of inhuman treatment of prisoners have been leveled at the
 NPFL. Reports indicate that detainees often were held in crude, makeshift facilities
 rather than in regular prisons or jails. Arbitrary beatings and torture were reported
 to be common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1985 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrests, but in the aftermath of the war, there were few functioning institu-
 tional safeguards preventing the practice. The Constitution provides for the rights
 of the accused, including warrants for arrests and the right of detainees either to
 be charged or to be released within 48 hours. These provisions were widely ignored.
 IGNU President Sawyer repeatedly has affirmed that his administration would re-
 spect the 1985 Constitution's procedural safeguards, and in practice he has at-
 tempted to do so. However, administrative inefficiency, delays in appointing judges
 and poorly trained criminal justice personnel resulted in some detainees beingheld
 for long periods without trial or charges. In practice, police officers had wide discre-
 tion to make arrests and this authority was often abused. Arrests regularly took
 place without probabie cause. Some human rights monitors reported that police offi-
 cers often disregarded the rights of detainees. At times they did not inform detain-
 ees of the charges against them. Police occasionally coerced confessions from persons
 illegally detained. Additionally, detentions by the ECOMOG peacekeepers did not
 always satisfy constitutional standards.
 
 
 138
 Liberian criminal procedure provides the right to bail, and the bail system func-
 tioned relatively welf in Monrovia. The law also allows for the writ of habeas corpus,
 which at times was employed, as in March when a noted human rights attorney se-
 cured the release of two clients implicated in, but not formally charged with, the
 homicide of a former INPFL official.
 Arbitrary arrests were commonplace in NPFL territory. NPFL soldiers and police
 officers had almost unbridled power to make warrantless arrests, and they often ex-
 ercised that power capriciously. Hundreds of persons reportedly were detained on
 spurious grounds or without charge for periods ranging from several hours to sev-
 eral weeks. Throughout the year, the PFL forcibly detained Liberian nationals,
 several foreign national relief workers, and missionaries, often accusing them of
 being spies.
 Detainees in NPFL territory were most often not informed of their legal rights.
 The right to habeas corpus remained suspended, and access to bail was basically
 unavailable. A Monrovia-based, attorney was detained for several days simply for
 raising an objection in an NPFL court.
 Credible sources indicated that the INPFL periodically detained persons on vague
 or spurious charges. The detention of press union President Isaac Bantu gained the
 most notoriety, but the INPFL also detained at least two IGNU police officers who
 had entered the INPFL base to investigate a crime committed in Monrovia. The
 INPFL had no regular police force or court system. Bail and habeas corpus were
 unavailable. Release depended primarily on the whim of INPFL leader Johnson,
 who could at times be innuenced by the intervention of important persons or organi-
 zations.
 Continuing a practice begun last year, undisciplined elements of the AFL periodi-
 cally detained and beat former NPFL fighters who had deserted to Monrovia, as
 well as civilians deemed to be "NPFL sympathizers." After the NPFL's attack on
 Monrovia, the AFL and IGNU security forces detained well over 100 NPFL fighters.
 Some detainees may have been killed or mistreated. Many detentions were without
 probable cause and were based on ethnic discrimination. Several prisoners were de-
 tained because of body scarification identifying them with certain ethnic groups. In
 December the AFL announced that it had released 100 detainees.
 During the year, there were no reported instances of any Liberians being sub-
 jected to forcedexile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Liberia's legal system is closely modeled on that
 of the United States, with the Supreme Court at its apex. Before the civil war, the
 system afforded little protection in practice for defendants, because of corruption
 among court officials lack of training, and executive interference. By mid-1990, the
 system had completely collapsed along with the rest of civil authority, with justice
 in the hands of military commanders of the warring factions.
 In 1991 the IGNU slowly began to reconstitute the court system in the Monrovia
 area. It reestablished several magistrate courts in Monrovia, and swore into office
 new circuit court judges. In September 1992, the only court with jurisdiction to hear
 theft cases was finally reestablished. The right to due process and a public trial was
 respected in Monrovia, but corruption in the judiciary was a recurrent problem cited
 by human rights monitors, the press, and members of the bar. The AFL formed
 boards of inquiry to investigate civilians suspected of collaborating with the NPFL.
 Proceedings were not public, and adherance to due process could not be confirmed.
 Under the auspices of the ECOWAS peace process, the IGNU and the NPFL
 agreed on the creation of a five-member ad hoc Supreme Court in September 1991.
 In March 1992, the NPRAG and IGNU agreed that the Court should have the full
 jurisdiction provided by the Constitution for the Supreme Court, and it began hear-
 ing cases.
 Although the NPFL also partially reactivated the court system in areas under its
 control, in practice legal and judicial protections were almost totally lacking. There
 were reports that the NPFL authorities unilaterally imposed capital punishment for
 alleged armed thefts. Those who were tried by the courts were not always guaran-
 teed fundamental fairness. Human rights observers questioned the independence of
 the judiciary in NPFL territory.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Serious
 abuses of privacy by soldiers of all of the warring factions continued in 1992. AFL
 soldiers committed many robberies in the Monrovia area. ULIMO and AFL soldiers
 commandeered vehicles and engaged in widespread looting in suburban areas aban-
 doned after the NPFL attackcd Monrovia in October. They continued illegally to oc-
 cupy some private homes. NPFL irregulars also engaged in looting in the Monrovia
 suburbs which came under their temporary control during the attack.
 The situation regarding interference with person or property in NPFL territory
 was abysmal. Throughout NPFL territory, but particularly in the western counties,
 
 
 NPFL soldiers regularly demanded food and personal possessions from village resi-
 dents and often robbed and physically abused citizens, particularly at checkpoints.
 Confiscation of private homes and vehicles was common. To escape the harassment,
 many Liberians moved their families to remote areas. INPFL soldiers guarding the
 entrance to the Caldwell Base, where several thousand civilians live, also extorted
 money and abused people.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Following the November 1990 cease-fire, fighting between the warring fac-
 tions declined, but the ULIMO offensive and the NPFL response in western Liberia
 in late Auust 1992 threatened a return to generalized, and possibly ethnically
 based, hostilities. While the Krahn/Mandingo-influenced ULIMO and the Gio/Mano-
 dominated NPFL skirmished in western Liberia, both groups caused more harm to
 noncombatants than to each other as they indiscriminately ransacked villages,
 abused populations, and confiscated scant fcod supplies. Although reports of NPFL
 abuses were more numerous, credible sources claimed that both ULIMO and the
 NPFL executed innocent civilians, usually young men, on the mere suspicion that
 the victims belonged to the rival group. Because ULIMO was based in Sierra Leone,
 the NPFL particularly mistreated the Sierra Leonean refugees living in western Li-
 beria.
 In August over 20,000 persons fled to Monrovia to escape the ULIMO-NPFL fight-
 ing and mistreatment from both sides. There were credible reports that the NPFL
 killed scores of civilians during counterattacks in September against ULIMO posi-
 tions in Bomi County. Several unconfirmed estimates placed the cumulative death
 toll from these attacks at close to 400 persons. The depradations in August were
 a prelude to the October 15 NPFL attack on Monrovia. There were credible reports
 that the NPFL troops plundered several villages and engaged in other abuses.
 IGNU claimed that in some areas NPFL troops went from house to house in a fren-
 zy of violence, executing hundreds of civilians. Five American citizen nuns were
 killed by NPFL troops during fighting on the outskirts of Monrovia. Human rights
 activists report that the NPFL also took hundreds of civilian hostages, and scores
 of persons were missing and feared dead.
 The NPFL was not the only faction guilty of abuses. Both ULIMO and AFL troops
 executed civilians. There were also credible reports of AFL and ULIMO squads
 targeting former NPFL and INPFL members living in Monrovia. Nighttime bands
 of AFL and ULIMO fighters also went from house to house in search of persons
 from Nimba County who became objects of harassment and mistreatment. One
 human rights group, citing credible sources, alleged that AFL troops summarily exe-
 cuted captured or surrendering NPFL fighters. After fighting broke out on October
 15, ECOMOG Alpha jets struck NPFL targets in several cities upcountry, causing
 collateral damage and an unknown number of civilian casualties.
 Some of the worst humanitarian offenses occurred in Grand Gedeh County where
 Gio and Mano fighters in the NPFL continued to punish their ethnic rivals, the
 Krahns. In January between 1,000 and 3,000 persons fled to Cote D'Ivoire for
 safehaven, and thousands more fled into the bush as the NPFL plundered their vil-
 lages.
 Several credible sources accused high ranking NPFL officers of operating involun-
 tary labor camps, resulting in the de facto imprisonment of scores of Grand
 Gedeans. Acknowledging the abuses, Charles Taylor in May dispatched a trusted
 NPFL official to enforce discipline among the NPFL soldiers in the area, and reports
 of abuses diminished. However, credible sources contended that after September the
 NPFL initiated a program of involuntary conscription, including children, in Nimba
 County and southeastern Liberia. According to these sources, persons who refused
 to oindthe NPFL were beaten and tortured, as were local government officials who
 refse     implement the conscription program. Many of the young NPFL troops
 sent to attack Monrovia in mid-October were given amphetamine drugs by NPFL
 commanders. NPFL soldiers also impeded the work of the relief organizations pro-
 viding emergency assistance in NPF L territory. In August a Liberian employee of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was killed, and the ICRC del-
 egate to Liberia was seriously wounded in an ambush, reportedly by NPFL soldiers,
 in Bomi County.
 Throughout the year, dozens of Liberian employees of relief organizations, includ-
 ing the United Nations, were detained; some were beaten or threatened. A few for-
 eign relief workers also were detained, but mostly for short periods. Occasionally,
 NPFL soldiers tried to confiscate relief supplies from relief workers; more com-
 monly, soldiers confiscated relief food after the humanitarian groups had distributed
 it. In September the NPFL seized 10,000 pounds of rice from U.N. stocks in Grand
 Gedeh County. Throughout the year, NPFL leader Charles Taylor publicly stated
 
 
 his desire to cooperate with the relief community, and in midyear, he took several
 steps to improve NPFL relations with the organizations.
 Askirmish between Senegalese ECOMOG troops and the NPFL in Lofa County
 in late May ended in the deaths of six ECOMOG and an undetermined number of
 NPFL soldiers. According to ECOMOG, autopsies of the killed Senegalese soldiers
 revealed that two or more were perhaps tortured.
 Throughout the year, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), an organization of
 Sierra Leonean dissidents, occupied or controlled areas along the Sierra Leonean
 border. Credible sources reported that the RUF, backed by the NPFL, committed
 many human rights infractions against Liberians and Sierra Leonean refugees.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for in the Con-
 stitution and, with some limitations, were generally exercised in Monrovia, but
 there were substantial limitations elsewhere. Monrovia had more than 12 privately
 owned newspapers, 3 to 5 of which published regularly. The Interim Government
 introduced its own paper, The Liberian Times, in June. There was no official press
 censorship in Monrovia, nor were any newspapers closed during the year. However,
 the Monrovia press tended to be pro-IGNU, and some journalists admitted practic-
 ing self-censorship. Other journalists asserted that constant public calls by IGNU
 officials for a "more responsible" press had a chillingeffect on journalistic freedom.
 At times, journalists were requested to meet with IGNU officials who had been of-
 fended by articles. Most of The Eye newspaper's editorial staff was arrested in Au-
 gust and sued in connection with an article alleging that a high-ranking IGNU offi-
 cial had threatened them. The case was settled out of court through the intervention
 of the Press Union of Liberia (PUL), a human rights organization, and the Informa-
 tion Ministry. The Eye had experienced two arson attempts in June.
 In November IGNU ordered that the Ministry of Information edit all news articles
 regarding the fighting around Monrovia which contained information about
 ECOMOG troop positions and numbers. While most journalists did not oppose the
 measure, a reputable journalist said that the Information Ministry had occasionally
 overstepped its authority by significantly editing articles. Until its disintegration,
 the INPFL sponsored an occasional newspaper, The Scorpion. The record of INPFL
 regarding freedom of the press was not good. It detained the PUL President and
 a colleague for several days because Prince Johnson felt the press was treating him
 unfairly (see Section 1.c.). On several occasions, Johnson threatened reporters for
 publishing unfavorable articles about him.
 The NPFL printed a newspaper, The Patriot. During the year, several privately
 owned newspapers appeared in Gbarnga, capital of NPFL-controlled territory. Some
 of these papers, however, were dependent on the NPFL Information Ministry print-
 ing presses and relied on the Ministry for newsprint. These papers were decidedly
 pro-NPFL, and self-censorship was apparent. Sme journalists voiced complaints
 that the NPFL Information Ministry stifled press freedom. Criticism of Charles Tay-
 lor and NPFL military efforts were not allowed. In July two journalists were tried
 b a aeia tribunal for publishing reports of NPFL military setbacks at the hands
 of ULIMO, but the outcome of the proceedings was never publicized. Journalists
 from Monrovia experienced difficulty in covering events in NPFL areas and often
 had to seek approval from the NPFL before traveling there. The NPFL impeded dis-
 tribution of Monrovia-based newspapers in its territory, and the IGNU reciprocated
 against some of the newspapers from NPFL territory.
 Residents of Liberia had to exercise care in their criticism of the various factions.
 Although NPFL leader Charles Taylor affirmed publicly on several occasions that
 his government supported free speech and criticism, both Liberians and foreign na-
 tionals were detained by his supporters for comments about the NPFL.
 The IGNU, in addition to supporting a shortwave radio station (ELBC), inaugu-
 rated FM broadcasts in early 1992. ELBC news reports were generally favorable to
 the IGNU. A Christian-operated FM radio station also broadcast from the Monrovia
 area. The NPFL operated thiee radio and two television stations in its area. NPFL
 news program supported Charles Taylor and the NPFL, while discussing economic
 and social conditions in NPFL territory.
 The University of Liberia, after along hiatus, reopened in the first half of the
 year but had to close because of the renewed fighting. While it was open, academic
 freedom was generally respected, although ro-NPFL expresssion was strongly criti-
 cized by university authonties and most of the student body.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides the
 rights of peaceful assembly and association. In Monrovia, political parties and other
 groups were able to organize and to hold public meetings.New political organiza-
 tions such as the Labor Party and National Reformation Party appeared, but the
 
 
 141
 National Patriotic Party, the political affiliate of the NPFL, was prohibited from lo-
 cating its headquarters in Monrovia. Several civic groups held peaceful demonstra-
 tions, some critical of IGNU. In July a group of taxi drivers blocked an important
 Monrovia thoroughfare in protest over rising gasoline prices. Neither the IGNU nor
 ECOMOG attempted forcibly to disband the demonstrators. However, in May
 ECOMOG restricted a peaceful demonstration of 1,000 to 1,500 NPFL supporters
 to the outskirts of Monrovia and refused to allow the demonstration into the central
 city. In late June, ECOMOG also prevented Prince Johnson from exiting his base
 to lead a demonstration calling for IGNU President Sawyer's removal. ECOMOG
 said that it quashed the demonstration because of the high probability of violence.
 In October ECOMOG, with IGNU concurrence, imposed a nighttime curfew in Mon-
 rovia because of the insecure conditions caused by the fighting. ECOMOG soldiers
 were ordered to enforce the measure strictly, and numerous persons were arrested
 for noncompliance. AFL soldiers have reportedly wounded several citizens for break-
 ing the curfew.
 The freedoms of assembly and association were generally more restricted in NPFL
 areas than in Monrovia. None of the prewar political parties was known to have
 held public meetings in NPFL areas. However, the NPFL did sponsor four con-
 ferences of tribal leaders, political party officials, and leaders of numerous civic or-
 g anizations. Although the events were fashioned to be pro-NPFL, several influential
 Monrovians attended some of the meetings, and some criticism of the NPFL was ex-
 pressed, particularly regarding the mistreatment of civilians by NPFL soldiers. In
 march several NPFL officials were assaulted in Buchanan by protesters (see Section
 L.a.), who dispersed peacefully only after NPRAG/NPFL leader Charles Taylor vis-
 ited the city and promised to restore discipline to the troops there.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1985 Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as
 a fundamental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. Christianity has
 long been the religion of the political and economic elite, while the majority of the
 population has continued to follow traditional religions or to practice a mixture of
 traditional religions and Christianity or Islam. There were no evident efforts by the
 various warring factions to suppress religious freedom, although Mandingos, who
 are predominantly Muslim, were targeted by the NPFL as sympathetic to President
 Doe during the civil war and in 1992 were mistreated by the NPFL as suspected
 supporters of ULIMO.
 dFreedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Immigration and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout Liberia
 as well as the right to leave or enter the country at will. Freedom of movement in
 and out of Monrovia was generally respected by IGNU in 1992. However IGNU re-
 portedly refused some NPRAG officials the right to depart Liberia througi the Mon-
 rovia airport. Throughout the year, freedom of movement, ranging from resettle-
 ment of displaced persons to ordinary commerce and travel was inhibited in NPFL
 territory because of extortion and harassment by unruly soliers.
 ULIMO-NPFL clashes in western Liberia and arbitrary confiscation of private ve-
 hicles also were strong deterrents to internal travel. While over 20,000 Liberians
 fled to Monrovia in August and September to escape the ULIMO-NPFL fighting in
 western Liberia, human rights groups and other credible sources stated that in Sep-
 tember the NPFL prohibited hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others from seeking
 similar refuge in Monrovia. For several months during the year, the IGNU imposed
 embargoes on shipment of goods into NPFL territory, and retaliatory actions by the
 NPFL had the practical effect of inhibiting the right to travel within the county.
 In January between 1,000 and 3 000 Krahns fled to Cote d'Ivoire to escape har-
 assment from the Gio and Mano NPFL fighters. Roughly 600,000 Liberian refugees
 remained in neighboring West African countries, many out of fear of ethnic discrimi-
 nation. While accurate figures of refugee repatriation are difficult to confirm, up to
 80,000 Liberians may have spontaneously returned since June 1991. Most of these
 returnees went to Monrovia, where they were well received and were provided as-
 sistance by a network consisting of the U.N. agencies, the IGNU, and international
 and domestic nongovernmental relief groups.
 There are approximately 100,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Liberia. Although
 many Sierra Leoneans were mistreated by the NPFL, there were no reports of such
 refugees being forced to leave Liberia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional and legal guarantees of free and fair elections, Liberians
 could not exercise the right to change their government in 1992. Under the auspices
 of ECOWAS, the NPFL and the IGNU established an ad hoc elections commission
 in 1991 with a mandate to organize presidential and national legislative elections
 
 
 142
 in 1992. However, the elections commission made little progress toward holding
 elections, primarily because of the failure of the warring factions to disarm.
 There was some limited activity in the search for new political formulas to restore
 unity under a popularly elected leadership. The NPRAG and IGNU exchanged pro-
 posals aimed at forming joint executive branch commissions, but there was little fol-
 lowup. The legislatures of the NPRAG and the IGNU periodically considered merg-
 ing, but no progress was achieved. The IGNU remained a coalition Government
 comprised of the major prewar political parties. Power in the IGNU mainly resides
 in the executive branch, led by President Amos Sawyer, and not in the legislature
 or the judiciary. The NPRAG also had three separate branches of government. But
 unlike the coalition-based IGNU, Charles Taylor is the NPRAG'S unquestioned lead-
 er and decisionmaker.
 Neither the legislature in Monrovia nor that in Gbarnga was truly representative.
 However, the Interim Legislature in Monrovia at times asserted its role as a sepa-
 rate branch of government, both confirming and rejecting important IGNU ap-
 pointees following public confirmation hearings. It also subpoenaed members of the
 executive branch to explain actions of the Interim Government. While the NPRAG
 legislature was generally subservient to its party leadership views, it too rejected
 a few NPRAG appointments. The NPRAG held legislative and county elections in
 NPFL teritory, and although some incumbents were not returned to office, few de-
 tails were available on the fairness of the exercise.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The few human rights organizations in Liberia are relatively new, underfunded,
 and inexperienced. These rups conducted some public meetings and other activi-
 ties but engaged in ver little human rights monitoring. Two groups occasionally
 published newspapers dedicated to human rights. None of the organizations re-
 ported any IGNU interference with their activities. The attitude of the NPRAG to-
 ward the human rights organizations was less clearly enunciated, and its conduct
 to date has not been encouraging. Some Monrovia-based activists feared for their
 personal safety, claiming that the NPFL had accused them of being IGNU agents.
 Rey also alleged that the NPFL placed significant restrictions on their travel in
 NPFL territory. There was one human rights organization based in NPFL territory,
 but it did not appear to be active or effective.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The roots of the civil conflict can be found in the historical division between, on
 the one hand, the Americo-Liberians, who for over 150 years dominated the politi-
 cal, economic, and cultural life of the country, and on the other hand, the indigenous
 ethnic groups. The latter frequently complained of government discrimination in
 many areas, such as access to education and civil service 'obs and to infrastructure
 development. The coup mounted by Sergeant Doe and other noncommissioned offi-
 cers in 1980 was seen as a revolution, with indigenous groups taking power from
 the Americo-Liberian elite. However, Doe's authoritarian military-based regime pro-
 gressively exacerbated ethnic tensions while subverting the democratic reforms em-
 bodied in the 1985 Constitution.
 During the Doe regime, resentment grew over domination by and government fa-
 voritism toward, his tribe, the Krahns. At the height of the civif war, an individual's
 language was used to identify that person's ethnic group. Those from groups consid-
 ered hostile frequently were summarily executed. The cease-fire in late 1990 stopped
 most of these abuses. However, NPFL reprisals against the Krahn, particularly in
 Grand Gedeh, and against Mandings throughout NPFL territory, continued to
 occur, and harassment of rival ethnic groups by Krahn AFL troops in Monrovia re-
 sumed when fighting broke out in mid-Octbr (see Section 1.g.).
 The 1985 Constitution prohibited discrimination based on ethnic background,
 race, sex, creed, place of origin, or political opinion. However, it also provided that
 only "persons who are Negies or of Negro descent" may be citizens or own land,
 thus denying full rights to many who have lived all their lives in Liberia. Neither
 Monrovia's ?nterim Government nor Gbarnga's NPRAG have considered repealing
 this racial test.
 The status of women in Liberian society varies by region, ethnic group, and reli-
 gion. Some women currently hold skilled jobs, including cabinet-level positions in
 both the IGNU and NPFL governments. In 1991 and 1992, several women's organi-
 zations were established in Monrovia and Gbarnga to advance family welfare issues,
 to help promote political reconciliation, and to assist in rehabilitating former com-
 batants as well as civilian victims of war. In urban areas and along the coast,
 women can inherit land and property. In rural areas, where traditional customs are
 
 
 143
 stronger, a woman is normally considered the property of her husband and his clan
 and is not usually entitled to inherit from her husband.
 Women in most rural areas are responsible for much of the farm labor and have
 had only limited access to education. According to a recent U.N. study, females in
 Liberia receive only about 28 percent of the schooling given to males. In the massive
 violence inflicted on civilians during the conflict, women suffered the gamut of
 abuses, and especially rape. Even prior to the war, domestic violence against women
 was extensive but never was seriously addressed as an issue by the Government or
 women's groups. Female genital mutilation (circumcision) was, and almost certainly
 still is, widely practiced, particularly in some rural areas. According to an independ-
 ent expert in the field the percentage of Liberian women who have undergone this
 procedure may be as high.as 60 percent. Young children are sometimes compelled
 to perform military service (see Section 6.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers have the right
 to associate in trade unions. Unions are constitutionally prohibited from partisan
 political activity, and the restriction has been observed in practice. Government in-
 terference in union activities, especially elections and leadership conflicts, was cus-
 tomary before the war. Over 20 trade unions, representing about 15 percent of the
 wage-earning work force, were registered with the Ministry of Labor before 1989.
 More than ten national unions were members of the Liberian Federation of Labor
 Unions (LFLU). However, the actual power the unions exercised was always slight.
 Like virtually all other organized activity in the country, unions disappeared dur-
 ing the height of the war. As some large-scale operations involving rubber and other
 extractive industries began operating in NPFL areas in 1991 and 1992, some union
 activity associated with these industries also resumed. In at least one instance, an
 incumbent union withstood a challenge from another group seeking to represent the
 workers at a major extractive operation in NPFL territory. Union activity also re-
 sumed in Monrovia, with much of it focusing on resolving prewar internal leader-
 ship questions. Labor unions traditionally were affiliated with international labor
 groups before the war, and many of these ties were resumed in 1992.
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under the United States'
 Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was suspended in 1990 as a re-
 sult of the Doe Government's failure to take steps to provide internationally recog-
 nized worker rights. For example, the Doe regime did not recognize the right of civil
 servants or employees of public corporations to unionize or strike. During 1992 the
 IGNU legislature worked toward, but did not enact, an amended labor code remv-
 ingthe prohibition against unionization of government workers.
 Neither the IGNU nor the NPRAG officially repealed or affirmed the 1980 Doe
 Government decree prohibiting strikes, but there were no major strikes in 1992.
 However, there were several work slowdowns (some by IGNU civil servants) because
 of late or partial wage payments. Workers in the extractive industries conducted
 slowdowns and also threatened work stoppags in protest over some companies'
 slowness or failure to comply with the NPRAG's requirement for wage payments in
 United States currency instead of Liberian dollars. During the year, neither IGNU
 nor NPRAG took any discriminatory actions against organized labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-With the important exception
 of civil servants and employees of public corporations, workers enjoy the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. However, in 1992 these rights were significantly
 constrained by the institutional breakdown of unions caused by the war and the low
 level of economic activity. With high unemployment and lay-offs being fundamental
 concerns, several unions negotiated with employers severance payments for union
 members who had become redundant. Generally, the wage and severance pay agree-
 meats are negotiated freely between labor and their employers, with occasional
 input from the IGNU or NPRAG Labor Ministry.
 Although the Interim Legislature deliberated the merits of a revised labor code,
 neither the Interim Government nor the NPRAG took steps to correct flaws high-
 lighted by the 1990 report of the International Labor Organization (ILO). That re-
 port stated that existing labor laws failed to provide workers adequate protection
 against discrimination and reprisals for union activity, failed to protect workers' or-
 ganizations against outside interference, and did not give eligible workers in the
 public sector the opportunity to bargain collectively.
 Labor laws have the same force in Liberia's one export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas, where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 
 
 projects" which often benefited only local leaders. Forced labor was used by some
 or all of the warring factions during the civil war, especially for moving equipment
 and supplies. Vestiges of this p)ractice persisted in 1992. NPFL officers established
 forced labor camps and farms in Grand Gedeh County. According to several sources,
 the NPFL reportedly used forced labor in western Liberia to move supplies in the
 wake of clashes with ULIMO. When it captured Bomi County in August, ULIMO
 reportedly forced inhabitants to carry property that had been confiscated as spoils
 of war.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Doe Government, the
 law prohibited employment of children under age 16 during school hours in the
 wage sector. Enforcement by the Ministry of Labor, however, was limited. Even be-
 fore the civil war, small children continued to assist their parents as vendors in
 local markets and on family subsistence farms. This practice persisted in 1992, par-
 ticularly in those areas where schools had been closed because of the war. During
 the conflict, the NPFL and the INPFL recruited young children as soldiers; many
 of them had been orphaned, and some were less than 12 years of age. Many of these
 children, especially in the NPFL, remained under arms in 1992. (Indeed, the NPFL
 had a unit named the "Small Boys Unit.") To help counter the ULIMO offensive in
 western Liberia, the NPFL was believed to have recruited additional soldiers, in-
 cluding children, in the latter half of 1992. Many of the young NPFL troops sent
 to attack Monrovia in mid-October were given mood-alteri  drugs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The labor law provids for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards. Before the economy collapsed,
 the legal minimum wage varied according to profession but did not generally pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Often workers were forced
 to supplement their incomes through other activities to maintain a minimal stand-
 ard of living. Most turned to subsistence farming. The wage limit has not always
 been enforced adecuately by the Labor Ministry.  n mid-1992, the NPRAG ordered
 that all extractive industries pay workers at least partly in U.S. dollars. The meas-
 ure effectively increased the workers' salaries due to the variance between the offi-
 cial and black market exchange rates. Prior to 1990, there had also been health and
 safety standards, in theory enforced by the Ministry of Labor. In view of the low
 level of economic activity during 1992, these various regulations were not obeyed by
 many employers, and there was very little attempt at enforcement in Monrovia or
 in NFL territory.
