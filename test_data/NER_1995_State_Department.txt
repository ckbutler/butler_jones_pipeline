 NIGER
 Niger was a multiparty democracy throughout the year. The elected civilian gov-
 ernment was overthrown by a military coup in January 1996. The Constitution
 under which the Government served throughout the year provides for a strong pres-
 idency, an ethnically representative Parliament (the 83-seat unicameral National
 Assembly), and an independent judiciary. Niger first held multiparty elections in
 1993; international observers judged both the presidential and legislative elections
 free and fair. When Prime Minister Mohamadou Issoufou resigned in late 1994, a
 parliamentary majority opposed to President Mahamane emerged. The President
 dissolved the National Assembly and called new elections. TI'e elections, held in
 January, were also judged free and fair by observers, and gave the opposition a
 three-seat majority, which increased following several defections late in the year.
 After failing to secure the Assembly's approval of a Prime Minister of his choice,
 the President named Hama Amadou, the opposition Movement for a National Devel-
 opment Society Party's secretary-general, to be Prime Minister. The continuing "co-
 habitation" between a directly elected President and a Prime Minister backed by a
 parliamentary coalition opposed to the President was difficult and was cited by the
 military as its major justification for overthrowing the Government. The Supreme
 Court is independent of the executive.
 A 3-year Tuareg insurgency in the north subsided with an October 1994 cease-
 fire. A formal peace accord was signed in April which called for decentralization of
 administration in northern regions, government support for northern economic de-
 velopment and grouping of rebels into special military units. In June the National
 Assembly passed a general amnesty releasing all those imprisoned for suspected or
 proven rebel activities.
 Security forces consist of the army, the gendarmerie (paramilitary police), the Re-
 publican Guard, and the national police. Despite almost two decades of military rule
 prior to 1991 the armed forces supported the transition to democratic government.
 Members of the security forces were responsible for some instances of human rights
 abuses.
 The economy is based mainly on traditional subsistence farming, herding, small
 trading, and informal markets. Uranium is the most important export. Persistent
 drought, low literacy, a declining uranium market and industrial base, and burden-
 
 
 some debt continue to weaken the economy. However, the value of livestock sales,
 the second most important export, has increased substantially due to the 1994 cur-
 rency devaluation. During the year Niger met International Monetary Fund/World
 Bank benchmarks for revenue and spending, and structural adjustment facility sup-
 port may resume.
 Reports of government troops committing human rights abuses declined mark-
 edly. Clashes between security and Tuareg rebel forces caused several deaths early
 in the year. An armed grou operating along the border with Chad accused govern-
 ment soldiers of killing civilians in retaliation for a raid against a military outpost,
 a charge the military denies. Prison conditions are poor. The overloaded judicial sys-
 tem and delays in trials resulted in long periods of pretrial confinement. Societal
 discrimination and domestic violence against women continued to be serious prob-
 lems; the de facto disenfranchisement of many women limits their right to change
 their government. Female genital mutilation persists. Labor unions freely bargained
 for wages and better working conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The peace accord signed with rebel
 Tuareg groups in October 1994 was generally respected, although clashes between
 security forces and Tuareg rebels caused several deaths early in the year. Arab mili-
 tia forces reportedly killed a Tuareg rebel leader and 13 of his fighters in July. The
 Tuareg rebel front is pressing the Government to identify and try the perpetrators.
 To date, the Government has not fulfilled its commitment in the peace accord to dis-
 arm the Arab militias. Also, an armed group operating near the border with Chad
 has accused government troops of killing civilians in retaliation for a raid against
 a military outpost. The military denies the charge.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and Penal Code prohibit torture, and there were no reports that
 authorities used it.
 Prison conditions are poor. There were reliable reports that prisons were over-
 crowded, and prisoners suffered poor nutrition, inadequate medical care, and a lack
 of facilities. The Niamey prison recently held 883 inmates in quarters built for 350,
 and authorities housed juvenile offenders with adult prisoners.
 Prisoners are housed separately by sex. Family visits are allowed, and prisoners
 can receive supplemental food and other items from their families. Nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) allege that families bribe guards for special treatment
 or privileges. NGO representatives and diplomatic personnel visited prisons during
 the year.
 d. Arbitrar Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary detention and the law prohibits detention without charge in excess of 48
 hours, police violate these provisions in practice. If police fail to gather sufficient
 evidence within the detention period, the prosecutor gives the case to another offi-
 cer, and a new 48-hour detention period begins.
 The seriously overloaded judicial system, in conjunction with the absence of statu-
 tory limits on pretrial confinement of indicted persons, results in excessively long
 detention, frequently months or longer. Pretrial confinement of up to 5 years has
 been reported. As many as 80 percent of persons in custody in Niamey are awaiting
 trial. The Government created new regional tribunals to handle civil cases on the
 local level.
 The law provides for a right to counsel, although there is only one known private
 defense attorney outside the capital. A defendant has the right to a lawyer imme-
 diately upon detention. The State provides defense attorneys for the indigent.
 Bail is available to defendants accused of crimes carrying a penalty of less than
 10 years' imprisonment. Widespread ignorance of the law and lack of financial
 means prevent full exercise of these rights by defendants.
 In 1995 the Government granted amnesty to all Tuareg detainees being held for
 suspected or confirmed rebel activities.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and there were no reports of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Supreme Court has asserted its independence. The Court showed im-
 partiality and sound interpretation of the Constitution when ruling on disputes as-
 sociated the power-sharing between the President and the Prime Minister. For ex-
 ample, followingthe January legislative elections, the Supreme Court rejected a pe-
 tition fied by the President's coalition-which at the time controlled the Govern-
 ment-to overturn the election results, ruling that allegations of massive fraud were
 
 
 not substantiated. The Court also refused to rule on what it considered strictly polit-
 ical issues related to the cohabitation.
 However, human rights groups argue that family and business ties influence the
 lower courts and undermine their integrity. Judges sometimes fear reassignment or
 having their financial benefits reduced if they render a decision unfavorable to the
 Government, although such practices are reportedly reduced.
 The legal system is based on French civil law and customary law. Within the for-
 mal court system, defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, fist to the
 court of appeals, then to the Supreme Court. The court of appeals reviews questions
 of fact an? law, while the Supreme Court reviews only the application of law and
 constitutional questions.
 A traditional chief or a customary court usually tries cases involving divorce or
 inheritance. Customary courts, located only in large towns and cities, are headed
 by a legal practitioner with basic legal education who is advised by an assessor
 knowledgeable in the society's traditions. The judicial actions of chiefs and cus-
 tomary courts are incompletely regulated by code, and defendants may appeal a ver-
 dict to the formal court system.
 Women have inferior legal status to men and do not enjoy the same access to legal
 redress (see Section 5).
 Civil and criminal trials are public except for security-related cases. The law al-
 lows the Government to constitute a State Security Court to try in secret high
 crimes against the State, but due process provisions still apply. This, however, has
 never been used. Defendants have the right to counsel, to be present at trial, to
 confront witnesses, to examine the evidence against them, and to appeal verdicts.
 The Constitution affirms the presumption of innocence.
 The law provides for counsel at public expense for minors and indigent defendants
 charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10 years or more. Although lawyers com-
 ply with government requests to provide counsel, they are generally not paid by the
 Government. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge, in order to
 conduct a search. Police may search without warrants when they have strong sus-
 picion that a house shelters criminals or stolen property. However, human rights
 organizations report that police often conduct routine searches without warrants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and establishes the Superior Council of Communication (CSC), which is
 charged with guaranteeing free and fair access to the media. The finances and exist-
 ence of small newspapers were, in recent years, occasionally threatened by official
 government lawsuits charging libel. To date, however, no newspaper has ceased
 publication, and no new suits were brought this year.
 CSC members were elected and installed in 1994, but the organization is hobbled
 by a limited budget and lack of political direction. The CSC did ensure equal access
 to the state media for all political parties during the January legislative elections.
 In mid-July the CSC sought to ban the media from reporting communiques from the
 political parties on the political conflicts associated with the contentious cohabita-
 tion of the President and Prime Minister. Protests from media, human rights, and
 labor groups that the CSC was violating its mandate and imposing censorship soon
 led the CSC to lift the ban.
 There are about a dozen private French and Hausa language newspapers and ad-
 ditional political party weeklies or monthlies. Newspapers openly criticized the Gov-
 ernment and provided access to publication for Tuareg and labor leaders. The Gov-
 ernment publishes the French language daily Le Sahel and its weekend edition.
 Foreign journals circulate and report reely. The most important public medium is
 the government-operated multilanguage national radio service, which reported on
 oppsition activities. Three independent radio stations operate in Niamey, and the
 Government granted a license to one independent television station. It was not yet
 operational.
 Academic freedom is respeted.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Although the Government routinely grants
 permits for demonstrations, it retains the authority to prohibit gatherings in what
 it considers a case of tense social onditions or if sufficient advance notice (48 hours)
 is not provided.
 Under the Constitution, citizens may form political parties of any kind, except
 those that are based on ethnicity, religion, or region.

 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this freedom in practice. Most Nigeriens practice Islam. Chris-
 tians (including Jehovah's Witnesses) and Baha'i practice freely. Foreign mission-
 aries work without interference, but must be members of an internationally recog-
 nized organization and registered as a Nigerien association.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement. Security forces at check-
 points monitor travel of persons and the circulation of goods, particularly near major
 population centers, and sometimes extort bribes. The continuing fear of rebels or
 bandits on major routes to the north severely limits movement. Neither emigration
 nor repatriation are restricted.
 Approximately 3,600 Chadian refugees have resettled in eastern Niger. In addi-
 tion, several thousand Tuaregs from Mali reportedly reside in Nier but are not offi-
 cially registered as refugees. The Government cooperates with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting
 refugees. There were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Until the military coup in January 1996, citizens had this right and exercised it
 in the legislative elections in 1995. Citizens 18 years and older can vote, and ballot-
 ing is by secret ballot. The President is directly elected and members of the National
 Assembly are elected by proportional representation for 5-year terms. The Prime
 Minister is named by the President and is subject to approval or censure by the Na-
 tional Assembly.
 Following the collapse of a coalition government in October 1994, legislative elec-
 tions in January gave majority control of the National Assembly to an opposition
 coalition headed by Hama Amadou. Amadou was named Prime Minister in Feb-
 ruary by the President.
 Women do not traditionally play a role in politics. The societal practice of hus-
 bands' voting their wives' proxy ballots effectively disenfranchises many women.
 This practice was widely used in the presidential and National Assembly elections
 in 1993, but more stringent requirements reduced the practice in 1995. Only 3 of
 83 National Assembly members are women; the Government appointed 2 women to
 ministerial positions (Education, and Social Development, Population, and Women's
 Issues). Special electoral districts are designed to ensure that minority ethnic
 groups (Toubou, Fulani, Tuareg, Kanouri, and Arabs) are represented.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several independent human rights groups and associations operate freely, pre-
 dominant among which are the Nigerien Association for the Defense of Human
 Rights, Democracy, Liberty, and Development; the National Leage for Defense of
 Human Rights; Adalci (Hausa for "dignity"); and the Network for the Integration
 and Diff'usion of Rights in the Rural Milieu (known as "Ridd-Fitla"). There are sev-
 eral active women's rights groups which, however, face difficulties (see Section 5).
 The International Committee of the Red Crss is also active.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, social ori-
 gin, or ethnicity. In practice, however, there is discrimination against women, chil-
 aren, ethnic minorities, and disabled persons, including limited economic and politi-
 cal opportunities.
 Womnen.-Domestic violence against women is widespread, although statistics are
 lacking. Wife beating is reportedly common, even in upper social strata. Families
 often intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce be-
 cause of physical mistreatment. While women have the right to seek redress in the
 customary or modern courts, few do so out of ignorance of the legal system, fear
 of social stigma, and fear of repudiation. Women's rights organizations report that
 prostitution is often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave
 her husband.
 Despite the Constitution's prvisions for women's rights, the deep-seated tradi-
 tional belief in the submission of women to men results in discrimination in the po-
 litical process (see Section 3), education, employment, and property rights. Discrimi-
 nation is worse in rural areas, where women do much of the subsistence farming
 as well as child rearing and household tasks. Among the Hausa and Fulani peoples
 in eastern Niger, some women are cloistered, and can leave their homes only lies-
 
 
 195
 corted by a male and usually only after dark. Women have made modest inroads
 in civil service and professional employment but remain severely underrepresented.
 Males have certain legal rights as heads of household, while the law does not rec-
 ognize divorced or widowed women, even with children, as heads of their house-
 holds. The Government considered a draft family code modeled on codes in other
 African Muslim countries which was intended to eliminate gender bias in inherit-
 ance rights land tenure, and child custody, as well as to end the practice of repudi-
 ation, which permits a husband to obtain an immediate divorce with no further re-
 ponsibiit   or hs wife or chldren. In June 1994, when Islamic associations con-
 dmned it, the Government suspended its discussion of the proposed code. Islamic
 militants reportedly threatened physical harm to women who supported the code.
 Many civil rights activists consider Islamic fundamentalism to be the greatest
 threat to attainment of women's rights. With the withdrawal of the draft family
 ode and increased intimidation, several women's groups lost membership and be-
 came increasingly beleaguered. iowever, the recent United Nations Fourth World
 Conference on Women and renewed activism by the female ministers in the Govern-
 ment have provided a new impetus to the morale of these groups.
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the State promote children's welfare.
 However, financial resources to do so are limited. Only about 25 percent of children
 of primary school age actually attend school and about 60 percent of those finishing
 primary school are boys. The majority of young girls are kept at home to work and
 rarely attend school for more than a few years, resulting in a female literacy rate
 of 7 percent, versus 18 percent for males. Tradition among some ethnic groups al-
 lows young girls from rural families to enter marriage agreements on the basis of
 which they are sent at the age of 10 or 12 years to join their husband's family under
 the tutelage of their mothers-in-law. There are credible reports of girls being drawn
 into prostitution sometimes with the complicity of the family.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as physically and psychologically damaging to health, is practiced by several
 ethnic groups in the extreme west and far east. While clitoridectomy is sometimes
 practiced b these two groups, the most extreme form, infibulation, is not practiced.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution mandates that the State provide for
 people with disabilities. However, the Government has yet to implement regulations
 which mandate accessibility to facilities and education for those with special needs.
 National RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou
 Kanouri, and Arab--continue to assert that the far more populous Hausa and
 Djerma ethnic groups discriminate against them. The Hausa and Djerma dominate
 business and government. The Government has supported greater minority rep-
 resentation in the National Assembly and increased education and health care tar-
 geted towards them. However, nomadic peoples, such as many Tuaregs and Fulani,
 continue to have less access to government services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides formal recognition of
 workers' longstanding rights to establish and join trade unions. However, more than
 90 percent of the work force is employed in the nonunionized subsistence agricul-
 tural, artisanal, and petty trading sectors.
 The National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN), a federation made up of 42
 unions, represents the majority of salary earners. Most are government employees:
 civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned corporations. The USTN and
 the affiliated teachers' union, the National Union of Nigerien Teachers (SNEN), pro-
 fess political autonomy, but like most unions, have informal ties to political parties.
 The International Labor Organization criticized the law requiring that all union
 management officials be citizens, asserting that this provision serves to restrict the
 exercise of the right to elect representatives in full freedom. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the right to strike, except by security forces and police.
 In 1994 the National Assembly passed a strike law specifying that labor must give
 notice and begin negotiations before work is stopped; that public workers must
 maintain a minimum level of service during a strike; that the Government can req-
 uisition workers to guarantee minimum service; and that striking public sector
 workers will not be paid for the time they are on strike. The latter condition already
 prevailed in the private sector. Prime Minister Hama Amadou's Government sus-
 pended the strike law and compensated public sector workers whose wages were re-
 duced for striking. The USTN continues to demand that the strike law be rewritten.
 The USTN orchestrated four brief general strikes during the year, as well as two
 "dead city" days in regional capitals, to buttress salary and working condition de-
 mands. SNEN also struck for 2 weeks in September, demanding payment of wages
 withheld during previous strikes. All these strikes were legal.
 
 
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions such as the teachers' union are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a basic framework agreement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, employers, and the Government which defines all classes and
 categories of work, establishes basic conditions of work, and defines union activities.
 In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use their right to bargain col-
 lectively with management, without government interference, for wages over and
 above the statutory minimum, as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collec-
 tive bargaining also exists in the public sector.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except for legally convicted prisoners. There were no reports
 of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor in nonindustrial enter-
 prises is permitted by law under certain conditions. Children under age 14 must ob-
 tain special authorization to work, and those aged 14 to 18 years are subject to limi-
 tation on hours (a maximum of 4.5 hours per day) and types of employment (no in-
 dustrial work) so that schooling may continue. Minimum compulsory education is
 6 years, but fewer than half of school-age children complete 6 years of education.
 The law requires employers to ensure minimum sanitary working conditions for
 children. Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors enforce child labor laws. Child labor is practically nonexistent in the for-
 mal (wage) sector, although children work in the unregulated agricultural, commer-
 cial, and artisan sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code establishes a minimum wage
 for salaried workers of each class and category within the formal sector. The lowest
 minimum wage is approximately $38 (cfa 20,500) per month. Additional salary is
 granted for each family member and for such working conditions as night shifts and
 required travel. Minimum wages are not sufficient to provide a decent living for
 workers and their families. Most households have multiple earners (largely informal
 commerce) and rely on the extended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours with a minimum of one 24-hour rest period. How-
 ever, for certain occupations the Ministry of Labor authorizes longer workweeks--
 up to 72 hours. There were no reports of violations.
 The Labor Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards; Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors enforce these standards. Due to staff shortages, however,
 inspectors focus on safety violations only in the most dangerous industries: mining,
 building, and manufacturing. Although generally satisfied with the safety equip-
 ment provided by employers, citing in particular adequate protection from radiation
 in the uranium mines, unions say workers should be better informed of the risks
 posed by their jobs. Workers have the right to remove themselves from hazardous
 conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
