 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The reigning Prince is the Head of State; all legislation enacted by the
 popularly elected Parliament (Landtag) must have his concurrence. The Landtag
 elects and the Prince appoints the members of the Government and of the function-
 ally independent judiciary. The Constitution authorizes the Prince to alter criminal
 sentences or pardon offenders; however, if the offender is a member of the Govern-
 ment and is sentenced for violating an official duty, the Prince can take such action
 only if the Landtag requests it.
 The Interior Ministry effectively oversees the regular and auxiliary police forces.
 There is no standing military force.
 Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed
 during recent decades from an agrarian society into a prosperous, highly industri-
 alized free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector. It participates in a cus-
 toms union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. As
 a result of complex negotiations held with member states of the European Economic
 Area and Switzerland, and a national referendum held in April, Liechtenstein is si-
 multaneously a member of the European Economic Area. Citizens enjoy a very high
 standard of living. Unemployment was only 0.9 percent in 1995.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens provided for in the
 Constitution, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with in-
 stances of individual abuse. Domestic violence against women is not a problem; ex-
 isting societal discrimination against women is being eliminated in accordance with
 government policy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel punishment, and there were no reports of the
 use of such methods.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, and the authorities honor these provisions. Within 24
 hours of arrest, the police must bring the suspect before an examining magistrate,
 who must either press formal charges or order release. The law grants suspects the
 right to legal counsel of their own choosing, at no cost if the suspect is indigent.
 Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted unless the examining magistrate
 has reason to believe the person is a danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 There is no provision for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. It has three tiers: lower court, high court, and Supreme Court.
 
 
 In addition, an Administrative Court hears appeals against government decisions.
 Also, a State Court protects the rights accorded by the Constitution, decides on con-
 flicts of jurisdiction between the law courts end the administrative authorities, and
 acts as a disciplinary court for members of the Government.
 The Constitution provides for public trials and judicial appeal, and the authorities
 respect these provisions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of the home, of postal
 correspondence, and of telephone conversations. No violations were reported. Police
 need a judicial warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, an effective judiciary,
 and a democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the
 press. Two daily newspapers are published, each representing the interests of one
 of the two major political parties, and one weekly news magazine. There is a state-
 owned television station and a private radio station, but residents freely receive
 radio and television broadcasts from abroad.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities do not interfere with these
 rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. The finances of
 the Roman Catholic Church are integrated directly into the budgets of the national
 and local governments. Churches also receive financial contributions from their
 members on a voluntary basis. Roman Catholic or Protestant religious education is
 compulsory in all schools, but the authorities routinely grant exemptions for chil-
 dren whose parents so request.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have unrestricted freedom to travel in or outside the country,
 to emigrate, and to return. The country's lack of an airport or international train
 station precludes it from being a country of first asylum. An asylum law is in prepa-
 ration; Parliament decides case by care on each application. In late 1994, it granted
 preliminary work permits, valid through 1996, to a group of 18 Tibetans who ar-
 rived in October 1993. Their status remains subject to further determination. In ad-
 dition, 295 refugees from the former Yugoslavia (corresponding to 1 percent of the
 population) received permission to stay until April 1996, also subject to annual ex-
 tensions. An additional 40 Yugoslav refugees and 2 Algerians whose status was not
 yet formalized by year's end were also admitted. Those entering to cross the Aus-
 trian frontier without permission are sent to Austrian authorities in accordance
 with a bilateral agreement. Those entering from a third country through Switzer-
 land are dealt with on a case by case basis. A solution is sought which would avoid
 forcing people to return to a country where they would be subject to persecution on
 political, religiouls, or racial grounds.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The 25-member unicameral legisla-
 ture is elected every 4 years. Suffrage is universal for adults over age 20, and ballot-
 ing is secret. A two-party coalition has formed the Government since 1938. Other
 parties operate freely; one currently has a seat in Parliament. The Government reg-
 ularly puts initiatives and referendums to popular vote.
 Since women gained the right to vote in 1984, a growing number have been active
 in politics. Two women are Members of Parliament, and two-one the Foreign Min-
 ister-are among the five members of the Cabinet. Women serve on the executive
 committees in the major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The sole local human rights organization, Justitia Et Pax, is an informal group
 of about 10 persons who monitor prison conditions and assist foreign workers with
 immigration matters.
 There have been no requests from any source for investigation of human rights
 violations.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status,
 and the authorities respect these provisions.
 Women.-The 1994 report provided an inaccurate description of the level of do-
 mestic violence against women. Domestic violence is not a societal problem. The
 total number of victims of domestic violence in 1994 was 21 rather than 670. (The
 latter figure actually represented the total number of nights spent in Liechtenstein's
 shelter, not the number of victims.) Of the 21 women involved, 18 were from adjoin-
 ing areas of neighboring countries. In 1995, 30 women sought shelter and were
 given assistance due to violence or threats from a spouse or male partner. Of the
 30 victims, 21 were from adjoining areas of neighboring countries, 6 were foreign
 nationals residing in Liechtenstein, and 3 were Liechtenstein nationals. The law
 prohibits wife beating, and the Government prosecutes abusers.
 Societal discrimination still limits opportunities for women in fields traditionally
 dominated by men. However, a 1992 constitutional amendment provided for equality
 for women under the law and requires the Parliament to revise, by the end of 1996,
 all laws relevant to this provision. Accordingly, Parliamentary committees have
 been working on revision of the statutes concerning citizenship, education, employ-
 ment conditions, taxation, and other matters. Liechtenstein ratified the U.N. Con-
 vention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1995.
 Children.-The Government supports programs to protect the rights of children
 and matches contributions made to the four nongovernmental organizations mon-
 itoring children's rights. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children.
 Liechtenstein ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and deposited
 the instruments of ratification in December.
 People With Disabilities-Although the law does not expressly prohibit discrimi-
 nation against people with disabilities, complaints of such discrimination may be
 pursued in the courts.
 The Government has required that buildings or government services be made ac-
 cessible for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, are free to associ-
 ate, join unions of their choice, and select their own union representatives. The sole
 trade union represents 13 percent of the work force, but it looks after the interests
 of nonmembers as well. It is a member of the World Confederation of Labor but is
 represented on an ad hoc basis by a Swiss union.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain essential services. No strikes
 are known to have taken place in the last 26 years. The law does not provide spe-
 cific protection for strikers. Employers may dismiss employees for refusal to work;
 such dismissals may be contested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively. However, collective bargaining
 agreements are generally adapted from ones negotiated by Swiss employers and
 unions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law generally prohibits em-
 ployment of children under age 16; however, exceptions may be made, under certain
 circumstances, for some employment of youths older than age 13 and for those leav-
 ing school after age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but even
 the lowest actual wages afford a decent living for workers and their families. The
 law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours for white-collar workers and employ-
 ees of industrial firms and sales personnel, and 50 hours for all other workers. The
 actual workweek is usually 40 to 43 hours. With few exceptions, Sunday work is
 not allowed. Workers over age 20 receive at least 4 weeks of vacation; younger ones,
 at least 5 weeks.
 The law sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Department for
 Worker Safety of the Office of the National Economy effectively enforces these provi-
 sions.
