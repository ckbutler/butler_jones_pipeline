 ANGOLA
 The Republic of Angola continued its onging transition from a single party state
 to a multiparty democracy. The Popular ovement for the Liberation of Angola
 (MPLA) has ruled Angola since its independence from Portugal in 1975. The Con-
 stitution was revised in 1991 to provide for elections and for the protection of basic
 human rights but the Government generally does not respect its provisions in prac-
 tice. In 1992 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos received a pluraity of votes in An-
 tila's first elections, which United Nations observers declared to be free and fair.
 ule second round of the election was not held due to the repudiation of the first
 round results by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
 and the subsequent return to civil war. In 1994 the Government and UNITA signed
 the Lusaka Protocol in an effort to formally end 20 years of civil war. In April
 UNiTA joined with the MPLA and 10 smaller opposition parties to form a Govern-
 ment of Unity and National Reconciliation (G    As specified in the Lusaka Pro-
 tocol, UN1TA finally filed in April the 70 National Assembly seats won in 1992. The
 judiciary where it functions, is not independent of the President and the MPIA.
 heGversnment and UNITA continued to implement the Lusaka Protcl's provi-
 sions for a cease-fire, including the disarming and quartering of 70,000 UNTA
 troops, tbe integration of some UNITA soldiers into the Angolan armed forces, and
 the demobilizat n of remaining combatants. This process is taing place under the
 auspices of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA-the follow-on force to
 the U.N. Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II). Three observer countries (Por-
 tugal, Russia, and the United States) are also monitoring the implementation of the
 Lusaka Protocol. In July the newly integrated Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) were
 officially inaugurated. Some 10,000 of the FAA's 90,000 troops are former UNITA
 soldiers.
 The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for internal security. It exercises this
 function through the National Police. The Paramilitary Rapid Intervention Police,
 (PIR), created mn 1992 as an elite paramilitary force, was restricted to barracks as
 part of the 1994 Lusaka Protocol; that quartering ended in October. The armed
 forces are responsible for external security. Prior to implementation of the Lusaka
 Prtcol-mandated cease-fire, they were primarily engaged in fighting the civil war
 against UNITA. While civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the
 security forces, there were frequent instances in which the security forces acted
 independently of government authority. Members of the security forces committed
 numerous, serious human rights abuses, especially in areas to which the Govern-
 ment recently extended its administration.
 Angola's developing economy is in transition from a centrally-directed to a mar-
 ket-based model. There are extensive natural resource reserves and rich agricultural
 lands which have not yet been exploited. Principal exports are petroleum and dia-
 monds, which together with foreign aid, are the country's leading sources of foreign
 exchange. Oil revenues for 1997 exceeded $4 billion, and diamond revenues were es-
 timatel at $850 million. Subsistence agriculture, the traditional livelihood for the
 majority of the country's approximately 12 million citizens, was constrained severely
 by the extensive use of landmines in 23 years of civil conflict, as well as by govern-
 ment and UNITA restrictions on freedom of movement. In 1997 approximately 1.2
 million internally displaced persons (IDP's) still relied on emergency food aid sup-
 plied by the international donor community. About 1 million Angolan IDP's had re-
 turned to their homes by late 1997. Areas under government control suffered from
 hyperinflation, scarcity of consumer goods, massive unemployment and under-
 employment, crumbling infrastructure, and continuing pervasive corruption. While
 the Government took some measures to increase the availability and control the
 prices of consumer staples, these unsustainable initiatives did not remedy the root
 causes of economic instability. Areas controlled by UNITA experienced scarcities of
 
 
 consumer goods along with massive unemployment and underemployment. Annual
 per capita gross national product is approximately $450, but the overwhelming por-
 tion of the country's wealth remains concentrated in the hands of a small elite. The
 average monthly salary of wage earners (a small minority of the labor force) was
 approximately $10 in rural areas and $50 to $160 in Luanda, a level that falls well
 short of providing a decent standard of living.
 Although there was some improvement, the Government's human rights record
 continued to be poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Members
 of the security forces committed extrajudicial killings, arbitrarily and secretly ar-
 rested and detained persons, and often tortured and beat detainees. The Govern-
 ment did not take effective action to punish abusers. The Government continued to
 inhibit independent investigations of human rights abuses. Government leaders
 cited the 20-year civil war as a justification for allowing emergency considerations
 to override concerns about human rights abuses. Prison conditions were life threat-
 ening. Arbitrary arrest and detention are problems. The judiciary does not ensure
 due process and only functions in parts of the country. The Government infringed
 on citizens' privacy rights. The Government restricted freedom of expression, the
 press, assembly, and association. While some improvements were made, citizens'
 freedom of movement continues to be restricted. The judiciary, where it functions,
 is not independent from the President and the MPLA. Although Angola is nominally
 a multiparty democracy, citizens have no effective means to change their govern-
 ment. Parliamentary elections due to be held in 1996 were postponed for between
 2 and 4 years under the terms of the Lusaka Protocol; presidential elections are not
 to be held until the United Nations determines that appropriate conditions exist.
 Discrimination and violence against women were widespread. Children and the dis-
 abled continued to suffer as a result of the civil war and poor economic conditions.
 The Government continued to dominate the labor movement, and there was no im-
 provement in the poor worker rights situation.
 The human rights situation in territories controlled by UNITA was poor, with nu-
 merous extrajudicial killings, disappearances, incidents of torture, arbitrary arrests
 and detentions, denial of fair public trial, forced conscription, and attacks on civilian
 populations. UNITA tightly restricted freedom of speech, the press, assembly, asso-
 -. ciation, and movement. UNITA did not cooperate with independent investigations
 of human rights abuses by United Nations human rights monitors, the only such
 monitors in the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically and economically moti-
 vated violence by state security forces and common criminal violence were often in-
 distinguishable. A large number -f violent crimes including robbery, vehicle hijack-
 ings, assault, kidnaping, rape, and murder were committed by members of the mili-
 tary and police forces both in and out of uniform. For example, the Government's
 so-called antibanditry campaign late in the year in the provinces of Benguela, Huila,
 and Huambo had to be abandoned when even the Government acknowledged that
 its own security forces- were out of control. Although most criminal activity was com-
 mitted by poorly and irregularly paid rogue elements of the security forces, there
 were credible reports that some-of these attacks were carried out under orders from
 the Government. The Government did- not take any-effective action to punish abus-
 ers, especially in areas to which government authority had recently been extended.
 Frequent gun battles between members of the military and police, and fighting
 among soldiers, police, and bandits in streets, suburbs, and open air markets of
 major urban centers resulted in numerous civilian casualties.
 Many prisoners died as a result of ifiadequate- food, poor sanitary conditions, and
 lack of medical treatment (see Section 1.c.).
 The 1995 killing of independent journalist Ricardo de Mello remains unsolved, as
 do the October 1995 murder of state-owned-television journalist Antonio Casmiro in
 Cabinda (see Section 2.a.) and the 1994 killing of the Vice-Governor of Malange
 Province. The results of the investigation into the November 1993 death of opposi-
 tion politician Carlos Simea were never released. It is widely believed that these
 persons were killed for political reasons.
 Civilians reportedly were killed in the cross-fire between the Angolan National
 Army and the armed factions of the Cabinda Enclave Liberation Front (FLEC).
 Fighting is concentrated in the northern areas of Tandu-Zinze, Kuku-Zau, and
 Belize.
 
 
 3
 UNITA forces also continued to kill civilians (see Section 1.g.). It has been
 credibly alleged that dozens of prisoners died in UNITA custody (see Sections 1.c.
 and 1.d.).
 There was no investigation of the mass grave site found in June 1996 in Soyo,
 Zaire Province. The Joint Commission determined that the killings took place prior
 to the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994 and that UNAVEM, and
 later MONUA, did not have the mandate to investigate.
 Two mass grave sites were discovered in Huambo Province in November, but
 MONUA has yet to determine the circumstances and timing of the deaths. The Joint
 Commission issued a declaration that these sites should not be disturbed until the
 situation on the ground allows for a proper forensic investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-The Government and UNITA continued to accuse each other
 of abductions and disappearances of civilians including traditional leaders (Sobas)
 and party activists. MONUA investigates all alleged cease-fire violations and human
 rights abuses that are reported to it by the Government UNITA, and private indi-
 viduals. It divides allegations into conflrmed and unconfirmed and pending, and it
 assigns responsibility of confirmed incidents to the Government  A or andits.
 While the cases reported to MONUA represent only part of the offenses that oc-
 curred in 1997, a pattern of government and UNITA disregard for the human rights
 of civilian populations can be discerned. For example, MONUA confirmed 100 cease-
 firne violations by the Government and UNITA (plus 36 acts of banditry) in the last
 quarter of the year, of which 41 were serious human rights incidents committed by
 either the Government or UNITA. A total of 18 incidents involved attacks on com-
 munities, another 16 involved the detention, harassment, or disappearance of civil-
 ians, and 7 involved the theft of property.
 There were no developments in the August 1994 disappearances of two individ-
 uals associated with Africare, Vincent Douma and Oliveira Lemba. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the human rights division of
 MONUA, as well as civilian police, continued searching for them throughout the
 year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible firsthand reports that the polce committed torture. In many
 cases the police beat and then release detainees rather than make an effort to pre-
 pare a formal court case. Security forces also committed rapes.
 UNITA forces continued to attack the civilian population and also committed
 rapes.
 Prson conditions constituted a serious threat to the health and life of prisoners.
 The Government and the National Assembly Committee on Human Rights have ac-
 knowledged that conditions are inhuman. Cells are overcrowded and lacl~c basic sani-
 tary faciities. Many prisons, lacking financial support from the Government, were
 unable to supply prisoners with adequate food and health care. There were credible
 reports that many prisoners died of malnutrition and disease.
 Prson officials routinely beat detainees. Prisoners depended on families, friends,
 and international relief organizations for basic support. On Augst 4, Vice Minister
 of the Interior Jeronimo Marcolino visited Bentiaba prison in Namibe Province and
 acknowledged that the conditions were harsh and life threatening. Tribunals are not
 functioning, and there are persons who have been in preventive detention for longer
 than the 135-day period allowed by law and who have not yet been put on trial.
 Ten UNITA members died in the custody of the National Police in Malange in
 November. A government report on the incident claimed that 9 had died as a result
 of fighting among a grup of over 50 prisoners, and 1 had committed suicide. The
 Government repr absolved the National Police of any responsibility. However, the
 prisoners were held for over 24 hours in inhuman conditions, and international and
 other observers believed that they died of asphyxiation. The Government refused to
 p erform autopsies and declined to return the bodies to the families of the deceased.
 Te Government also refused to allow the exhumation of the bodies.
 The Government permitted prison visits by MONUA human rights monitors.
 It has been credibly alleged that dozens of prisoners died in UN]TA custody (see
 Section 1.d.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. Under the law a prson caught in the act of committing a crime may be ar-
 rested and detained immediately. Otherwise, the law requires that an arrest war-
 rant be signed by a judge or a provincial magistrate. Arrest warrants may also be
 signed by members of the judicial police and confirmed within 5 days by a mag-
 istrate. The Constitution provides for the right to a prompt judicial determination
 of the legality of the detention. Under the law, the prosecution and defense have
 90 days before trial to prepare a case, although this deadiine may be extended by
 attorneys general but only under extenuating circumstances. The Constitution also
 
 
 provides prisoners with the right to receive visits by family members. However, a
 scarcity of resources and the lack of qualified and motivated personnel in the judi-
 cial system, limited the exercise of these rights.
 Although in 1993 the Council of Ministers decided to transfer control of the judi-
 cial prcess and prison system from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry
 the decision had not been implemented as of year's end. Interior Ministry personnel
 continued to systematically, arbitrarily, and secretly arrest and detain persons for
 all categories of crime for indefinite periods of time, often without any apparent in-
 tent of bringing the detainees to trial.
 Throughout 1996, UNAVEM III human rights monitors visited 12 prisons and
 found th at more than half of all inmates were awaiting trial. This figure was as
 high as 90 percent in Luanda. Under Anglan law, a prsner may not be legally
 hefor longer than 135 days without trial. In reality most prisoners awaiting trial
 have been incarcerated for lnger than 135 days. In many cases the police beat and
 then release detainees rather than make an effort to prepare a formal court case.
 According to the Government there are no political prisoners in government cus-
 tody. However, the security services routinely are usedto serve the interests of the
 ruling MPLA, including detention and harassment of oppositionists.
 U   TA continues to detain persons against their will. The number of such per-
 sons is unknown, though a number of confirmed cases exist: Eugenio Manuvakola
 (former UNITA Secretary General and signer of the Lusaka Protocol), Germana
 Malaquias, Linda Arthur Chipuku, Shita Nkongo Artur Danda, Carlos Emerson
 Artur Danda, and Telma Nunda. Manuvakola was kept under house arrest for 3
 years, escaping to Luanda in August, where he recounted the harsh conditions of
 his ilegal detention and torture, and gave credible reports of substantial numbers
 of people under UN1TA house arrest.
 The Lusaka Protocol provides for the release, under ICRC auspices of persons de-
 tained for war-related reasons. As of September 10, 1996, the ICRd reported that
 535 prisoners reported bY the Government (369) and by UNiTA (166) had been re-
 leased. However, the ICRC has reclassified '78prisoners originally 'reported to the
 ICRC by UNITA as "disappeared" because UNITA claimed that they were no longer
 in its possession. It was credibly alleged that most or all of these individuals died
 in UNITA custody. In October 1996, the ICRC arranged the release of 205 political
 detainees in government and UNITA custody. There have been no cases filed with
 ICRC since.
 The Government did not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the court system lacked the means, experience, and training
 to be truly independent from the influence of the President and the ruling MPLA.
 The President has strong appointive powers, including appointment of Supreme
 Court justices, with no requirement for confirmation by the National Assembly. The
 judicial system was largely destroyed during the civil war and during 1997 did not
 function in large areas of the country.
 The court system comprises the Supreme Court at the appellate level, and munici-
 pal and provincial courts of original jurisdiction under the authority of the Supreme
 Court. As of the end of the year, 9 of the 12 seats on the Supreme Court had been
 filled. The Court serves as an appellate tribunal for questions of law and fact, but
 it does not have authority to interpret the Constitution. The Constitution reserves
 this role for a constitutional court, an entity that had not yet been set up as of
 year's end. The Constitution provides for the creation of an office of the "Provider
 of Justice," or ombudsman, designated by the National Assembly for a 4-year term,
 to defend citizens' rights and liberties. This office also had not yet been constituted
 at year's end.
 Trials for political and security crimes are handled exclusively by the Supreme
 Court. There were no known political or security trials.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the presumption of innocence, the
 right to a defense and legal assistance, and the right of appeal. Amendments to the
 Code for Penal Process in 1991 provided for public trials, established a system of
 bail, and recognized the accused's right to counsel. However, the Government does
 not respect these rights in practice. Municipal courts deal rapidly with routine civil
 and misdemeanor cases on a daily basis. Judges are normally respected laymen, not
 licensed lawyers. The judge and two laymen selected by the full court act as jury.
 Routine cases are usually settled by a court within 3 months. The verdict is pro-
 nounced the day following the conclusion of the trial in the presence of the defend-
 ant. More than half of all prisoners in jail are awaiting trial (see Section 1.c.).
 UNITA has established a military and a civilian court system in territories under
 its control and claims that its civil code is equivalent to the Portuguese civil code
 currently used by the Government. UNITA President Jonas Savimbi appoints judges
 
 
 5
 personally, and UNITA trials are not open to the public. Juries consist of n~ale el-
 ders chosen from the community. The accused reportedly has the right to a lawyer.
 There are credible reports that the Government holds political prisoners; however,
 the number is unknown. There are numerous confn-med cases of UNITA-held politi-
 cal prisoners. It is unknown if persons detained by UNITA have been convicted by
 some judicial procedure. Even if they were, decisions made by self-styled UNITA
 courts have no standing under the legal system of the Republic of Angola or other
 protections of rule of law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government maintained a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveil-
 lance, monitoring, and wiretapping of certain groups, including journalists, opposi-
 tion party leaders, members and suspected sympathizers of UNITA, National As-
 sembly deputies, and foreign diplomats. Legal requirements for search warrants are
 routinely disregarded.
 Both the Government and UNITA continued to forcibly conscript civilians for mili-
 tary duty (see Section 1.g.). There were credible reports that military-aged Rwandan
 refugees, including minor children, were forcibly conscripted into UNITA's forces
 when they entered areas of Angola under UNI    controlin July and August. On
 July 6, UNITA forcibly conscripted 200 youths in Cubal, Benguela Province, part
 of a continuing pattern.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-Land mines planted during the civil war to gain military advantage and to
 restrict the free circulation of people and goods continued to kill and maim thou-
 sands of people. Many major roads were deMtined and reopened as a consequence
 of government and UN1TA commitments to allow the free circulation of people and
 goods throughout Angola. However, new mines were planted late in the year in Bie,
 Uige, and Moxice provinces. In October a group of detiners were attacked, and six
 people killed in                   2   yongoroi in Benguela Province. While the perpetrators were not
 identified, the deaths followed threats by local UNITA supporters against deminers
 in a nearby area. In many areas local authorities and military commanders of both
 parties continued to restrict free and safe passage of local populations, humani-
 tarian organizations providing relief assistance, and United Nations observers. Free-
 dom of movement was particularly constricted in the northeastern provinces of
 Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul.       A forced demobilized soldiers to go to areas of
 its choosing rather than to their home villages. On May 30, Vice Minister of Terri-
 torial Administration N'Zau Puna and UITA Joint Commission delegate Isaias
 Samakuva were publicly attacked and injured in Qibala by more than a dozen in-
 dividuals known to be U   A su porters.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press, and specifically provides that the press cannot be subject to
 political, ideological, or artistic censorship. However, the Government does not al-
 ways respect these rights in practice. Citizens, including Deputies in the National
 Assembly, expect reprisals for public criticism of the Government or the MPLA. The
 formation of the GURN and the seating of 70 UNITA members in the National As-
 sembly opened the political process to greater debate. The Government intimidates
 journalists, sometimes with death threats, into practicing self-censorship.
 Ricardo de Mello, editor of Imparcial Fax, was killed in 1995 following the publi-
 cation of an article on government corruption, which named Minister of the Interior
 Santana Andre Pitra Petroff as one corrupt official. There has been no investigation
 of this killing by the Government. Angola's open involvement in the October fighting
 in the Republic of Congo was never reportedin the official media. The Government
 runs and tightly controls the only daily newspaper, the only television station, and
 the major radio station. It tightly restricts opposition leaders' access to these media.
 Five commercial radio stations, three private weeklies, and one twice-weekly news-
 paper all practice some measure of self-censorship. Low-circulation newsletters that
 openly criticize government policy and highlight growing socioeconomic problems
 have thus far been allowed to operate. The Government allows UNAVEMMONUA
 to broadcast a series of "Roads of Peace" television and radio programs each week,
 although it continues to deny UNAVEM/MONUA the right to establish its own radio
 Media policy and censorship are controlled by a committee composed of the Min-
 ister of Social Communication; the press spokesperson for the presidency, and the
 directors of the state-owned radio, television, and newspaper. The state-controlled
 national radio headquarters in Luanda reviewed programs broadcast on national
 radio stations in provincial capitals.
 
 
 6
 The Government generally was less restrictive with foreign news agencies such
 as the Voice of America, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Cable News
 Network, although it continues to prohibit direct retransmission. Foreign journalists
 require authorization from the Minister of Interior in order to obtain access to gov-
 ernment officials or travel within Angola. Both the Government and UNITA invited
 journalists to planned press events and to visit areas under their control.
 UNITA runs the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel (VORGAN), which
 often broadcasts hostile propaganda against the Government, contrary to the provi-
 sions of the Lusaka Protocol. For example, a UNITA broadcast in July accused the
 MPLA of declaring war against the people of Angola and urged the people to resist.
 However, the use of hostile propaganda declined towards year's end. Under the pro-
 tocol, UNITA is obliged to transform Radio VORGAN into a nonpartisan private
 commercial station. UNITA's newspaper, Terra Angolana, follows a strictly pro-
 UNITA line and could not be found in government-controlled areas. UNITA pro-
 hibits the press from freely entering UNITA-controlled territory.
 Academic life has been severely circumscribed by the civil war, but there is aca-
 demic freedom, and academics do not practice self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of assembly, association, and protest, but the Government does not re-
 spect these rights in practice. The Government strictly controls both assembly and
 association. Legislation allows the Government to deny registration to private asso-
 ciations on security grounds, and the Government arbitrarily limits organized activi-
 ties deemed inimical to its interests. The law also requires a minimum of 3 days'
 notice to authorities before public or private assemblies are scheduled to be
 ied, and it makes participants liable for "offenses against the honor and consider-
 ation due to persons and to organs of sovereignty.
 In May 1996, Konrad Leibsher, a Catholic priest working with Luanda's poor, was
 arrested and tried for "crimes against the security of the state" for displaying plac-
 ards decrying deteriorating economic conditions in Luanda. The Government pros-
 ecutor argued that crowds drawn by the priest's placards violated the law on meet-
 ing and demonstrations that requires prior government approval of gatherings that
 have the potential to endanger ublic order. The defense argument that freedom of
 speech protections are enshnndin the Constitution prevailed.
 Legislation allows the Government to deny registration to private associations on
 security grounds, and the Government arbitrarily limits organized activities deemed
 inimical to its interests.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, but the Government does
 not respect this right in practice. The Government strictly controls freedom of asso-
 ciation.
 UNITA did not allow free assembly and association in areas under its control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the separation of church and state, and the Government respects this right in
 practice.
 During the May 1996 trial of Catholic priest wonrad Leibsher (see Section 2.b.),
 the government-cntrolled newspaper published a front page editorial accusing the
 priest of subversive activities, ordering the Church to stay out of social affairs, and
 insisting that sovereignty and order must be safeguarded. The Angolan Catholic
 Church issued a response supporting the priest, calling it the duty of every religious
 minister to confront issues of social justice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 n Angola and freedom of exit from and entry into the country, but the Government
 does not respect these rights in practice. As part of the peace process, both the Gov-
 ernment and UNITA committed themselves t          the free circulation of people
 and goods, but local authorities and military commanders continued to restrict
 movement in many areas. The Government and UNITA continue to operate illegal
 checkpoints in many areas of the country that limit freedom of movement and eco-
 nomic activity. Nevertheless, many major rads were deained and opened to traffic.
 Roughly a fifth of Angola's 1.2 million internally displaced persons returned home;
 as did a third of the 325,000 Angolan refugees living in neighboring countries. Re-
 mining of roads in areas of the country under U      control, or adjacent to such
 areas, caused additional civilian cadalties as well as new restrictions on the free-
 dom of movement.
 Angola is a party to bth the 1951 UN. Convention Relating to the Status of Ref-
 ugees and its 1967 Protocol and Organization of African Unity Convention on Refu-
 gees, and the Government cooperates with the I. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR). The Government provides first asylum to refugees. An eligibility
 committee to evaluate asylum claims was established on paper in 1990, was first
 
 
 7
 staffed in 1995, and now meets regularly to evaluate asylum requests. There are
 approximately 9,600 refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at least
 1,000 of whom have been officially granted refugee status. There were no reports
 of the forced expulsion of persons with valid claims to refugee status. As of'October,
 there were some 2,000 refugees in Luau, Moxico Province, an area that reverted to
 government control in September. The Government agreed not to arbitrarily expel
 or forcibly repatriate this group of Rwandan and Burundian refugees and allowed
 the UNHCR to provide all appropriate assistance.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides all adult citizens with the right to vote by secret ballot
 in direct, multiparty elections to choose the President of the Republic and the depu-
 ties of the National Assembly. However, in practice, citizens have no effective means
 to change their government.
 The President is elected by absolute majority. If no candidate obtains a majority
 of votes cast, there is a runoff between the two candidates with the highest number
 of votes. The National Assembly consists of 220 deputies, 130 elected on a national
 ballot and 90 elected to represent the provinces. The Electoral Law also provides
 for the election of three additional deputies to represent Angolans living abroad;
 however, these positions were not filled in the 1992 elections. Ruling power is con-
 centrated in the President who appoints the Prime Minister and other members of
 the Council of Ministers, through which the President exercises executive power.
 The Council can enact decree-Yaws, decrees, and resolutions, thereby controlling
 most functions normally associated with the legislative branch. The National As-
 sembly has, since its inception, served as a rubber stamp for the Council of Min-
 isters. However, the seating of 70 UNITA deputies in April fostered for the first
 time substantive debates on issues ranging from the peace process to the Govern-
 ment's budgeting priorities and accountability. Subsequently, all parties called for
 the National Assembly to assume greater powers.
 Citizens exercised their constitutional right to elect the President and members
 of the National Assembly in the country's first free election, held under UN. aus-
 p ices in 1992. President dos Santos won 49.5 percent of the vote and should have
 fed UNITA leader Savimbi, who won just over 40 percent of the vote, in a con-
 stitutionally mandated runoff election. UNITA and other parties accused the Gov-
 ernment of massive electoral fraud, but U.N. and other international observers de-
 clared the elections generally free and fair and called on UNITA to accept the re-
 sults. The civil war resumed after UNITA rejected the election results, and the run-
 off in the presidential elections was postponed indefinitely. The U.N. is authorized
 by the Lusaka Protocol to declare that requisite conditions have been met to hold
 the second round of presidential elections.
 In April the MPLA, UNITA, and 10 small opposition parties, joined to form a gov-
 ernment of unity and national reconciliation. All 70 UNITA deputies took their seats
 in the National Assembly for the first time since the 1992 elections. UNITA officials
 assumed the posts of Ministers of Geology and Mines, Trade, Health, and Hotel and
 Tourism; Deputy Minister of Defense, Home Affairs, Finance, Agriculture, Public
 Works, Social Reintegration, and Mass Communication. UNITA cabinet officials
 have been allowed considerable freedom within their areas of direct responsibility,
 but they have had little input on overall government policy. UNITA leader Jonas
 Savimbi has so far refused to assume the duties of leader of the largest opposition
 party, a position created for him by the National Assembly in April. The measure
 creating the position was never published in the government gazette, as required
 by Angolan law, and was automatically nullified 10 days after passage.
 The National Assembly began to conduct substantive debates on national policy.
 In July military preparations in the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul led
 to often acrimonious debates which were broadcast on national radio. During the
 August debate on the national budget, the National Assembly passed a resolution
 criticizing the Council of Ministers for the small amount spent on education and
 health.
 There are no legal barriers to the participation of women in the political process;
 however, only 10 of 83 cabinet positions, 35 of 220 seats in the National Assembly,
 and 0 of 9 seats on the Supreme Court are held by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally cooperated with UNAVEM/MONUA human rights
 monitors. The Angolan Human Rights Association, the only Angolan human rights
 group, and the Human Rights Committee of the National Assembly remained weak
 
 
 and ineffective. UNITA reports its human rights concerns through its Lisbon-based
 Association of Surviving Angolans (ACAS). The Dominican Order of the Roman
 Catholic Church is building a cultural center on the outskirts of Luanda that is to
 have a human rights component.
 The UNAVEM1MONUA Human Rights Monitoring Group (HRMG) established of-
 fices in six provinces, conducted human rights training for U.N. Forces, and inves-
 tigated individual cases of human rights abuses. Human rights committees were es-
 tablished in Namibe, Benguela, Huambo, Kwanza Sul, Uige, and Cunene. Commit-
 tees consist of representatives from government and civic organizations. In Uige
 both government and UNITA representatives participate. To date, the committees
 have done little investigative work, though their establishment is considered a posi-
 tive first step.
 The HRMG'S work was hampered by insufficient staff throughout much of 1997,
 ranging from 3 to 10 investigators, and other difficulties. The arrival of 55 MONUA
 human rights officers in September greatly increased the HRMG's capacity.
 UNITA impedes independent investigations of human rights abuses in territory
 that it controls. It denied attempts by UNAVEM/MONUA to investigate complaints
 of human rights violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the Constitution all citizens are equal before the law and enjoy the same
 rights and responsibilities regardless of color, race, ethnicity, sex, place of birth, reli-
 *on, ideology, degree of education, or economic or social condition. The Government
 does not have the ability to enforce these provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women was widespread. In March a Ministry of
 Women was created to deal specifically with this problem. In the last half of the
 year, a series of-national conferences on violence against women, partially funded
 with foreign assistance, were held which resulted in resolutions caling on the Gov-
 ernment to reform the civil code to end women's legal inequality; to hire more fe-
 male police officers giving them responsibilities for domestic abuse cases; and to cre-
 ate a social welfare program.
 The Constitution and Family Code provide for equal rights without regard to race,
 religion, gender, national origin, ideology, level of education, or socioeconomic condi-
 tion. However, a portion of Angola's civil code dates back to colonial times and in-
 cludes discriminatory provisions against women in the areas of inheritance, property
 sales, and participation in commercial activities.
 The maternal mortality rate during 1996 was 1,500 per 100,000 live births. There
 is no effective means to enforce child support laws, and women carry the major re-
 sponsibility for raising children. Due to dire economic circumstances, increasing
 numbers of women engaged in prostitution. Credible evidence indicated that a sig-
 nificant proportion of homicides were perpetrated against women, usually by their
 spouses.
 Despite constitutional protections, women suffered from discrimination. The law
 provides for equal pay for equal work, but in practice women are not compensated
 equaly. Some women held senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical
 field) and civil service, but women were mostly relegated to low-level positions in
 state-run industries and in the small private sector. In much of the country in re-
 cent years women swelled the ranks of the disabled because they often set off land
 mines while foraging in the fields for food and firewood. Adult women may open a
 bank account, accept employment, and own property without interference from their
 spouses. Women a so have the right to inherit property. Upon the death of a male
 head of a household, the widow automatically is entitled to 50 percent of any estate
 with the remainder divided equally among legitimate children.
 Children.-The Government gave only marginal attention to children's rights and
 welfare, in spite of the fact that over half the population is under the age of 15.
 The Education Ministry barely functions due to a meager education budget. Low to
 nonexistent pay has resulted in a shortage of teachers. There is a net enrollment
 rate of 40 percent of the school-age children, down from 42 percent in 1992, with
 an 18-point gap between boys and girls to the detriment of girls. In 1996 it was esti-
 mated that 872,575 school-age children were out of school The public school net-
 work in its present state cannot absorb these children. Most educational infrastruc-
 tures are partially or totally damaged and lack basic equipment and teaching mate-
 rials. A highly successful nationwide antipolio campaign in 1996 and 1997 was an
 important exception to the lack of government health programs for children.
 The peace process has allowed the successful demobilization and reintegration of
 over 8,000 child soldiers from both government and UNITA forces. However, UNiTA
 has impeded planned follow-up assistance to most of its underage demobilized sal-

 diers. An increase in the number of street children in Luanda and other cities re-
 sulted from the breakdown of family structure caused by the resumption of the civil
 war in 1992 and the continuing deterioration of the economy. UNICEF estimates
 that there are approximately 5,000 street children in Luanda alone. Living condi-
 tions in government youth hostels were so poor that the majority of homeless chil-
 dren preferred to sleep on city streets. Street children wash cars, shine shoes, and
 carry water, but also beg, steal, pick through garbage, and prostitute themselves in
 order to survive. The Christian Children's Fund, a nongovernmental organization
 working with children, estimates that there are approximately 500 to 1,000 pros-
 titutes under the age of 18 in Luanda.
 The government-sponsored National Institute for Children is a well-intentioned
 organization, but it lacks the capacity to adequately assist efforts by international
 nongovernmental organizations to assist dispossessed youth. There are no active pri-
 vate children's rights advocacy groups, although the Association of Women Jurists
 has signaled its intention to take up these issues. Minister of Justice Paulo Tjipilica
 has been an outspoken advocate of children's rights and has launched a nationwide
 campaig to register 3 million children.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), is widely condemned by international health ex-
 p erts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. There is very little evi-
 dence of the practice of FGM in Angola. It reportedly occurs rarely in remote areas
 of Moxico Province, bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.
 People With Disabilities.-The number of physically disabled includes an esti-
 mated 78,000 people who were disabled by land mine explosions. While there is no
 institutional discrimination against people with disabilities, the Government is
 doing little to improve their physical, financial, or social conditions. There is no leg-
 islation mandating accessibility for the disabled to public or private facilities, and,
 given the degradation of the nation's infrastructure and the high unemployment
 rate, it is difficult for the disabled to find employment or participate in the edu-
 cation system.
 National /RaciallEthnio Minorities.-Angola's population includes 1 to 2 percent
 of Khoisan and other linguistically distinct hunter-gatherer tribes scattered
 throughout the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. There
 is no evidence that they suffer from official discrimination or harassment, but they
 do not participate actively in the political or economic life of the country and have
 a marginal ability to influence government decisions concerning their interests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join trade unions, engage in union activity, and strike, but the Government does not
 consistently respect these rights in -practice. Although the Government dominated
 the National Union of AngoIan Workers (UNTA), which is the labor organ of the
 ruling MPLA, the General Center of Independent and Free Labor Unions of Angola
 (CGSILA) remained relatively independent. SIMPROF (Sydicatos de Professores), a
 nationwide teachers' union, staged strikes demanding better pay for teachers, and
 met with some limited success. The law requires that labor unions be recognized
 by the Government. Restrictions on civil liberties potentially prevent any labor ac-
 tivity not approved by the Government. However, the major impediment to orga-
 nized labor's ability to advocate on behalf of workers is the 80 percent unemploy-
 ment rate.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and legislation passed in 1991
 provides the legal framework for, and strictly regulates the exercise of, that right.
 The law prohibits lockouts -and worker occupation of places of employment and pro-
 vides protection for nonstriking workers. It prohibits strikes by military and police
 personnel, prison workers, and firemen. The law does not effectively prohibit em-
 ployer retribution against strikers.
 Employees of the Ministry of Health, including.medical personnel, as well as
 teachers staged strikes during the year. Stevedores and other port personnel also
 threatened to strike. In 1996 there were strikes against the -Government by teach-
 ers, doctors, and nurses, among others. The Health and Education Ministries nego-
 tiated settlements but repeatedly failed to honor them because of lack of resources.
 On Labor Day, May 1, 1996, the Government deployed paramilitary police in all
 public spaces in Luanda to deter rumored labor demonstrations.
 Unions have the right to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize, and the law provides for collective bargaining, but the Govern-
 ment does not respect these rights in practice. The Government dominates the econ-
 omy through state-run enterprises. The Ministry of Public Administration, Employ-
 ment, and Social Security sets wages and bene its on an annual basis. In 1996 the
 
 
 10
 Government failed to honor a February 1996 agreement between the teachers' union
 and the Education Ministry to provide teachers an indexed wage. In the small pri-
 vate sector, wages are based on multiples of the minimum salary set by the Govern-
 ment. Legislation prohibits discrimination against union members. Union members'
 complaints are adjudcatd in the regular civil courts. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers firedfor union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Current law authorizing forced
 labor for breaches of worker discipline and participation in strikes has been cited
 by the International Labor Organization as a violation of its Convention 105. The
 laws prohibit forced or bonded child labor, but the Government does not have the
 capacity to enforce these provisions. According to the General Employment Law and
 complimentary legislation of 1981, children under the age of 14 cannot be employed.
 Children between the ages of 14 and 18 may not work at night, in dangerous condi-
 tions, or in occupations that require great physical effort. However, these prvisions
 are generally unenforced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment .-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 14 years. The Inspector General of the Ministry
 of Public Admnistration, Employment, and Social Security is responsible for enforc-
 ing labor laws. This Ministry maintains employment centers where prospective em-
 ployees register, and the centers screen out applicants under the age of 14. How-
 ever, many younger children work on family farms, as domestic servants, and in the
 informal economy. Family-based child labor in the subsistence agricultural sector is
 common. Poverty and social upheavals have brought large numbers of orphaned and
 abandoned children into the unregulated urban informal sector. Laws exist that pro-
 hibit child labor, but the Government does not enforce them (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The minimum wage set by the Ministry of
 Public Admnistration, Employment and Social Security was roughly $30 per month
 before erosion of the currency by inflation (with the rapid devaluation of the
 kwanza, the dollar value of the minimum wage was $2 a month at the end of 1995).
 However, the Government does not enforce this standard. Neither the minimum
 wage nor the average monthly salary, which ranges in Luanda from approximately
 $50 to $160, is sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and family. As a
 result, many wage earners depend on the thriving informal sector, subsistence farm-
 ing, theft, corruption, or support from relatives abroad in order to survive.
 A 1994 government decree established a 37-hour workweek. However, inadeiate
 resurcsprevented the Ministry of Public Administration, Employment, and Social
 Security from enforcing this standard or from enforcing occupational health and
 safety standards. Workers cannot remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
