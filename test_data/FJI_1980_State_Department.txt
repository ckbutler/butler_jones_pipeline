 FIJI
 A multi-racial society made up of indigenous Melanesians
 (44.4 percent), immigrant Indians (50 percent), and small
 groups of European, Chinese and other Pacific Islanders
 (5.6 percent), Fiji is justly proud of its human rights
 record. Fiji has a multi-party parliamentary system
 inherited from the British colonial period, with safe-
 guards to protect the traditional communal social systems,
 including land holding rights, of the indigenous Fijians.
 Citizens' individual rights are protected by law, a court
 system which functions rapidly, a free press, strong
 democratic institutions and a government which supports
 cultural diversity.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law under Chapter II of the
 constitution,and this prohibition is observed in practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 is illegal. In addition to constitutional prohibitions,
 Legal Notice No. 51 setting out the prisons ordinance
 contains spebific regulations on treatment, visiting
 rights, and clothing. Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
 is not practiced although prisons are overcrowded. Legis-
 lation is presently under consideration by parliament which
 would allow prisoners to serve their time in extramural situations
 (i.e. work for the government and live outside the prison
 environment) for the last 12 months of sentence
 or for any sentence of 12 months or less duration (the present
 situation allows for 6 months only). Legislation also would
 allow gainful employment in addition to a commitment to
 perform public work while serving the extramural sentence.
 The Solicitor General, in his investigation into prison
 conditions following disturbances last year, found that the
 biggest problem was boredom. Additional use of an
 extramural option went into effect within about three months
 following prison disturbances, and extension of the extra-
 mural option is expected to pass parliament this session.
 The prison ordinance is detailed and includes provisions for
 such things as accommodating dietary restrictions for
 vegetarians, and entering prison cells at night. Treatment
 of prisoners is impartial and humane and there are no
 discriminatory practices by virtue of race. There are also
 no summary executions in Fiji. Public defenders are avail-
 able and the Fiji Red Cross has access to detainees.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no disappearances nor is there any evidence of
 people being abducted, secretly arrested or clandestinely
 detained.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Fiji. Habeas corpus
 exists and is honored in practice.     There is no pre-
 ventive detention. A suspect can be held without charge
 following arrest for a maximum of 24 hours. Arrest, in
 addition to constitutional provisions, is covered by Legal
 Notice 14 which establishes rules to be followed by the police.

 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 and is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel, and counselors have free access to defendants.
 Consultations between counselors and defendants may be held
 in private. There is no harassment of defense counsel by the
 government. Defendants are made fully aware of the charges
 brought against them, and they and their lawyers can inform
 themselves of the evidence on which charges are based.
 Fiji's courts are independent of executive or military
 control. There are no special courts to deal with security
 or political offences, and civilians are not tried by
 military courts. The Ombudsman's office investigates
 complaints against the government. Chapter II of the
 constitution, a lengthy document with some 18 provisions,
 contains rights to trial.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home, and warrants
 issued by a magistrate are required for officials to enter
 a private residence. Illegal entries of the home are not
 practiced.
 2.   Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Fiji economy is divided between a subsistence agri-
 culture economy, characteristic of the outlying islands,
 and a modern economy centered on the two main islands of
 Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Although Fiji's per capita
 income of $1500 is relatively high for a developing country,
 wealth is not evenly distributed between the urban and rural
 areas, and Fiji's development plan calls for increased
 attention to rural development problems and the commitment
 of resources to improve housing, nutrition, health services
 and education in rural areas. Government support for
 opening new areas to agricultural development, particularly
 cane farming and pine projects, has provided economic in-
 centives to the rural population. Fiji seeks redistribution
 of economic opportunities through regional planning and
 incentives. Private enterprise is encouraged as is foreign
 investment. The right to private property is respected.
 Fiji does not have an equal pay. for equal work act. Women
 are increasingly entering the job scene and are increasingly
 active in the labor union movement. There is no pay or
 hiring discrimination in the public service. Fiji is a
 traditional society with serious unemployment problems.
 Private companies sometimes show sexual discrimination in
 hiring.
 The literacy rate in Fiji is 80 percent and the rate of
 population growth is approximately 2.1 percent per annum.
 The government is seeking to provide free education for grades
 1-6; almost 90 percent of secondary school-aged children
 are enrolled. The government supports housing programs to
 make available adequate shelter at reasonable cost. Health
 care has been expanded to cover as many of the outlying areas
 as possible with an emphasis upon preventive medicine. Women
 are active in the economic life of Fiji although they are
 disproportionately represented in private enterprise. Fiji
 experienced a real growth rate of 6 percent in 1979.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 
 
 598
 These rights are guaranteed in Chapter II of the
 constitution, Sections 11-13, and observed in practice.
 Although there is only one radio station, it is under the
 administration of an independent broadcasting commission
 and provides balanced coverage of the news in three languages.
 The press is free and private, and there is no censorship or
 control of the press by government except for an ordinance
 dating from 1949 which allows the government to order a
 correction in the press if the government believes its position
 has been misrepresented. The ordinance, although very seldom
 used, is resented by the press as it requires printing equal
 space and equal placement of the government's statement.
 There is no interference with academic inquiry. All
 religions are freely practiced. There are no impediments
 to assembly or to freedom of association. Rights of assembly
 are guaranteed by the constitution and are practiced although
 for picketing and public demonstrations an ordinance requires
 obtaining a permit one week in advance of the event. Fiji
 has an active trade union movement, recognized by the
 government, with rights to organize, strike, bargain collectively
 and lobby.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens, men and women, are free to travel within
 the country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. Passport fees are not excessive. There are
 no refugees in Fiji.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the immigrant
 Indian community. Election to the House is on the basis of
 communal and national rolls. House elections are free and
 democratic, and a multitude of parties contest the seats.
 During Fiji's most recent national election (September 1977)
 81.1 percent of the voting age population participated. The
 Senate is appointed by the Fiji Council Chiefs, the Prime
 Minister and the leader of the opposition. Chapter II of
 the constitution states that "every person in Fiji is entitled
 to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual,
 whatever his race, place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed or sex..." There is no law that specifically prohibits
 discrimination by sex. Women are active in all aspects of
 social, economic and political life. There are few professional
 women (doctors, parliamentarians, lawyers) but they are influ-
 ential. Women in the rural areas play a traditional role,
 and tribal inheritance is usually based on a patriarchal
 system. Women can and do nevertheless inherit chiefly status
 (Fiji's third highest ranking chief is a woman). Among the
 Indian community, marriages are still often arranged, but
 there is growing awareness among the women, both Fijian and
 Indo-Fijian, of their right and obligation to participate
 more actively in social and professional endeavors outside
 the home.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no allegations of violations of human rights
 against the Fiji government nor any requests for investigations.
 Fiji was recently elected a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission. Fiji has not acceded to the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
