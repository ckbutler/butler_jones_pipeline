 IRAN
 After over a year of open political protest, the Shah left
 Iran on January 16, turning the government over to Prime
 Minister Bakhtiar. Less than one month later, Bakhtiar
 departed and Mehdi Bazargan was named Prime Minister of a
 provisional government. Real political authority, however,
 was exercised by the Revolutionary Council and by Ayatollah
 Khomeini. With the resignation of Bazargan in November,
 the Revolutionary Council became the formal, as well as the
 de facto, national governing body, with ultmate political
 authority continuing to be held by Khomeini.
 Questions of human rights practices, both past and present,
 have played a central role in Iranian politics in 1979.
 During the more than two decades of the Shah's rule, many
 thousands of Iranians were imprisoned for political reasons
 and a significant number reportedly were tortured. In addi-
 tion, in 1978 and early 1979, violence against persons
 demonstrating against the Shah's rule, by the Shah's security
 forces, took at least several thousand lives.
 Revolutionary courts, established after the fall of the Shah
 in 1979, conducted summary trials and executions of hundreds
 of Iranians. In addition, perhaps as many as 15,000 Iranians
 were imprisoned at some time during the year for past poli-
 tical or official association with the Shah.
 Since November 1979, 50 Americans have been held as hostages
 in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The hostages have been sub-
 jected by their captors to inhumane and degrading treatment.
 These actions have been supported and approved by the governing
 Revolutionary Council and by the Ayatollah Khomeini. The
 continued holding of the hostages has been condemned by the
 World Court, the Security Council, and private human rights
 groups, including Amnesty International and the Interna-
 tional Commission of Jurists.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 There were reports of harsh treatment (i.e., beatings) and
 psychological abuse by revolutionary committees in Tehran
 and the provinces.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 More than 700 executions by firing squads took the lives of
 political and military figures identified with the previous
 Government who were accused of killings or torture; counter-
 revolutionaries accused of plotting to overthrow the new
 (744)
 
 
 745
 Government; and persons accused of violating Islamic ethical
 norms (alleged prostitutes, homosexuals, drug dealers). Their
 convictions followed summary trials conducted with virtually
 no regard for due process.
 The number of executions of persons from the previous regime
 declined substantially following a partial amnesty declared
 on July 11 by Ayatollah Khomeini. The amnesty applied to
 all political offenses except those directly involved with
 murder or orders to kill. The number of persons executed
 because of anti-Islamic or counter-revolutionary crimes
 continued at a high level into the fall months. The working
 of revolutionary courts resulted in the flight from Iran of
 thousands of citizens.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment.
 In early February, many individuals who had been imprisoned
 under the Shah's regime were released by revolutionary groups.
 Arrest and imprisonment by revolutionary groups of individuals
 associated with the Shah's regime, with or withqut Government
 sanction, continued throughout 1979. The incidence of such
 arrests declined in the second half of the year. Prolonged
 imprisonment without charge was frequent. Many prisoners
 arrested in the spring on suspicion of political crimes were
 released beginning in July. There are no reliable figures
 for the number of political prisoners held in jails through-
 out the country at the end of the year. The Department of
 State estimates that several thousand persons remain in
 custody for political reasons.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Most trials in the revolutionary court were carried out at
 night, in secret, in a very short time, and without right
 of appeal. Accused persons were not afforded the right of
 defense counsel or time to prepare evidence in their behalf.
 The summary nature of the trials and executions by revolu-
 tionary courts was strongly criticized by some leaders of
 the former Government under Bazargan, as well as by Iranian
 and international human rights groups.
 e. Invasion of the Home.
 The search by revolutionary groups for figures from the
 previous regime led to frequent invasions of the privacy
 of homes. In addition, searches made in insurgent areas
 and illegal searches by local committees for people and
 contraband (such as liquor) continued.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care, and
 Education
 The Government is publicly committed to the revitalization
 of agriculture, the extension of educational opportunities
 and the provision of improved housing and health care. Due
 primarily to chaotic political conditions, only limited steps
 have been taken toward these goals.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly.
 Freedom of speech, the press, and assembly were signi-
 ficantly broadened with the advent of the new government
 in February. However, a press law promulgated in August
 established penalties for criticism of political and
 religious leaders and was harshly criticized by Iranian
 journalists as excessively restrictive. During August and
 early September, 41 newspapers and magazines were closed
 and 18 foreign correspondents were expelled. By late
 October, 8 of the closed papers reopened and 28 new papers
 were given licenses.
 Throughout 1979 and even including the post-August period
 of restrictions and intimidation, Iranians did enjoy a
 greater opportunity to express their political views than
 at any time in the past 25 years. The dissolution of
 SAVAK, the Shah's secret police, has allowed freer public
 and private discussions of political questions.
 Religious minorities experienced periods of great anxiety
 about their well-being during the year. With the execu-
 tion of the prominent Jewish leader Habib Elghanian in the
 spring and harsh attacks on Israel and Zionism, Iranian
 Jews felt seriously threatened. After a mob demolished
 the Baha'i faith's most sacred shrine in Shiraz and the
 Government confiscated property of the Baha'i community,
 feelings of members of that religious group moved from
 unease to alarm. The new constitution reconizes (as did
 the former) Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians as legal
 religious minorities but does not include the Baha'is or
 others. The Government stated repeatedly that the recog-
 nized religious minorities would not be persecuted, that
 their rights would be protected, and that only those per-
 sons charged with specific offenses would be arrested and
 tried. The absence of effective central government control
 has allowed vigilante groups to take actions against the
 minorities, particularly the Baha'is.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 In the first month following the revolution, the departure
 of adult males was prohibited. The revolutionary authori-
 ties have completed a secret list of persons, believed to
 total 10,000 - 20,000, who are barred from leaving the
 country. There are no official restrictions on movement
 within the country except into insurgent Kurdish areas.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 A national referendum in December overwhelmingly approved
 a new Constitution providing for an Islamic Republic under
 the ultimate authority of Ayatollah Khomeini. While the
 constitution enjoyed widespread support, voters were
 reportedly required to sign their ballots and were subject
 to other pressures.
 Groups which do not support the concept of an Islamic
 Republic under the ultimate authority of Ayatollah
 Khomeini have been subject to varying degrees of harass-
 ment. Some leaders of political parties which have called
 for a secular republic have gone into hiding to avoid
 arrest.
 
 
 747
 Ethnic minorities in Kurdestan, Khuzestan, Baluchistan, and
 Azerbaijan oppose the new Constitution and have demanded
 greater autonomy. They have been involved in intermittent
 fighting with the Iranian army and revolutionary guards.
 The legal rights of women and their ability to pursue inde-
 pendent lives appear to be significantly more restricted by
 the new government.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Revolutionary Government has been severely criticized on
 human rights grounds by many international and non-governmental
 human rights groups. Some representatives of these groups
 have been invited to Iran and some have made visits and in-
 spections.
 On December 5, 1979, the International Court of Justice
 responded to a request for indication of provisional measures
 made by the United States, which had invoked the compulsory
 jurisdiction of the Court as provided for by certain treaties
 to which the United States and Iran are parties. The Court
 issued a unanimous Order indicating -- pending final decision --
 that Iran "should ensure the immediate release, without any
 exception, of all persons of the United States nationality
 who are or have been held in the Embassy of the United States
 of America or in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran,
 or have been held as hostages elsewhere, and afford full
 protection to all such persons, in accordance with the
 treaties in force between the two States, and with general
 international law." It further indicated that "Iran should,
 as from that moment, afford to all the diplomatic and con-
 sular personnel of the United States the full protection,
 privileges and immunities to which they are entitled under
 the treaties in force between the two States, and under
 general international law, including immunity from any
 form of criminal jurisdiction and freedom and facilities
 to leave the territory of Iran." Its Order noted that
 "the continuance of the situation ... exposes the human
 beings concerned to privation, hardship, anguish and
 even danger to life and health and thus to a serious
 possibility of irreparable harm."
 On December 4, 1979 the United Nations Security Council by
 resolution urgently called "on the Government of Iran to
 release immediately the personnel of the Embassy of the
 United States of America being held in Tehran, to provide
 them protection and allow them to leave the country." This
 resolution was reaffirmed on December 31, 1979.
