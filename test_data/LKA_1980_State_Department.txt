 SRI LANKA
 A multi-party democratic society, the island nation
 of Sri Lanka in 32 years of independence has seen
 government change hands six times in eight national
 elections. It has an executive presidential system
 with a parliament and independent judiciary. From
 mid-July to mid-August, 1980, the country was under
 a state of emergency during severe labor unrest.
 Much of the resources of this predominantly agricul-
 tural country have been devoted to welfare, education,
 and land reclamation and redistribution efforts.
 As a result, many of the social and economic needs
 of the people are net to a greater degree than the
 limited resources of the country might imply.
 The principal focus of the government's economic
 efforts continues to be on increased productivity
 and job creation. Historically, there have been
 communal disturbances between the Sinhalese majority
 and the Tamil minority on the island. However,
 there have been no major incidents of tension
 between these two groups during 1980 and no incidents
 of terrorism advocating a separate Tamil state.
 Legislation has been passed to create district
 development councils to allow residents of 24
 districts island-wide to participate in development
 decisions through elected representatives.
 A major concern of civil libertarians during 1980 has
 been the imposition of civic disabilities upon
 former Prime Minister Bandaranaike and two other
 officials of the previous government following a
 special commission's investigation of abuse of power
 charges.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Chapter III, paragraph 11 of the constitution pro-
 hibits torture. There have been no documented
 allegations of torture in 1980. The parliamentary
 committee investigating deaths and injuries charged
 by the Tamil United Liberation Front in 1979 is
 still holding hearings. No report has been issued.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 There are periodic complaints of harsh treatment
 during interrogation by police. By law, such
 accusations must be filed within a month of the
 incident if disciplinary action is to be taken.

 Sri Lankan prisons are very overcrowded, both
 because of the increase in the number of convicted
 prisoners accompanying population growth, and the
 large numbers of remand prisoners who either cannot
 meet bail or whose trials are delayed in the con-
 gested court systems. Accommodations, sanitary
 facilities and health services are severly strained.
 The government recognizes this problem and appointed
 a prison reform committee which recommended in 1980
 construction of new prisons, improved rehabilitation
 programs and alternatives to continued custody
 for those awaiting trial on minor offenses. The
 government is currently considering measures to
 alleviate congestion and reduce the number of remand
 prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no confirmed reports of disappear-
 ances in 1980. There have been no further allega-
 tions or developments regarding disappearances noted
 in the 1979 edition of this report. A select
 parliamentary committee is investigating the 1979
 allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. An arrested person must be produced
 within 24 hours before a magistrate who can authorize
 further detention for certain serious crimes; an
 accused can be detained for up to three months
 without bail, and longer if a court so rules.
 An anti-terrorism law passed in 1979 provides for
 preventive detention, which cannot be appealed
 but which may be reviewed by a presidentially-
 appointed advisory board. This law also permits
 police to detain a person for 72 hours before a
 court appearance. A magistrate must detain a person
 if police so request; only the attorney general can
 authorize release. Preventive detention can be
 authorized for three months and renewed incrementally
 for up to 18 months. In late 1980, several persons
 were believed to be in detention under this law.
 During a state of emergency declared in mid-July and
 terminated in mid-August, 1980, special regulations
 provided for unlimited preventive detention for
 specified offenses following commital by a magistrate.
 No persons are known to have been detained under
 provisions of the regulations. Under the constitution
 and law, persons arrested have the right of access
 to counsel.
 Detained Tamils referred to in the 1979 edition of
 this report were released on bail for over a year.
 They were tried for sedition in December, 1980, and
 found not guilty.
 
 
 1093
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the constitution and law provide that persons
 are entitled to a fair trial, counsel, information
 about the charges against them, and access to the
 evidence against them. Trial by jury is customary in
 Sri Lanka. Anti-terrorism legislation requires
 trials by justices only on grounds that juries in
 such cases can be intimidated.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Police must have search warrants to enter premises
 in ordinary circumstances; this is normal practice.
 Search warrants are not required under the Anti-
 Terrorism Act however.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Since independence in 1948, successive governments
 have implemented policies aimed at meeting vital
 needs of food, shelter, health care, and education.
 These policies include a variety of direct subsidies
 to the people, support programs for producers, land
 reform, control of prices, and free education through
 the university level. Although per capita income
 is only about $250, the literacy rate is approx-
 imately 80 percent, the average life expectancy is
 68 years, the population growth rate is 1.8 percent,
 infant morality is 43 in 1000, and land is equitably
 distributed.
 The economy is predominantly rural and agricultural,
 employing more than half the work force. Roughly
 60 percent of industry is owned by the government.
 A market economy is encouraged, with incentives
 for private investment. At the same time, the government
 is making efforts to force public sector companies to
 pay their own way. The economic growth rate in real
 terms is about six percent in 1980; inflation is
 estimated at 30 percent. Economic liberalization in
 the past three years has increased business activity
 and created more jobs. Heavy, temporary migration
 to the Middle East also has helped to alleviate
 unemployment, which the government estimates is now
 15 percent, down from 24 percent in 1977. Under-
 employment is still a problem.
 A massive scheme to develop the hydroelectric and
 irrigation potential of the Mahaweli River is intended
 to open government land to settlement and create
 employment.
 For administrative, rather than policy, reasons the
 tax system is regressive: progressive income taxes
 account for only a miniscule part of government
 
 
 1094
 revenues. Property is privately owned and is protected.
 Housing is in short supply, particularly in urban areas.
 The government has undertaken to build 100,000 homes
 by 1984, compared with 20,000 government-built housing
 units constructed in the previous 25 years.
 Health care is widely distributed, and for a country
 of its economic level, Sri Lanka's basic health
 indicators are good (340 persons per bed in 1978).
 Hospital facilities are heavily taxed and doctors
 are in short supply (6,429 persons per physician in
 1978). Among steps taken to improve health services,
 the government is building more hospitals, recruiting
 foreign doctors through the United Nations, increasing
 enrollment of medical and paremedical students, and
 permitting government physicians to practice privately.
 The educational system is extensive but, as with other
 social services, is of lesser quality outside the prin-
 cipal urban areas. To meet the heavy demand for higher
 education, the government has opened additional univer-
 sities, including one for part-time education. Some
 rural populations are backward economically and educa-
 tionally, the Indian Tamil tea estate workers, in
 particular. In the past schooling for these workers
 was separate from that provided to other segments of
 Sri Lanka's minority Tamil and majority Sinhalese
 groups. Recent integration of the formerly estate-
 run schools into the national educational system
 should improve the quality of education they receive.
 The Tamil minority cosununity alleges discrimination in
 university placement, public sector employment and
 land-settlement schemes; there is some truth to these
 allegations. The majority Sinhalese community, in turn,
 contends that Tamils traditionally enjoyed a dispro-
 portionate share of these positions, a claim with
 some historical justification. But the demands on
 services in several areas currently are greater than
 the system can meet. A recently legislated scheme to
 create district development councils throughout the
 country with the participation of locally elected
 representatives is intended to give people of various
 regions a greater voice in economic and social develop-
 ment plans for their localities.
 Women participate fully in the economic and social
 life of Sri Lanka and discrimination on the grounds
 of sex is forbidden by the constitution. Women have
 a greater life expectancy than men, and there is a
 low maternal mortality rate (1.2 per 1000). Women
 have a higher school dropout rate, receive lower
 wages for equal work among skilled and unskilled
 workers, and have a higher unemployment rate among
 the educated.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, pub-
 lication, religion and assembly. It gives Buddhism
 a preferred position among religions. There is no
 indication of religious discrimination.
 The government controls two of four major newspaper
 groups and owns Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.
 This constrains criticism against government. There
 is a wide range of smaller publications--daily, weekly
 and monthly-- which often are organs of political parties.
 Independent publications complain of government pressures
 to control criticism. The press nevertheless is a medium
 for active expression of differing views. Direct censor-
 ship can be invoked under the Anti-Terrorism Law.
 Censorship was imposed during the July-August state
 of emergency to suppress news of the attempted general
 strike and some editorials. In addition, if parliament
 considers that the press has impugned it, a Parliamentary
 Privileges Act can be invoked. In one such case in
 1980, the Supreme Court acquitted the defendant.
 Freedom of assembly generally is not restricted.
 Political and other rallies may be held in public places
 subject to permits, but no political party is allowed
 to hold political processions or street demonstrations.
 During labor unrest in 1980, police enforced "move
 along" laws and rescinded permission for on-site picketing
 when the picketing allegedly turned into demonstrations.
 During parliamentary consideration of civil disabilities
 against former Prime Minister Bandaranaike in October,
 the government banned public meetings for four days
 and took other security measures to prevent anticipated
 violence.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right
 to choose one's place of residence are guaranteed by the
 constitution and permitted in practice. Foreign travel
 and travel within the country are not restricted.
 Women are not subjected to different rules regarding
 travel. Sri Lanka welcomes returning citizens, including
 expatriate workers. There are ho refugees in Sri Lanka.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sri Lanka is a multi-party democracy with an executive
 presidency and a parliament. Universal adult suffrage
 was initiated in 1931 and power has changed hands six
 times since independence in open and peaceful political
 elections. Opposition parties function freely and have
 access to news media, although they complain that the
 government-controlled press does not give them
 sufficient coverage. No political parties are banned,
 
 
 1096
 although all must meet certain qualifications to
 appear on the ballot as acknowledged parties.
 Candidates who fail to qualify may run as independents.
 The constitution and legislation provide for special
 presidential commissions of judges to inquire into
 charges of corruption and abuse and misuse of power
 by government ministers and officials. The commission
 also recommends to the president and parliament
 whether or not the accused should be subject to impo-
 sition of civic disabilities: i.e., the suspension
 of the right to vote and to hold public office or public
 employment for seven years. As a result of a special
 commission's investigation into allegations against
 officials of the former government, parliament voted
 to impose civic disabilities on the former prime
 minister, former justice minister and former secretary
 of the justice ministry. The former prime minister also
 was expelled from parliament. Parliament also amended
 election laws to prohibit those under civic disabilities
 from participating actively in political campaigns.
 Opponents of this action argued that the law was ex
 post facto, failed to define its terms, did not
 follow strict rules of evidence, provided no right
 of appeal and usurped the right of the people to
 decide who is to represent them. In defending its
 action, the government argued that there are sound
 precedents for special commissions, that the commission
 was composed of eight eminent jurists including two
 supreme court justices, that the abuse of power had
 no place in a democratic system, that the principle
 of accountability had to be upheld, and that no person
 is above the law and the law must take its course.
 The major group without citizenship in Sri Lanka
 is Indian Tamils, who came during the British colonial
 era to work on tea estates, were largely disenfranch-
 ised after independence, and now constitute about nine
 percent of the population. A 1964 bilateral agree-
 ment concluded between India and Sri Lanka, without
 consultation with the Tamil community in Sri Lanka,
 over a fifteen year period provides for the relo-
 cation to India of some Tamils and Sri Lankan
 citizenship for others. Implementation of this
 agreement is behind schedule. By mid-November 1980,
 349,330 had been repatriated and 195,055 had become
 Sri Lankan citizens. In the 1978 constitution,
 Tamil, along with Sinhala, were recognized as national
 languages. This provision protects the right to use
 Tamil in elected bodies, courts, administration, and
 schools, and in part has met Tamil demands for
 official status for their language.
 Women have equal suffrage, equality under general law,
 and equal property and inheritance rights. Under
 
 
 1097
 the personal law of various ethnic groups, there
 are some limitations on women's rights. Women exer-
 cise the vote but otherwise play a limited role
 in the political process and decision-making. There
 are four women in parliament, out of a total of
 168 -- two of whom serve as minister and district
 minister. The previous prime minister was a woman
 but there are few women in decision-making positions
 in government.
 There are more than 1500 registered trade unions in
 Sri Lanka. Under the law, unions have the right to
 organize, bargain collectively, lobby and, in the
 private sector, to strike. The Essential Public
 Services Law passed in 1979 gives government the
 authority to ban strikes in essential public sectors
 of the economy and provides stiff penalties for
 violations. The law has not yet been invoked. The
 government treated the attempted general strike in
 July 1980 as a political action, not as an industrial
 relations problem, and invoked the state of emergency
 under which government strikers were deemed to have
 vacated employment.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reported investigations by inter-
 national organizations of human rights violations
 in 1980. Numerous local civic and human rights organ-
 izations monitor and criticize the human rights sit-
 uation in Sri Lanka through publication of newsletters,
 press releases and communications to government.
 There is a local Amnesty International chapter.
 Sri Lanka was the site of a regional legal conference
 and a law and media conference during 1980. Sri
 Lanka is also represented on the United Nations
 Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and
 Protection of Minorities.
