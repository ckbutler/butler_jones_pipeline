 JORDAN
 Jordan has been a poor country, disfavored by geography, a
 small population, an often difficult climate, and a lack of
 arable land, water, and natural resources. During the past
 20 years, however, Jordan has made substantial economic
 progress, thanks in part to an atmosphere of domestic
 stability in a politically volatile region. A participant
 in the Arab-Israeli wars of 1948 and 1967, Jordan gave
 shelter to large numbers of Palestinian refugees in each
 of those years. Tensions between the Palestinian fedayeen
 and East Bank "Trans-Jordanians" boiled over in the civil
 war of 1970. Since these violent incidents, Jordan has
 remained under martial law, which it justifies by pointing
 to the political instability of its Arab neighbors and the
 generally tense situation in the region. The government
 resorts to authoritarian measures sparingly.
 Under Jordan's constitution, the king has retained over-
 whelming power since independence. Be appoints and dis-
 misses the government and is the primary locus of foreign
 policy. The prime minister and the cabinet exercise
 considerable responsibility in the formulation of domestic
 and economic policy.
 Jordan strongly opposes terrorism. Jordanian security
 forces have made concerted efforts to prevent cross-border
 infiltration of any terrorist elements. Those involved
 in such raids have been detained, tried and sentenced
 under Jordanian law.
 Although adversely affected by the 1973 and subsequent
 oil price increases, Jordan also has benefited from the
 general increase in wealth in the region.
 Jordan is committed to free enterprise, and there is a
 minimum of government interference in the market place.
 Economic stability and development are enhanced because
 Palestinian refugees have been given Jordanian citizen-
 ship and are allowed to participate in Jordanian economic,
 social, and political affairs. Despite the past tensions
 among and between West Bank Palestinians and East Bank
 "Trans-Jordanians," relations between the two communities
 are generally good. Jordanians, primarily Sunni Muslims,
 respect Islamic civil, legal and social institutions.
 In general, the small but important Christian minority
 enjoys considerable status and economic well-being.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No constitutional provision or law specifically forbids
 torture. Law 23 of 1953, which regulates the treatment of
 prisoners, guarantees that they receive medical attention
 
 (1012)
 
 
 1013
 and provides for inspection of prisons in order to ensure
 that healthful conditions prevail. Although the Freedom
 House 1981 report maintains that "there are prisoners of
 conscience and instances of torture," no accusations of
 torture are known to have been made in 1981. There is
 no evidence that Jordanian governmental authorities
 condone or practice torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 As mentioned above, Jordanian law provides for the decent
 treatment of prisoners. Jordanian prisons are spartan but
 adequate in the context of Jordanian society and limited
 budgets. Prison conditions do not appear to represent
 intentionally degrading treatment. There appears to be
 no discrimination according to religion or social class
 in the treatment of prisoners.
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan.
 Jordanian law provides for trial in absentia of Arabs
 who sell West Bank property to the "enemy" (defined as
 an Israeli citizen, resident of Israel or Israeli cor-
 poration). The maximum penalty for this crime is death.
 Although such trials have occurred and the death penalty
 pronounced, there has been no instance in which it has
 been carried out.
 c. Disappearances
 The Jordanian security forces do not secretly abduct
 people. They are empowered to detain people without
 trial. In such cases, family members can obtain infor-
 mation on the whereabouts of their relatives. No
 evidence has been received that persons so detained
 have died as a result of torture, cruelty, negligence
 or summary executions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Jordan legally has been in a state of war since 1948.
 In force for much of that period, martial law was most
 recently reaffirmed in 1973. Under martial law, the
 executive authority has the power to detain persons
 Indefinitely withut trial. A detained person may take
 his case to the high court of Justice (an administra-
 tive tribunal) to argue that his detention on security
 grounds is not justified. Jordanian martial law does
 not provide for habeas corpus. When security problems
 arise, such as the tensions between Jordan and Syria
 in late 1980 and early 1981, or increased cross-border
 infiltration occurs into or out of Jordan, Jordanian
 security forces use martial law provisions to detain
 or arrest suspected terrorists.
 
 
 1014
 In recent years the government of Jordan has made limited
 use of its detention powers. Amnesty International did
 send a letter to the minister of interior in April 1981,
 expressing its concern about detention without trial and
 submitting the names of 131 untried detainees at the
 "central intelligence prison" in Amman. Amnesty Inter-
 national asked the minister to investigate the status of
 their cases and give details of any trial plans. The
 The Jordanian ambassador in London told Amnesty he had
 asked his government for the information. We have no
 confirmation of Amnesty's contentions. While exact
 statistics are unavailable, it appears that several
 people were detained in 1981 for periods ranging from
 a few days to several months. Royal amnesty is often
 granted at various times of the year. For example, in
 1981, 52 Palestinian prisoners (21 of whom had been
 sentenced, the remainder held without sentences) were
 released.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although martial law is in force in Jordan, both civilian
 and military courts operate. The jurisdiction of the two
 systems is clearly defined in law, with the martial law
 court responsible for crimes such as espionage, bribery
 of public officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons,
 black marketeering and security offenses. The civil
 courts retain jurisdiction for most other crimes.
 Although the martial law court is not bound to observe
 normal rules of evidence or procedure, such generally
 accepted legal practices have been observed during the
 last five years. Accordingly, defendants before this
 court may be represented by legal counsel and may cross-
 examine witnesses. The three judges currently sitting on
 the martial law court all have legal training, as does
 the military prosecutor. Sentences of the martial law
 court may not be appealed. They must be ratified by the
 prime minister in his capacity as martial law governor,
 and the prime minister has the authority to increase,
 reduce or annul any martial law sentence. In practice,
 cases are reviewed for fairness by his legal advisor
 and/or the ministry of justice before the prime minister
 makes a decision.
 Under the civilian court system, cases must be reviewed
 by the public prosecutor's office within 24 hours of an
 arrest. The prosecutor must determine that sufficient
 evidence exists to warrant prosecuting the accused. The
 prosecutor then turns the case over to the attorney
 general's office, which prepares a formal bill of inci-
 dent if satisfied that enough evidence exists to warrant
 prosecution. At all stages in this process, the accused
 is entitled to be represented by legal counsel. Many
 defendants, however, are unaware of this right and fail
 to exercise it. The Jordanian legal system provides that
 
 
 1015
 if the accused cannot obtain legal counsel for himself,
 the state, via the bar association, will assign a lawyer
 to defend him. An established appeals process exists
 for felony cases.
 Jordan upholds the principle that judges should be
 independent and insulated from political pressures.
 Judges are selected by a board composed of members of
 the high court of justice, a representative of the
 attorney-general's office, and the under secretary of
 justice (the senior civil servant in the ministry).
 Judges may be removed from office only on grounds of a
 specific transgression of the law and after a hearing
 before a disciplinary board (made upon of a membership
 similar to that of the selection panel).
 In addition to martial and civil law, Muslims are able
 to practice traditional religious law (Sharia) which is
 an important part of Jordanian life and society. Rights
 of inheritance and child custody, conduct between neigh-
 bors, and especially women's personal status, are largely
 adjudicated according to the Sharia. In accordance with
 Muslim tradition, polygamy is permitted though not widely
 practiced in Jordan. A man may divorce by unilateral
 repudiation; discriminatory inheritances exist under the
 Sharia and are applied in Jordan. A Muslim woman with
 children receives one-eighth of her husband's estate--the
 children get the rest; if she is childless, the wife gets
 one-fourth of the estate. A non-Muslim wife of a Muslim
 is not entitled to an inheritance. Islamic law provides
 that the father or, in his absence, the father's family,
 has ultimate custody of the children in case of divorce
 or the father's death.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authorities
 is against the law, and there have been no reported cases.
 Search and arrest require legal warrants.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The 1952 constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press,
 and assembly within certain limits defined by law. In
 fact, Jordanians express their opinions freely in private
 and, to a certain extent, in print. The radio and televi-
 sion system in Jordan are state controlled. Private news-
 papers and periodicals (which are all subject to government
 influence) practice a form of self-censorship on important
 national issues. Low-key media criticism of the govern-
 ment's domestic policies occurs occasionally. The press
 generally reflects the government's position on major
 foreign policy and security issues. Newspapers have been
 closed down for varying periods in the past for printing
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 65
 
 
 1016
 articles of which the government strongly disapproves,
 and journalists have been warned about comments which
 may be considered critical of some groups or interests.
 In 1981, one daily newspaper was closed for several weeks
 for publishing "erroneous and inciteful (sic)" material.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available,
 although subject to occasional censorship. Similarly,
 foreign books and works of art are generally permitted
 to circulate, being subject to censorship more on moral
 grounds than on political ones. Salacious and porno-
 graphic materials are banned. The government is not
 known to interfere with free academic inquiry. Persons
 who demonstrate without first obtaining a permit are
 liable to be dispersed by police action.
 Jordanians may freely join labor unions and professional
 organizations; a large number of such organizations
 exist and membership is widely held. Such associations
 require government license, but these routinely are
 granted for groups which are not overtly political.
 These unions and associations are permitted to defend
 the interests of their members, and their officers are
 freely elected by the membership. Strikes are legal
 in Jordan. The only condition is that the ministry of
 labor be notified in advance (14 days for small firms,
 28 days for large firms). During this period, the
 ministry will attempt to arbitrate. If these efforts
 fail, employees may strike.
 Islam, the state religion, is followed by the great
 majority of Jordanians. The constitution guarantees
 freedom of worship. Persecution or harassment of the
 Christian minority is against government policy, and
 there appears to be little difference between adherents
 of the religions in social or economic status, although
 very small numbers of the most senior positions in the
 government and the army will not be offered to Christians.
 Nevertheless, some tensions do exist between the Islamic
 and Christian communities. When disputes occur, they are
 usually localized and quickly defused. In 1981, three
 Christians were murdered by several Muslim religious
 fanatics in an isolated incident. The perpetrators were
 arrested and were in pre-trial confinement at the end of
 the year.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within the country (with the exception of certain
 defined and limited military zones) is unobstructed.
 The government does not restrict travel abroad by its
 nationals.
 
 
 1017
 Women and minor children are required to have written
 consent of their husband, father, or oldest male rela-
 tive in order to obtain a passport. Such persons
 traveling alone generally are presumed by the author-
 ities to have permission to travel.
 Jordan has confronted a long-term, major refugee problem,
 especially since the 1948 and 1967 influxes of Palestin-
 ians made homeless as a result of the Arab-Israeli wars.
 Jordan has committed substantial resources to help re-
 settle these refugees and ameliorate their plight.
 According to the most recent United Nations relief and
 works agency statistics, refugees and their descendants
 on the East Bank of the Jordan River now.total approx-
 imately 896,000. This total does not include a large
 but undetermined number of other persons from the West
 Bank, the Gaza Strip, or the State of Israel, who have
 settled in Jordan since 1948. All of these people have
 been granted Jordanian citizenship and have the unre-
 stricted right to live, work, and own property in Jordan.
 There are no restrictions on these or any other citizens
 who might wish to return to Jordan after a period spent
 residing abroad.
 Jordan defends the movement of peoples between the East
 Bank and Israeli occupied territories. In doing so, the
 government has reminded its critics that such travel is
 humanitarian, helps maintain West Bank Arab ties, and is
 economically advantageous to the inhabitants of the
 occupied territories.
 Jordan recognizes the right of asylum, even in cases which
 have resulted in strained relations with neighboring states.
 Many Iraqi Christians claiming religious persecution have
 passed through Jordan en route to resettlement countries
 elsewhere.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Jordan is a monarchy in which. the king exercises central-
 ized political power. Governments are formed and dissolved
 at his command and he remains the ultimate arbiter of
 policy. Organized political parties are not permitted in
 Jordan. One, the Communist Party, is prohibited by law.
 According to the 1952 constitution, there should be an
 appointed senate and a chamber of deputies elected by
 universal suffrage in secret ballot. The chamber of
 deputies was adjourned sine die in 1974. Parliamentary
 elections have been postponed indefinitely, since Jordan
 holds that both the East and West Banks must be repre-
 sented in any future parliament, and it is presently im-
 possible to conduct Jordanian elections in the occupied
 West Bank.
 
 
 1018
 In 1978, King Hussein established a national consultative
 council (NCC) with appointed members selected to represent
 the various geographic regions and social, ethnic, religious,
 and tribal groups in the country. Legislation is submitted
 to the NCC for review; it does not have veto power, but
 often discusses policies actively, and sometimes heatedly.
 In 1981, for the first time the NCC advocated and achieved
 changes in the government's budget, i.e., increases in
 civil servants' salaries, and it also has played a direct
 role in shaping the 1981-85 development plan, especially
 in increasing planned proposed spending on agricultural
 development. The government generally has not promulgated
 legislation with which the NCC is in strong disagreement.
 The town councils of towns in Jordan are elected by
 popular vote; in villages they are appointed. In 1980,
 King Hussein called for increased democracy in local and
 regional government. Early drafts of legislation pro-
 posed to extend the franchise to all citizens over 18
 years of age, and plans to allow women to run for local
 offices such as mayor and councilor of municipalities
 and villages are now under study.
 King Hussein has recently taken other steps to increase the
 participation of women in the political process, appointing
 the first female cabinet minister in Jordan's history in
 1979 and in 1980 increasing the number of women in the NCC
 (from three to five out of sixty members).
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from private and
 international human rights organizations. Amnesty
 International has made inquiries about specific cases
 from time to time. In May and June 1981, a delegation
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 inspected 14 places of detention with a total of 2,500
 detainees. The Amman delegation, in co-ordination with
 that in Tel Aviv, also organized thirteen operations
 enabling certain categories of persons to pass the
 demarcation lines via the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge
 and the Prince Mohammad (Damia) Bridge. The delegates
 in Jordan continued to transmit messages between sepa-
 rated family members, some living in Jordan and others
 in the territories occupied by Irael. The Government
 of Jordan regards human rights issues essentially as
 internal matters. Extensive Jordanian government and
 private concern has remained focused on the Ziyad Abu
 ain extradition case. Abu Eain, a Jordanian citizen
 of Palestinian origin, is accused by the Israeli govern-
 ment of being responsible for a bomb explosion in
 Tiberias which killed a number of civilians. Under the
 provisions of the U.S.-Israeli treaty on extradition,
 he was arrested in Chicago. He was extradited to Israel
 in December 1981.
 
 
 1019
 Jordan has played an active role in the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission at Geneva.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Jordanian government is committed to development
 of a free enterprise economy. While government involve-
 ment in economic development is substantial, Jordan's goal
 is generally to stimulate market forces that will serve
 to create an economic climate conducive to the develop-
 ment of a healthy private sector. Jordan's open, market-
 oriented economy has demonstrated healthy growth--estimated
 to average 9 percent annually--during the period of the
 1976-80 five year plan. Current per capita gross domestic
 product (GDP) stands at 1,247 (1980 dollars). The economy
 is dominated by the services sector, which accounts for
 63 percent of GDP. Industry's share rose from 27 percent
 in 1979 to 30 percent in 1980, and the government is
 currently preparing plans for further industrial develop-
 ment that should further increase industry's share of GDP.
 Agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined to about 6
 percent, due to insufficient rainfall in recent years and
 more attractive opportunities for labor and capital in
 other sectors. When security conditions in Beirut greatly
 deteriorated, Amman--with its agreeable climate, relatively
 good communications and transportation connections, stable
 government and free-market economic policies--began to
 play an increased role as a Middle East regional economic
 and commercial center. Spurred by the influx of foreign
 funds and repatriated earnings of Jordanians working
 abroad, the Amman area is experiencing an economic boom.
 The foundation of this boom is fragile, and there are
 recent signs of a slowdown of economic growth.
 About one-third of Jordan's native work force is employed
 in the Gulf states, where wages are much higher. Foreign
 exchange earned by these expatriate workers (about one
 billion U.S. dollars per year) is sent as remittances to
 families still residing in Jordan. These funds are then
 widely distributed through the Jordanian economy. Because
 of the important role of remittances in the economy, the
 government does not restrict the international movement of
 Jordanian workers or those from other Arab states coming
 to Jordan, although efforts have been introduced to regis-
 ter foreign workers. Jordan also continues to receive
 large transfer payments. Of Jordan's East Bank population
 of 2.34 million, 63 percent live in urban areas and about
 one-half of the total population lives in metropolitan
 Amman. The natural rate of increase is 3.8 percent per
 year; 51 percent of the population is under the age of 15.
 The basic law governing education (Law 16 of 1964) stipu-
 lates that free education is compulsory through grade 9,
 and that every Jordanian shall have equal access to educa-
 tion without regard to sex, religion, or other factors.
 Education facilities are generally good and are widely
 
 
 1020
 distributed. Enrollments have grown rapidly from 531,000
 in 1970 to 772,000 in 1980. Virtually all eligible
 children are enrolled in primary schools (grades 1-6),
 84 percent in the preparatory (grades 7-9), and 60 percent
 in secondary schools. Today, about every third Jordanian
 is a full-time student. Jordan's female student enrollment
 rate is one of the highest in the Middle East. Enrollment
 of girls has grown faster than that of boys at all levels
 of the education system in recent years, in response to
 public demand and government support for construction of
 girls' schools. It is public policy to educate girls in
 separate facilities, except in universities, reflecting
 traditional cultural and religious preferences. In the
 1979-80 school year, 46 percent of all Jordanian students
 were female, including 47 percent at the elementary level,
 45 percent in preparatory schools, and 42 percent in the
 secondary grades.
 As a result of the expansion in education cited above,
 Jordan's adult literacy rate in 1977 was 70 percent, up
 from 32 percent in 1960. 59 percent of the female popu-
 lation is literate; the figure for males is over 82
 pecent. In 1960, only 15 percent of all females and
 50 percent of all males were literate.
 Health facilities are widely distributed, although a
 shortage of trainednurses and paramedical personnel
 restricts the availability of medical care outside the
 cities, and particularly in poorer, less densely popu-
 lated areas. The most extensive and complete health
 services, including the more specialized ones, are found
 in the larger cities, where public and private sector
 services are well represented. Outside the major cities,
 only government facilities exist. Improvements in avail-
 able health care and expansion of services are indicated
 by rising life expectancy (61 years in 1980 versus 47
 years in 1960), the halving of the child death rate from
 30 to 15 per thousand children aged 1-4, and the fall in
 the infant mortality rate of 125 per thousand live births
 in the mid-1950s to about 97 or less per thousand. Women
 of child bearing age and children remain, however, the
 segment of the population most at risk in terms of health.
 Prior to the great expansion in demand for labor in the
 Gulf states, which began about 1973, Jordan had a serious
 and chronic unemployment problem. The outflow of Jordan-
 ian workers to the Gulf, however, has served virtually to
 eliminate unemployment; currently the rate stands at less
 than 1.5 percent. There are no reliable data on under-
 employment. Two parallel developments tend to confirm
 the low level of unemployment. One is the rising number
 of foreign workers in Jordan--at least 80,000, most of
 whom are unskilled agricultural and construction workers
 from Egypt. The second is the rapid increase in female
 participation in the non-agricultural workforce from
 
 
 1021
 about four percent of the total in 1975 to over 15 per-
 cent in 1979. Many.of the government's expanding voca-
 tional training efforts are directed toward training
 women to meet shortages in areas requiring technically-
 trained personnel.
 Wage rates have risen rapidly in all sectors, although
 civil services wages continue to lag behind those in the
 private sector. Per capita income in Jordan increased
 rapidly in the 1970s, reaching $1,180 in 1980, exceeding
 population growth rates and making Jordan a middle-income
 country. Lacking baseline data, income distribution
 trends are difficult to assess, although the gap between
 the highest and lowest income groups may be assumed to
 have remained constant, or to have widened, primarily
 reflecting economic advances at the upper levels. About
 14 percent of the urban population and 17 percent of
 rural residents are estimated to live in absolute poverty
 and to lack the annual income necessary to meet minimum
 nutritional and physical needs.
 Jordan's free-enterprise economy has created many opportun-
 ities for its people, regardless of religious, ethnic, or
 tribal background. There is no evidence of government-
 encouraged discrimination. While women in Jordan have
 traditionally been disfavored economically and, to a lesser
 extent, educationally, this pattern is changing in favor
 of increased opportunities for the employment and educa-
 tion of women. In September 1981, the National Federa-
 tion of Jordanian Women was created, joining the various
 women's organizations in one body. The Federation's aim
 is to coordinate women's voluntary and philanthropic
 efforts and to integrate Jordanian women more fully in
 the social and economic development of the country.
