 CAMBODIA
 The regime in place in Cambodia's capital is widely known as
 the People's Repfublic of Kampuchea (PRK) although it now cails
 itself the State of Cambodia. The PRK regime is headed by
 Council of State Chairman Heng Samrin and Prime Minister Hun
 Sen. The regime was installed by the Vietnamese army after it
 drove the Khmer Rouge Communists from Phnom Penh in 1979. The
 PRK is not recognized by the majority of the international
 community. In September Vietnam apparently withdrew virtually
 all of its main force units. However, Vietnam continues to
 exert consid6rable influence over the PRK regime's policies.
 Recently, the PRK regime has begun to pursue a set of
 increasingly liberal economic policies.
 PRK political institutions tend to follow the Vietnamese
 model. Power is wielded by the Communist Kampuchean People's
 Revolutionary Party (KPRP), but the KPRP's control over
 Cambodia has been challenged by the Coalition Government of
 Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), composed of two non-Communist
 resistance groups, and the Khmer Rouge. As in previous years,
 resistance forces continue to wage a guerrilla war against the
 PRK, operating primarily from areas along the Thai-Cambodian
 border and in small enclaves in western Cambodia. Occupying
 Cambodia's seat at the United Nations, the CGDK was formed in
 1982, when the non-Communist resistance groups joined with the
 Khmer Rouge in a loose political alliance.
 In August 1989, all four Cambodian factions, along with
 Vietnam, the ASEAN countries, the permanent members of the
 U.N. Security Council, and several other nations, met in Paris
 in an attempt to work out a negotiated settlement to the
 conflict. After a month of discussions, the conference
 recessed without an agreement, but efforts to reach a
 diplomatic settlement continue.
 The Khmer Rouge, with between 30,000 and 40,000 men under
 arms, is considered the most effective fighting force in the
 resistance coalition. While in power from 1975-1979, the
 Khmer Rouge compiled one of the worst records of human rights
 violations in history as a result of a thorough and brutal
 attempt at restructuring Cambodian society. More than
 1 million people, out of a total population of approximately
 7 million, were killed or died under the Khmer Rouge's
 genocidal reign.
 Although the Khmer Rouge has intensified a major public
 relations effort aimed at convincing the world that it has
 abandoned its past genocidal policies, its authoritarian and
 brutal treatment of Cambodians under its control continues in
 camps along the Thai-Cambodian border not accessible to
 international agencies and in parts of Cambodia under direct
 Khmer Rouge control. Conditions are better at Site 8--the
 first Khmer Rouge camp accessible to international
 agencies--and two other open camps, but Khmer Rouge
 administrators of all camps go to great lengths to prevent the
 departure'of people from their control. (See Section 2.d. for
 an explanation of the various types of Khmer Rouge camps.)
 The Khmer Rouge top leadership from the 1975-79 period remains
 in power and is reliably reported to retain its ultimate goal
 of regaining control over Cambodia.
 The non-Communist resistance (NCR) is made up of two groups.
 The first is the National United Front for an Independent,
 Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC) whose
 de facto leader is Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia's former
 
 
 793
 CAMBODIA
 hereditary king and head of state. FUNCINPEC's military force
 is the Sihanoukist National Army (known as the ANS, an
 abbreviation of its name in French).
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) is the
 older of the two NCR groups. Its political leader is former
 Prime Minister Son Sann who espouses a parliamentary form of
 government for Cambodia. It was formed in 1979 with the
 merger of several existing NCR groups, many led by former
 soldiers from the pre-1975 period of the Khmer Republic.
 While these two groups have been comparatively free of human
 rights violations, there have been some credible reports of
 violations committed by their respective armed forces.
 The PRK's economic system began to change significantly in
 1989 when the regime began to permit citizens to own land and
 operate private businesses. There have been reports that the
 official exchange rate was abolished in 1989, permitting the
 market to determine the value of the riel against hard
 currency. Hundreds of privately owned businesses are now
 flourishing in Phnom Penh and, on a smaller scale, in
 provincial towns. Lured by the prospect of commercial
 opportunities, many foreign investors, particularly from
 nearby Southeast Asian countries, are already doing business
 in Cambodia or making plans to do so. Many visitors also
 report growing corruption among PRK officials.
 Reliable reports from travelers to Cambodia and Cambodians who
 have left the country indicate that widespread and serious
 human rights violations by the PRK regime continued in 1989,
 despite evidence of improvement in some areas. The PRK
 continues to discourage efforts to monitor its human rights
 record.
 During 1989 the human rights situation began to improve in
 many of the displaced persons camps located along the
 Thai-Cambodian border, in part because the United Nations
 began a program of assigning security liaison officers to each
 camp to train camp police.and to institute a code of justice
 and a court system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The few Cambodians who departed the country in 1989 did not
 report political killing by the PRK or Vietnamese in
 regime-controlled areas of Cambodia.         W-
 Political killings by the Khmer Rouge appear to have been
 reduced, but information on what happens in Khmer Rouge camps,
 especially in those of its camps not open to international and
 humanitarian organizations (where at least 50,000 people
 reside), is sparse. One defector from a closed Khmer Rouge
 camp reported that the Khmer Rouge, in an effort to regain
 popular support, now imprison or attempt to "reeducate"
 violators of their policies rather than kill them. He said,
 however, that serious offenders are sometimes placed in jails
 where they are starved to death.
 
 
 794
 CAMBODIA
 Khmer Rouge defectors report that civilians from the border
 camps and prisoners'from Khmer Rouge jails have been killed by
 mines while performing-forced labor, such as transporting
 supplies for guerrilla forces in Cambodia. They also report
 that those who attempt to flee Khmer Rouge closed camps run
 the risk of being shot. One 1989 defector from a closed Khmer
 Rouge camp reported that those accused of selling weapons or
 associating -with the NCR sometimes receive the death penalty.
 Civilians continue to be killed during attacks by the Khmer
 Rouge on towns, lines of communication, and economic targets
 within Cambodia. Often the Khmer Rouge, before attacking a
 town, have threatened all residents with death if they
 resist. The Khmer Rouge policy of killing captured Vietnamese
 troops'and some PRK officials does not appear to have changed.
 KPNLF and ANS units were not generally accused of political
 killings during 1989. Murders by NCR troops did occur in
 camps run by both factions, but these appear to have been the
 result of domestic conflicts. In September, however, a
 section leader in the major FUNCINPEC camp of Site B was
 assassinated in what was believed to be retaliation for
 alleged spying activities.
 NCR forces attempt to avoid civilian casualties as much as
 possible during their military operations. This was
 especially evident during its major offensive launched
 September 30 when the safety of civilians who occupied the
 area attacked was a high NCR priority.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearances in Cambodia increased during 1989,
 but it appears that most of these cases involved the PRK's
 forced induction into the armed forces of young men between
 the ages'of 18 and 30. There were also sporadic reports of
 residents from the displaced persons camps along the
 Thai-Cambodian border being impressed for the resistance armed
 forces.- Disappearances from closed Khmer Rouge camps were
 also reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Prisoners who were released or escaped from PRK prisons during
 late 1988 or 1989 reported that the use of torture by PRK
 authorities, who took over administration of the prisons from
 their Vietnam advisers, has been reduced. Some prisoners
 report that, in lieu of being tortured, prisoners are
 sometimes just shown the tools of torture which could be used
 against them unless they confess their alleged crimes.
 Article 35 of the new PRK Constitution, promulgated in April,
 specifically prohibits the use of coercion or physical abuse
 against prisoners.
 According to reports gathered by Amnesty International (AI),
 in the past, persons suspected of being involved with the
 resistance ran the highest risk of torture. Recent reports
 indicate this continues to be true. This category has been
 defined by the PRK authorities to include persons alleged to
 have expressed opinions critical of regime policies or the
 role of the Vietnamese, as well as those thought to be trying
 to leave or return from areas under the control of the
 resistance.
 
 
 795
 CAMBODIA
 According to Al and prisoners recently released from PRK
 jails, beatings have been inflicted on political suspects
 detained for interrogation. PRK authorities have been known
 to use various forms of torture, but recent information on
 such practices is unavailable. The PRK refuses to permit
 outside inspection of its prison facilities.
 As in previous years, some detainees undergoing interrogation
 continue to be held incommunicado in small and completely dark
 solitary confinement cells that are poorly ventilated and
 unsanitary. They are constantly immobilized by shackles on
 both legs; sometimes they also are handcuffed, They are
 allowed no bedding or mosquito netting. To intensify
 ill-treatment during interrogation, some detainees are also
 deprived of food and water to progressively undermine their
 physical strength and resistance to illness. They may not
 bathe or go outside their cells to relieve themselves and are
 permitted neither medication nor medical attention.
 Although it is rarely reported that a suspect has been killed
 during the actual interrogation, the indefinite period of
 detention without charge or trial that usually follows
 interrogation exposes detainees to the risk of death from a
 combination of injuries sustained during interrogation,
 unattended diseases, and inadequate diet.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 As a rule, PRK authorities often detain, interrogate, and jail
 resistance sympathizers for extended periods without formal
 charges. Estimates of the number of political prisoners held
 by the PRK, including the estimates of AI, range up to several
 thousand, but reliable figures are not available.
 In April an AI current report noted that an additional 430
 people had been detained by PRK authorities for political
 reasons in 1988. Much of this information has come from
 official PRK broadcasts reporting the arrests of people
 -ancused of being "agents" of the CGDK or merely "political
 enemies." AI has repeatedly urged the PRK "to provide details
 about the fate of people reportedly arrested on political
 grounds," but has received no response.
 Separate sections within the police are responsible for the
 investigation of activities by the non-Communist (KPNLF and
 ANS) and Communist Khmer Rouge resistance groups. The
 Ministry of Interior maintains at least three prisons in which
 suspected supporters of the resistance are held without formal
 charges. Provincial police and military internal security
 units maintain additional detention and interrogation
 centers. Regime regulations call for the arrest and
 "reeducation" of "any person carrying out propaganda campaigns
 to sabotage internal unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam
 solidarity." Such "reeducation" means indefinite detention to
 force a change in political thought.
 In general there has been a virtual absence of legal process
 for those detained. Detainees have seldom been informed of
 the charges against them, or given access to lawyers, or
 informed of any rights or legal protections. There has been
 no requirement that officials notify anyone of a person's
 arrest. The same PRK authorities have been responsible for
 arrests, interrogation, decisions on a subject's guilt or
 innocence, and prison administration.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 Since 1981 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 has unsuccessfully sought permission to visit prisoners
 captured in combat. It has also not yet been able to gain
 access to Thai prisoners reportedly held in PRK prisons.
 During the October offensive against the PRK in northwestern
 Cambodia, NCR troops captured 600 prisoners of war (POW's).
 These prisoners are being detained for interrogation and
 political orientation and, if they do not wish to join the
 resistance forces, the NCR says it will release them. In
 addition to these 600 POW's, the NCR forces also detained and
 later released additional PRX soldiers, providing them with
 money so they could return home. The Khmer Rouge also
 captured POW's during 1989. The Khmer Rouge presented some
 POW's they claimed tO be Vietnamese to the press in October as
 "evidence" that Vietnam still had troops in Cambodia. No
 information is available as to what has since happened to
 these prisoners.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 85 of the 1989 PRK Constitution guarantees defendants
 the right to lawyers-at all trials. In addition, this
 Constitution states that "all stages of court proceedings
 shall be held in public." Nevertheless, cases may be held in
 secret if provided for by law." In past years, political
 prisoners were regularly denied fair trials. There are no
 indications that this situation has changed since the new
 Constitution was adopted.
 The PRK has used trials primarily for propaganda or public
 intimidation, with verdicts decided in advance. There are few
 procedural safeguards for defendants. Defendants have been
 required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all the
 questions and answers to be presented in court, even in cases
 where the interrogators had already decided to release them;
 if-these defendants satisfactorily recited their testimonies
 as rehearsed, they were released. Other reports indicated
 that prisoners who had been arrested by PRK authorities for
 alleged cooperation with the resistance were incarcerated, not
 as a result of judicial proceedings, but rather because they
 confessed to their crimes under interrogation. There are no
 indicatibns that these practices changed in 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 PRK authorities search whenever and wherever they wish.
 Networks of informers report to the secret police. Almost all
 villages in Cambodia close to the Thai-Cambodian border in the
 northwest provinces have been relocated inside a border
 security zone, especially those near known infiltration
 points. There are also numerous reports, confirmed by former
 PRK district officials, that the regime confiscates rice and
 other foodstuffs from villagers in some parts of the country
 in an effort to prevent cooperation with the resistance.
 In most of their camps along the Thai-Cambodian border,
 especially in the south, the Khmer Rouge maintain strict
 control on the social activities of those under their
 control. The rules appear to differ little from those imposed
 by the Pol Pot regime of 1975-78. For instance, the Khmer
 Rouge punishes persons who marry without permission or forbids
 
 
 797
 CAMBODIA
 marriages altogether. If a marriage is permitted, the bride
 and groom are often not allowed to live together. Contacts
 with foreigners are restricted, and listening to unauthorized
 radio broadcasts can result in punishment. Relief workers who
 visit those Khmer Rouge camps open to outsiders report that
 -residents .require permission to visit the health clinics run
 by voluntary agencies or the ICRC's surgical facility at
 Khao-I-Dang. One Khmer Rouge defector during 1989 reported
 that in his.camp, which was closed to international access,
 between 5 and 10 children and adults died each month because
 of the absence of medical care and the refusal of the Khmer
 Rouge leaders to allow camp residents to leave to seek help
 from international relief organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The press and radio within Cambodia are wholly controlled by
 the PRK regime. Criticism of the regime is not generally
 tolerated. Possession of foreign books and periodicals can
 result in arrest, but it is doubtful that such regulations are
 strictly enforced. Some limited criticism of the regime was
 tolerated in 1989 in publications such as the newspaper
 Kampuchea. On one occasion, this criticism took the form of a
 comparison implying that the PRK regime's armed forces
 sometimes engaged in undisciplined behavior similar to that of
 Pol Pot's soldiers.
 In some areas of the country, people can listen to foreign
 radio broadcasts relatively freely, while in other areas,
 people are discouraged from listening to these broadcasts and
 threatened with arrest if they persist. The PRK makes a
 nominal attempt to control what types of movies the population
 sees, but widespread smuggling of video tapes has made movie
 censorship virtually impossible.
 The PRK has, in the past, controlled individual contacts with
 foreigners. Recently, however, visitors to Cambodia have noted
 that Cambodians appear to be free to talk with anyone they
 wish, including foreigners.
 In Site 8, a Khmer Rouge camp open to international
 assistance, residents have access-to a relatively wide range
 of foreign publications and can listen to the radio with
 relative freedom. However, this was not the case during 1989
 in the closed Khmer Rouge camps where, defectors report, those
 who listen- to foreign broadcasts, or even those of the
 non-Communist resistance groups, are imprisoned. Residents of
 closed camps also lack access to foreign publications. In
 areas of Cambodia seized by the Khmer Rouge, the schools are
 closed. The non-Communist groups do not have similar
 restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the PRK are those created
 to support the regime, such as those for farmers, women, and
 youth. These are usually-headed by ranking party or regime
 officials.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 798
 CAMBODIA
 C., Freedom of Religion
 Article 6 of the PRK's 1989 Constitution made Buddhism the
 state- religion of Cambodia. The regime also announced in May
 that all men were free to enter the monkhood, provided the
 ordination was approved by the regime and carried out by
 designated senior monks.
 Interviews with Cambodians who left the country in 1989
 indicate that in many parts of the country there is now
 considerable freedom to practice Buddhism and enter the
 monkhood. There are reports, however, that in some areas, men
 are still discouraged from entering the monkhood. Sometimes
 this involves a requirement to pay a bribe to obtain the
 necessary permission.
 Generally, PRK authorities attempt to use Buddhism as one of a
 number of organizations for "mass mobilization" to implement
 party policies. Religious affairs are overseen by the
 National United Front for Construction and Defense, the same
 government agency that seeks to organize women, youth,
 workers, and religious groups to support the State.
 Communities t~At wish to construct Buddhist temples must apply
 to the local front committees for permission. The most senior
 monk is a Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, indicating
 the subordination of the Order of Buddhist Monks to political
 ends.
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion and systematically murdered
 much of the Buddhist monkhood. Since being driven from power,
 the Khmer Rouge has tried to give the impression of reform.
 This is most noticeable in the large Khmer Rouge camp at Site
 8, which has been accessible to international organizations
 and relief workers since, it was established as an evacuation
 site in 1985 for people fleeing a Vietnamese offensive. This
 camp has a temple with monks in residence. However, defectors
 from other Khmer Rouge camps, and those relief workers
 occasionally allowed into those camps, reported in 1989 that
 Buddhism is still repressed by the Khmer Rouge outside of Site
 8. Christianity and Islam were even more ruthlessly
 suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when it controlled the country
 and are not known to have been revived in Khmer
 Rouge-controlled areas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The PRK'has attempted to control tightly all travel within
 areas under its authority through systems of neighborhood
 surveillance, family registration, and identification
 documents. Despite formal regulations governing movements of
 families and individuals, there is a growing ability to travel
 within Cambodia as evidenced by the expanding domestic trade.
 However, checkpoints are still ubiquitous, and bribes as well
 as passes are required to pass through them.
 Permission is required to travel abroad, and it is rarely
 granted except for officigl business. Cambodians seeking to
 leave the country to escape the conflict flee to the Thai
 border or to U.N.-supported refugee or displaced persons camps
 in Thailand. The regime routinely imprisons those caught
 attempting to flee as well as those believed to be returning
 from border camps affiliated with the CGDK.
 
 
 799
 CAMBODIA
 Most of the several hundred thousand Cambodian refugees who
 fled to Thailand before 1980 have been approved for
 resettlement and- have departed for Western countries.
 However, over 11,000 Cambodians approved for refugee status
 but deemed "non-resettleable"--generally because of close
 contacts with the Khmer Rouge regime before 1978--remain at
 the Khao-I-Dang holding center in Thailand. Another 291,000
 Cambodians--generally those who have fled since 1980--are
 considered "displaced persons" and remain in other camps on
 the Thai-Cambodian border. The PRK regime has agreed in
 principle to accept returning displaced persons from camps in
 Thailand. During 1989, 20 displaced persons were repatriated
 from Thailand to Cambodia.
 The Khmer Rouge tightly controls movement within areas under
 its control. During 1989 some Khmer Rouge nonassisted camps
 were relocated, in some cases to "hidden" locations closer to
 the border. There are indications that these moves may be
 only interim steps to the Khmer Rouge objective of
 transferring some of its population back into Cambodia.
 Defectors reported in 1989 that the civilian populations in
 some closed Khmer Rouge border camps,.especially in the south,
 are not allowed to leave the camps. Those attempting to
 escape run the risk of being shot by Khmer Rouge guards.
 Along the northern border, however, many Khmer.RoUge were seen
 walking freely along roads on their way to new camps,
 including the U.N.-assisted camp of An Trao. Also, residents
 of the Khmer Rouge camp at Site 8 are often allowed to leave
 the camp each day to work for Thai farmers.
 The Khmer Rouge limits access by international organizations
 and voluntary agency personnel to camps under its control in
 Thailand. International organizations continued their appeals
 to the Thai Government in 1989 for greater access to
 Cambodians in closed camps. In January the Thai Government
 agreed to create U.N.-assisted camps for civilians under Khmer
 Rouge control in the northern and southern sectors of the
 border--at Au Trao and Site K respectively, similar to Site 8
 in the central area. This decision resulted in the number of
 Khmer Rouge civilians in U.N.-assisted camps rising to around
 73,000 in October, up from 51,500 at the end of 1988.
 Freedom of movement is also restricted in the non-Communist
 camps. Residents wishing to move-to a camp controlled by a
 different faction must obtain permission from the camp
 leadership or leave surreptitiously. International
 organizations and voluntary agencies have good access to
 NCR-affiliated camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cambodians do not have the right to change their government.
 The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party controls political
 life in the majority of the country. Elections have been
 staged by the PRK regime to attempt to demonstrate legitimacy
 as well as the relative status of leaders by varying reported
 percentages of the "vote." Although National Assembly members
 are~supposed to serve terms of 4 years (the second round of
 elections should have been held in 1986), no elections have
 been held since 1982. There were various announcements by the
 regime during 1989 that elections would take place before the
 end of the year. At year's end, no date for elections had
 been set. The PRK regime has asserted that the scheduling of
 elections is pending external diplomatic developments.

 CAM.BODIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discriminationand Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the Khmer'Rouge record of atrocities. In
 February 1988, the Commission adopted the latest in a series
 of resolutions on Cambodia, reiterating its condemnation of
 persistent violatiQns of human rights and reaffirming that
 Cambodia's occupation by foreign forces deprives the people of
 Cambodia of their right to self-determination.
 With the exception of a brief visit in August 1989 by the
 Cambodia Documentation Commission to investigate past Khmer
 Rouge atrocities, the PRK authorities have not permitted
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. The regime
 has not responded to requests by the Lawyers Committee for
 Human Rights and by AI to visit regime-controlled areas.
 Repeated pequests by the ICRC to visit detainees under PRK
 control have never been granted. Local Red Cross
 organizations exist, but neither they nor any other groups
 have a role in the protection of human rights. The Khmer
 Rouge also does not permit investigations of the human rights
 situation in areas under its control, except in U.N.-assisted
 camps.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Directives issued by the PRK regime in 1982 seemed to accord a
 privileged status to Vietnamese immigrants; there have been
 reports of Vietnamese taking advantage of this privileged
 status to force Cambodians out of desirable occupations or off
 of property. Cambodians arriving on the border in 1988
 frequently reported that Vietnamese in the cities continued to
 supplant Cambodian merchants, and this privileged status
 appeared to continue to be backed by the Phnom Penh
 authorities. Many Vietnamese moved into Cambodia to join
 other returning residents who had been expelled during the
 Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge periods. Most are traders or
 fishermen, but a large group of Vietnamese farmers have
 settled on rich marshland in Takeo Province.
 In 1989, however, with the announced departure of Vietnamese
 troops, many Vietnamese merchants and settlers began to leave
 for Vietnam, apparently believing that the regime would not or
 could not protect them. The CGDK has repeatedly claimed there
 are up to 1.2 million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and
 demands that they must all depart the country before a peace
 settlement can be reached. There is no independent, verified
 data on the number of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia.
 There is nb specific information available on discrimination
 of other types, including violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Cambodia do not enjoy the right of association and
 have no right to establish and join organizations of their own
 choosing. Organized labor is totally under the PRK's control,
 
 
 801
 CAMBODIA
 and industries have organized branches of the official "Trade
 Union for National Salvation." The "Kampuchean Federation of
 Trade Unions" is an official mass organization headed by
 Communist Party politburo member Mat Ly. As far as can be
 determined, there is no right to strike.
 Cambodia became a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1969 but has ratified neither ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association nor Convention 98 on
 Collective Bargaining. The PRK regime has not supplied any
 information on unratified Conventions to the ILO in 5 years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no right to collective bargaining in Cambodia. The
 PRK has not established any economic incentive zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is commonly used by the PRK, although not
 primarily as a sanction or means of racial, social, or other
 discrimination. Although the use of forced labor appeared to
 decrease in 1989, the regime still conscripted thousands of
 laborers to clear brush, cut timber, and build roads.
 The decrease in the number of forced laborers during 1989
 appeared to result from the institution of a nationwide
 military draft. There were many reports of young men being
 taken forcibly and sent directly to the front, with minimal or
 no training. One student who fled to Thailand to escape the
 draft reported that the authorities deliberately failed
 students in his school to force them into the military. This
 mass conscription policy has resulted in many of those subject
 to the draft fleeing to Thailand. On one day in 1989, 119 PRK
 defectors crossed into Thailand.
 The Khmer Rouge also requires labor from all persons under its
 control, including women, children, and the handicapped.
 Khmer Rouge civilian defectors continued to report in 1989
 that they were forced to carry supplies and ammunition into
 the interior of Cambodia in support of military operations,
 saying they were punished if they failed to comply.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no known minimum age for the employment of children.
 Children are regularly employed as soon as they are physically
 able to perform the tasks required.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No attention appears to have been given by PRK authorities to
 ensure acceptable conditions of work, and there is little
 information on this subject. Wage scales for the few
 industrial and government workers are set by the regime and
 are universally regarded as insufficient, forcing employees to
 supplement their wages in other manners.
