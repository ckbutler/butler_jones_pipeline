 MADAGASCAR
 The Democratic Republic of Madagascar is governed by President
 Didier Ratsiraka, who has been in power since 1975, and the
 National Popular Assembly. The President and Assembly
 deputies are elected by universal direct suffrage for 7- and
 5-year terms respectively. The President selects the members
 of the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), which is the
 executive branch's policymaking body.  He won reelection in
 1989 with 63 percent of the vote, and his position is further
 enhanced by the influence of his political party, the Vanguard
 of the Malagasy Revolution (AREMA), which controls the
 National Assembly.
 In January the SRC promulgated, and in July the National
 Assembly passed, Ordinance 90-001 which permitted the creation
 of political parties outside of the now defunct National Front
 for the Defense of the Revolution (NFDR), which formerly
 grouped several parties, with widely varying political
 platforms, under a common umbrella of socialism. Yaced with a
 growing and increasingly outspoken opposition, the NFDR was
 reorganized into the Militant Front for Malagasy Socialism
 (MFMS) on July 21, 1990. By the end of the year, 30 political
 parties were registered in Madagascar, including 16 opposed to
 the MFMS. The maj-or parties in the opposition, call for the
 creation of Western-style democracy, further economic
 liberalization, and reform of the Constitutiom to remove all
 references to socialism.
 The gendarmerie (rural police) and the national polrce (urban
 police) are responsible for internal security. The President
 has under his direct control the Directorate General of
 Documentation and Economic Investigations (DGIDIE), or
 security service. The DGIDIE and the police have reportedly
 employed physical mistreatment of detainees, particularly
 during interrogation.
 Agriculture dominates the Malagasy economy. About 85 percent
 of the population-is employed in the agriculture sector which
 in turn provides about 80 percent of the country's export-
 earnings. In 1990, to encourage both greater domestic and
 foreign investment, the Government enacted a new investment
 code and an export processing zone law. Despite some modest
 gains, personal incomes remain abysmally low, and unemployment
 remains high, particularly among youth (60 percent of the
 population is under age 25).
 In 1990 the AREMA-dominated Government moved forward in a
 carefully controlled manner with its program of political
 reform. It permitted a reorganization of the old National
 Front and the formation of many new political parties, but it
 firmly rejected opposition calls to move up presidential and
 parliamentary elections before 1996 and 1994 respectively.
 The independent press continued to operate freely and to be
 critical of the Government. Press censorship, suspended in
 1989, was legally abolished with passage of the new
 Communications Charter by the National Assembly in December.
 The new Charter contains elements which significantly increase
 press freedom, but other aspects of the Charter could place
 limitations on the media, depending upon their implementation.
 The Government permitted the Christian Council of Churches to
 hold two national conventions of what the Council called the
 "nation's active forces" to discuss a wide range of topics,
 including constitutional reform. Opposition parties held
 regular public meetings. During an armed takeover of the
 
 
 204
 MADAGASCAR
 national radio station in May, some police without
 authorization by superiors fired on a stone-throwing crowd,
 killing 6 and injuring 44 (see Section l.a.). The authorities
 conducted an investigation into the shootings. There was no
 indication whether the police involved were found guilty and
 punished.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings. The Government
 arrested a group of 14 persons after an armed takeover of the
 national television and radio station in Antananarivo on May
 13. Court authorities subsequently released four of these
 persons on bail. The trial in December of the 14 resulted in
 acquittal of 2 persons, with the remainder receiving sentences
 ranging from 6 to 30 months' imprisonment. Some police fired
 without authorization on a crowd gathered outside the radio
 station, some of whom had begun to stone police, killing 6 and
 injuring 44.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The DGIDIE, police, and gendarmes have been known to beat
 suspects in their custody. The DGIDIE, in particular, has had
 a reputation for ruthless treatment of detainees, frequently
 during interrogation. In May the DGIDIE was reorganized with
 the objective of curbing past abuses, and a new director
 appointed, a well-respected jurist and diplomat, who is also
 the head of Madagascar's Human Rights Commission.
 Conditions in Malagasy prisons are harsh. The diet provided
 is inadequate, and family members of prisoners must augment
 daily food rations. Those prisoners without relatives in the
 prison vicinity sometimes go for several days without food.
 Prisoners suffer a wide range of medical problems that are not
 routinely treated, including malnourishment, infections,
 malaria, and tuberculosis. The prison death toll rises
 significantly during the winter months. A number of children
 live in the prisons with their mothers. The Minister of
 Justice has appealed for international assistance to help
 ameliorate these conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In a normal criminal case, the accused must be charged or
 released within 3 days after arrest. Generally, defendants in
 ordinary criminal cases are charged formally within the
 specified time frame and, upon being charged, are allowed to
 obtain an attorney. Counsel is readily available, and
 court-appointed counsel is provided for indigents.
 Under Malagasy law, persons suspected of activity against the
 State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to
 indefinite extension if considered necessary by the
 
 
 205
 MADAGASCAR
 Government. At the end of 1990, there were no persons being
 held under this provision of law. Bail may be requested by
 the accused or by his attorney immediately after arrest, or
 after being formally charged, or during the appeal process.
 Of those arrested following the May 13 takeover of the radio
 station, four were released on bail.
 On June 25, President Ratsiraka by executive order released
 two former gendarmerie officers who had been imprisoned since
 1977 and convicted in 1983 of plotting against the security of
 the State, possession of unauthorized arms, and other
 charges. Immediately following their release, the two left
 for France. There was speculation that they may have been
 exiled as part of the agreement for their release. Neither
 man has spoken publicly about the conditions for his release.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and in
 practice the judiciary seems to function in most cases without
 outside influence from the executive. The judiciary has three
 levels of courts: lower courts for civil and criminal cases
 carrying limited fines and sentences; a court of appeals which
 includes a criminal court for cases carrying sentences of 5
 years or more; and a Supreme Court. The judiciary also has a
 number of special courts designed to handle specific kinds of
 cases under the jurisdiction of the higher courts. A
 Constitutional High Court, with a totally separate andy
 autonomous status, may review the constitutionality of laws,
 decrees, and ordinances, and the legality of elections.
 A Military Court has jurisdiction over all cases involving
 national security. The definition of national security is
 largely a matter of interpretation by the authorities but
 includes acts constituting a threat to the nation and its
 political leaders, invasion by foreign forces, and riots that
 could lead to an overthrow of the Government. In exceptional
 cases, civilians may be tried in the Military Court if they
 are charged with having broken military laws. Military
 courts, like civilian courts, provide for an appeal process.
 Furthermore, military courts are presided over by a civilian
 magistrate. The rank of the four military officers comprising
 the court is determined by the rank of the accused.
 There were no political prisoners in Madagascar at year's
 end. Of the 14 persons arrested following the May 13 takeover
 of the radio station, 4 were released on bail. The trial
 began on December 18 and resulted in acquittal for two of the
 defendants, while the others received sentences ranging from 6
 months' imprisdnment for unlawfully occupying a public
 building to 30 months' imprisonment for unlawfully occupying a
 public building, possession of unauthorized firearms, and
 possession of a false national identity card.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not generally itervene in the private aspects
 of the lives of the people. The home is traditionally
 inviolable under Malagasy law. However, in December 1989,
 Article 42 of the Constitution was amended to permit
 authorities to enter the homes of persons caught in a criminal
 act or who explicitly consent to a search. In the course of
 suppressing cattle rustlers and bandits, military authorities
 without court orders have entered and ransacked some homes.
 
 
 206
 MADAGASCAR
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There was noticeable improvement in these areas in 1990. With
 increasing frequency, opposition figures publicly denounced
 the Government and called for the revision of the Charter of
 the Socialist Revolution. Viewpoints were openly debated and
 discussed in public forums, including in the National Assembly.
 While the new Communications Charter provides for private
 ownership of radio and television stations, the broadcast
 media are at present under state control and usually provide
 positive coverage of the Government's activities while
 limiting coverage of opposition activities. A weekly radio
 discussion program which features prominent figures has
 included opposition party leaders. The new Communications
 Charter requires government broadcast media to present a
 variety of opinions.
 In 1990 there were seven major independent dailies in
 Antananarivo as well as eight major weeklies (one of which is
 government owned). Additionally, local magazines were
 published periodically. In past years, the Ministry of
 Interior reviewed and censored the content of newspapers--both
 official and independent--prior to printing. The President's
 suspension of censorship in February 1989 was followed in
 December 1990 by passage in the National Assembly of a new
 Communications Charter which abolished censorship and further
 strengthened freedom of information. Among its positive
 provisions, the Charter removes all references to the
 requirement to respect revolutionary principles of socialism,
 allows journalists to protect sources unless a court
 determines that national security is involved, requires the
 government media to give coverage to a variety of viewpoints,
 and allows private radio and television stations. On the
 other hand, the Charter contains other provisions--such as
 heavy fines and long prison sentences for defamation and
 libel--which could place limitations on the media. Throughout
 1990, foreign news publications, primarily in French, were
 readily available at major hotels and bookstores.
 Academic freedom is in theory restricted by a constitutional
 prohibition, now largely ignored, of any public lectures or
 teachings which condemn the Charter of the Socialist
 Revolution. However, for the first time since 1977, high
 school students during their August final exams were exempted
 from answering questions on Marxism and Socialist thought.
 Marxism is not in the syllabus for the 1990-91 academic year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While political opposition meetings are increasingly common,
 some restrictions remain on the right of assembly and
 association. Permits are required to hold public meetings and
 can be denied by the Government if officials believe that the
 meeting poses a threat to the State or endangers national
 security. Immediately following the May 13 radio station
 takeover, the Government temporarily suspended permits for all
 outdoor functions and meetings, including political meetings
 and concerts and cultural events.
 All new political parties are required to register with the
 Ministry of Interior. No political parties were denied
 registration during the year. The Government granted permits
 
 
 207
 MADAGASCAR
 to all political parties and religious organizations wishing
 to hold public meetings, including those known to be critical
 of the Government. Party congresses and other meetings such
 as the "national concert" took place in 1990 (see Section
 2.c.).
 University student associations meet freely. Large numbers of
 students frequently gathered without permits during July and
 August to protest the Government's program of university
 rehabilitation which included the removal of unregistered
 'students" from student housing.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The
 Government is secular, and there is no discrimination on the
 basis of religious affiliation. Between 4a and 50 percent of
 the population adheres to Christian beliefs, with the
 remainder following traditional Malagasy beliefs, Islam, and
 other faiths. Religious publications are allowed, and the
 Catholic weekly Lakroa has often been blunt in its criticism
 of the Government. Missionaries and clergy are generally
 permitted to operate freely.
 The Christian Council of Churches (FFKM), which is  composed of
 the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, and Church of Jesus Christ
 Churches, provided a major setting for a nationwide debate on
 issues of national importance. The first meeting, termed a
 "national concert" meeting, was held in August, with a
 follow-up session in December.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Officially there is no restriction on travel within the
 country. Persons in the southwest who previously needed
 permission to travel outside of their villages during the
 height of the anticattle rustling campaign may now travel
 freely. For all Malagasy, official approval must be obtained
 for trips outside the country. All residents of Madagascar
 (Malagasy and foreign) require exit visas issued by the
 Ministry of Interior, but these are seldom denied. Foreign
 travel is impeded by the difficulty of obtaining foreign
 currency for that purpose. The Malagasy franc (FMG) is not
 convertible abroad, and the Government limits to about $125
 the amount of hard currency that can be obtained annually for
 foreign travel. There is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In November the National Assembly passed Ordinance 90-017
 which revised the electoral code to allow all political
 parties and political groups to present candidates in all
 future elections. Coupled with the passage of Ordinance
 90-001, which permitted the establishment of political parties
 outside of the now defunct National Front for the Defense of
 the Revolution, these changes led to a proliferation of new
 political parties in 1990. These ordinances, if fully
 implemented, hold the potential to enhance significantly the
 ability of the people to exercise their right to change their
 government.
 Two large political groupings began to form in 1990 around the
 government-affiliated Militant Front for Malagasy Socialism
 
 
 208
 MADAGASCAR
 (MFMS) and the so-called opposition platform, but deep
 divisions began to develop among the parties in the latter
 group. Inasmuch as the last elections were held in 1989 prior
 to the passage of Ordinance 90-001, opposition parties have
 called for new elections in advance of the next regularly
 scheduled ones (1994 for the National Assembly and 1996 for
 the President). President Ratsiraka, with the vast majority
 of deputies in the National Popular Assembly having been
 elected as AREMA candidates, has successfully resisted those
 demands.
 In its May-July session, the National Popular Assembly began
 to assert itself somewhat. Initial steps were taken to
 introduce legislation beyond items presented by the executive
 branch. Opposition parties introduced four minor pieces of
 legislation, which were passed, and voted against accepting
 the Government's report of its activities. A large number of
 AREMA party deputies called for greater accountability from
 the executive branch. At its December session, the debate in
 the National Assembly on the new Communications Charter was
 lively, with government spokesmen closely questioned by
 opposition and governing party legislators alike. Amendments
 offered by both groups were adopted and modified the
 Government's draft legislation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has historically not cooperated with groups,
 either externally or internally based, wishing to investigate
 alleged human rights violations. It denied visas to Amnesty
 International (AI) representatives in the early 1980's. Human
 rights organizations are considered to be political groups
 under Malagasy law and must register with the Government. No
 independent local human rights groups were active in 1990.
 The Christian churches in the country have advocated human
 rights and in 1989 served as electoral observers. They did
 not, however, publicly challenge or criticize government human
 rights policies.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Madagascar is inhabited by approximately 11 million people.
 The Malagasy are a mix of Malayo-Polynesian and African
 origins. The Malagasy are divided into 18 ethnocultural
 groups based on regional and ancestral affiliation. While
 legal discrimination does not exist, favoritism based on
 regional origin is often a determining factor in selecting
 personnel for positions in ministries and the private sector.
 A large Indo-Pakistani community has been in Madagascar since
 the earlier part of this century. Of Gujurati Muslim origin,
 this group is primarily engaged in commerce. Numbering about
 24,000 persons, they have often felt the brunt of resentment
 from Malagasy during economically hard times. There were no
 reported instances of violence specifically directed towards
 this community in 1990. However, many Malagasy mistrust and
 criticize these Indo-Pakistanis for holding themselves apart
 from the mainstream of Malagasy life. Few have integrated
 into local society, preferring to retain their language,
 religion, and culture, and most have opted to retain French
 rather than Malagasy citizenship.
 
 
 209
 MADAGASCAR
 Women have traditionally played a prominent role in the
 business and economic life of the country, with many of them
 managing or owning business concerns or filling management
 positions in state industries. Education at all levels is
 open to women. However, women in rural areas and among the
 urban- poor face a greater degree of hardship, bearing the
 traditional responsibilities of raising a family and engaging
 in farm labor or other subsistence activities.
 On July 11, the National Popular Assembly passed additional
 legislation dealing with the rights of married women. The new
 law permits wives an equal say in choosing where a married
 couple will reside. The, Malagasy Family Code was also revised
 to give women a more equitable distribution of marital
 property in divorce cases as well as in disputes involving the
 custody of children. In the case of the death of a husband, a
 wife now inherits one-half of the joint marital wealth. A
 widow receives a pension; however, a widower does not. There
 are no specific women's rights groups in Madagascar, but
 groups of professional women and women's branches of political
 parties continue to work towards additional changes in the
 Malagasy Family Code.
 According to various sources, including magistrates,
 journalists, and women doctors, violence against women, such
 as wife beating, is not widespread, and neither the Government
 nor womens' organizations have addressed this issue
 specifically. The society frowns on marital confrontation.
 Married couples generally prefer to avoid divorce and, if
 necessary, to live separate lives under one roof. In very few
 divorce cases is there an allegation of physical abuse that
 could be construed as wife beating. In the rare cases where
 this condition is detected, police and legal authorities do
 intervene. However, there is no law dealing specifically with
 violence against women. Female circumcision is not practiced
 in Madagascar.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Malagasy have the right in law and in practice to
 establish and join labor unions. Unions are required to
 register with the Government, and registration is routinely
 granted. However, the labor force of 4.9 million is mostly
 agrarian (85 percent), and unionized labor accounts for less
 than 5 percent of the total. Seven of the approximately 20
 national labor organizations in existence are affiliated with
 the political parties that composed the National Front for the
 Defense of the Revolution, and two nonaffiliated unions in the
 past signed a protocol of agreement with the dominant
 political union belonging to the President's party. The
 primary focus of the unions is party politics, and they are
 usually active only during election campaigns. In spite of
 political liberalization, there was very little union
 activity, and no new unions were organized in 1990. Overall,
 labor unions play an insignificant role in national life.
 Public servants may not form independent trade unions but may
 join "Malagasy Revolutionary Organizations" under the
 supervision of the Government. The Committee of Experts of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) asked the
 Government to take appropriate measures to ensure that public
 servants can establish organizations without prior
 authorization or other restrictions. It also asked the
 
 
 210
 MADAGASCAR
 Government to introduce legislation explicitly guaranteeing
 the trade union rights of seafarers; no government action was
 known to have occurred in response to this request.
 Workers have the legal right to strike, but strikes are a
 rarity because of the severe unemployment problem and the
 politicization of the labor federations. There are occasional
 wildcat strikes. In these, the Government generally sides
 with management for the restoration of order. The Labor Code,
 which covers all workers except civil servants and merchant
 marine employees, prescribes an arbitration procedure which
 must be followed in labor/management disputes. Should this
 procedure not lead to a settlement, workers individually, or
 as represented by a union, may in theory call a strike.
 Several of the union organizations are members of the World
 Confederation of Labor or of the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions. One, the Confederation of
 Malagasy Workers, has links with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Union activity is governed by the Labor Code of 1975 which
 provides for free unions and the right to bargain
 collectively. The Labor Code formally prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers. It also states that collective bargaining may be
 undertaken between management and labor at either party's
 behest. When there is failure to reach agreement, the
 Ministry of Labor convenes a committee of employment
 inspectors who attempt to resolve the matter. If this process
 fails, the committee refers the matter to the Chairman of the
 First Circuit Court for final arbitration. As noted above,
 workers' interests are not represented equally in this
 process. Collective bargaining agreements are not routinely
 negotiated. The minimum wage is set by the Government. Other
 wages are negotiated between employers and employees.
 While there are no geographic export processing zones (EPZ's)
 operating yet in Madagascar, there are companies operating
 under the 1989 legislation authorizing the creation of such
 EPZ's. Labor laws are applied uniformly throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is explicitly prohibited by Article 2 of the
 Labor Code and is not practiced. The ILO in 1990, as it has
 on previous occasions, again urged the Government to amend its
 legislation regarding prison labor and compulsory national
 service to bring it into conformity with ILO Convention 29 on
 forced labor which Madagascar ratified in 1960.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code describes a child as any person under the age
 of 18. The minimum age for employment is 14, and the use of
 child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is
 apparent and imminent danger. The Government enforces these
 child labor laws relatively effectively in the small wage
 sector through inspectors from the Ministry of Civil Service,
 Labor, and Social Law. However, in the large subsistence
 agricultural sector many young children work with their
 parents on family farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in
 
 
 211
 MADAGASCAR
 the urban areas many children earn a living as parking
 attendants, newspaper vendors, and through other street
 trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code and its enforcing legislation prescribe the
 working conditions for employees. Malagasy law distinguishes
 between agricultural and nonagricultural work. There is a
 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service industries.
 There are also provisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity
 leave, and insurance. There are several legal minimum wage
 rates in Madagascar according to categories of work. The
 lowest (for unskilled workers) is approximately $24 per month
 and is inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living.
 Accordingly, such workers must supplement their incomes
 through subsistence agriculture or reliance on the extended
 family structure.
 The Labor Code has rules concerning building safety, machinery
 and moving engines, operational safety, and sanitation
 standards. It appears that, in practice, the rules and
 regulations of the Code are generally adhered to by employers
 and are enforced by the authorities. Labor inspectors from
 the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Law carry out
 regular visits to industrial work sites. Violations of
 safety, sanitary, operational, and other work code laws are
 the subject of reports by these inspectors. If the violations
 are not remedied within the specified time frame, the
 violators are legally charged and subject to various
 penalties.
