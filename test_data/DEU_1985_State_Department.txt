 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a modern and stable
 parliamentary democracy. On the national level, there is
 separation of power between executive, legislative, and
 judicial branches. There is also division of governmental
 authority between national and state governments. The latter
 retain significant autonomy, especially in matters relating to
 police and judiciary, culture and education, the environment,
 and social assistance. The head of government, the
 Chancellor, is elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of
 Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and of the
 Parliament, which are substantial, are set down in the
 Constitution (Basic Law) adopted in 1949. The Bundestag is
 elected through a mixture of direct constituency candidates
 and party lists. Members of the second house of Parliament,
 or Bundesrat, are appointed by the state governments.
 The Federal Republic has been ruled since its creation by a
 number of governments headed by one of the two major parties,
 the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the Social Democratic
 Party (SPD). The current Government is led by a coalition of
 the Christian Democratic Union, joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union, and the Free Democratic
 Party. The SPD is the leading opposition party.
 Organized essentially at the state (Land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, the police are
 highly disciplined and scrupulously respect human rights. In
 dealing with hostile elements, including terrorists, special
 care is taken to respect the rights of the accused.
 The economy of the country is highly industrialized. The
 population is highly educated and enjoys one of the highest
 standards of living in the world. The Government of the
 Federal Republic scrupulously protects human rights. It does
 not subordinate women or any other social group.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including:
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government or by
 constitutional political organizations is unknown. However,
 terrorist groups on the far left (Baader-Meinhof and its
 successor groups, including the Red Army Faction - RAF) and
 the far right (neo-Nazi groups) have in the past engaged in
 political violence. There were four politically motivated
 assassinations in the FRG during 1985: German industrialist
 Dr. Ernst Zimmermann by RAF terrorists in Munich on
 February 1; Libyan opposition politician Gebril Denali by
 unknown terrorists in Bonn on April 6; Moroccan citizen
 Mustafa Talmine by a Libyan national in Aachen on April 13;
 and U.S. soldier Edward F. Pimental by RAF terrorists in
 Wiesbaden, on August 8.
 Other politically motivated actions ending in deaths included
 the bomb attacks at the Frankfurt airport on June 19,
 resulting in 4 deaths and 46 injured, and at the U.S.
 Rhein-Main airbase in Frankfurt by RAF terrorists, resulting
 in 2 deaths and 17 injured.

 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 In two attempted bomb attacks, the bombs exploded prematurely,
 killing the persons planting the bombs, on January 20 in
 Stuttgart-Vaihingen and on June I in Hannover.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities have not abducted or
 secretly arrested persons. There have been no kidnapings by
 political terrorist groups for several years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment. Prison conditions are not substandard.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested in the Federal Republic except on
 the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial
 authority. Any person arrested by the police must be brought
 before a judge and charged no later than the end of the day
 following the day of apprehension. There is no preventive
 detention except that a prisoner may be detained no longer
 than 24 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is
 evidence that he might seek to flee the country to avoid
 prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel has
 been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who have
 used contacts with lawyers to promote and continue terrorist
 activity even while in prison. Only judges may decide on the
 admissibility or continuation of any deprivation of liberty.
 Bail bond exists in the Federal Republic but is seldom
 employed. The Basic Law prohibits forced labor, and there
 have been no complaints of violations in 1985.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 may be undertaken only after authorization by a court order.
 Mail is not monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is also
 unrestricted. There is no censorship of fbreign or domestic
 books. In April, the Bundestag amended the law on defamation
 
 
 990
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 to make illegal any denial of the fact of Nazi crimes or the
 crimes of other tyrannies. Newspapers and magazines are
 privately owned. Radio and television networks and stations
 exist, for the most part, as corporations. They are governed
 by independent boards made up of representatives of churches,
 political parties, and other organizations. A few
 experimental private cable television, stations and local cable
 television networks have been set up. Legislation is under
 consideration in some German states to facilitate and
 encourage private television stations using cable, satellites,
 and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits
 beforehand and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the
 repair of any damage to public facilities. When demonstrators
 have not obtained the required permits, police have exercised
 considerable restraint, showing concern ultimately only for
 the continued functioning of public facilities and for the
 safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is completely free. Parties
 found to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" may be outlawed.
 Under this constitutionally based provision, the
 Constitutional Court, in the 1950's, declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely in the Federal Republic. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 40 percent of the eligible work force
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation represents over
 80 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their
 historic role as the protector of workers' rights and a
 bulwark of the democratic system. They actively participate
 in the International Labor Organization and in international
 trade union organizations.
 The Moscow-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions,
 claiming that the FRG practice of excluding alleged political
 extremists from employment in the FRG civil service violates
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 111, has
 lodged a complaint with the international body. An
 ILO-appointed Commission of Inquiry is expected to conduct an
 investigation in 1986. The German practice is based on the
 special oath of allegiance of civil servants to defend
 actively the State, its institutions, and laws, and stems from
 a 1972 joint resolution by the Federal and state governments.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The practice of religion is completely free. Major religious
 groups benefit from a state-administered church tax system.
 The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools. Personal
 religious affiliation today plays an insignificant role in
 politics and commercial life. Members of all religions can be
 found in all political parties.

 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Germans who arrive in
 the Federal Republic from the German Democratic Republic are
 treated as German citizens and therefore may take up residence
 without restrictions. The number of resettlers from the
 German Democratic Republic in 1985 was less than in 1984
 (40,974) but still about double the level of 1983 (11,343).
 The Federal Republic regards itself as the homeland of all
 ethnic Germans and actively encourages the immigration of
 ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe.
 The Federal Republic remains a favorite destination for both
 political and other refugees. Since 1982 the Government has
 sought to restrict illegal immigration and abuse of political
 asylum status. Nevertheless, after a drop in political asylum
 applications between 1980 and 1983, the number increased
 substantially and is estimated to reach 70,000-80,000 in
 1985. Meanwhile, the Government continues the measures
 introduced in 1981, such as denial of work permits and some
 social services, to make emigration to the Federal Republic
 less attractive for so-called economic refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the stable and liberal parliamentary democracy
 established by the Basic Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by
 a government chosen by the people through orderly elections
 based on universal suffrage. Election participation is
 usually in the range of 90 percent of eligible voters.
 Candidates for public office are normally members of political
 parties but are not required to be. Because of the negative
 experience with splinter parties under the Weimar Republic,
 the Basic Law and the state constitutions contain provisions
 that only parties achieving at least 5 percent of the vote can
 be represented in the Federal and state Parliaments. New
 political parties are free to form and enter the political
 process. The Greens, a party concerned about the environment
 and present in the Bundestag since the elections of 1983, is
 the most recent party to exceed the 5 percent threshold.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The International Society for Human Rights, Amnesty
 International, and other smaller human rights organizations
 freely conduct their activities in the Federal Republic.
 Amnesty International's organization in the Federal Republic
 continues to express concern about several cases in which
 conscientious objectors were sentenced to jail and about
 instances in which convicted terrorists have been placed under
 special restrictions in prison.
 Amnesty International's 1985 Report did not mention the FRG.
 Freedom House rated the Federal Republic "free."
 The Government considers the international promotion of human
 rights one of its highest priorities.

 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of the Federal Republic, now just over 61
 million, decreased marginally in 1984. Per capita gross
 national product was 11,430 in 1983. The Federal Republic has
 an advanced industrial mixed economy. The Government seeks to
 promote economic growth and minimize unemployment through
 monetary and fiscal policies designed to promote favorable
 business conditions.
 The social welfare system in the Federal Republic is of long
 standing and provides relatively generous benefits. The
 budgetary austerity of the past few years has resulted in some
 marginal reduction of basic social welfare benefits, which
 include old age and disability pensions, unemployment
 compensation, and medical care. Life expectancy at birth is
 73.7 years, and the infant mortality rate is 9.3 per 1,000
 live births (1984). There is no discrimination in the extent
 to which shelter, health care, and education are available to
 all inhabitants, regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, political opinion, or citizenship.
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under age 15 with a few specific exceptions: children aged 13
 and 14 may engage in farm work for up to 3 hours per day or
 may deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; children
 aged 3 through 14 may take part in cultural performances under
 stringent conditiona with regard to number of hours, time of
 day, and form of activity.
 In the absence of minimum wage legislation, wages generally
 conform to the pattern set in collective bargaining. There is
 federal legislation setting occupational safety and health
 standards.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal employment at the workplace. They
 play significant roles in all political parties and are
 increasingly rising to management and leadership positions in
 the private and public sectors. In organized labor, about 20
 percent of union members are women, and a woman has served as
 president of the second largest trade union since 1982.
 The majority of women, however, do not work outside the home.
 The rate of participation of women in the labor force, about
 38 percent, is below the average in the European Economic
 Community, and most working women are employed in traditional
 fields. Moreover, protective legislation bars women from
 certain heavy industrial occupations and also generally bans
 night work. Young women experience difficulties in gaining
 access to training in some traditionally male-dominated
 fields. Recent court rulings and government pilot programs
 have helped break down some of these attitudinal and
 institutional barriers.
 The Government has pursued a three-pronged policy with regard
 to foreign workers: integration of longtime residents,
 limitation of further entries, and repatriation aid for those
 willing to return to their home countries. A 9-month special
 program of repatriation aid to unemployed foreign workers, in
 the form of repatriation bonuses and reimbursement of social
 security contributions, stimulated the departure of about
 300,000 persons, reducing the foreign population to 4.4
 million in 1984. A national debate has been under way over
 
 
 993
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 whether the rights of guest workers should be broadened to
 permit unlimited residence and the right to vote or reduced by
 limiting the right of entry for dependent children.
