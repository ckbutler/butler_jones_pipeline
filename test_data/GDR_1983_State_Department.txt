 GLRMAN DEMOCFATIC REPUBLIC
 
 The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was created in
 1949 out cf the former Soviet occupation zone of Germany. bere
 are still some 400,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country.
 East Germany's Government closely resembles the Soviet model,
 and internationally recognised human rights are routinely
 suppressed. The country is ruled by the East German Communist
 Party, known as the Socialist Unity Party. It has a centrally
 planned economy and is industrialized with a relatively high
 standard of living.
 Profound historical, cultural, and family ties remain between
 the people of the German Democratic Republic and those of the
 Federal Republic of Germany. These links are kept alive by West
 German radio and television broadcasts, which can be received in
 most of East Germany, and through millions of individual visits
 annually. The concern that these ties and the constant exposure
 to Western values could undermine support for the Government is
 a central factor in East Germany's tight control of its
 populace.
 East Germany's ruling party sees it as its duty to suppress all
 forms of opposition while attempting to transform society to
 socialism. Hence, while the freedoms of speech, press,
 religion, and assembly are theoretically guaranteed in the
 Constitution, the Government does not tolerate their exercise in
 ways which contest its policy or doctrines. All important
 national decisions are made by the Communist Party. Four
 additional parties are allowed a token existence, but these have
 no power and no independence. Elections are not democratic;
 instead, voters are presented every five years with a single
 list of candidates for the Volkskammer (national parliament) and
 Volksvertretungen (local assemblies). Voting is not secret.
 East Germans who refuse to vote or who reject the entire ballot
 are apt to suffer reprisals.
 East Germany has an efficient security apparatus which is
 administered by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of
 State Security. Together, they employ approximately 270,000
 individuals. The activities of the secret police, or "Stasi,"
 are pervasive. The Stasi does not hesitate to install listening
 devices, to open private mail, to place groups and individuals
 under surveillance, or to subject people to intimidation and
 interrogation. Many East Germans, either voluntarily or under
 coercion, act as informants for the Stasi.
 Minefields, guard dogs, and electrified fences make East
 Germany's entire western border nearly impermeable. Party
 leader Erich Honecker announced in 1983 that automatic shooting
 devices along the border with West Germany would be dismantled.
 Indications are, however, that the border will continue to be
 effectively sealed, and any who attempt unauthorized crossing
 risk death.
 During 1983, East Germany showed signs of easing some of its
 restrictions on the country's churches. The state is officially
 atheistic, but it tolerates religious worship and activity so
 long as these do not address "political" concerns. In 1983, the
 Government cosponsored celebrations of the 500th anniversary of
 Martin Luther's birth with the Lutheran Church, to which over
 half the population belongs. During this Luther Year, church
 leaders were allowed a somewhat greater latitude in discussing
 
 (985)
 
 
 986
 subjects, such as the environment and peace, which the
 Gcvernment considers sensitive. The Government responded with
 harassment and arrests, however, to attempts to forge links
 between the churches and the unofficial or "autonomous" peace
 movement, which it viewed as a rival to its own, official
 positions on disarmament and peace. Unauthorized peace
 demonstrations, which occurred in East Berlin and other cities,
 were immediately dispersed by police, and the demonstrators were
 sometimes jailed.
 There are an estimated 5,000 political prisoners in East
 Germany, most of whom were jailed for trying to leave the
 country without permission or for submitting an application to
 leave. Despite this, there was a marked increase in the number
 of exit applications submitted in 1983. At least 684 political
 prisoners were sentenced between January I and October /, 1983.
 Some were released to West Germany following payment of a fee.
 East Germany is a member of the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe. It distributed the text of the Madrid
 Conference's concluding document in Neues Deutschland, the
 party's national daily. The Government issued new ordinances in
 a step to bring its migration laws into compliance with its
 strict interpretation of the document's provisions on this
 matter. Past experience, however, indicates that it will take
 only the most limited steps to comply with the broader human
 rights provisions of the Madrid and Helsinki agreements.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 A 1982 law codified orders to border guards that they should
 shoot, if necessary, to prevent a person from attempting to
 leave East Germany without authorization. There have been
 several confirmed deaths from such shootings since 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance in East Germany
 during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of systematic torture in East Germany in
 1983.   Specific laws state that the life, health, and ability
 to work of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized
 during confinement. However, former detainees and prisoners
 have reported physical abuse and excessive psychological strain
 in East German prisons. Arrestees have reported long,
 uninterrupted interrogations without sleep, food, and drink,
 followed by threats and demands to sign statements or blank
 pieces of paper. There are allegations of high suicide rates in
 prisons, but the Government has not published suicide statistics
 since 1976.
 The West German-based Salzgitter Center, which monitors prison
 conditions in East Germany, reported in 1983 that there were 84
 
 
 987
 infringements on the rights of prisoners and at least one case
 of severe maltreatment in 1982.  Prisoners arrested on political
 charges, as well as an estimated 200 young men currently
 imprisoned for refusing to perform military service, are often
 placed in cells with hardened criminals. There have been
 reports that inmates in the Zeitahein Prison have been forced to
 work under unsafe conditions at a steel mill in Riesa.
 Fragmentary information derived mainly from former inmates who
 have emigrated indicates that there are also instances of
 beatings and other similar forms of physical mistreatment by
 individual guards.
 Prison conditions are reportedly inadequate in several respects,
 including overcrowding in cells, poor food, and inadeguate
 sanitary facilities. Prisoners are supposed to have access to
 medical facilities, but service is often slow and relatively
 poor in ouality. There are allegations of a scarcity of
 medication and of treatment by personnel with little or no
 medical training.
 Prisoners, except for those being punished for violations of
 prison regulations, are generally allowed to have two visitors a
 month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In practice, the police and secret police have blanket authority
 to detain and interrogate East Germans on suspicion. Arrest and
 conviction may result when people merely express dissenting
 views. East Germans who become particularly active are
 sometimes subject to recurrent harassment, such as police
 interrogations on a regular basis--sometimes as often as once a
 week for long periods of time--without charges being filed
 against them.
 There is a high degree of subjectivity in the application of the
 Penal Code. The charges used in clearly political cases are
 often based on laws which are written in vague and general
 language. Section 99 of the Code, for instance, states that the
 transmission of information "detrimental to the interests of the
 German Democratic Republic" (even if it is not secret) can be
 considered treason. There are laws against "anti-state
 agitation" and "asocial behavior" (parasitism). These are often
 applied selectively against East Germans who become politically
 active. A report by the August 13 Study Group, a private West
 Berlin human rights organization, noted a trend in 1983 toward
 applying the relatively lighter charge of "public slander" in
 some cases rather than the more serious charge of "anti-state
 agitation."
 East Germans can be arrested with or without warrants. When
 held in detention, a person does not have the right to a
 judicial determination of his continued detention. Although
 there are provisions for bail, they are rarely applied. Every
 East German citizen has the right to legal counsel of his
 choosing. In practice, few East Germans make use of this right,
 and most act as their own defense. There are only a handful of
 attorneys who are willing to take on political cases.
 In late 1982 and early 1983, 17 young East Germans from Jena
 were arrested on charges ranging from anti-state agitation to
 transmission of nonsecret information to others. The youths had
 
 
 988
 been active in the autonomous peace movement and had planned to
 participate in a minute of "silence for peace" in front of a
 church on Christmas Eve. Possibly because of international
 (particularly West German) criticism which followed the arrests,
 the 17 were released after approximately two months in prison.
 Earlier, at least five people had been arrested for signing and
 passing on a petition addressed to the head of state which
 protested increasing militarism in East Germany, where military
 training is compulsory in many schools.
 In most political cases, it takes longer than 24 hours--often
 many weeks--before interested parties are notified. Some
 persons detained without charge have been held incommunicado for
 long periods of time while being investigated. According to the
 Criminal Procedure Code, the public prosecutor may postpone
 notification of the relatives and employer of a prisoner if "the
 objective of the investigation would be endangered by such-
 notification." Visiting rights by relatives are restricted and
 held under tight security provisions.
 The West Berlin-based All-German Institute (Gesamtdeutsches
 Institut), an agency of the Federal Republic's Ministry for
 Inner-German Affairs, has reported that over 2,000 East Germans
 are arrested every year for political reasons. The overwhelming
 majority of them are persons who have applied for permission to
 leave the country. Many lose their work and are unable to find
 new jobs; with few exceptions, the state controls employment.
 Some are subsequently arrested for "parasitism," and may incur a
 prison term of six months to two years.
 East.Germany does not admit to having political prisoners, nor
 does it publish statistics which would enable one to know the
 exact number of political prisoners actually held. However, the
 August 13 Study Group estimates that there are currently 5,000
 political prisoners in the country. The 1983 Amnesty
 International report stated that in 1982 that organization
 worked on behalf of about 200 prisoners of conscience in East
 Germany, and stated that the number of such prisoners may be
 much higher. The report noted that many political prisoners are
 released to West Germany upon payment of a fee.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 East German law provides for a fair, public trial for defendants
 in civil and criminal cases. In cases involving security and
 political issues, however, judges can authorize closed trials.
 Virtually all political trials are closed. On the same grounds,
 judges can ban individuals or groups from "open" trials. There
 is no hearing prior to such decisions and no appeal from them.
 Identity checks outside courtrooms by police can also result in
 de facto closed trials. Although defendants are guaranteed the
 right to a lawyer of their choice, there are many hindrances to
 effective counsel. Defendants are often not allowed to choose
 their lawyers until a few days before the trial or to discuss
 the specifics of the case with lawyers until the investigation
 is completed and formal charges are brought, which may be a
 period of months. Defense attorneys must also request
 permission to meet clients in private, and there is no guarantee
 that the recuest will be granted. Attorneys are not allowed to
 make photocopies or tape recordings of their clients' court
 file. The file can only be viewed in the court and any notes
 must be taken in longhand.
 
 
 989
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. Constitutionally, the
 courts are under the control of the Council of State; in
 reality, they are controlled by the party, which appoints the
 judges. Military courts try civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 East Germans must obtain permission from the Government to marry
 foreigners. Permission to marry a citizen of a Warsaw Pact
 nation is granted on a routine basis, but those who seek to
 marry citizens of other countries encounter serious problems.
 These applicants can lose their jobs and must usually wait long
 periods before obtaining permission to marry. Those who are
 finally granted permission are expected to emigrate without
 delay.
 Young people are not compelled to join the party's youth
 movement, the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend).
 However, school and government authorities make it clear that
 failure to join this group will limit educational and job
 opportunities.
 It is routine and legal for the state security organs, solely on
 their own authority, to tap telephones and to open mail.
 Evidence collected in this manner may be used in court. East
 German citizens often claim to be subjected to hidden tape
 recording, opening of their mail, and physical surveillance if
 they have unauthorized contacts with Westerners or in any way
 arouse the curiosity of the state security services. There is a
 widespread concern in East Germany that undercover state
 security service informers are ubiquitous.
 All printed materials require an official permit. Only
 publications bearing a postal license may be legally
 distributed. These regulations effectively block the legal
 receipt by individuals of materials not approved by the
 Government.
 By law, the police need authorization to enter and search a
 house, but the police can authorize entry themselves and the
 courts will retroactively give approval. The authorities
 reportedly do not investigate complaints of abuse. The police
 do not have to give a receipt if they confiscate materials in a
 home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights. Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All media are government controlled and censored. All
 publications must be licensed before distribution. With the
 exception of.20-30 copies of the International Herald Tribune
 sold in two East Berlin hotels serving foreigners, only
 politically acceptable publications, such as newspapers of
 Western Communist parties, are allowed in the country. Border
 officials confiscate prohibited Western publications carried by
 travel'ers to East Germany. East German citizens and travelers
 can be arrested and interrogated simply for possessing such
 publications.
 
 
 990
 Written and unwritten rules severely limit East German contact
 with Western journalists. In spite of the restrictions, the
 Government's control of information is greatly undermined
 because most East German citizens watch West German television
 and listen to West German radio broadcasts. The regime no
 longer tries to prevent its citizens from receiving these
 broadcasts. It does make a special propaganda effort to
 discredit Western media and to persuade East Germans not to
 listen.
 Individual academic freedom is not permitted in East Germany.
 The state views education as an instrument for government
 objectives, and all areas of academic inquiry are strictly
 controlled. Teachers who allow open discussions in the
 classroom or deviate from the party line are disciplined. Many
 books are prohibited totally; others are permitted only in
 university libraries to which only carefully screened and
 authorized personnel are allowed access.
 The East German ruling party considers art and literature to be
 an integral part of its revolutionary struggle, not a forum for
 expressing individual opinions or perceptions. There are
 state-run unions for artists and writers, headed by party
 officials. Literary figures who are critical of the regime are
 expelled from these associations and prevented from publishing.
 Persistently nonconformist writers and artists may face criminal
 charges. They are often encouraged to emigrate to the West.
 The display of any symbol regarded by the Government as 'harmful
 to the Socialist community" is prohibited. Church-affiliated
 young people who wear armpatches depicting the Biblical
 quotation "swords into plowshares" have been forced to remove
 the patch and have been detained by the police if they refuse.
 In September 1983, a number of East Germans placed a large
 letter "A" in their home windows to demonstrate their desire to
 emigrate. Some of these exit applicants were arrested and
 others were obliged to remove the symbol.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution states that there is freedom of
 assembly, only government-organized demonstrations are allowed.
 Police used force to disperse an unauthorized candlelight vigil
 by peace activists in Leipzig on November 18, arresting at least
 six demonstrators. On September 16, a group of demonstrators
 who attempted to hold a silent, candlelight vigil in front of
 the U.S. Embassy was broken up. Five persons were temporarily
 detained and a sixth was held for three weeks before being
 released.
 Government permission is required for public events. The
 Government has used this law to block unwanted public meetings,
 smaller discussion groups, and, on some occasions, gatherings
 held in private homes.
 Free labor unions and strikes are prohibited. Unions are viewed
 as political arms of the party and are used as institutions to
 carry out official policy. Union assemblies are controlled by
 loyal party members, as are all other public meetings except for
 religious and church-sponsored events.
 
 
 991
 C. Freedom of Religion
 While East Germany is officially atheistic, the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religious belief and worship. In
 practice, the state tolerates religious activity but does not
 encourage it. Overt adherence to religious beliefs usually
 results in effective disqualification for preferred job and
 educational opportunities. The Government controls religious
 activity carefully, monitoring statements and writings by church
 figures and regulating the printing and distribution of
 religious materials.
 Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian Scientists are prohibited from
 practicing their faiths, because Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to
 perform military service and because Christian Scientists do not
 use medical care and refuse to submit membership lists.
 Nontraditional or "charismatic" religious sects, some of which
 have gained popularity in recent years, are also proscribed.
 A growing number of East Germans who have been denied political
 expression have been attracted to the churches. Although the
 secret police monitor church-sponsored events closely, the
 church remains the only institutional forum in East Germany
 where opinions can be expressed with relative freedom. The
 churches have provided moral support to young East Germans who
 refuse to bear arms in military service based on their beliefs,
 and some persons who have fallen into disfavor with the state
 have been able to obtain alternative employment with the church.
 During 1983, East Germany showed signs of easing some
 restrictions on the churches. Nonconformist singers and writers
 were allowed to hold performances in church facilities, and some
 subjects which were previously forbidden could be carefully
 discussed so long as they did not become "political." This
 greater tolerance coincided with the Government's cosponsorship
 of celebrations of the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's
 birth. Strict limits continued to be placed on the churches'
 encouragement of those who wished to express individual opinions
 on peace, disarmament, or militarism. In September, Lutheran
 Deacon Lothar Rochau was sentenced to prison on charges
 including "illegal association." He had reportedly counseled
 young men on alternatives to military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 East Germans can travel freely within the country, except near
 borders or military installations. However, they are not
 allowed to change their residence without permission from the
 Government. All citizens must carry identification cards which
 the police have the right to check at will. Some East Germans
 are prohibited from traveling to East Berlin because of their
 political activities.
 Foreign travel is strictly controlled. Obtaining permission to
 travel to other Warsaw Pact countries, except Poland, is
 relatively easy, but private travel to non-Communist countries
 is forbidden to most citizens. With few exceptions, East
 Germans are not allowed to travel to non-Communist countries for
 personal or nonofficial reasons until they reach retirement age
 (60 for women, 65 for men). The sector line between East and
 West Berlin and the border between East Germany and the Federal
 
 
 992
 Republic are fortified by an array of lethal devices designed to
 stop East Germans from fleeing to the West. Beyond the mortal
 danger involved, any attempt to cross these boundaries without
 permission constitutes a crime punishable by up to eight years
 in prison.
 Each year a small number of East Germans are allowed to emigrate
 for the purpose of family reunification or because the
 Government finds their political activities "harmful to
 society." Successful applicants often wait from one to five
 years before they receive permission to leave. In the meantime,
 emigration applicants may lose their jobs or suffer
 imprisonment. Despite the hardships to which applicants are
 subjected, there are currently an estimated 200,000-500,000
 emigration applications pending.
 Most East Germans who obtain permission to emigrate legally are
 forced to give up their citizenship and must wait at least five
 years before returning to visit the country. Some are not
 allowed to return at all, as was the case when former Jena peace
 movement member Mario Striehn was prevented by border officials
 from using a transit train between West Germany and West
 Berlin. Those who left the country illegally before January 1,
 1981, are eligible to apply for permission to visit, but many
 are reluctant to do so. Reportedly, only about half of those
 who have applied have obtained visas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 East Germany does not recognize the right of citizens to change
 their government. Elections capable of doing this are not
 permitted. Voters are permitted only to vote either yes or no
 on a ballot prepared by the Communist Party. Since ballots are
 not secret, a "no" vote or a refusal to vote exposes the voter
 to reprisals.
 The Government is completely dominated by the Socialist Unity
 (Communist) Party. Though there are nominally four other
 parties, they are not permitted to challenge Communist
 doctrine. All decisions are made by the party's central
 leadership; lower level representatives are expected only to
 approve those decisions. All candidates for both party and
 legislative positions are nominated by the leadership. The
 party also determines who will fill executive positions in the
 Government. Though some government positions are reserved for
 members of the other four parties, the Communist Party insures
 that they will not contest its policy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has taken the position that inquiries into its
 human rights policies constitute interference in its internal
 affairs. Requests by Amnesty International and other private
 human rights groups in the West for information about human
 rights conditions go unanswered, and the Government does not
 permit visits by these groups. According to Amnesty
 International, some East Germans have been punished for
 attempting to contact human rights groups based outside the
 country. No unofficial human rights groups are permitted to
 
 
 993
 exist inside the country. The government-sponsored Committee
 for the Protection of Human Rights is not designed to safeguard
 the human rights of East German citizens, but to attack human
 rights conditions in Western countries while claiming that there
 are no human rights concerns inside East Germany. Amnesty
 International's 1983 report expresses concern for the treatment
 of political prisoners, conscientious objectors, and would-be
 emigrants. Freedom House rates the German Democratic Republic
 "not free..
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of 16,724,000, East Germany has a highly
 industrialized, centrally planned economy. It is generally an
 importer of raw materials and an exporter of manufactured
 goods. All large industrial, retail, and agricultural
 operations are state owned, but small private businesses of
 fewer than 10 employees are allowed. According to official
 statistics, 2.9 percent of the net national product is produced
 by private enterprise.
 It is difficult to devise precise statistical comparisons
 between the East German standard of living and that of other
 countries because of the manner in which the Government compiles
 data. The country has a relatively high standard of living,
 apparently the highest in the Warsaw Pact. According to the
 World Bank, per capita income in 1979 was $6,430 (the U.S.
 Department of Commerce 1979 per capita income figure for East
 Germany was $8,110). More recent figures are not available.
 Official statistics give the economy's annual rate of expansion
 as about four percent over the last few years, with a dip to
 three percent in 1982.
 For the majority of the population, income discrepancies are not
 great. A small number of East Germans, however, live in
 relative opulence. High party and military officials, important
 scientists, artists, and athletes enjoy special access to
 housing, education, travel and consumer goods. These special
 benefits, which are much more important than wages in
 determining status and living standards, tend to create a small
 and highly privileged bureaucratic class.
 The caloric supply available for consumption is 139 percent of
 the nutritional requirement, and 82 percent of the population
 has access to safe water. Prices of basic goods and services
 have remained stable throughout the last decade because of price
 controls and heavy subsidies, though prices of consumer goods
 have risen steadily. Shortages of consumer goods are periodic
 but not pervasive.
 The most serious shortage is in housing. This is partly a
 result of the damage caused in World War II, compounded by the
 priority given to heavy industrial investment. Residents of
 Berlin usually must wait more than 18 months for housing if they
 are single, and often more than a year if they are married. The
 Government is committed to a major housing construction program
 lasting until 1990.
 There is an extensive social welfare system which includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents. Free
 medical care is also provided. In 1980, there were 2.03
 doctors, .58 dentists, and 10.3 hospital beds for every 1,000
 
 
 994
 East German:.  The infant mortality rate in 1983 was 12.3 per
 1,000 births, and life expectancy in 1980 was 72.43 years. Free
 and universal education is supplied through the 12th grade, and
 97 percent of all school-aged children attend school.
 Literacy is almost universal. The number of students in
 institutions of higher learning is a function of projected
 needs. Competition is keen for these spaces, and allocation
 usually depends on the political acceptability of the
 applicant. In 1981, there were about 78 college or university
 students for every 10,000 people. Social services, including
 full medical care, are provided to rural residents as well as to
 urban dwellers. In 1980, the Government devoted approximately 6
 percent of its budget expenditures to education, 5.9 percent to
 medical and social services, and 20 percent to social insurance
 and pensions. There is no officially recognized unemployment in
 East Germany.
 The Sorbs, an indigenous Slavic minority numbering about 45,000,
 constitute the only ethnic minority in East Germany. There is
 no officially tolerated discrimination against this group.
 Schools in areas with a Sorb population have specially designed
 curriculums that emphasize aspects of Sorb culture, and
 instruction is offered in the Sorb language. Sorbs are
 generally fluent in German as well as Sorbian and they are well
 integrated into the general population.
 Women and men are treated equally in most respects. Women are
 allowed to retire at age 60, men at 65. As one of the many
 incentives to increase the birth rate, women are given leave
 with full pay for one year after the birth of any children.
 About 87 percent of women of working age are employed, compared
 to 88 percent of men. Women can be found in significant
 proportions up to the middle level in all professions except the
 military. Plans are being made by the Government to register
 women for military service. Women comprise 44 percent of the
 industrial work force and 42 percent of those employed in
 agriculture and industry. There are few women in high positions
 of the party, government, economy, and most professions, though
 in the medical profession women are probably more numerous than
 in most Western nations.
