 ECUADOR
 Ecuador's current regime took power in a coup on
 January 11, 1976. The chiefs of Ecuador's three
 military services constitute the Supreme Council of
 Government. The National Assembly is inactive. The
 court system is fully operative. Since 1970 the country
 has been ruled by decree. Ecuador is on the path of
 return to constitutional, democratic rule.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No reports alleging torture in Ecuador have been received.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 No reports have been received regarding cruel, inhuman
 or degrading treatment or punishment in Ecuador.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been arbitrary arrests and imprisonment of
 persons alleged to have engaged in anti-government
 plotting or illegal strike activity.
 The most recent serious case involved arrests following
 the drowning of at least 25 striking workers at the
 Aztra sugar mill on October 18, 1977. The deaths
 occurred during police action to remove strikers from
 the mill, apparently as a stampeding crowd spilled
 into waters nearby. The Government asserted that the
 strike was illegal, and arrested labor leaders,
 including Jose Chavez, President of the Ecuadorean
 Confederation of Free Labor Organizations (CEOSL),and
 Luis Cordero, President of the CEOSL-affiliated sugar
 workers. Chavez was said to be directly linked with
 the strike. The others apparently did nothing more
 than criticize the Government in strong terms for its
 handling of the strike. A number of those detained
 were released during the subsequent two months. Chavez
 was released after 36 days. Cordero and lower-level
 prisoners were still being held at the close of 1977.

 No formal charges have been announced in any of these
 cases.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The great majority of Ecuadoreans have access to fair
 public trial. However, there are sometimes exceptions
 to this rule, particularly when the Government feels
 strong measures are necessary to preserve public order.
 On May 18, 1977, the National Teachers' Union began
 an indefinite strike for higher wages. Concurrently,
 the three national labor confederations carried out a
 one-day national strike. The Government declared the
 strikes illegal, and issued arrest orders for the
 leaders. Those finally condemned to jail (including
 the President of the Teachers' Union) were sentenced
 by the police official who had issued the arrest orders,
 in accordance with a decree-law promulgated just prior
 to the strikes. About five people reportedly have
 been sentenced and are currently serving terms of
 between two and five years. This procedure of arrest
 and sentencing applies only to cases of illegal strike
 activity.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 No cases of invasion of homes have been reported.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Government has taken steps to control the prices of
 foodstuffs, to construct considerable quantities of
 low-cost housing, to expand popular participation in the
 Social Security Institute (includes health care), and to
 increase the number of teachers and classrooms. Education
 receives a fixed percentage of petroleum revenues. Gains
 in these areas are limited because of scarce resources.
 An agrarian reform program has not been carried through.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 The Ecuadorean Government generally respects these
 liberties. There is no established religion. Foreign
 missionaries operate freely. Street demonstrations require
 prior government consent, which is usually forthcoming
 for nonpolitical acts. Consent is withheld only for events
 that have a potential for public disorder. People who
 challenge those guidelines have been dealt with stiffly
 by the police, but there are no repor-ts of severe or brutal
 treatment. There are no restrictions on indoor meetings.
 Most political rallies are held in large buildings such
 as theaters and sports arenas.
 As a result of the National Teacher's strike described
 in Id above, the Government formally abolished the
 National Teachers' Union (UNE) on May 30, 1977. The
 abolition has been criticized as a denial of the inter-
 nationally recognized right to form and join trade
 unions. The Government argues that its action was a
 justified response to the Union's refusal to halt an
 illegal strike action. Labor leaders have complained of
 a hard line by the Ministries of Labor and Government
 since the May 1977 strikes.
 Labor legislation is generally liberal, often favoring
 workers over employers (except for the decree-law on strikes
 discussed in Section ld). Nevertheless, union leaders
 assert that this legislation has not prevented some
 arbitrary, anti-labor measures.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no formal interhal or external travel
 restrictions. Ecuadoreans may emigrate freely. In
 May 1977, the Government confiscated the passport of
 the President of the Ecuadorean Confederation of Free
 Labor Organizations, thereby preventing his planned
 
 
 158
 trip to the International Labor Organization in Qeneva.
 However, this case seems to have been atypical.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ecuador is currently governed by a military junta. There
 have been no presidential or congressional elections
 since 1968. Legislation is by decree. The Government is*
 currently carrying out a step-by-step plan to deliver
 power to a civilian, popularly-elected administration
 during 1978. On January 15, a national plebiscite on two
 proposed constitutions was held, with 94 percent voter
 participation.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Ecuadorean Government has been an active supporter of
 human rights in international organizations. On
 October 21, 1977, the Government ratified the American
 Convention on Human Rights.
 There were no UN or OAS investigations of alleged
 violations of human rights in Ecuador during 1977. At
 the Executive Board Meeting of the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) held in November,
 the Board criticized the Government of Ecuador for trade
 union repression, and authorized the ICFTU's General
 Secretary to send an ICFTU mission to Ecuador. The
 mission had not gone to Ecuador by the end of the year.
 The Amnesty International Report 1977 stated that two
 1976 political group arrests, lollowed by short-term
 imprisonment, were of concern to Amnesty International
 (AI). AI expressed concern about both those group
 arrests, although no individual cases were taken up,
 and although "None of the detainees were held for more
 than a few days and there were no allegations of mal-
 treatment."
 The Amnesty International Report 1977 noted Amnesty's
 Secretary General had thankedthe Government for its
 support of the resolution on torture passed by the U.N.
 General Assembly in December 1976.
