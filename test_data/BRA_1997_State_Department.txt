 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic composed of 26 states and the federal
 district. The federal legislative and judicial branches of government exercise author-
 ity independent of the executive branch. In 1994 voters elected a new president,
 two-thirds of the Senate, and 513 federal deputies. It was the second time since the
 end of military rule in 1985 that citizens freely chose their president and elected
 the legislative bodies in accordance with the 1988 Constitution. All parties are able
 to compete on the basis of fair and equal procedures. Fernando Henrique Cardoso
 became p resident on January 1, 1995, and is serving a 4-year term, reduced from
 5 years by a 1994osina mendment. The judiciary is independent but inef-
 ficient and subject to political influence.
 Police forces fall primarily under the control of the states. State police are divided
 into two forces: The civil police, who have an investigative role, and the uniformed
 police, known locally as the "military police," who are responsible for maintaining
 public order. Although the individual state governments control the uniformed po-
 lice, the Constitution provides that they can be called into active military service
 in the event of an emergency, and they maintain some residual military privileges,
 including a separate judicial system. In September the Justice Ministry created a
 aublic security secretariat to coordinate efforts to reorganize and modernize the po-
 ice forces. The federal police force is very small and plays little role in maintaining
 internal security. The state police forces committed numerous serious human rights
 abuses.
 Brazil has a market-based, diversified economy. The Government, which tradition-
 ally played a dominant role in shaping economic development, is encouraging great-
 er private sector participation in the economy through privatization of state enter-
 
 
 430
 prises, deregulation, and removal of impediments to competition. Industrial produc-
 tion, including mining operations and a large and diversified capital goods sector,
 accounts for approximately 34_percent of gross domestic product (GDP); agriculture
 contributes about 13 percent. Brazil exports both manufactured and primary goods.
 Among the principal exports are coffee, soybeans, textiles, leather metallurgical
 products, and transportation equipment. Per capita GDP was about J5,000 in 1997,
 and the economy grew at a rate of 3.5 percent. Although income distribution im-
 proved slightly in 1997, the poorest tenth of the population received only 1 percent
 of nationa inome while the richest tenth received 48 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but numer-
 ous serious abuses continued. State police forces committed many extrajudicial
 killings, and officials reportedly tortured prisoners. The police also were responsible
 for abductions for ransom and instances of arbitrary detention. The state govern-
 ments concerned did not effectively punish perpetrators of these abuses. In many
 cases, special courts for the uniformed police were overloaded, rarely investigated
 effectively or brought fellow officers to trial, and seldom convicted abusers. This sep-
 arate system of special state police courts contributes to a climate of impunity for
 police officers involved in extrajudicial killings or abuse of prisoners. Legislation en-
 acted in 1996 gave civil courts jurisdiction over intentional homicide committed by
 uniformed police officers, but left control of the initial inquiry in the hands of the
 police, which can preempt investigation and prosecution of cases.-
 The poor bear the brunt of most violence. Prison conditions range from poor to
 harsh. The judiciary has a large case backlog and is often unable to ensure the right
 to a fair trial. Justice is slow and often unreliable, especially in rural areas where
 some powerful landowners use violence to settle land disputes and influence the
 local judiciary. Violence against women, minorities, and homosexuals, and discrimi-
 nation against women and minorities are problems. Child prostitution is also a prob-
 lem. Despite constitutional provisions safeguarding the rights of indigenous people,
 they continue to be victimized by outsiders who encroach on Indian lands and to
 be neglected by governmental authorities. The authorities do not adequately enforce
 laws against forced labor, including that by children. Child labor is a serious prob-
 lem.
 In April the Government created a human rights secretariat in the Justice Min-
 istry to oversee implementation of its 1996 Action Plan to address human rights
 abuses. The Government also passed a law defining and penalizing torture and ex-
 panded scholarship programs to reduce child labor. However, because of jurisdic-
 tional and resource limitations, the increased commitment by the national Govern-
 ment did not have a significant impact in some of the states where human rights
 violations are most common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings continued to
 be a serious problem throughout the country. In urban areas, high crime rates, fail-
 ure to apprehend most criminals, and an inept and inefficient criminal justice sys-
 tem all contribute to public acquiescence in police brutality and killings of criminal
 suspects. Human rights groups report that the uniformed police, who openly doubt
 the judiciary's ability to convict those they apprehend, often summarily execute sus-
 pected criminals rather than apprehend them, and then file false reports describing
 the executions as shootouts. A Human Rights Watch/Americas report described the
 unjustified use of deadly force in police raids in urban shantytowns; extrajudicial
 kilings, justified in official reports under " resisting arrest;" and executions by off-
 duty officers in response to minor provocations or to resolve personal vendettas.
 Failure to investigate, prosecute, and punish police officers who commit such acts
 creates a sense of impunity that encourages continued human rights abuses. The
 need for police reform was brought to the forefront by widely publicized incidents
 of police involvement in criminal activity and police strikes in at least 15 states,
 which drew attention to their low pay and inadequate training.
 A 1996 law giving civil courts jurisdiction over intentional homicide committed by
 uniformed police officers was used in some high-profile cases. However, in most less
 prominent cases, the decision whether a policeman acted in self-defense or commit-
 ted an intentional homicide is based on an investigation performed by the police
 force itself; almost without exception, the police investigators conclude that suspects
 were "resisting arrest." All crimes less serious than murder committed by uniformed
 police officers against civilians remain in the military justice system. According to
 one leading newspaper, a majority of criminal cases involving police in the state of
 Rio de Janeiro were never tried in court. Of 1,472 cases against police that were
 
 
 sent to the military court between January 1996 and July 1997, 68 percent were
 "retired" without a court hearing. Cases were retired for insufficient evidence and
 lack of knowledge of the author of crime. Cases were also retired in which police
 killed or wounded civilians while the latter were resisting arrest.
 The number of citizens killed in conflicts with police fell in Sao Paulo but contin-
 ued to rise in Rio de Janeiro. A study by the Institute for Religious Studies (ISER)
 concluded that 10 percent of all Rio de Janeiro homicides were civilians killed by
 police. The ISER study also documented that in a sample of 697 cases of fatal police
 shootings between 1993 and 1996, Rio de Janeiro police officers rarely fired to im-
 mobilize rather than kill; half of the victims were killed with four or more bullets,
 and the majority of victims were shot in either the shoulders or the head. Forty
 cases clearly demonstrated execution-style deaths, where victims were first immo-
 bilized and then shot at close range. Victims were generally young, black, and with-
 out criminal records. Human rights groups continued to criticize "bravery" awards
 conferred by the Rio de Janeiro authorities which have had the effect of encouraging
 police to use excessive force.
 In a report released on December 8, the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR) stated that the police forces require widespread reform to curb re-
 peated instances of violence and other abuses. The report said that the number of
 deaths in Rio de Janeiro attributed to state police officers averaged 20 a month in
 1996, which it termed an "alarming phenomenon." It said that one battalion that
 covers slum areas was responsible for one-third of the deaths. The IACHR also said
 that the number of deaths in civilian confrontations with the state police was three
 times the number injured by them, a reversal of normal patterns. The IACHR said
 "this is evidence o? the use of excessive force and even shows a pattern of
 extrajudicial executions by the Rio de Janeiro police." The report added that there
 had been instances in which officers guilty of victimizing suspects have been re-
 warded. It cited one case in which a corporal was decorated and elected "officer of
 the year" even though he had been accused of 49 killings. State security officials
 continue to champion an approach to crime that effectively rewards police officers
 for killing suspects, and leaves the poor neighborhoods unpoliced and open to the
 violent rivalries of drug gangs.
 In February Sao Paulo state police killed Osvaldo Manoel da Silva. On December
 11, the state attorney general's office charged five policemen with Da Silva's mur-
 der. The policemen claimed that Da Silva died as a result of wounds suffered while
 resisting arrest, but a reconstruction of the events by a credible university forensic
 team indicated that he was shot three times in the ambulance en route to the hos-
 pital. The judged assigned to the case set evidentiary hearings for early February
 998.
 On May 20, uniformed police killed 3 homeless persons and injured 11 in violence
 that erupted at a low-income housing project in greater Sao Paulo. The police were
 carrying out a court order to remove over 400 families that had illegally occupied
 the "Fazenda da Juta" housing complex on May 3. The police operation was broad-
 cast on television and criticized as an excessive use of force.
 Police involvement in criminal activity often produces killings. The most notorious
 case occurred in March, when police in the Sao Paulo suburb of Diadema were
 filmed at a roadblock mounted to extort money from residents. The video implicated
 the police in murdering Mario Jose Josino and beating and torturing numerous oth-
 ers. Ten police officers charged with the murder were expelled from the force and
 were in jail awaiting trial at year's end. The commander of the police battalion,
 after initially being relieved of duty, was reinstated; the officer in charge of the
 group actually involved in the incident suffered only administrative punishment.
 In Rio de Janeiro, police were believed to have been involved in the fatal kidnap-
 ing of the son of the mayor of Teresopolis and several other abductions. In Septem-
 ber off-duty Sao Paulo police officers were implicated in the kidnaping and murder
 of an 8-year-old boy. On his first day in office, the new Sao Paulo police chief dis-
 missed 20 uniformed police officers for abuse of authority and other crimes and
 promised to purge future violators from the force.
 In January witnesses identified five uniformed police officers as having arrested
 four men who were found dead a few hours later. The deaths occurred in May 1996
 in France da Rocha, one of Sao Paulo state's poorest communities, and location of
 a clandestine dumping site for the victims of death squads. Since 1993, at least 212
 bodies have been found there, 50 victims killed with bullets to the head, while the
 arms and heads of some of the bodies had been removed in an apparent attempt
 to conceal the victims' identities.
 Policeman Nelson Cunha, who was sentenced in 1996 to 261 years in prison for
 his role in the 1993 killing of eight street children near Candelaria church in down-
 town Rio de Janeiro, was acquitted on appeal. Cunha remained in prison, serving
 
 
 a sentence of 18 years for the attempted murder of Candelaria survivor and key wit-
 ness Wagner dos Santos. Another defendant in the Candelaria case, Marcos Vinicius
 Emmanuel, had his prison term reduced from 309 years to 89 years on appeal. Two
 other defendants were in jail and awaiting trial at year's end.
 Paulo Roberto Alvarega, one of 56 policemen accused of participating in the 1993
 killing of 21 Vigario Geral residents in Rio de Janeiro, was sentenced to 449 years
 in pnson (although, under the law, no prisoner may serve more than 30 years). In
 November a judge found one of them, Arlindo Magiario Filho, guilty of 20 counts
 of murder and 4 counts of attempted murder and sentenced him to 441 years in
 prison. Four years after the massacre, Maginario Filho was only the second of the
 accused police officers to be convicted for the Vigario Geral killings. The trials of
 10 other officers named in the first indictment were postponed a number of times.
 In the meantime, one of the defendants named in the second indictment, former pb-
 liceman Sirley Alves Ferreira, escaped from prison on December 29.
 There was no progress in the investigation of the 1996 killing of three Belo
 Horizonte street children in Taquaril plaza. A group calling itself- "Reaction" had
 claimed responsibility, writing in a note that the minors had been killed to protest
 the low salaries paid to civil police. According to human rights groups in Belo
 Horizonte, there is significant evidence that Reaction is composed of active duty and
 former police officers. One police officer was charged in the slaying and several oth-
 ers were under investigation.
 In the April 1996 police killingof 19 landless workers in Eldorado de Carajas,
 Para, the authorities decided in November to try before a jury 153 police officers
 charged with intentional murder, as well as 3 landless workers charged with bodily
 harm. One policeman was dropped from the indictment because of insanity, and an-
 other policeman and one gunman were not indicted because they are in hiding. The
 authoriti es  ie   a      d                         s and will schedule trials
 after the state court reviews appeals filed by the defense. In a related development,
 the federal Government assigned a team of police officers to protect journalist
 Mariza Romao after she fled Para in December. Romao had received a series of
 death threats after testifying against the police officers implicated in the Eldorado
 de Carajas killings.
 In March a court sentenced Sao Paulo jailkeeper Jose Ribeiro to 45 years in pris-
 on and civil police investigator Celso Jose da Cruz to 53 years for their roles in the
 1989 killing of 18 prisoners in the "42nd Delegacia." The precinct chief, Carlos
 Eduardo de Vasconcelos, was originally found innocent of wrongdoing, but in March
 the state attorney general's office convinced the court to reconsider the charges
 against him. Cases against another 29 police officers indicted by a military court
 for participating in the 42nd Delegacia killings have been transferred to civilian
 court. At year's end, the state governor signed a decree authorizing payment of com-
 pensation to the victims' families. Each dependent is to receive about $33,000 for
 psychological damages, plus a yet-to-be-determined amount for physical damages.
 In rural areas, conflicts continued between rural landowners and the landless, in
 part due to land invasions organized by the rural Landless Workers' Movement
 (MST) to pressure the Federal Government to speed up settlement of landless fami-
 lies. The MST illegally occupied hundreds of plots of land identified as unproductive,
 blocked highways, and occupied government buildings, raising tensions and increas-
 ing confrontations with landowners, their gunmen, and, in many cases, policemen.
 At least 26 persons died in land disputes. Such killings usually go unpunished, be-
 cause the landowners thought to be responsible for many of them reportedly control
 the police in isolated areas and intimidate local judges and lawyers with violence
 and threats of violence. A jury in the small, rural town of Pedro Canario, Espirito
 Santo, sentenced MST leader Jose Rainha to 26 12 years for the 1989 murders of
 landowner Jose Machado Neto and police officer Sergio Narciso da Silva. The jury
 convicted Rainha even though the prosecution presented no material evidence, and
 witnesses testified to Rainha's presence 1,500 miles away from the scene of the
 crime. Since Rainha's sentence exceeded 20 years, he was entitled to a new trial.
 Rainha's lawyers persuaded the judge that Rainha would face a biased jury in a
 small, rural town, and the second trial was therefore moved to Vitoria, the *state
 capital
 The authorities charged the commander and 19 otherpolice officers involved in
 the August 1995 massacre of 9 squatters in Corumbiara, Rondonia, with intentional
 homicide, meaning that those accused are to be tried in regular courts rather than
 a special  lice tribunal. They also charged four squatter leaders with intentional
 homicide for the deaths of two policemen, as well as for the deaths of the nine
 squatters. The authorities justified the latter charges by declaring that the leaders
 were responsible for the land invasion that sparked the confrontation. The medical
 examiner reported that most of the squatters killed had been shot in the back at
 
 
 433
 short range and that many of the bullets had traveled from the top of the body
 downwardc indicating that the victims had been killed from behind while kneeling.
 At year's end, the authorities were still taking testimony from witnesses and were
 awaiting the judge's decision on which cases would go to a jury.
 The cases against the 121 Sao Paulo police officers accused of killing crimes rang-
 ing from homicide to use of excessive force (111 inmates died) while quelling a 1992
 riot in the Carandiru prison were transferred from military to civilian court, but are
 proceeding slowly, with depositions still being taken.
 In September the former mayor of Rio Maria, Pars, was charged with the 1985
 murder of Joao Canuto, the frst resident of the rural workers union in Rio Maria,
 after the case was transferred to Belem, the state capita.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, off-duty police reportedly were involved in several abductions for ran-
 som, at least one of which resulted in the death of the victim (see Section .a.). The
 Human Rights Division of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Belo Horizonte reported
 that, in the last 7 years, it had received nearly 100 complaints of "disappearances"
 of persons from Belo lorizonte in which the p olice allegedly were involved. In the
 majority of cases, the alleged victims were criminal suspects.
 In 1995 Congress passed legislation recognizing and assumin, government re-
 sponsibility for the deaths of p oitical activists who "disappeared' during the mili-
 tary regime while in the custody of public officials, and obligating the Government
 to pay indemnities of between $100,000 and $150,000 to each of the families. On
 September 7, President Cardoso signed a decree awarding reparations to the fami-
 lies of 43 such persons. A commission created by the law continued to evaluate re-
 quests for, and authorize payment of, indemnities.
 c. Torture and Other Crue, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and contains severe legal penalties for torture or
 acquiescence in it. In April the Government passed a law  efin  and penalizing
 torture. However, there are frequent credible reports that police beat and torture
 criminal suspects to extract information, confessions, or money. Such torture has re-
 sulted in death (see Section l.a.). No cases of torture were successfully prosecuted
 under the new law by year's end.
 On November 18, the state of Rio Grande do Sul enacted a aw providing com-
 pensation for persons tortured in the state during the military regime.
 In March and April police officers in Rio de Janeir and SaoPaulo were caught
 on videotape torturing citizens. In Sao Paulo the police were taped on two occasions,
 once abusing 15 persons on a single street. For example, at midnight on March 6,
 police ordered three persons out of a car. Police officers Octavio Lorenco Gambra
 and Nelson Soares de Silva Junior removed the shoes of Jefferson Sanches Caput
 and beat him repeatedly on the soles of his feet with a nightstick. The two officers
 were taped hitting Sanhes 39 times in 8 minutes, at times appearing bored by the
 process. After the three men were allowed to leave, Gambra fired through the car's
 rear window, killing Mario Jose Josino. The authorities arrested 10 police officers
 in Sao Paul in connection with these incidents (see Section l.a.). On March 12, an
 amateur video captured 6 uniformed Rio de Janeir police-beating, torturing and ex-
 terting 12 residents--including women--of the "fCidade de Deus" neighorhood.
 Originally set for September, their trial was postponed repeatedly. The incident
 prompteda state legislature investigation of police violence and the establishment
 of a hot line for reporting instances of police violence and impunity.
 In the  ast 7 years, the Human Rights Division of the Public Prosecutor's Office
 in Belo  orizonte has indicted more than 500 civil police officers (nearly 15 percent
 of the force) for battery or abuse of authority (torture). In the last 3 years, the divi-
 sion filed indictments against 439 civil police and 116 uniformed police for these
 crimes. A state legislature committee investigating torture in prisons in Minas
 Gerais concluded its work in September with a report asking the governor to initiate
 reforms at the highest level of the Secretariat for Public Security and Justice. The
 committee also recommended the dismissal of the Chief of Special Operations and
 various officials, including the director of the Nelson Hungria maximum security
 prison, who are accused of having tortured prisoners.
 According to the National Association of Newspapers, police in Teresina, Piaui,
 detained and beat a photographer on April 2 afterhe photographed policeman Fran-
 cisco S   oares Rocha torturing 23 youths. In August a member of the Chamber of
 Deputies asked state authorities in oias to investigate a report that the police tor-
 tured four persons in ArSana while investigating the disappearance of two police of-
 ficers. Police in Pernambuco were accused in February of duming a 17-year-old in to
 a vat of chemicals, seriously injuring him.
 According to a report by the Sao Panlo ombudsman, 8 percent of all complaints
 against the police specifically mentioned torture or beatings, and 40 percent of all
 
 
 complaints involved some form of mistreatment. The Government estimated in its
 1994 report on the internal human rights situation that fewer than 10 percent of
 cases of mistreatment by police are reported. Victims are generally poor, uneducated
 about their rights and-most of all-afraid to come forward for fear of reprisals.
 Prison conditions range from poor to harsh. Severe overcrowding is prevalent, es-
 ~ecially in larger cities. According to figures for 1995 released in December by the
 Justic Ministry, the inmate population was 149,000, but prison capacity was only
 designed for 76,000. During the year, the Federal Government spent about $150
 million in the prison system, a major increase over previous years. Because of the
 shortfall in prison capacity, police stations were often used as prisons, with con-
 victed criminals sharing cells with detainees. In the state of Sao Paulo, which holds
 40 percent of the national prison population, 52 percent of inmates are serving their
 sentences in police stations or local jails. Most penal authorities do not have the re-
 sources to separate minor offenders from adults and petty offenders from violent
 criminals.
 As a result of overcrowding, prison riots were almost daily occurrences. Sao Paulo
 state officials reported a 147 percent increase in prison revolts from 1996 to 1997
 (from 72 to 178 incidents). Prison officials and olice often react with excessive use
 of force. In May the second major rebellion at Sao Paulo's Praia Grande prison left
 3 prisoners dead and 17 wounded. In April prisoners in Ribeirao Preto killed three
 fellow inmates, allegedly to protestprison conditions. The facility, designed to hold
 198 persons, had 625 prisoners. In December inmates at the Sorocaba prison seized
 about 650 hostages, mostly inmates' relatives, and took control of the facility after
 a failed escape attempt left 1 inmate and a female visitor dead. While the prisoners
 dragged out negotiations for the release of the family members, other inmates were
 finishing an escape tunnel. After the prisoners reneged on their promise to release
 the hostages, the police learned of the tunnel and stormed the prison, regaining con-
 trol without firing a single bullet. Some leaders of the revolt were transferred to an-
 other facility for their own safety.
 In the northeastern state of Ceara, eight inmates were killed and three hostages
 wounded when authorities put down a December prison revolt in Fortaleza. One of
 the hostages later said she saw police shoot at least two inmates who had already
 surrendered and were lying prostrate on the ground.
 In November students at the Escola Joao Luiz Alves juvenile penitentiary in Rio
 de Janeiro revolted over alleged brutality by institution guards. Of a total of 312
 internees, 247 escaped from the institution. One youth died at the hands of school
 guards in the melee. Complaints about incidents of torture and violence and the
 school's failure to separate youths by age and by crime committed had been filed
 in 1996 with the IACHR.
 Sao Paulo's prison system, in particular, suffers from chronic overcrowding, cor-
 rupt and abusive local prison management, and prisoner access to weapons and
 drugs. Discipline is difficult to maintain under such conditions, and prison officials
 often resort to inhuman treatment to maintain order. In January 14 police officers
 put down a riot at the Santa Rosa do Viterbo women's penitentiary by punching,
 kicking, and beating 80 inmates with nightsticks; they seriously injured 22 persons
 and caused a pregnant inmate to miscarry. According to separate reports by the po-
 lice ombudsman and a church-affiliated group, Santa Rosa police chief Elton Testi
 Renz ordered the systematic beating of the 80 women. Renz was transferred to an-
 other district; the civil police involved are awaiting trial in civilian court. Sao Paulo
 state is building 21 new prisons, which are expected to be completed by the end of
 1998.
 In January the Legal Medical Institute of Parana state opened an investigation
 into allegations of torture at a prison in Foz do Iguacu. Seven prisoners had been
 taken to the Institute with serious injuries, including external and internal wounds
 allegedly sustained during police beatings. The Carandiru prison in Sao Paulo con-
 tinued to be the scene of serious prisoner abuse. In a section of the prison known
 as "the dungeon," prisoners are typically kept in isolation for months without any
 sunlight. According to a church-affiliatedgroup, approximately 15 prison guards en-
 tered the dungeon on February 19 and beat prisoners with wooden clubs and iron
 bars.
 Prisons do not provide adequate protection against violence inflicted by inmates
 on each other. Prisoners are subject to dismal health conditions as well. Scabies and
 tuberculosis, diseases not common in the general population, are widespread in Sao
 Paulo prisons. Prison officials believe that within 5 years 50 percent of the prison
 population could be HIV positive. Denial of first aid and other medical care is some-
 times used as a form of punishment.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 detention, and the Government generally observes this prohibition. The Constitution
 limits arrests to those caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by
 order of a judicial authority. The authorities usually respect the constitutional provi-
 sion for a judicial determination of the legality of detention,' although some con-
 victed inmates are held beyond their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law
 permits provisional detention for up to 5 days under specified conditions during a
 police investigation, but a judge may extend this period. According to groups that
 work with street children, however, the police sometimes detain street youths ille-
 gally without a judicial order or hold them incommunicado.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment, but it is inefficient and subject to political influence. In many instances,
 lower-income, less-educated citizens make limited use of the appeals process that
 otherwise might ensure the right to fair trial.
 At the appellate court level, a large backlog of cases hinders the courts' ability
 to ensure fair and expeditious trials. In a press interview, the president of the Fed-
 eral Supreme Court complained about the volume of appeals that by law the Su-
 preme Court must review. The 11 judges on-the court received over 35,000 cases
 in 1997. It takes 8 years to reach a definitive decision in the average case, a delay
 that the Supreme Court president considered unjust.
 The judicial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes courts
 of first instance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial systems but
 must adhere to the basic principles in the Constitution. There is also a system of
 specialized courts dealing with police, labor, elections, juveniles, and family matters.
 Special police courts have jurisdiction over state uniformed police (except when
 charged with intentional homicide); the record-of these courts shows that conviction
 is the exception rather than the rule. A human rights group in the northeast, which
 studied police crimes against civilians tried in police courts from 1970 to 1991,
 found that only 8 percent of the cases resulted in convictions. In Sao Paulo, another
 study found that only 5 percent of cases resulted in convictions. The courts (which
 are separate from the courts-martial of the armed forces, except for the final appeals
 court) are composed of four ranking state uniformed police officials and one civilian
 judge. With too few judges for the caseload, there-are backlogs, and human rights
 groups note a lack of zeal among police charged with investigating fellow officers.
 In 1996 the President signed legislation giving ordinary -courts jurisdiction over
 cases in which uniformed police officers are accused of intentional homicide against
 civilians. However, the internal police investigation determines whether the homi-
 cide was intentional or not, and the police tribunal decides whether to forward a
 case to a civil court for trial.
 A federal law approved in September 1995 created small claims courts to handle,
 and resolve quickly, less serious criminal and civil cases. In Sao Paulo, the new
 courts resolved 80 percent of their cases within 60 days, and cleared from the state
 docket some 45,000 backlogged cases.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. According to the Ministry of Justice, approximately 85 percent of pris-
 oners cannot afford an attorney. In such cases, the court must provide one at public
 expense; courts are supposed to appoint private attorneys to represent poor defend-
 ants when public defenders are unavailable, but often no effective defense is pro-
 vided. Juries decide only cases of willful crimes against life; judges try all others.
 The right to a fair pulic trial as provided by law is genera ly respected in prac-
 tice, although in ruraareas the judiciary is generally less capable and more subject
 to the influence of local landowners, particularly in cases related to indigenous peo-
 ple and rural union activists. Similarly, local police are often less zealous in inves-
 tigating, prosecutors are reluctant to initiate proceedings, and judges find reasons
 to delay when cases involve gnmen contracted by landowners to eliminate squat-
 ters or rural union activists.
 The need for judicial reform is widely recognized because the current system is
 inefficient, with backlogs of cases and shortages of judges. Lawyers often drag out
 cases as long as possible in the hope that an appeals court might render a favorable
 opinion and because they are paid according to the amount of time they spend on
 a case. According to the Institute of Economic, Social, and Political Studies of Sao
 Paulo, however, 90 percent of appeals court decisions confirm  decisions made in
 lower courts. Low pay, combined with exacting competitive examinations that in
 some years eliminate 90 percent of the applicants, make it difficult to fill vacancies
 on the bench. The system requires that a trial be held within a period of time from
 the date of the crime (similar to a statute of limitations). Due to the backlog of
 
 
 cases, old cases are frequently dismissed. According to a former judge, this encour-
 ages corrupt judges purposely to delay certain cases, so that they can be dismissed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home, although
 wiretaps authorized by judicial authority are permitted. The law regulating the con-
 ditions under which wiretaps may be used appears to strike a fair balance between
 giving the police an effective law enforcement tool and protecting the civil liberties
 of citizens. There were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal
 entry into homes without a warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. The
 inviolability of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of
 censorship and provides for freedom of speech and a free press. The authorities re-
 spect these rights in practice.
 Newspapers and magazines, which are privately owned, vigorously report and
 comment on government performance. Both the press and broadcast media routinely
 discuss controversial social and political issues and engage in investigative report-
 ing. Most radio and television stations are privately owned; however, the Govern-
 ment has licensing authority, and politicians frequently obtain the licenses. Many
 television and radio stations are owned by current or former congressmen, some of
 whom are or were members of the committee overseeing communications. It is dif-
 ficult to determine how many media outlets are indirectly controlled by politicians
 since concessions are often registered in the names of family members or friends
 linked to them. In addition, concessions are regularly transferred to other names,
 with little oversight by the Government.
 The penalty for libel under the 1967 press law-a prison term-is considered ex-
 treme by judges and is rarely imposed. Press criticism has described it as an archaic
 and authoritarian law inherited from the military regime.
 In November the authorities held six members of the music group "Planet Hemp"
 for 5 days under a law forbidding incitement to use drugs. A judge in the Federal
 District also prohibited the broadcast of 14 of the group's songs.,
 There were few reports of harassment of journalists; however, there was a case
 of torture involving a photojournalist and death threats were made against a jour-
 nalist who testified against the police (see Sections L.a and 1.c).
 Foreign publications are widely distributed; prior review of films, plays, and radio
 and television programming is practiced only to determine a suitable viewing age.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Permits are not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings
 occur frequently. However, in Salvador, the head of the, legislative assembly's
 Human Rights Commission claimed that the right of assembly in the downtown
 area had been denied by state authorities for 9 months, following violent clashes
 with police during demonstrations in April.
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of association, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no favored or state religion. All
 faiths are free to establish places of worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although
 the Government controls entry into Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement, except for the protected Indian
 areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return. A parent, however,
 is not allowed to leave the country with children without the permission of the other
 parent.
 In July the Government passed legislation with provisions for asylum and refugee
 status intended to conform with the principles of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating
 to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government provides first asy-
 lum and cooperates with the office of the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were
 207 requests for refugee status covering 277 persons; 68 cases (for 80 persons) were
 granted and 176 cases (for 198 persons) were denied. According to the UNHCR,
 there were 2,260 refugees in the country atlyear's end.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Voting is secret and mandatory for
 all literate citizens age 18 to 70, except military conscripts who may not vote. It is
 voluntary for minors age 16 to 18, for the illiterate, and for those age 70 and over.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution and are becoming active
 in politics and government. They comprise 7.6 percent of the national Congress; 39
 women serve in the Chamber of Deputies (out of 513 seats), and 6 serve in the Sen-
 ate (out of 81 members).
 Brazil's diverse ethnic and racial groups are-not represented in government and
 politics in proportion to their numbers in the general population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human -ights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Federal officials are
 generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 The IACHR's December report noted President Cardoso's "objective treatment" of
 human rights problems and the positive thrust of the national human rights Action
 Plan. The report also strongly criticized Brazil for violating a broad range of human
 rights, including police violence and involvement in extrajudicial killing, violence
 against and exploitation of minors, and general impunity for human rights violators.
 President Cardoso publicly accepted the conclusions of the IACHR report, acknowl-
 edging in a speech that "We cannot, as in the past, pretend these things dd not
 exist.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional, yet women, blacks, and indigenous people continued to experience discrimi-
 nation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) notes that important differences
 in wages continue to exist to the detriment of women and blacks, particularly in
 rural areas. The Government passed a law in May with prison penalties and fines
 for racism, including promulgation of pejorative terms for ethnic or racial groups,
 use of the swastika, or acts of discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, reli-
 gion, age, or ethnic origin.
 There continued to be reports of violence against homosexuals, although it was
 not always clear that the victims' sexual orientation was the reason. The Grupo Gay
 da Bahia, Brazil's best known homosexual rights organization, compiled media re-
 orts indicatin that 109 homosexuals were killed in the first 10 months of the year.
 ile some of those reports showed clear evidence of a hate crime, most did not
 provide evidence that the victims were targeted because of their sexual orientation.
 Women.-There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women. Most major cities
 and towns have established special police offices to deal with crimes of domestic or
 sexual violence against women; such offices total over 200. The special police office
 in Brasilia has seen a steady increase in reports of crimes against women during
 the last 7 years, but police and social workers attribute the increase in reported
 complaints not to a rising level of violence against women, but to greater awareness
 by women of their rights and less willingness to tolerate abuse than in the past.
 In rural areas, abused women have little recourse since there are no specialized
 police offices available to them. Men who commit crimes against women, including
 sexual assault and murder, are unlikely to be brought to trial. Although the Su-
 preme Court in 1991 struck down the archaic concept of "defense of honor" as a jus-
 tification for murder of a wife, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict
 men who claim they attack their wives for infidelity.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment or pay and
 provides for 120 daya of paid maternity leave. However, the provision against wage
 discrimination is rarely enforced. According to the most recent official statistics,
 women earn, on average, 54 percent of the salaries earned by men. A recent study
 by a sociologist showed that women who started working in positions in which they
 earned twice the minimum wage advanced in pay after 10 years to a wage of seven
 times the minimum wage. Men starting in the same positions earned 2.6 times the
 minimum wage and advanced to a wage of 10.9 times the minimum wage after 10
 years. A Ministry of Labor survey revealed that the average starting salary for high
 school-educated women in Sao Paulo was one-third less than the average starting
 salary for high school-educated men.
 
 
 438
 In response to the maternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certifi-
 cates from female job applicants or try to avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 Hoping to clamp own on such practices, President Cardos signed a law in April
 1995 prohibiting employers from requiring applicants or employees to take preg-
 nancy tests or present sterilization certificates. Employers who violate the law are
 subject to a jail term ranging from I to 2 years, while the company must pay a fine
 equal to 10 times the salary of its highest paid employee.
 Children.-Despite progressive laws to protect children and a growing awareness
 of their plight through media and NGO campaigns, millions of children continue to
 fail to get an education, must work to survive, and suffer from the poverty afflicting
 their families. A report issued by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statis-
 tics (IBGE) stated that the number of children between the ages of 10 and 14 who
 were employed decreased by 163,000 from 1993 to 1995. However, more than 3.8
 million children in the same age range continue to work, many of them together
 with their parents, under con tions approximating forced labor or debt bondage
 (see Sections 6.c. and 6.d.). Many other children beg on the streets of cities. School-
 ing is free and compulsory for the first six grades and available in all parts of the
 country. The education system does not exclude any groups, and most children re-
 main in school until age 14.
 There are no reliable figures on the number of street children, some of whom are
 homeless, but the majority of whom return home at night. In Rio de Janeiro, an
 organization aiding street children estimated recently that 30,000 frequent the
 streets by day but probably less than 1,000 sleep there. NGO's have made enough
 shelters available for homeless children, but some children prefer the freedom and
 drugs that street life offers. In Sao Paulo, NGO's aiding street children estimated
 that some 12,000 children roam the streets by day and that from 3,000 to 5,000 of
 them live permanently on the streets. The NGO s report that extreme poverty at
 home or sexual abuse by fathers and stepfathers are the principal reasons so many
 children choose to live on the streets. An IBGE study reported that 47 percent of
 Sao Paulo children come from families that earn less than $200 per month. In Sal-
 vador, Bahia, the NGO's estimate the number of children who sleep in the streets
 to be less than 1,000, although this number fluctuates widely during the weeks be-
 tween Christmas and Carnival, when children from the region are attracted to the
 city by the large number of tourists and festivals. Nationwide, the Inter-American
 Development Bank estimates that some 30 million children live below the poverty
 line and increasingly come from households headed by women.
 Because street children have a high rate of drug use and have been involved in
 assaults and robberies, a significant portion of the public supports harsh police
 measures against them, viewing the issue as one of crime and security, not human
 rights. Government and NGO resources for street children have not been able to
 keep up with the high demand.
 Homicide became the leading cause of death among 15- to 17-year- olds, with its
 rate more than tripling since 1980, according to a survey published in November.
 The survey, conducted by IGBE and the United Nations Children's Fund, found that
 23.5 percent of deaths in that age group were homicides, compared with 7.8 percent
 in 1980. Among children between the ages of 10 and 14, homicide accounted for 5.1
 percent of all deaths. In Rio de Janeiro, according to the Division for the Protection
 of Children and Adolescents and the Court of Infancy and Youth, approximately 659
 minors were shot to death in 1996, up from 596 in 1995.
 The Government continued its campaign against sex tourism and child prostitu-
 tion, a significant problem throughout the country, but particularly prevalent in the
 major tourist cities in the northeast. The Federal District has a 24-hour number for
 reporting cases of sexual abuse; a special police unit to investigate sexual crimes
 against children; and special teams at all clinics and hospitals to treat child victims
 of violence or sexual abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution contains several provisions for the dis-
 abled, stipulating a minimum wage, educational opportunities, and access to public
 buildings and pullic transportation. Groups that work with the disabled, however,
 report that state governments failed to meet the legally mandated targets for edu-
 cational opportunities and work placement. There was little progress in the elimi-
 nation of architectural barriers to the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Brazil's approximately 330,000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferent languages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. Indigenous
 rights groups, however, expressed concern that in practice the authorities allow
 most indigenous people only limited participation in ecisions affecting their lands,
 cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. The 1988 Constitution
 charged the Federal Government with demarcating indigenous areas within 5 years,
 but the authorities have yet to complete the process.
 
 
 In January 1996, the Government issued decree 1775, altering the demarcation
 process to permit challenges to proposed demarcations from nonindigenous inter-
 ested parties, despite the fact that the Constitution allows the Federal Government
 to expropriate land with just compensation. A total of 419 separate challenges, cov-
 ering 34 Indian areas, were filed. FUNAI, the National Indian Foundation, rejected
 all of the claims, and forwarded them to Justice Minister Nelson Jobim. Eventually
 the Ministry rejected all the challenges. In November President Cardoso signed de-
 crees ratifying the 22 indigenous reserves, which encompass 8.4 million hectares
 where 9 indigenous groups live. With these new reservations, the Government has
 set aside a total of 28.2 million hectares for indigenous reserves, representing about
 5 percent of the country's territory.
 The Constitution provides Indians with the exclusive use of the soil, waters, and
 minerals found on their lands, subject to congressional authorization. The regula-
 tions necessary for economic exploitation, however, are still pending before the Con-
 gress. Illegal mining, logging, and ranching are a serious problem on Indian lands,
 as a majority of these lands also have been occupied by non-Indians. In November
 FUNAI, with help from the army and air force, began clearing out an estimated 800
 to 1,000 wildcat miners from indigenous lands in Roraima.
 Due to the Federal Government's failure to provide adequate medical care, as re-
 quired by law, indigenous people have suffered epidemics of malaria, measles, and
 tuberculosis. The Catholic Church-affiliated Indigenist Missionary Council (CIMI)
 and the coordinator of Brazilian Amazon Indigenous Organizations (COIAB) have
 reported on the lack of health care for Indians in the Amazon region. According to
 a report by the Manaus-based Institute of Tropical Medicine, the average, life expect-
 ancy of Brazilian Indians dropped from 48.2 years in 1993 to 42.6 years in 1995.
 A federal judge convicted 5 gold miners in December 1996 for killing 17
 Yanomami on the Venezuelan border in 1993, but only two of the miners are in cus-
 tody. Indigenous rights groups expressed concern that the others may never be
 brought to justice.
 In August a federal judge dismissed murder charges against four young men ac-
 cused of dousing an Indian leader with gasoline and setting him on fire, saying that
 they did not realize he was an Indian nor did they intend to kill him. One defendant
 was the son of a federal judge. The victim was Galdino Jesus dos Santos, age 44,
 of the Pataxo tribe. The judge's decision was widely criticized, and President
 Cardoso denounced the murder as unjustifiable.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minortties.-Although racial discrimination has been ille-
 gal since 1951, darker skinned citizens say they frequently encounter discrimina-
 tion. Most blacks are found among the poorer sectors of society. Even though nearly
 half of the population has some African ancestry, very few senior officials in govern-
 ment, the armed forces, or the private sector are black. Black consciousness organi-
 zations challenge the view that Brazil is a racial democracy with equality for all re-
 gardless of skin color. They assert that racial discrimination becomes most evident
 when blacks seek employment, housing, or educational opportunities.
 According to government statistics, blacks earn on average 43 percent as much
 as whites. The monthly per capita income for white males is 6.3 times the minimum
 wage; for white women, 3.6 times the minimum wage; for black men, 2.9; and for
 black women, 1.7. Illiteracy is also a problem; 32 percent of blacks are illiterate,
 compared with 14 percent of whites. Of 30,000 students at the University of Sao
 Paulo, there are about 1,000 blacks.
 Blacks are often the victims of violence at a level disproportionate to their per-
 centage in the population. For instance, a well-respected human rights NGO active
 in the northeast, the Luiz Freire Cultural Center, reported that, of the 1,378 murder
 victims in Recife in 1994, 87 percent were black.
 A much higher percentage of blacks are convicted by courts than whites, according
 to professor Sergio Adorno, of the University of Sao Paulo's Nucleus for the Study
 of Violence. Adorno analyzed 500 criminal cases judged in Sao Paulo courts in 1990
 and found that 60 percent of whites able to afford their own lawyers were acquitted,
 while only 27 percent of blacks who hired lawyers were found not guilty.
 In September a government working group on racism and discrimination issued
 29 recommendations, including the creation of affirmative action programs for uni-
 versity admissions and government hiring. The group was charged with proposing
 public policies to increase the participation and access of Afro- Brazilians in society.
 The President's public acknowledgment in November 1995 that racism and-discrimi-
 nation exist was unprecedented, for presidents had maintained in the past that peo-
 ple were discriminated against because they were poor, not because of their skin
 color.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associatin.-The Labor Code provides for representation of all
 workers (except for members of the military, uniformed police, and firemen) but im-
 poses a hierarchical, unitary system, funded by a mandatory union tax on workers
 and employers. Under a restriction known as "unicidade" (one per city), the code
 prhibits multiple unions of the same professional category in a given geographical
 area. The 1988 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones
 without prior authorization by the Government, but retained other provisions of the
 old Labor Code. All elements of the labor movement and the International Confed-
 eration of Fre  e   Unions (ICFTU) criticize the retention of unicidade.
 Unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as more liberal interpreta-
 tions permitted new unions to form and, in many cases, to compete with unions and
 federations that had already enjoyed official recognition. The sole bureaucratic re-
 quiremnt for new unions is to register with the Ministry of Labor which, by court
 decision, must accept and record the registration. In practice, unicidade is enforced
 by the system of labor courts, which retain the right to review the registration of
 new unions and to adjudicate conflicts over their formation. This can often result
 in complicated jurisdictional quarrels. The pwer of the labor courts to define juris-
 dictions came to the fore when the Workers Unitary Central (CUT-the largest and
 most activist of thethree labor confederations) A   nBC metaworkers' federation was
 riven by a 1996 attempt by a group of dissidents to establish their own local union
 in one of the suburban Sao o l municipalities that the federation comprises. Al-
 though a majority of federation members hlearly appeared to favor the unified struc-
 ture, the dissidents were able to seek re ss through the labor court, where a suit
 still was pending at year's end.
 Otherwise, uni ons are independent of the Government and, at least nominally, of
 political parties. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the work force is organized, with
 well over half this number affiliated with an independent labor central. Intimidation
 of rural labor union organizers by landowners and their agents continues to be a
 problem (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides workers, including most civil servants, with the right
 to strike. Enabling legislation passed in 1989 stipulates that essential services must
 remain in operation during a strike and that workers must notify employers at least
 48 hours before beginning a walkout. The Constitution prohibits government inter-
 ference in labor unons but provides that "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not
 maintaining essential services, or failure to end a strike after a labor court decision)
 is punishable by law. In the case of public employees, the Constitution specifies
 their right to strike, subject to conditions enacted by the Congess. Since the Con-
 gress has yet to pass the complementary legislation, labor an[ legal experts debate
 the limits of the right to strike for public employees. In practice, the Government
 has not interfered with their right to strike, although a moth-ong strike by
 Petrobras (the state-controlled oil company) employees in May 1995 which greatly
 inconvenienced the public, was judged abusive by the Supreme Labor Court, and
 caused many-including some labor leaders--to call for limits on public employees'
 right to strike.
 The CUT, the parent central to the petroleum workers, submitted a complaint to
 the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association in May 1995 arguing that th firing
 of 59 union members for their involvement in the strike viomate their right to
 strike. In November 1995, the ILO body found that the nature of the labor court's
 procedures, which allow either party to submit a dispute for what amounts to bind-
 g arbitration, "may effectively undermine the right of workers to strike and does
 not promote effective collective bargaining." The ILO suggested that the legislation
 be amended to permit submission of disputes to judicial authorities only with the
 ermission of both parties or in case of the interruption of essential services. The
 rLO also suggested that the 59 workers be rehired and that the high fines levied
 on the local unions for defiance of a court order to return to work amounted to a
 serious limitatio  n the right to strike. President Cardoso maintained that since
 the fies were levied by the courts, the executive branch should not interfere and
 the unions should seek relief in the courts.
 Postal workers and teachers, police, train and municipal transit workers, auto-
 workers, metalworkers, electrical generating authority employees, and dockworkers
 all went on strike in 1997. Formerly, the courts almost automatically ruled strikes
 abusive. In recent years, however, the courts have applied the law with more discre-
 tion. The 1989 strike law prohibits dismissals or the hiring of substitute workers
 during a strike, with certain exceptions, provided the strike is not ruled abusive.
 Although the law makes no provision for a central labor organization, three major
 groups have emerged: The Workers' Unitary Central, the Workers' General Confed-
 eration, and the Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing to represent
 
 
 professional categories of workers, but all three centrals can effectively acquire such
 standing by affiliating with existing statewide federations or nationwide confed-
 erations or by forming new federations and confederations.-
 Unions and centrals freely affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 All three major confederations are affiliated with the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize. With government assistance, businesses and unions are work-
 ing to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. The scope of issues
 legally susceptible to collective bargaining is narrow. The labor court system exer-
 cises normative power with regard to the settlement of labor disputes, thus discour-
 aging direct negotiation. The Cardoso Government has made expansion of collective
 bargaining one of its major objectives in the labor sector. In mid-1995, the Govern-
 ment promulgated a provisional measure that simultaneously ended inflation-index-
 ing of wages, allowed for mediation of wage settlements if the parties involved so
 desired, and provided greater latitude for collective bargaining. Unions have wel-
 comed these changes, since labor courts and the Labor Ministry previously had me-
 diation responsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute settlement. In many
 cases, free negotiations set wages; labor court decisions set them in others. Under
 the provisional measure, parties may now freely choose mediation.
 The ILO notes that important differences in wages continue to exist to the det-
 riment of women and blacks, particularly in the rural sectors (see Section 5).
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the old Labor Code prohibiting dis-
 missal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership positions.
 Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort to a
 lengthy court process for relief. In general, the authorities do not effectively enforce
 laws protecting union members from discrimination. Union officials estimate that
 only 5 percent of such cases reaching the labor court system are resolved within
 days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent generally take 5 to
 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies equally in the free trade zones. However, unions in the Manaus
 free trade zone, like rural unions and many unions in smaller cities, are relatively
 weaker vis-a-vis industry than unions in the major industrial centers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor, there were credible reports of forced labor in many parts -of the
 country. The Catholic Church-affiliated Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) continued
 to report cases of forced labor in various states. In 1996 the CPT reported 21 cases
 of forced labor, involving a total of 26,047 workers in 8 states. The number of work-
 ers involved represented a small increase over the 25,193 reported in 1995 and a
 large increase over the 19,940 reported in 1994. Forced labor is common on, farms
 producing charcoal for use in the iron foundries, steel mills, and in the sugar indus-
 try (see also Section 6.d.).
 Federal authorities admit that enforcement resources are inadequate and, as a re-
 sult, state and federal officers have been unable generally to conduct timely inves-
 tigations of compulsory labor, although their record is improving.
 Local police acknowledge that overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay
 from migrant laborers and use force to retain and intimidate them, but such viola-
 tions fall within the jurisdiction of the federal Ministry of Labor, which has 3,000
 inspecr for the entire country. Because of its limited resources, the Ministry gen-
 erally investigates only those cases for which it has received a complaint. In an ef-
 fort to combat forced labor, the CUT initiated a 24-hour hot line with a toll free
 numbor for reporting instances of forced labor.
 The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but it is not adequately
 enforced. Labor organizations allege that in mining and the rural economy thou-
 sands of workers, including minors, ar hired on the basis of false promises, sub-
 jected to debt bonda  wit violence used to retain or punish workers who attempt
 to escape (also see Section 6.d.). The Governmen  ntneragency task frce deploys
 federal law enforcement officers to combat forced labor. The CPT has noted that the
 task force's effectiveness is sometimes hampered by its inability to arrive in an area
 without advance warning and by the often spotty collaboration of the federal police.
 The people responsible for ex iting forced labor usually go unpunished because
 freed workers are often afraid to testify against those w o recruited and oversaw
 them, and because he authorities have found it difficult to identify and locate the
 owners of farms or businesses that exploit forced labor.
 The Labor Ministry decreed in 1995 that farms caught a second time using forced
 labor would be seized and used to settle landiess families as part of the Federal
 Government's agrarian reform program. The authority was used when 220 laborers
 were freed at the Fazenda Flor da Mata in Para and the farm was turned over to
 the land reform agency to resettle landless families.
 
 
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but enforcement varies considerably
 depending on location (see Section 6.c). Schooling is free and compulsoy for the first
 six grades. Most children remain in school until at least age 14. The minimum
 working age under the Constitution is 14 years, except for apprentices. The Govern-
 ment announced in June that it would raise the minimum working age to 15.
 Judges can authorize employment for children under 14 years of age when they feel
 it appropriate. The law requires permission of the parents or guardians for minors
 to work, and they must attend school through the primary grades. The law bars all
 minors from night work, work that constitutes a physical strain, and employment
 in unhealthful, dangerous, or morally harmful conditions. The Government esti-
 mates, however, that 60,000 children work in unhealthful conditions. The authori-
 ties rarely enforce legal restrictions intended to protect working minors under the
 age of 18, however, and the problem is serious.
 Despite these legal restrictions, official figures state that nearly 3.8 million chil-
 dren under age 14 were employed, accounting for 4.6 percent of the work force.
 Many children work alongside their parents in cane fields, cutting hemp, or feeding
 wood into charcoal ovens; frequent accidents, unhealthy working conditions, and
 squalor are common in these cases.
 Enforcement of restrictions is limited by the small number of inspectors available.
 Inspection suffers from a lack of resources and, as with forced labor, inspectors gen-
 erally act on the basis of complaints and tips concerning the use of child labor.
 When inspections do take place, however, they are effective. Employers illegally
 using child labor have been ined heavily for their offenses.
 Sugar cane growers illegally employ children and adolescents ranging in age from
 7 to 17 years of age, many cutting cane with machetes. In September 1996, the
 Labor Ministry created a special fund supported by a percentage of income from the
 production of sugar cane, alcohol, and sugar, which is used to combat child labor
 in cane cultivation. The charcoal industry, hemp cultivators in the northeast, and
 orange growers have all used illegal child labor. Children also perform various tasks
 in the mining and logging industries in the Amazon region. In addition, although
 strenuous efforts have been made to eliminate it, there is still some child labor in
 the shoe industry.
 The private sector, and particularly the Toy Manufacturers Foundation for Chil-
 dren's Rights (ABRINQ), have been active in trying to remedy many of these abuses.
 The ABRINQ reached an agreement with the Sao Paulo state sugar producers to
 cease using child labor. In addition, the ABRINQ persuaded Abecitrus, the citrus
 export organization, to agree to remove child labor from its operations. Because of
 ABRINQ's efforts, Volkswagen and General Motors, as well as other automakers,
 are studying the role of child labor in the production of auto parts. Both Volkswagen
 and GM have agreed to remove child labor from their own operations. The govern-
 ment is reviewing an ABRINQ proposal to create a quadripartite group coordinated
 by the ILO and UNICEF with representatives from government, business, labor and
 NG' to investigate and eliminate cases of child labor.
 ABRINQ's efforts have been particularly distinguished by the foundation's empha-
 sis not just on ending child labor, but in putting the children into good-quality
 schools. Shoe manufacturers in the city of Franca have, with the help of the
 ABRINQ, eliminated child labor there and enhanced the educational opportunities
 for children who were formerly employed. Following a pilot project in 1996, the state
 government of Mate Grosso do Sul instituted an innovative program designed to
 eliminate child labor in the charcoal industry and the shoe industry. The state of-
 fered scholarships to the families of working children on the condition that they stop
 working and attend school. The program is being expanded to five other states.
 On October 7, the Sao Paulo state government promulgated a law that prohibits
 the state from using contractors who exploit child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The official minimum wage is 120 reals ($110)
 per month. It is not sufficient to provide a Aecent standard of living for a worker
 and family. The Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics es-
 timated that the minimum wage is slightly more than one-fourth that necessary to
 support a family of four (the standard set by the Constitution). Many workers, par-
 ticularly outside the regulated economy and in the northeast, reportedly earn less
 than the minimum wage.
 The Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly rest pe-
 riod of 24 consecutive hours, preferably on Sundays. The Constitution expanded pay
 and fringe benefits and established new protection for agricultural and domestic
 workers, although not all of these provisions are enforced. All workers in the formal
 sector receive overtime pay for work beyond 44 hours, and there are prohibitions
 against excessiv  e  of overtime.
 
 
 Unsafe working conditions are prevalent throughout the country; The Ministry of
 Labor sets occupational, health, and safety standards, but its resources are
 insufficent for adequate inspection and enforcement of these standards. There were
 also credible reports of corruption within the enforcement system. If a worker has
 a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly from his employer,
 the worker or union can file a claim with the regional labor court, although in prac-
 tice this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 The law requires employers to establish internal committees for accident preven-
 tion in workplaces. It also protects employee members of these committees from
 being fired for their activities. Such firings, however, do occur, and legal recourse
 usually requires years for resolution. While an individual worker does not have the
 legal right to depart a workplace when faced with hazardous conditions, workers
 may express such concerns to the internal committee, which would conduct an im-
 mediate investigation.
