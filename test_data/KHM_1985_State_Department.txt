 CAMBODIA
 Control of Cambodia has been contested since January 1979,
 when the Vietnamese army drove the Khmer Rouge Communist
 regime of Democratic Kampuchea out of Phnom Penh and installed
 its own puppet regime, the so-called People's Republic of
 Kampuchea, under a former Khmer Rouge division commander, Heng
 Samrin. Vietnam controls all major cities and towns and
 maintains the Heng Samrin regime in power by force of arms.
 This control is challenged by a three-part Khmer resistance
 movement, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea,
 which holds Cambodia's seat at the United Nations. During the
 1984-85 dry season the Vietnamese army overran all of the
 civilian camps and resistance bases close to the Thai border,
 but the resistance continues to conduct guerrilla operations
 throughout large parts of Cambodia.
 Vietnam has attempted to develop political and economic
 institutions on the Vietnamese model, with power restricted to
 the Communist Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, which
 is dominated by the Communist Party of Vietnam. Vietnam, by
 highlighting the brutality of the former Khmer Rouge regime,
 seeks acceptance of its own military occupation while
 attempting to establish institutions and popular support for
 the Heng Samrin regime, with the declared objective of
 enabling the Vietnamese army to leave Cambodia by 1990.
 The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea opposing
 Vietnamese domination of Cambodia and contesting the authority
 of the Heng Samrin regime was formed in 1982 when two
 non-Communist resistance groups joined with the Khmer Rouge.
 The latter have perhaps between 30-40,000 armed men, and the
 non-Communists about 23,000. While in power from 1975 to 1979
 the Khmer Rouge had compiled one of history's worst records of
 human rights violations, responsible for the deaths of
 probably over one million Khmer. Since its overthrow by
 Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge claim to have abandoned their radical
 ideology and-policies. The Khmer Rouge leadership is
 attempting to gain the following of the Khmer people by public
 support for traditional institutions such as Buddhism and by
 publicizing its links with the popular former ruler, Prince
 Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge formally dissolved the Communist
 Party of Kampuchea in 1981, and Khmer Rouge strongman Pol Pot
 purportedly formally "retired" to an advisory role in 1985 but
 the Khmer Rouge top leadership--Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and
 Son Sen--remains in place.
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) with
 approximately 14,000 men under arms is led by former Prime
 Minister Son Sann and espouses government based on
 parliamentary ideals. The third group in the coalition, the
 National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,
 and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), with approximately 9,000
 armed soldiers in its Sihanoukist National Army (ANS), is
 headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled as hereditary
 king and later head of state until 1970. The appeal of this
 organization centers on the Prince's international stature and
 his popularity within Cambodia.
 Cambodia's economy is based on subsistence-level agriculture.
 Although the regime is attempting to impose a collective
 economic system, lack of control and administrative capacity
 have resulted in continued reliance on decentralized
 agricultural production. After seven years of Vietnamese
 control, Cambodian industry, reportedly-consisting of some 36
 
 
 727
 CAMBODIA
 operating factories and a total industrial and public sector
 work force of approximately 150,000, remains of marginal
 importance to the economy. Most other nonagricultural
 employment is in small family-run services or handicrafts.
 During 1985 systematic violations of human rights continued.
 The Vietnamese and the Heng Samrin regime greatly expanded
 forced labor defensive work projects in support of combat
 operations in western Cambodia in an attempt to cut off
 infiltration by the resistance. As a result, there have been
 heavy casualties due to mines and disease.
 The scope of military and paramilitary activity and associated
 violence by both Vietnam and the Khmer resistance groups
 increased in 1985. In their fight against the Vietnamese and
 the Heng Samrin regime, the Khmer Rouge have employed
 terrorist tactics, including murder and destruction of
 economic resources, against Khmer civilians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killing in the Vietnamese-controlled
 areas declined after an intensive Vietnamese/Heng Samrin
 internal security campaign against suspected opponents in
 mid-1983. Khmer resistance groups continue to report
 instances of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin officials killing
 suspects during interrogations. Testimony of former Heng
 Samrin security officials does not reveal a pattern of
 arbitrarykilling. However, death in captivity due to torture
 or other mistreatment is common, according to testimony of
 former prisoners. These reports have been substantiated by
 interviews conducted in 1985 by the Lawyers Committee for
 Human Rights.
 The number of allegations concerning the use of lethal
 chemicals or toxins by the Vietnamese against Cambodian
 resistance forces subsided in 1985. Those that were reported
 were fully investigated by U.S. government specialists in
 chemical warfare, but none of these reports were confirmed
 according to U.S. strict standards of proof.
 The Khmer Rouge, a movement based on total control of the
 lives of its adherents, seems to have moderated its use of
 terrorist tactics in 1985. Nevertheless, civilians continue
 to be killed during attacks on lines of communication and
 other economic targets. Khmer Rouge defectors report that
 prisoners in Khmer Rouge jails have been killed by mines while
 performing-forced labor. Some former Khmer Rouge believe that
 those deaths were intended by the Khmer Rouge. One former
 Khmer Rouge military officer who defected in 1985 claimed that
 people had been executed for marrying without permission.
 Reportedly, the KPNLF conducted summary executions of a few
 soldiers believed to have engaged in banditry, rape, or other
 violent crimes near the Thai-Cambodian border. It is apparent
 that disaffected KPNLF troops, often deserters, and the lack
 of discipline in the KPNLF have resulted in criminal attacks
 on some Thai and Khmer refugees in the Thai-Cambodian border
 areas.

 CAMBODIA
 b. Disappearance
 There have been reports that Heng Samrin security officials
 have been responsible for the disappearance of persons
 suspected of being opponents of the regime. A Heng Samrin
 official who defected in 1984 has reported that resistance
 soldiers who accept offers of amnesty from the Heng Samrin
 authorities frequently disappear following formal release from
 reeducation. The official also claimed that individuals
 arrested for economic violations have disappeared. Most of
 those who have disappeared apparently have been imprisoned,
 but some may have been killed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical torture has been reported in both rural areas and
 Phnom Penh prisons. The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights
 reported, based on its 1984-1985 interviews, that persons
 suspected of resistance activity are routinely tortured in the
 early weeks and months of detention by Vietnamese and Heng
 Samrin officials. Cambodians arriving at the border in 1985
 report that beatings during interrogation to uncover
 resistance sympathizers continue to be the most common form of
 mistreatment. There have also been reports of suffocation
 with plastic bags, burning with boiling water, deprivation of
 food and sleep, and degrading treatment such as removing
 clothing during interrogation. Psychological pressures such
 as the threat of indefinite confinement without trial are
 employed during interrogation. The Lawyers Committee reported
 a pattern of initial detention during which prisoners were
 shackled in a dark cell, interrogated, and tortured. After
 several months of this interrogation phase, prisoners were
 usually transferred to larger daylight cells, which they
 shared with other prisoners, and eventually to work camps
 prior to release. A Heng Samrin security service official who
 defected to the border in late 1984 reported that political
 prisoners in Phnom Penh were confined in isolation for up to 3
 months while being interrogated by the Vietnamese military.
 This source claimed that criminal prisoners were frequently
 beaten and tortured by the interrogation bureau of the Heng
 Samrin police (the Ministry of Interior), but that the
 interrogation bureau did not torture political prisoners.
 Cambodians who left Khmer Rouge control in late 1984 report
 that those who violate minor regulations, such as by
 conducting unauthorized trading, are punished by detention and
 forced labor. Those committing more serious offenses, such as
 trying to escape from Khmer Rouge control or having
 unauthorized contacts with foreigners, have been confined in
 underground cells for periods of up to 3 months or forced to
 work in dangerous, mine-infested areas. A number of
 Vietnamese prisoners who had been in Khmer Rouge hands ended
 up in Thailand following Vietnamese attacks on Khmer Rouge
 bases in early 1984. Press photographs of the Vietnamese
 indicated that they were close to starvation. Treatment of
 Vietnamese and Heng Samrin prisoners by the non-Communist
 resistance groups has been generally adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Suspected resistance sympathizers are detained, interrogated,
 and often jailed for extended periods of time with neither
 formal charges nor pursuant to other legal procedures.
 
 
 729
 CAMBODIA
 Separate sections within the Heng Samrin police are
 responsible for investigation of activities by the
 non-Communist (KPNLF and Sihanoukist) and Communist (Khmer
 Rouge) resistance groups. The Ministry of Interior maintains
 at least three prisons in Cambodia in which suspected
 supporters of the resistance are held without formal charges,
 often for more than 3 years. Provincial police and joint
 Vietnamese/Heng Samrin military internal security units
 maintain additional detention and interrogation centers.
 Regulations of the Heng Samrin regime call for the arrest and
 reeducation of "any person carrying out propaganda campaigns
 to sabotage internal unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam
 solidarity." Such reeducation means indefinite detention to
 force a change in political values. The 1985 Amnesty
 International Report expressed concern about the detention
 without trial of persons suspected of anti-regime activities.
 There is a virtual absence of legal process for those
 detained. Those detained or arrested are almost never
 informed of the charges against them, nor are they given
 access to a lawyer or informed of any rights or legal
 protections to which they are entitled.
 In Vietnamese-controlled areas, forced labor is common. The
 Vietnamese and the Heng Samrin regime have systematically
 conscripted Khmer civilians from throughout Cambodia for work
 on military-related projects in or near combat areas along the
 Thai-Cambodian border. The number of forced laborers
 increased to the tens of thousands in 1985 as workers were
 organized into paramilitary units in a massive program to
 construct physical-obstacles against infiltration by
 resistance forces. The workers have suffered frequent loss of
 life from mines, malaria, and other diseases in the remote
 border areas. Foreign observers in Phnom Penh have reported
 that the hospitals there.have been inundated with sick and
 injured civilians returning from the border construction
 projects and that malaria, including the severe and sometimes
 fatal cerebral variety, is spreading into previously safe
 areas of Cambodia. Forced participation also places the
 workers' lives at risk when Vietnamese or resistance military
 actions occur nearby.
 The Khmer Rouge also require labor from all individuals under
 their control and prevent them from leaving, either to return
 to areas controlled by the Vietnamese or to join the
 non-Communist Khmer resistance groups. Khmer Rouge defectors
 in 1985 report that they were forced to carry supplies and
 ammunition into the interior of Cambodia in support of
 military operations and they claim they were punished if they
 failed to carry out these tasks.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied the right to a trial. Figures on the numbers of
 political prisoners in Cambodia are only rough estimates. A
 Ministry of Interior official who fled Cambodia in 1985
 estimated that the main ministry prison in Phnom Penh (T-3)
 housed about 600 low-rapkI.g former Heng Samrin officials in
 one section and an unknown number of other political prisoners
 in a separate section of the prison. A second prison, Prey
 Sar, reportedly holds approximately 1,000 prisoners, including
 many political prisoners. The Lawyers Committee estimates
 that political prisoners number in the thousands, and this
 
 
 730
 CAMBODIA
 seems to be a conservative estimate, especially if those held
 in provincial jails and military interrogation facilities are
 included.
 Trials are used primarily for purposes of propaganda and
 public intimidation, with the verdict decided in advance.
 Show trials in 1980 and 1983 were intended in large part to
 publicize the "confessions" of the accused. There are few
 procedural rights for defendants. A 1982 law on the
 organization of courts provides the right of counsel only with
 prior approval of the court. The 1981 Constitution provides
 for public trials, but allows for closed sessions. Arrivals
 on the border have related little information about the
 workings of the Heng Samrin legal system, either in theory or
 practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Heng Samrin authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish. Networks of informers report to the secret police, and
 Vietnamese personnel are assigned to monitor all levels of the
 Heng Samrin internal security apparatus. Vietnamese and Heng
 Samrin authorities have forced people to relocate into
 fortified villages in order to prevent contact with resistance
 forces.
 The Khmer Rouge maintain strict control on the social activity
 of those under its control. Severe punishment may be given
 for acts such as marrying without permission, contacts with
 foreigners or listening to unauthorized radio broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Heng Samrin areas the press and radio are wholly controlled
 by Hanoi and its client regime. Criticism of the regime is
 not tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals admitted,
 except those officially distributed. There have been reports
 of arrests for listening to foreign radio broadcasts. A
 similar situation exists in the Khmer Rouge camps. The
 non-Communist groups do not have such restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Heng Samrin regime are
 those for groups such as farmers, women, and youth which were
 created to support the regime. Organized labor is totally
 under the regime's control, and industries have organized
 branches of the official "Trade Union for National
 Salvation." Collective bargaining is unheard of. The Khmer
 Rouge do not allow associations or trade unions. The
 non-Communist groups encourage voluntary women's associations
 which have both educational and social functions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion, destroying temples and
 defrocking monks. Islam and Christianity, as "foreign"
 religions, were even more ruthlessly suppressed. The Heng
 Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious practices
 but has not reinstated Buddhism as a state religion.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 Religious activities are closely controlled by the regime. At
 the second Buddhist Monks' Conference in Phnom Penh on July 4,
 1984, a resolution was passed which forced Buddhism into the
 "two strategic tasks of the party--namely, to defend the
 fatherland and to build it step-by-step toward socialism
 through the period of transition." In general, the Heng
 Samrin authorities attempt to use Buddhism as one of a number
 of organizations for "mass mobilization," to implement party
 policies. Christian groups are harassed by the Heng Samrin
 regime. The Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in
 Phnom Penh are reportedly not authorized to meet. Muslims,
 most of whom are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been
 encouraged by the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious
 community, and Muslims have spoken out in public in support of
 the Heng Samrin regime and against the excesses of the former
 Khmer Rouge regime.
 Since being driven from power, the Khmer Rouge have tried to
 give the impression of reform. However, defectors from the
 Khmer Rouge zone in 1985 report that Buddhism is still
 discouraged by Khmer Rouge authorities. Christianity and
 Islam are not known to have been revived in Khmer
 Rouge-controlled areas since.
 Non-Communist resistance camps afford complete freedom of
 religion. The camps feature active Buddhist temples and often
 have Muslim mosques and Christian churches as well.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within the areas under its authority. A system of
 neighborhood surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese
 system, was introduced in 1981. A system requiring family
 registration and identification books was begun in 1980, and
 in 1983 the registration effort was placed under the police in
 each local administrative unit. Complex regulations govern
 movement of families and individuals within Cambodia. Passes
 are required for internal movement between villages.
 Checkpoints are ubiquitous, and bribes as well as passes are
 required to pass them, although checkpoints can often be
 dodged by avoiding roads. Only a few top Heng Samrin regime
 officials travel abroad. Other Khmer seeking to leave the
 country flee to the border to try to enter Thailand, and the
 Heng Samrin regime routinely imprisons those caught attempting
 to do so.
 The Heng Samrin regime has agreed in principle to accept
 refugees back from camps in Thailand but has taken only a
 handful so far. No agreement has been reached by the Heng
 Samrin regime and the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees [UNHCR] on the mechanics of repatriation. Thousands
 of Khmer have returned informally to Cambodia from the Thai
 border. There is no reliable information on what conditions
 they face if they become known to the Phnom Penh authorities,
 but the UNHCR does provide some limited assistance to the Heng
 Samrin regime for returnees. Nearly all of the Khmer allowed
 refugee status in Thailand have been approved for resettlement
 and departed for Western countries. At least 245,000
 Cambodians not given refugee status (the "border Khmer")
 remain in camps along the Thai-Cambodian border where they are
 assisted by the United Nations and the International Committee
 of the Red Cross.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their
 zone and attempt to prevent the non-Communists from operating
 in or crossing what they consider their "liberated areas" in
 Cambodia. In one 1984 instance, a group of approximately 500
 Khmer escaped from Khmer Rouge control and joined a
 non-Communist group. Several smaller groups of Khmer Rouge
 escaped from Khmer Rouge control to the non-Communists in
 1985. The Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist groups have
 accepted people back from refugee camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The fundamental right of self-determination is denied to the
 Khmer people. The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party, a
 Communist party which acknowledges a serious shortage of
 members and is directed by a very small group of leaders,
 controls political life in the Heng Samrin regime areas.
 Major policies are controlled by Vietnam, and many day to day
 administrative decisions, especially in internal security
 matters, are made unilaterally by Vietnamese officials. Both
 Vietnam and the Heng Samrin regime have rejected any change in
 the system imposed following the Vietnamese invasion, calling
 the situation "irreversible."
 Political aspirants in Heng Samnrin areas must study the
 current political dogma, which centers on acceptance of the
 Vietnamese explanation for Vietnam's dominant position in
 Cambodia. Middle- and high-level Heng Samrin officials must
 attend political indoctrination courses taught by Vietnamese
 at political schools in Phnom Penh and in Vietnam. Relatively
 few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable by the
 Vietnamese. Khmer with strong ties to Vietnam from before
 1975 or as pre-1978 defectors from the Khmer Rouge, are
 afforded the highest positions of trust, followed by other
 former Khmer Rouge cadre, non-political "intellectuals"
 (including many pre-1975 school teachers), and low-ranking
 officials of pre-1975 governments, in that order. While
 attempting to build an indigenous Communist party and
 government structure in Cambodia, Vietnam itself maintains
 complete control. Elections in Heng Samrin areas do not allow
 genuine political participation but rather are staged by the
 regime to attempt to demonstrate legitimacy through voter
 activity, and to underscore the relative status of leaders by
 varying percentages of the "vote." Reports suggest that in
 the 1981 national elections, percentages were manipulated and
 some victors were named regardless of the number of votes they
 received. Under the Heng Samrin Constitution, the next
 national "election" is due in 1986, but recent Vietnamese
 statements suggest it may not be held until 1987.
 The Khmer Rouge formally dissolved the Communist Party of
 Kampuchea in December 1981, but it continues in Khmer Rouge
 areas as a clandestine entity. In fact, the party, in which
 power is concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10 people,
 controls all political, economic, and military life in those
 areas. No opposition is tolerated. Although Pol Pot
 purportedly formally "retired" as military commander in 1985
 and assumed a position of advisor on national security,
 defectors from the Khmer Rouge areas report that power
 continues to be held by the pre-1979 leadership.
 The non-Communist political fronts are less disciplined and
 control their areas more loosely. Power is normally shared
 
 
 733
 CAMBODIA
 through a system of factional alliances based on personalities
 and the number of troops controlled.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978 and during the
 period of Khmer Rouge rule, when the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities began
 investigating the problem. In February 1985 the Commission
 adopted the latest in a series of resolutions on Cambodia.
 The 1985 resolution welcomed the continued effectiveness of
 the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea with Prince
 Sihanouk as President, reiterated its "condemnation of
 persistent occurrence of gross and flagrant violations of
 human rights in Kampuchea," and reaffirmed "that the
 continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea by foreign forces
 deprives the people of Kampuchea from exercise of their right
 to self-determination and constitutes the primary violation of
 human rights in Kampuchea at present."
 Authorities in the Heng Samrin and Khmer Rouge-controlled
 areas have not permitted investigation of charges of human
 rights violations. In late 1984 the Heng Samrin regime
 declined to permit the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights to
 visit areas it controls. The Khmer Rouge allowed two members
 of the Committee to visit part of the area under its control,
 but the Committee was not able to visit a Khmer Rouge prison
 or freely interview sources and the Committee's Khmer-speaking
 scholar was denied permission to participate in the visit.
 Committee members visited resistance-controlled parts of
 Cambodia in November 1984 and January-February 1985 and
 conducted in-depth interviews with over 150 people. In its
 report on Cambodia, the Committee concludes that, "beyond its
 general and pervasive control of expression and political
 thought, the regime has sought to stamp out opposition--both
 real and imagined--with a systematic practice of arbitrary
 arrest, brutal torture, and indefinite detention under
 degrading conditions, at times resulting in death. The Heng
 Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in those
 areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 The non-Communist camps along the Thai/Cambodian border have
 substantial daytime presence of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened to secure better
 treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees among the
 Khmer. Also, representatives from the International Committee
 of the Red Cross have conducted interviews with prisoners held
 in KPNLF stockades.
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 Report, expressed concern
 about long-term detention of political prisoners without
 charge or trial, reports of systematic torture and
 ill-treatment, and reports of the death in custody of
 political detainees. Freedom House rates Cambodia "not free"
 and, in its 1985-86 report, assigned the country its lowest
 ratings.
 
 
 734
 CAMBODIA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 After the years of fighting within Cambodia, statistics on the
 economic, social, and cultural situation are wholly
 unreliable. The population in 1985 is estimated to be 6.2
 million, close to the 1962 census figure of 5,729,000, with a
 growth rate of 2.2 percent.
 Cambodia is now, to an even greater extent than it was before
 1970, an agricultural country. Rubber, sugar cane, and
 tobacco production have begun to be restored. The Vietnamese
 continue to attempt to integrate the economies of Laos and
 Cambodia with that of Vietnam, particularly the exploitation
 of timber, rubber, and fishing resources. There were reports
 that Vietnamese continued to dominate the fishing industry,
 especially on the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap Lake. A Heng
 Samrin official who defected in 1985 reported extensive
 transfer of resources from Cambodia to Vietnam--rice, fish,
 logs, maize, sesame. There have also been unconfirmed reports
 of diversion of international relief goods from Cambodia to
 Vietnam.
 In rural areas, the Heng Samrin regime has instituted a system
 of agricultural collectivization to till the larger rice
 fields. Heng Samrin officials claim that 90 percent of Khmer
 peasants have been organized into more than 100,000
 1solidarity production" teams. The Constitution permits
 families to occupy a small plot on which a house and garden
 exist. Other land is farmed collectively, although in
 practice most farm production is still on an individual family
 basis.
 Earlier trends toward urbanization were reversed when the
 Khmer Rouge forcibly evacuated the entire urban population in
 1975 with great hardship and loss of life. Since the
 Vietnamese invasion, urbanization has resumed, but many of the
 former city people, including Chinese merchants, died during
 the Khmer Rouge years or have since fled abroad. The
 embryonic Khmer enterpreneurial class faces overwhelming
 competition from Vietnamese who have entered commercial
 activities in market towns throughout Cambodia and in Phnom
 Penh itself.
 There have been credible reports of Vietnamese immigrants
 taking advantage of their privileged status to force Khmer out
 of desirable occupations or land. Khmer arriving on the
 border in 1985 reported that Vietnamese pressure and
 commercial taxes which favor the Vietnamese are continuing to
 drive out Khmer and Chinese merchants. Regime Circular 351
 issued in 1983 specified particular measures against ethnic
 Chinese who, according to the circular, are being used by
 enemies of the state "to engage in espionage, psychological
 warfare, economic warfare, and to cause turmoil in the market
 place." Chinese with "questionable family histories" are
 encouraged to volunteer to report to authorities to "clear
 themselves." Reports from border travelers indicate that many
 new Vietnamese have moved into Cambodia to join returning
 residents who had fled or been expelled during the Khmer
 Republic or Khmer Rouge periods. Most are traders or
 fishermen, but a large group of Vietnamese farmers have
 settled on rich marshland in Takeo Province.
 The health, medical, and nutritional deficiencies of recent
 years are only slowly being overcome, and life expectancy at
 
 
 735
 CAMBODIA
 birth is still at a low 44.5 years. An inadequate number of
 Khmer medical personnel at all levels has been supplemented by
 foreign medical teams. Foreign teams from non-Communist
 countries are increasingly restricted to Phnom Penh and other
 cities in eastern Cambodia. Despite the presence of these
 teams, and a reportedly large number of Vietnamese health
 cadres, medical care even in the best hospitals in Cambodia is
 not adequate. Most Khmer have no access to medical care at
 all. Cambodia is subject to many kinds of tropical diseases
 and to an especially virulent strain of malaria. Preventive
 measures for mosquito-borne diseases no longer exist. The
 emergency relief needs that led to the massive international
 food relief operation beginning in 1979 have been essentially
 fulfilled. Vietnamese media reported in 1985 that 2.1 million
 tons of food (probably paddy equivalent--whereby other food
 grains are converted into their equivalent in paddy rice) were
 harvested in Cambodia in 1984-85, in contrast to 697,000 tons
 in 1979. Nevertheless, the nutritional situation remains
 precarious.
 The Heng Samrin regime has tried to restore some parts of the
 traditional culture, reversing Khmer Rouge efforts to
 completely restructure the society and remold invididual
 personality. The regime has promoted traditional music and
 dance and has reopened many primary schools and selected
 university faculties, such as medicine and dentistry. It
 claims a total primary and secondary school population of more
 than 1.8 million.
 There is no known minimum age for the employment of children.
 Little attention has been given by authorities to ensure
 acceptable conditions of work, and there is little available
 information on this subject. Wage scales for the few
 industrial and government workers are set by the state.
