 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General of the Army Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has headed the
 Government of the Central African Republic since his acces-
 sion to power in a bloodless coup on September 1, 1981. As
 head of the Military Committee for National Recovery, he holds
 all political power and is the final arbiter of all governmental
 matters. His all-military Cabinet of ministers is supplemented
 by a small group of high commissioners who are largely techno-
 crats. Although the appointment of four more civilians as
 high commissioners in 1983 provides a greater degree of civilian
 participation in the Government, there was litle progress
 elsewhere toward civilian or constitutional rule.
 Political party activities are now suspended. Kolingba enjoined
 such activities following the politically exacerbated regional
 and tribal cleavages that marked the brief tenure of the David
 Dacko regime (1979-1981) when democratic institutions were estab-
 lished in the country.' Prior to that, Emperor Bokassa's control
 of the Government, the armed forces, the judiciary, and the sole
 political party was absolute.
 Kolingba imposed a state of siege on two occasions in 1982
 as a result of opposition challenges to his rule and arrested
 scores of suspected dissidents. In 1983, however, the Government
 did not face the same level of opposition and Kolingba released
 at least 67 political prisoners. The wives of three opposition
 leaders implicated in the alleged March 1982 coup plot were freed
 from detention in February 1983. And on the second anniversary
 of his accession to power, Kolingba released 64 political pris-
 oners, including Abel Goumba and Patrice Endjimoungou, two opposi-
 tion leaders arrested in 1982 for alleged subversive activities.
 During 1983, 12 persons were acquitted by the special tribunal
 of Government charges dating back to 1981 and 1982.
 In February 1983, a general strike by workers in the private
 sector, due to what they considered unreasonable taxation by
 the Government, resulted in the arrest of several labor leaders.
 They were released, however, on May 1, having never gone to trial.
 The Central African Republic is a poor, landlocked, sparsely
 populated country. Its inhabitants for the most part derive
 their livelihood from subsistence agriculture. Only about
 one percent of the population has had university education.
 The essentially free enterprise agrarian economy, one of the
 world's poorest, has suffered from inadequately coordinated
 and implemented government policies, occasional drought, and a
 poorly trained work force. Expatriates dominate the small
 manufacturing sector of the economy. Corruption and abuse of
 position by. public officials present additional difficulties.
 The Government has, however, taken some effective if modest steps
 to reduce corruption, particularly in the collection of customs
 receipts.
 Kolingba's release of at least 67 political detainees in 1983
 marked an improvement in human rights practices and indicates,
 among other things, the Government's desire to avoid continuing
 bad publicity on this point. Abuses of the integrity of the
 person are not widespread or exceptionally severe. Nevertheless,
 it has been estimated that as many as 100 political detainees
 are still being held. In addition, certain political freedoms,
 including freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of
 association are circumscribed under the current regime.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is no evidence of assassination or summary execution
 for political motives by Government forces, nor are killings
 condoned, as far as is known, by the Government. In an isolated
 event in 1981, a cinema was bombed, allegedly by politically
 motivated oppositionists--the country's first and only incident
 of a terrorist attack.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no indication that people are being abducted, secretly
 arrested, clandestinely detained, or that they disappear as
 a result of Government action. When people are arrested,
 however; it may be a few days before their whereabouts are
 publicly known.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against persons guilty of physical abuse. Nevertheless, there
 are reports of beatings in prisons. Conditions in some prisons
 are said to be poor. Ngaragba Prison in Bangui reopened, however,
 after a long period of refurbishing. Family members, legal
 counsel, doctors, and ministers of the faith have as a rule been
 given controlled access to some prisoners. Nevertheless, retired
 Captain Mathieu Gouda, imprisoned after the March 1982 coup
 attempt, died May 27, 1983, reportedly because of inadequate
 medical attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Kolingba's government has engaged in illegal arrest and
 imprisonment, especially during its early months in power.
 During 1983, however, at least 67 political prisoners were
 released, leaving perhaps as many as 100 still detained.
 Political detainees can be held without charge under local
 law for as long as two months, but at that point detainees
 must either be formally charged or released. If charged,
 local judicial procedures (which are modeled on French
 procedures) allow for open-ended preventive detention while
 the public prosecutor prepares the state's case against the
 accused. Some political detainees are held much longer than
 two months, however, without counts of indictment being
 brought against them. Neither common criminals nor political
 prisoners can claim the right of habeas corpus. Its
 procedural equivalent nonetheless exists, in that within a
 maximum of 96 hours in the first case and two months in the
 second, a detainee must physically be brought before an
 examining magistrate who considers whether formal charges
 will be filed against the prisoner. Although about a half
 dozen well-known political oppositionists live in exile,
 their doing so is self-imposed, not the result of government
 expulsion.
 
 
 77
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In common criminal cases, except when leading personalities
 of the regime are involved, the Government permits the
 French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and openly
 applied and the laws to be properly executed. Within this
 framework, Kolingba granted amnesty to about 10 petty
 criminals in September 1983. The courts are clearly dependent
 on the executive. The Constitution states that the
 judiciary is independent of the executive, but that its
 independence is guaranteed by the President.
 A special tribunal comprising civilian magistrates and
 military advisers adjudicates political crimes. The special
 tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that there is no
 appeal except for the possibility of presidential clemency,
 and it can try a case only after being authorized by the
 President. The right of political detainees to effective
 counsel is not clear. In April 1983, Abel Goumba and
 Patrice Endjimoungou, detained since August 1982, were
 sentenced by the tribunal to five years in prison, 10 years
 without civic rights, and fined. They subsequently received
 amnesty and were released on September 1. In June, 31
 persons allegedly involved in the July 1981 cinema club
 bombing which killed three people and wounded many others
 were brought before the tribunal in a public trial. Five
 persons were sentenced to life imprisonment; 16 were given
 10 years; and 10 were released. International warrants were
 issued for the six of those sentenced who are living in
 exile.
 During the fall 1983 session of the special tribunal concerned
 with people accused in the March 3, 1982, attempted coup, former
 Government Minister Paulin Sondeboli was sentenced to a total of
 five years in prison, three for failing to report offenses and
 two for stealing ammunition. During the same session, a sergeant
 received three years for stealing weapons, and a colonel was
 sentenced to six months for rebellion. A major and a captain in
 the military were acquitted of conspiring against state security.
 Two other military officers and four members of the Politburo of
 the banned Central African People's Liberation Movement are
 still awaiting trial for their alleged offenses in connection
 with the 1982 coup attempt.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Except for political/security matters and the case of the
 Unification Church noted below, the Government does not intervene
 in the private life of citizens. There is no forced membership
 in any political organization, there is no interference with the
 right to marry or have children as one chooses, and parents are
 free to teach their children religious practices. Private family
 life is respected. The criminal code prohibits the invasion of
 the home without due process. This right is apparently not
 generally abused in civil and minor criminal cases. If a political
 crime is involved, however, ordinance 81/035 (which instituted
 the special tribunal) authorizes searches any time, anywhere.
 These searches have been conducted without specific warrants.
 
 
 78
 On November 12, 1982, the Government issued a decree ordering
 the expulsion of all members of the Unification Church in
 the country. Pursuant to this decree, Government police raided
 the home of two American citizens on January 1, 1983, while they
 were allegedly hosting a party for foreign adherents of the
 Unification Church. The Government arrested and interrogated
 everyone at the congregation, determined they were members of the
 Church, and deported them on January 10. Approximately 60
 foreign adherents were deported including Zairians, Nigerians,
 West Germans, Japanese, and possibly other nationalities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak one's mind about political developments or
 to criticize the Government publicly is circumscribed. The
 Government prohibits the distribution of tracts and literature
 deemed to be subversive and has arrested some people for
 doing so. Laws ban "subversive writings" and conspiracies
 of any sort against the internal security of the state.
 Primarily due to financial difficulties, no regularly
 published newspapers or journals exist in Bangui. Those
 that do appear occasionally, whether published privately or
 by the Government, are carefully monitored. The radio and
 television are both controlled by the Government. Religious
 organizations and missionary groups are protected and
 provided religious freedom by the Constitution, although in
 January 1983, as previously mentioned, some 60 foreign
 adherents of the unification Church were arrested (and
 later deported) for, among other things, distributing tracts
 without authorization. No other reports of similar actions
 were received during 1983.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only sports enthusiasts and devotees of other cultural or
 religious pursuits of a nonpolitical nature can assemble
 without fear of government repression. No effective labor
 movement exists. The Government frowns on organized labor
 activities, although it tacitly approves of an apoliticized
 labor federation that has conducted a few activities on behalf
 of workers. The International Labor Organization has a case
 pending before it involving the Government's violations of
 the right to free association. In principle the right
 to strike exists. Under the Kolingba regime, however, fear
 of government reprisals has dampened the enthusiasm of
 potential strikers. During the strike in February 1983,
 several labor organizers were arrested. They were sub-
 sequently released on May 1.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government does not generally interfere with religious
 activities. The expulsion of foreign adherents of the Unifi-
 cation Church in January 1983 is the only known exception. No
 one religion predominates, and none seems to confer either a
 social advantage or disadvantage. About one-fourth of the
 population adheres to animist beliefs.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are frequent road checkpoints. The right of
 voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized, and there
 appears to be no sexual discrimination in its application.
 Financial and educational constraints rather than goverment
 controls restrict most foreign travel and emigration. The
 country remains relatively hospitable to foreigners; the largest
 foreign population living temporarily or permanently in the
 country is from Chad. No case of revocation of citizenship was
 reported in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Government is dominated by President Andre Dieudonne
 Kolingba. He rules with the assistance of 17 officers of
 the Military Committee for National Recovery, each of whom
 also holds a Cabinet post. In addition, he is advised by
 seven civilian high commissioners who head their own
 departments.
 President Kolingba holds in principle all political power
 appointing, dismissing, and reshuffling members of his Cabinet.
 In practice, he allows his Cabinet considerable leeway in the
 day-to-day activities of government administration although he
 makes all important policy decisions and is the final arbiter of
 all government matters.
 Since September 1, 1981, all forms of public and private
 assembly for political purposes have been proscribed.
 Kolingba has stated he has *no intention of returning his
 country to the turbulent multiparty experience of the Dacko
 regime.* Be has spoken, however, of a return to "constitutional
 rule" in 1985 with the "election* of a President, the
 creation of a National Assembly, and the formation of a
 single political party. The degree to which this system
 would allow democratic development and participation is not
 known, but the outlook is poor.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 International or non-governmental investigation of alleged
 human rights abuses are not welcomed by the Government. In
 1983, Amnesty International's concerns focused on the
 incommunicado detention without trial of suspected Government
 opponents, the harsh conditions for political detainees held
 at the Kassai military camp in Bangui, and the death sentences
 of three political prisoners. Pressures from such groups as
 Amnesty International, however, have had an influence on
 the Government's behavior. The release of 64 political
 prisoners on September 1 is said to have been partly due to
 the bad publicity about the detentions. Amnesty International
 sent a representative to the trial of those accused in the
 1981 cinema club bombing. The International Committee of
 
 
 80
 the Red Cross visits Bangui periodically, but does not
 have easy access to the prisons or information about those
 being held. Freedom House rates the Central African Republic
 "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government plans to rebuild and encourage development
 of one of the world's poorest economies, which has suffered
 in the past 15 years from poor policies, inept management,
 and corruption. The Government's ability to stimulate the
 economy depends on massive and long-term contributions of
 financial and human resources from abroad. Current government
 plans focus on strengthening the agricultural sector,
 primarily through road building/maintenance programs and by
 encouraging cash crop production, and upgrading other basic
 infrastructure. These programs are designed also to increase
 state revenues and, thus, over time, lessen reliance on foreign
 aid.
 The 1983 drought seriously affected the country's agricultur-
 ally based economy. Crop production was down and there was
 some lasting damage, especially with respect to coffee where
 many trees were damaged. In 1983 per capita gross national
 product was around $330. Inflation, averaging roughly 15-18
 percent, took away most of the gains in this modest increase
 from $295 during 1981. Since urban employment conditions
 are so poor, the Government hopes to discourage rural
 migration to Bangui by promoting rural development. During
 the last few years, many of the country's predominantly
 rural inhabitants abandoned cash crop production and returned
 to subsistence farming and hunting.
 Despite the ravages of tropical diseases and an infant
 mortality rate of 138 per 1,000 live births, the country's
 population of about 2.5 million still grows by 2.8 percent
 per year. Life expectancy at birth is only 44 years,
 because of the woefully inadequate or simply nonexistent
 health care in most of the country. Although health care is
 accorded a high priority by the Government, it is handicapped
 by lack of trained personnel and the inaccessibility of
 large parts of the country.
 Almost all education in the country is government supported.
 Total school population is about 310,000 (primary through
 university levels). Only about 38.5 percent of the population
 is literate, however, and undoubtedly this rate is far lower
 in the rural areas. The Government is making a concerted
 effort to train more teachers and to build more schools for
 those living outside the capital. There is still a very
 long way to go, however, to reduce class sizes and to
 provide adequate facilities in those schools that already
 exist.
 Women are generally accorded a lower status than men in the
 Central African Republic. Their   work at home and in the
 fields prevents many of them from receiving an education.
 Polygamy is common, but the legal system and traditional
 practice support the rights of wives and all children of
 such marriages. The Government reactivated a women's
 organization in 1983 and expressed its support for equality
 and opportunity for women throughout society. There are no
 women Cabinet members or high commissioners in the Kolingba
 government.
