 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of or-
 derly transfer of power. Individual liberties and civil rights are protected by the
 1937 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive Irish governments have
 had to deal with the spillover'into the Republic of terrorist violence from Northern
 Ireland. That violence led Irish authorities to adopt special legislation in 1984
 granting the police increased powers to detain and interrogate those suspected of
 acts of terrorism. During 1992 Irish officials continued to show restraint in exercis-
 ing these powers.
 The Irish economy, based largely on free enterprise, has grown rapidly as a result
 of long-term policies of industrialization and diversification which are agreed to
 among government, the labor unions, and the business community. It performed
 well in 1992 despite continued fiscal austerity and an 18-percent rate of unemploy-
 ment. Exports were strong, and the budget deficit was held below 2 percent of gross
 national product.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance to the observance
 and maintenance of human rights. There were no reports of significant human
 rights abuses in 1992.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the past politically motivated
 killings have occurred in Ireland as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ire-
 land. In these cases such groups as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)
 or the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) usually claim responsibility. The Gov-
 ernment uses the full force of law to pursue and prosecute such cases wherever pos-
 sible. There were no known instances of such political killings in 1992.
 b. Disappearance.-Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandes-
 tine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment are prohibited by laws
 which are observed in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that a person
 shall be deprived of personal liberty only in accordance with the law. This is re-
 spected in practice. The same section of the Constitution provides for a judicial de-
 termination of the legality of a person's detention and requires in such cases that
 the arresting authorities make written explanation to the court about the person
 concerned. Neither in law nor in practice is anyone subject to arrest for the expres-
 sion of political or religious views.
 The use of short-term detention without charges being brought is restricted. It is
 p ermitted for a maximum of 48 hours in cases covered by the Offenses Against the
 tate Act of 1939, legislation designed to "prevent actions and conduct calculated
 to undermine public order and the authority of the State." This le, islation, reac-
 tivated in 1972, was broadened to include other "scheduled offenses against peace
 and order. The police may now arrest and detain for questioning anyone suspected
 of any terrorist offense involving firearms, explosives, membership in an unlawful
 organization, or malicious damage to property. After the 48-hour period, the person
 must be brought before a magistrate, presented with written charges, and given
 legal representation.
 Neither incommunicado detention nor exile is used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Fair public trial is provided for by the Constitu-
 tion and respected in practice. A defendant has the right to legal counsel. The courts
 are independent, and jury trial is the norm. There is provision for free legal aid and
 appeal of conviction or sentence.
 The Constitution provides, however, for the creation of "special courts" to deal
 with cases in which the "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective ad-
 ministration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order." The Of-
 fenses Against the State Act of 1939 formally set up such courts and provided that
 they may try persons for offenses against national security, particularly cases of po-
 litical violence perpetrated by terrorist groups likely to intimidate regular juries.
 Rather than having juries, these courts have panels of judges, each consisting of an
 uneven number of judges, but in no instance less than three. Their verdicts are by
 majority vote. Rules of evidence generally are similar to those of regular courts, ex-
 cept that the sworn statement of a police chief superintendent that the accused is
 a member of an illegal organization is considered prima facie evidence of such mem-
 bership. Court sessions are usually public but may exclude certain persons (other
 than press representatives). Such "special courts were used about six times in
 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Though
 not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the inviolability of personal privacy,
 family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and generally observed. The
 Constitution, however, provides that the state shall enact no law "providing for the
 grant of the dissolution of marriage." A proposal to amend the Constitution to per-
 mit divorce in limited circumstances was overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986 nation-
 wide referendum. In the same year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled
 that the prohibition of divorce is not a breach of the European Convention on
 Human Rights, to which Ireland is a party.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for by the Con-
 stitution and gencrally respected in practice. Publication or utterance of "blas-
 phemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense punishable by law. The law
 in practice is directed against pornographic material. Convictions result in sentences
 reqiring fines.
 The state-owned radio and television network uses constitutional provisions deal-
 inv with oublic order and the authority of the State to deny air time to members
 
 
 807
 of organizations on a list that includes (Provisional) Sinn Fein the legal political
 wing of the illegal PIRA. In 1982 the Irish Supreme Court upheld this action on
 constitutional grounds. All political parties not on the list are given access to both
 publicly owned radio and television facilities and major independent daily news-
 papers. Criticism of the Government in such media flourishes. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for by the Constitution and respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations,
 such as PIRA and INLA, however are illegal, and membership in them is an offense
 against national security punishable by a maximum of 7 years' imprisonment. Polit-
 ical parties or groups associated with such organizations, such as (Provisional) Sinn
 Fein, are not proscribed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population of Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and there are no restrictions on
 freedom of worship. Some Irish-laws, such as the prohibition against divorce, reflect
 the point of view of the majority of the population. The area of family law-includ-
 ing the rights of illegitimate children-is the subject of current debate in which mi-
 nority religious communities have taken a vocal and active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within the country, as well as freedom
 to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation. In one instance,
 the Government attempted to restrict a citizen's freedom of foreign travel when au-
 thorities prohibited a young teenage girl from traveling to the United Kingdom
 where she planned to abort a pregnancy which was the result of an alleged rape
 (abortions are illegal in Ireland; see Section 5). The Supreme Court reinstated her
 right to travel. One of the constitutional amendments proposed by the Government
 and approved in the November referendum was a provision that permits travel in
 such circumstances.
 Irish authorities have accepted asylum seekers only on a limited basis and firmly
 apply international definitions to those who claim refugee status. Some applicants
 for asylum have been held in detention for varying lengths of time pending the adju-
 dication of their applications.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the end of the Irish civil war in 1923, periodic elections have resulted in
 the orderly transfer of political power. There are several political parties, and inde-
 pendents may stand for election to either house of Parliament. The constitutional
 requirement that elections be held at least every 5 years has always been met. Ire-
 land uses a proportional voting system, and the secrecy of the ballot is fully safe-
 guarded. There is universal suffrage for those over 18 years of age.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Irish Council for Civil Liberties operates freely and without hindrance as the
 principal independent organization interested in domestic human rights issues. The
 Council for the Status of Women, representing over 70 national women s organiza-
 tions, provides the central focus in Ireland for pursuit of legislative and other re-
 forms to end discrimination against women and to promote fuller participation by
 women in the social, economic, and political life of the country.
 Irish governments generally cooprate with independent outside investigations of
 alleged human rights abuses and have become more responsive to prisoners' rights
 groups. Ireland has also actively promoted observance of human rights in various
 international forums, including the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide adequate shelter, nutrition, health care, and
 education without regard to race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opin-
 ion.
 The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of
 1977 seek to provide protection and redress against sex and pay discrimination. The
 Employment Equality Agency monitors their operation. The number of cases has
 fallen in recent years, but there has been only modest progress in eliminating the
 differential in the key index of average hourly earnings in industry. In June 1990,
 women's hourly earnings in the manufacturing sector were 68 percent of men's
 earnings.
 Violence against women occurs, but there have been no reliable studies to show
 the extent of the problem. The Rape (Amendment) Act of 1990 has criminalized rape
 within marriage. It also makes provision for free legal advice to the rape victim.
 
 
 808
 Women's groups are seeking the extension of this provision to that of actual legal
 representation, as well as increased counseling and other support services for the
 victims of rape and domestic violence.
 The Prime Minister established a new Commission on the Status of Women in
 1990 with the mandate of promoting greater equality for women in all facets of Irish
 life. As priority objectives, the Commission identified child care training and edu-
 cation, the development of employment opportunities, legal rights and protection,
 and the appropriate funding of representative bodies and support services. At the
 Government's request, the Commission in 1992 continued to pay particular atten-
 tion to the needs of the fultime homemaker (only a third of Irish women work out-
 side the home). In this regard, the Commission obtained from the Government the
 promise of early introduction of legislation providing for automatic joint ownership
 of the family home. In addition, the women s movement continues to highlight fam-
 ily law, rape law reform, and social welfare discrimination as problem areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike. The right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to refrain from
 Joining. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 introduced some limitations on picket-
 ing but generally renewed legal guarantees of immunity to union members and offi-
 cias for industrial actions with regard to terms or conditions of employment.
 About 60 percent of workers in the private and public sectors are members of
 unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited from joining unions or striking,
 but they may form associations to represent them in matters of pay, working condi-
 tions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely exerised in both the public
 and private sectors. In 1992 there were several significant strikes, including one by
 postal workers which lasted several weeks. A 2-week strike by employees of the
 state-wned Electricity Supply Board in the spring of 1990 led the Labor Relations
 Commission to draft a code of conduct for industrial relations in essential services
 which is still under discussion by the concerned parties.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents unions in both the
 Republic and Northern Ireland, has 73 member unions with around 700,000 mem-
 bers. Both the ICTU and the unaffiliated unions are independent of the Government
 and of political parties. The ICTU is affiliated with the European Trade Union Con-
 federation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize an to engage in free collective bargaining. Legislation prohibits
 antiunion discrimination. Most terms and conditions of employment are determined
 through collective bargaining, which took place in 1992 in the context of a national
 economic pact (Program for Economic and Social Progress, or PESP) negotiated by
 representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the Government. The PESP in-
 cluded an agreement between the ICTU and the Federation of Irish Employers es-
 tablishing standard pay increases for the 3-year period of the PESP. In addition,
 the agreement provides for a one-time wage increase of up to 3 percent to be nego-
 tiated at local levels during the second year of the PESP.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labour Relations Commis-
 sion which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Com-
 mission may refer unresolved disputes to the Labour Court. That Court, consisting
 of an employer representative, a trade union representative, and an independent
 chairman, may investigate trade union disputes, recommend the terms of settle-
 ment, engage in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint committees to regulate
 conditions of employment and minimum rates of pay for workers in a given trade
 or industry.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years with the written permission of the parents. Irish laws limit the hours
 of employment for those 15 years of age to 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
 Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up to 9 hours per day and 40 hours
 per week. These provisions are effectively enforced by the Labour Department.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage legislation.
 However, some workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to specific
 industrial sectors, mainly those that tend to pay lower than average wages. Al-
 though the lowest of these minimum wage rates would not be sufficient to provide
 a decent living for a family of four, additional benefits are available to low income
 families, including subsidized housing and children's allowances. Working hours in
 the industrial sector are limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Over-
 
 
 809
 time work is limited to 2 hours per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a
 year. As part of the national economic pact adopted in 1987, the standard workweek
 as been reduced to 39 hours.
 The Labor Department is responsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing with
 occupational safety that provide adequate and comprehensive coverage. There were
 no significant complaints from either labor or management in 1992 regarding en-
 forcement of these laws.
