 MALI
 Mali is a single party state in which effective authority is
 exercised by General Moussa Traore, Secretary General of the
 Democratic Union of the Malian People and President of the
 Republic. In 1968, President Traore, then a lieutenant, led a
 military coup which overthrew the leftist civilian government
 of Modibo Keita. Although Mali adopted a Constitution in 1974
 which increased the number of civilians in the Government, the
 military continues to play an important role in party and
 governmental affairs. Military officers hold about a quarter
 of the senior positions in the cabinet and party, four of
 seven governorships, and an important portion of the lower
 level administrative posts, mostly in border areas.
 Mali is one of the world's poorest countries with the average
 per capita income around $160 a year. Landlocked and lacking
 easily exploitable mineral resources, except for some gold,
 Mali's economy is based on farming and animal husbandry, both
 of which have been severely affected by drought in recent
 years.
 The political and human rights situation did not change
 significantly over the past year. Although civil rights are
 officially guaranteed, no organized political opposition
 groups are permitted within Mali. The Government has not,
 however, reacted harshly or brutally to opposition since the
 student riots in 1981. It permitted limited criticism in 1985
 of its economic reform policies within the controlled context
 of official party or union meetings. The number of women
 holding important government positions increased slightly.
 The Government remained sensitive to any criticism of its
 human rights record. The country's only external problem is a
 border dispute with Burkina Faso which has been referred to
 the World Court.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political killing
 There were no reported incidents of politically motivated
 killings during 1985 in Mali.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported incidents of disappearance, abduction,
 or hostage-taking during 1985 in Mali.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government of Mali does not officially condone police
 brutality, but physical abuse of suspects is sometimes used in
 police interrogation. Torture rarely occurs and never as a
 form of punishment. Public beatings by the citizenry-of
 persons identified as thieves are known to occur, though not
 regularly. Prisons in Mali are not harsh by design, but lack
 of resources creates poor physical and health conditions.
 Amnesty International in its 1985 report again expressed its
 concern over alleged inhuman and degrading treatment of
 
 
 203
 MALI
 prisoners in Taoudenit and Kidal prisons situated in northern
 desert locations and appealed to the Government to improve
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests, detention, or
 exile during 1985 in Mali. The Malian judicial system is
 based on the French model so the principle of habeas corpus
 does not exist. Bail is not legally available, but prisoners
 are sometimes released on their own recognizance. Prisoners
 are usually allowed access to a lawyer of their choosing.
 Administrative backlogs often cause delays in bringing people
 to trial.
 All forms of forced or compulsory labor are prohibited except
 in the case of convicted criminals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is part of the executive branch and therefore
 potentially subject to interference. Trials are generally
 short in duration. While confessions are not coerced,
 defendants usually admit guilt and defense lawyers tend to
 argue mitigating circumstances. The verdict and sentence are
 rendered by a panel of three judges. The appeals process is
 limited to presidential pardon or call for a new trial. The
 National Assembly can convene a high court of justice to hear
 cases against state ministers. This court did not meet during
 1985. Amnesty International indicates that at least nine
 political prisoners were reportedly held in Taoudenit prison
 in 1984 for involvement in a coup plot.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is guaranteed in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. Police
 searchs are infrequent, and warrants are issued and recorded,
 but sometimes after the fact.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Malian Constitution does not guarantee freedom of speech
 or of the press. The state controls all Malian media and does
 not permit criticism of its authority. Criticism of specific
 programs, aspects of society, or the performance of government
 offices (rarely individuals) is allowed limited expression.
 The national labor union is allowed limited freedom to express
 dissatisfaction with some government austerity programs.
 Academic freedom does not extend to criticism of the
 Government or its policies. Journalists are all government
 employees. A few have been suspended or fired due to
 "impertinent" questioning, but in general have not been
 subjected to harsh reprisals. Private Malian publications
 expressing antigovernment views are not tolerated, but
 international publications, even those critical of Mali or its
 Government, are readily available and circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malian Constitution guarantees the liberty of citizens to
 form organizations to protect their "professional interests,"
 
 
 204
 MALI
 but in reality only selected organizations such as urban
 professional associations qualify for this freedom, The only
 groups which assemble freely are the women's, youth, and labor
 associations of Mali's single political party.
 The National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM) is the only
 recognized workers' organization. Workers are organized
 according to the type of work and belong to I of 12 unions
 which form the UNTM. Despite party affiliation, the UNTM
 claims to maintain a degree of autonomy from the Government.
 Strikes, though permitted by law, seldom occur. The UNTM
 maintains relations with international bodies, both public and
 private.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a secular state. The Government generally does not
 discriminate on religious grounds. Ninety percent of Malians
 are Muslim, but most other religions are practiced freely and
 permitted to establish houses of worship and schools.
 Christian missionaries of various faiths enjoy government
 cooperation and are free to proselytize. Religious conversion
 is permitted. The Baha'i are forbidden to proselytize or
 establish houses of worship, although they are free to
 practice their faith otherwise.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 travelers are sometimes subject to police checks, especially
 at night. These are allowed by law, ostensibly to restrict
 the movement of stolen or contraband goods. In practice, some
 underpaid police are known to supplement their usually delayed
 salaries by assessing fines or confiscating goods. Malians
 are free to change residence or workplace. Foreign travel
 requires an exit visa which is easy to obtain. Emigration is
 viewed as a relief from poor economic conditions.
 Repatriation is not restricted. Mali is both a
 refugee-accepting and -generating country with the drought and
 famine the major forces in the movement of people. A steady
 stream of people--mainly nomads--migrated to the towns in 1985
 under the impact of the drought.
 .Section 3. Respect for Political Righlts: The Right of Citizens
 to.Change Their Government
 The only legal political party, the Democratic Union of the
 Malian people,-is the supreme political entity in Mali. The
 Secretary General of the party is by law the President of the
 Republic. In March 1985, the second party Congress reelected
 Secretary General Moussa Traore. He was then confirmed as
 President in a June election. Important policies and
 decisions are made among a small group--the President, the
 19-Member Central Executive Bureau (which includes
 representatives from all regional groups in Mali), and the
 Council of Ministers. National delegates to the party
 congress meet only once every three years and the National
 Assembly meets twice a year. Citizens thus have only limited
 opportunity to influence government. Within the one-party
 system, multiple candidates often contest party elections at
 the local level. National Assembly elections generally have a
 single candidate selected by the party for each seat. All
 party members are eligible to run for election. The National
 
 
 205
 MALI
 Assembly debates proposed legislation after its acceptance by
 the Council of Ministers and review by the Supreme Court.
 The role of the military has decreased in recent years but is
 still important. Five of the 19 Central Executive Bureau
 members, 5 of the 17 cabinet ministers, 4 of the 7 regional
 governors, and numerous lower level officials are military
 officers.
 Women are free to participate in the Malian political process,
 and, while underrepresented, are present at all levels of
 government and the party, especially at the local level. A
 limited number of women occupy positions of responsibility in
 most ministries. There is one woman in the cabinet (Minister
 of Information) and one in the Executive Bureau (president of
 the women's union.) Three women now serve in the National
 Assembly. In 1985, the first woman cabinet director was
 appointed in the Ministry of Health. The Union of Malian
 Women is an active political organization under party auspices
 and a channel thrOUgh which women can voice their concerns.
 While the Government avoids use of ethnic "quotas," in
 practice, virtually all ethnic groups are represented at the
 highest state and party level. In local government, officials
 are assigned outside their native regions. Although some
 nomadic groups remain outside the economic and political
 mainstream, Mali is relatively free of ethnic tension.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Mali has been generally responsive to calls
 by recognized groups such as Amnesty International to correct
 reported human rights violations. Mali itself has no local
 human rights organizations. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs
 and Justice are charged with responsibility for human rights
 issues. Mali does not play a major role in international
 human rights forums. Amnesty International's current concerns
 are noted in ic and le above. Freedom House rates Mali as
 "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its
 agricultural activities occupy 73 percent of the work force
 and provide 42 percent of the gross domestic product.
 Small-scale subsistence farming dominates the agricultural
 sector. Mali's population of 7,721,000 is growing at the rate
 of 2.3 percent annually. Real per capita gross national
 product ($160 in 1984) has stagnated. A 3-year drought has
 devastated livestock, and massive amounts of food aid have
 been necessary to feed the population. The Tuareg nomads, who
 have long relied on raising cattle for their livelihood, have
 seen 70 percent of their herds destroyed by drought.
 Emergency food aid and resources appear to be distributed on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, but Malians living near or in urban
 centers or who work for the Government generally have greater
 access to government services and resources.
 Despite deteriorating health conditions due to the prolonged
 drought, infant mortality has fallen slightly from 174.3 per
 1,000 live births in 1984 to 172.8 per 1,000 live births in
 1985. Malians born in 1985 can expect to live an average of
 
 
 206
 MALI
 46.1 years. Only a relatively small part of the population
 has access to safe water, although the percentage is higher
 for urban dwellers (37 percent) than for rural dwellers (3
 percent). Only 9 percent of the population is literate (male
 14 percent, female 6 percent). About 27 percent of the
 elgible children attend school (approximately 20 percent are
 female and 35 percent are male).
 Workers' rights are specified in the Constitution.  The
 minimum age for employment is 18. However, with parents'
 permission, children can be apprenticed at the age of 12.
 Social and cultural factors affect the role of women more
 negatively in Mali than political or economic determinants.
 Custom often restricts women to "women's issues" when they do
 participate in politics. The National Union of Malian Women
 in particular promotes discussion of health and education
 issues. It has disseminated information on the disadvantages
 of female circumcision, but it is still widejy practiced,
 without government sanction, throughout Mali.
