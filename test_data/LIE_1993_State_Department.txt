 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy whose present Constitution dates from 1921. The reigning Prince is the
 Head of State. All legislation adopted by the unicameral legislature (Landtag) must
 have his concurrence. The Government, whose members are proposed by the
 Landtag and appointed by the Prince, is responsible for the entire administration
 of the State. After the Head of Government lost a confidence vote in September,
 Parliament voted pursuant to constitutional procedure, to ask the Prince to remove
 him from office. Instead, the Prince, citing the lack of legitimacy for any new gov-
 ernment head, dissolved Parliament and scheduled elections for October. The
 Vaterlaendishe Union won an absolute majority of seats but chose to govern again
 with its former coalition partner, Fortschrittliche Burgerliche Partei.
 The Principality's police force maintains internal order and is aided by a part-time
 auxiliary police force. Both organizations are under the control of the elected Gov-
 ernment and operate under procedures consistent with respect for human rights.
 Despite its small size (29,386 population of which over one-third are noncitizen
 resident foreigners) and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed dur-
 ing the last 3 decades from a rural agrarian society into a prosperous, highly indus-
 trialized, free enterprise economy with an important service sector. Through a 1923
 treaty, it participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc
 as its national currency. Liechtenstein voted on December 13, 1992 to join the Euro-
 pean Economic Area (EEA). Unemployment stood at 1.2 percent in 1993. The people
 of Liechtenstein enjoy a very high standard of living.
 Individual human rights are ensured by the Constitution and protected in prac-
 tice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There is no history of politically mo-
 tivated or other extrajudicial killing, and none is known to have occurred in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no known abductions, secret arrests, or clan-
 destine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and cruel punishment are prohibited by law, and there were no reports of
 violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. Any person detained by the
 authorities must appear before an examining magistrate not later than 24 hours
 after arrest. The magistrate must either state formal charges or release the pris-
 oner. The right to legal counsel is guaranteed. If the accused cannot afford represen-
 tation, the State provides the cost of defense. Release on personal recognizance or
 bail is granted unless the examining magistrate believes the person is a danger to
 
 
 society or will not appear for trial. There is no provision in the legal system for
 exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary is separated from the executive and
 legislative branches. The Constitution provides for public trials and judicial appeal.
 Liechtenstein has a three-tier system of courts: Lower Court, High Court, and Su-
 preme Court. The Constitution provides also for an administrative court, which
 hears appeals against government decisions. A State Court, which protects the
 rights accorded by the Constitution, decides on conflicts of jurisdiction between the
 law courts and the administrative authorities and acts as a disciplinary court for
 members of the Government.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty and the inviolability of the home and of
 letters and telephone conversations, including the freedom from wiretaps. Police
 need a judicial warrant to search private property. No violations have been reported.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, effective judiciary, and
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There
 are two newspapers, each representing the interests of one of the two major political
 parties. Th-re are no private television or radio broadcasting facilities within the
 Principality, but residents receive radio and television broadcasts from neighboring
 Switzerland, Austria, and Germany, and many are also cable television subscribers.
 There is one government-owned television station. A suit brought to protest the
 exclusive use of the channel by the Government during the 1992 EEA debate was
 thrown out of court. The Government granted permission for a private radio station
 to be established in 1994, contingent on 50-percent ownership by citizens of Liech-
 tenstein. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedoms of assembly and
 association are protected by the Constitution and observed in practice. Although
 permits must be obtained for public meetings and demonstrations, they are rou-
 tinely given.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Liechtenstein enjoys religious freedom. The state church
 is Roman Catholic, and 87 percent of the population practices that faith. The fi-
 nances of the state church are integrated directly into the budgets of the national
 and local government. Catholic or Protestant religious education is a compulsory
 part of the school curriculum, although parents may request government ermission
 to exempt their offspring. Other denominations are entitled to practice their faiths
 and to hold religious services. Foreign clergy are free to perform their duties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens have the freedom to travel in or outside the country and can
 emigrate without difficulty. There is no restriction on repatriation of citizens from
 abroad. As Liechtenstein has no airport or international train station, it is not a
 country of first asylum. The few applicants for asylum are returned to the authori-
 ties of one of the two neighboring entry points, Switzerland or Austria. Liech-
 tenstein seeks assurances from the two countries that asylees will not be forced to
 return to countries in which they have reason to fear persecution.
 Liechtenstein's asylum policy was put to the test in October, when 18 Tibetan ref-
 ugees arrived in the country, claiming persecution in Tibet. They were granted per-
 mission to stay for 3 months. The Prime Minister said that they would not be re-
 turned to Tibet. Liechtenstein is discussing the matter with Switzerland and Aus-
 tria. If the refugees make formal application for asylum, it would require an act of
 Parliament to grant the request.
 Despite the lack of asylum law, Liechtenstein does make provision for refugees
 on a case-by-case basis. In 1993 Liechtenstein accepted 44 Bosnian refugees who
 will be permitted to remain at least until the violence in their homeland ends.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The unicameral legislature, compris-
 ing 25 deputies, is elected by the people every 4 years by proportional representa-
 tion. The Constitution provides for the right to vote, which is universal, equal, se-
 cret, and direct. A coalition of the two major political parties, the Vaterlaendische
 Union and the Fortschrittliche Burgerpartei, has formed the Government since
 1938. Although there are historical differences between these two parties, as well
 as disagreements over some local issues, a high degree of political consensus exists.
 The rights of emerging opposition and splinter groups are respected. For the first
 
 
 time in 55 years, in 1992 a third party, the Freie Liste, which focuses on environ-
 mental issues, entered the legislature.
 In late August Head of Government Marcus Buechel was asked by his own party
 to step down because he allegedly misinformed and ignored them. He refused to re-
 sign, even after a parliamentary vote of no confidence on September 14. Subse-
 quently the Parliament voted, pursuant to constitutional procedure, to ask the
 Prince to remove Buechel. The Prince instead dissolved Parliament and called for
 new elections. The elections were held in late October. The Vaterlaendishe Union
 won an absolute majority of parliamentary seats but chose to govern again in coali-
 tion with its former Fortschnttliche Burgerliche Partei partners Mario Frick was in-
 stalled as Prime Minister on December 15.
 The electorate regularly makes use of its right to participate in initiatives and ref-
 erendum. Women gained the right to vote in national elections in 1984 and have
 exercised this right. The Landtag presently has two female members. The Executive
 Council of Five contains two women, one of whom participated also in theprevious
 government. All major parties have committees to address the concerns of women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The only known human rights group based in Liechtenstein, Justitia, is an infor-
 mal group of several persons who monitor prison conditions and assist foreign work-
 ers with imnmiration matters. Justitia was founded by church members to address
 the needs of Liechtenstein's marginalized persons and operates without government
 restriction.
 There have been no requests for the investigation of human rights violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status.
 There were no reported incidents of abuse of minorities. Of the resident foreigners,
 87 percent are from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. The remainder is
 composed of citizens of Turkey, Spain, Greece, and the former Yugoslavia. It is pos-
 sible for foreigners who have been resident in Liechtenstein for 5 years to become
 citizens through an acceptance vote of the local community. The process is expedited
 for wives and children of citizens.
 Women.-A 1992 constitutional amendment guaranteed women equality under the
 law. All relevant statutes concerning citizenship and residency rights, social security
 and unemployment insurance, education taxation, and conditions in the workplace
 are to be revised to conform to this equal rights amendment and must be presented
 to Parliament before 1996. Revisions of the law became linked to Liechtenstein's
 entry into the EEA, which was projected to take place in mid-1994. For instance,
 legislation to give women equal pay for equal work is to enter into force with
 Liechtenstein's entry into the EEA.
 Several groups monitor and promote women's rights. They report that the Govern-
 ment is cooperative with respect to their concerns and in some cases provides finan-
 cial support. The social and traditional discrimination that still persists hinders op-
 portunities for women in fields that have been traditionally dominated by men, and
 at present there are no legal means to redress discrimination. Wife beating is pro-
 hibited by law and is prosecuted in practice. Liechtenstein has facilities through
 which women who are victims of violence may obtain help and counseling. In 1993,
 536 women were sheltered overnight because of violence or threat of violence from
 a spouse or partner.
 Children.:-There is no pattern of societal abuse against children. The Govern-
 ment supports programs intended to protect the rights of children and matches con-
 tributions made to the four nongovernmental organizations involved in children's
 rights concerns.
 People with Disabilities.-Liechtenstein has not legislated accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Government programs to provide supplemental financial support for disabled
 persons are being revised. An organization dedicated to promoting the interests and
 rights of the disabled works together with international disabled rights organiza-
 tions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor-management relations in Liechtenstein are
 conducted according to the Swiss Code of Obligations. All workers, including foreign
 workers in Liechtenstein, have the freedom to associate, join the unions of their
 choice, and select their union representatives. The existing social peace, in part due
 to the high standard of living, has resulted in a low demand for organized worker
 representation. The one trade union comprises 13 percent of the work force but
 
 
 955
 looks after the interest of nonmembers as well. It is a member of the World Confed-
 eration of Labor although it is represented at meetings by the Swiss National
 Christian Trade Union.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain work categories, as outlined in
 work contracts and agreed to by the employees concerned. Labor unrest is virtually
 nonexistent. No strikes are known to have taken place in the last 25 years.
 Liechtenstein's law does not have specific protections for strikers. Employers may
 dismiss employees for "refusal to work." Such dismissals may be contested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides workers the
 right to organize and br ain collectively. This right is recognized for all professions.
 Because of Liechtenstein s reliance on Swiss practice, collective bargaining agree-
 ments are as a practical matter, generally adapted from similar agreements already
 negotiated by Swiss industry. Agreements so adopted have not been contested in the
 past 25 years. The last such agreement came into force in January 1989 in the met-
 als industry.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The employment of children under
 the age of 15 is prohibited. Children are required to remain in school for 9 years.
 Child labor laws are enforced by the Government, and adolescent workers are pro-
 vided special protection by law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage; wages
 are high. The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours for white collar workers
 and employees of industrial firms. The maximum in other areas is 50 hours. In
 practice, the average workweek is 40 to 43 hours. Workers under the age of 20 re-
 ceive a minimum of 5 weeks of vacation. After they are 20 they receive a minimum
 of 4 weeks.
 Occupational health and safety standards are set by law and protect the worker
 in the workplace. A safe working environment is enforced by the Department for
 Worker Safety. The trade union also monitors working conditions. There were no
 allegations of worker rights abuses, other than disputes over contractual obligations.
