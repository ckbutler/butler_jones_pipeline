 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's human rights situation has remained generally
 stable during the past year. A local tradition of
 moderation and respect for one's neighbor's life and
 property has persisted, though security concerns stem-
 ming from Kuwait's status as a small, wealthy country
 with a heterogeneous population in a troubled region
 have resulted in some new restrictions.
 Kuwait has experienced rapid change in the course of a
 single generation. Once a poor, unhealthy, and isolated
 town whose population lived in medieval conditions,
 Kuwait has become a regional center for finance,
 commerce, and the media. Rapidly mounting oil revenues
 have been distributed to Kuwaiti citizens in the form
 of education, medical care, and housing. Employment
 opportunities have brought an influx of foreign workers;
 some long term (largely Palestinians), others temporary
 (mostly non-Arab Asians). Some of these expatriates
 have imported their homelands' political tensions and
 rivalries. Non-Kuwaitis, now over 50 percent of the
 population, enjoy fewer civil rights and social benefits
 than do citizens.
 Upon independnce in 1961 from British protectorate
 status, the 200-year reign of Amirs (hereditary rulers)
 chosen from the Al-Sabah family continued, but with the
 additions of .a written constitution including a bill of
 rights, free elections to an active parliament, and a
 vigorous press. Education abroad exposed many Kuwaitis
 to Western attitudes. However, in August 1976, when the
 parliament reflected sharply partisan tendencies and
 some deputies began to criticize the Al-Sabah regime
 directly, the Amir dissolved parliament and tightened
 the reins on dissent. A return to parliamentary partici-
 pation was promised within four years. In August 1980,
 the government announced that a new parliament would be
 elected and convened before the end of February 1981.
 The election date subsequently was set at February 23.
 The State of Kuwait combines a traditional sheikhdom with
 newly-introduced constitutional norms and mass media.
 Kuwait's constitution and laws enshrine ideals some of
 which are not yet observed in practice. Given Kuwait's
 sizeable and varied expatriate population, regional
 developments such as Iran's Islamic revolution and the
 Iran-Iraq conflict potentially have destabilizing inter-
 nal repercussions. Consequently, Kuwait has limited
 expression of some basic political rights.
 A new law on general mobilization promulgated on October
 5, 1980, gave the Kuwait government sweeping power over
 thepersons and property of both citizens and expatriates
 in the event general mobilization is declared by the Amir.
 As this "war powers" act would take effect only in a
 national emergency and has not yet been invoked, it is
 unclear to what extent human rights might be affected
 by the implementation of this law.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by Article 31 of the Kuwaiti
 constitution, which states: "No person shall be subjected
 to torture or to degrading treatment." No available
 evidence indicates that the government of Kuwait engages
 in or encourages torture.
 It has been alleged that "third degree" methods are
 employed by the police on occasion to extract confessions
 to crimes, particularly with non-Kuwaiti suspects. The
 Kuwaiti press has reported trial testimony that Palestinian
 defendants in the July Al-Rai Ai-Aamnewspaper bombing
 were ill-treated in order to gain their confessions. The
 trial continues and there have been no reports of reactions
 by senior Kuwaiti authorities or the judiciary to these
 alleged abuses.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Capital punishment by hanging is practiced in Kuwait. The
 last instance of capital punishment was in October 1979.
 Five Thai workers temporarily resident in Kuwait presently
 are condemned to death for murder. Their cases are under
 appeal. Summary executions are not practiced. Flogging
 has been practiced in the past as a disciplinary measure
 in prisons, but with decreasing frequency. The government
 has pressed prison authorities to reduce instances of
 flogging.
 Prison conditions appear relatively humane and do not
 inflict  intentionally degrading treatment. Prisoners
 receive necessary medical care. They are permitted to
 supplement prison fare, which is adequate in amount but
 questionable by nutritional standards, with food purchased
 from outside the prison. Family visits and access by
 attorneys are routinely permitted. Youthful offenders are
 not separated from hardened criminals, but neither are they
 often imprisoned. There is no policy of differential
 treatment on the basis of social class, race, or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention in Kuwait by the Kuwaiti authorities
 or with their cognizance. Reports have surfaced of a few
 persons being abducted from Kuwait and forcibly repatriated
 by foreign agents to their country of origin for political
 reasons. There is no evidence that the Kuwait government
 approves or condones such occurrences.
 d. Arbitrary Arrestand Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by Article
 31 of the constitution. With occasional exceptions, such
 practices are not sanctioned by the Kuwaiti government.
 Road blocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings of
 expatriates, especially of South Asians, are used sporadically
 by the police searching for illegal immigrants. Persons
 without proper identification may be detained by the police.
 The authorities have considerable leeway in picking up
 individuals whom they suspect constitute security threats.
 However, no political prisoners are known to be in custody
 
 
 1025
 in Kuwait.
 Legally, police may hold a person for investigation without
 charge for no more than four days; a prosecutor's approval
 is required for periods over 24 hours. Thereafter the
 suspect either must be released or turned over to a public
 prosecutor who may authorize detention for up to an
 additional 21 days. Further detention may be authorized
 by a judge pending trial. The lack of a specific charge
 against an expatriate considered a trouble maker does not
 hinder the authorities from summarily expelling him.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's legal system is independent and provides for public
 trial, the right of appeal, and representation by an attorney
 of one's choice. Procedural rights are not always strictly
 observed, and failure of the police to protect a suspect's
 rights may not provide a defense in the courts. Charges
 are supposed to be stated formally when a suspect is brought
 before a public prosecutor not more than four days after
 arrest. There are no reports of secret or unfair trials,
 nor of discrimination against defense counsel. However,
 the court-appointed attorney of a defendant unable or
 unwilling to engage his own lawyer is not always given
 adequate time to prepare a defense. Interpretation of court
 proceedings to ensure their understanding by non-Arabic
 speaking defendants is sometimes inadequate. The Kuwaiti
 judiciary is independent of the executive and the military.
 There are no special political or security courts. By
 Article 164 of the constitution, military courts have
 jurisdiction only over offences committed by members of
 the armed or security forces, except during periods of
 martial law. There has never been a state of martial law
 in Kuwait as such, although certain articles of the
 constitution have been suspended temporarily since August
 1976. The Amir has the power to pardon or to commute
 sentences passed either by civilian or military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home. is provided for in the Kuwaiti
 constitution (Article 38). Warrants are required for
 searches unless the police are in actual pursuit of a
 suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or where an outside
 odor indicates the presence of a distillery or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter residences or business
 premises are issued by a public prosecutor.
 2. Government . Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs- as Food, Shelter,7Health Care
 and Education
 Kuwait has over 50 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.
 Its oil revenues coupled with its small population (1,355,000)
 result in a per capita income (GDP) of-about $18,000 a year.
 The constitution provides that the economic activities of
 the state shall be based on social justice. The government
 has a lavish social welfare program for all citizens.
 Programs are designed to provide all citizens with jobs
 (there is little unemployment in Kuwait), housing, family
 allowances, retirement income, medical care, and education.
 $1.08 billion (37 percent) of the government's fiscal year
 1979-1980 ordinary budget was allocated to the Ministries
 
 
 1026
 of Education, Health, and Social Affairs and Labor. All
 residents are entitled to free education through high school,
 but Kuwaitis gain preference for admission to the University
 of Kuwait. Foreign nationals and Kuwaitis alike may send
 their children to private schools, most of which follow
 foreign language curricula. More than 80 percent of
 Kuwaitis under thirty (three-quarters of the Kuwaiti
 citizenry) are literate.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 41 percent of the population,
 and the expatriate population. Commerce, real estate, and
 the local stock market -- the principal sources of private
 wealth in this capitalist economy -- are open only to
 Kuwaitis. Foreigners are not allowed to own real estate
 in Kuwait and usually are able to engage in business only
 in partnership with a Kuwaiti citizen. Except for state-
 owned oil and other mineral resources, property is privately
 owned and protected in law and in practice. While there
 are still numbers of lower-income Kuwaitis, even the poorest
 benefit from an abundance of government subsidies and
 welfare programs.
 Women in Kuwait have full property rights, although
 inheritance law gives female heirs half shares compared to
 'the full shares of male heirs. This practice accords with
 the traditional rule of inheritance in Islam. A number of
 Kuwaiti women, primarily from the ruling family, own
 trading companies and participate in their management. There
 are also Kuwaiti women who own their own shops and boutiques.
 Most professions are open to women. The 1975 census showed
 that women comprised 11 percent of the total labor force
 and 8 percent of the Kuwaiti citizen work force. Almost
 one-half of the working women were categorized as professional/
 technical workers; most of the rest were service workers.
 The professional category includes nurses and teachers;
 service workers include maids and waitresses. The number of
 female managers and senior civil servants is still relatively
 small. Kuwait University has the distinction of having the
 only woman dean of a law faculty in the Arab world. In
 Kuwait, women are permitted to drive automobiles and may
 move in public unveiled. This gives comparative freedom
 to Kuwait's women, although the remaining major barrier
 to full equality is local culture and tradition.
 The annual increase in the official cost of living index has
 been about 7 percent in recent years, but most observers
 believe the real rate of inflation is higher. As a partial
 offset to the high cost of living, the government provided
 $82 million in subsidies in fiscal year 1979-1980, mostly
 for food. Utilities are provided considerably below cost.
 Land grants and low cost housing loans are also available
 to Kuwaitis. The government housing program (4,214
 residence plots distributed last year) barely has kept up
 with the approximately 7 percent annual population growth
 over the last five years. Good quality medical care at
 nominal cost is provided to all residents of Kuwait. There
 is one doctor per 794 inhabitants and one hospital bed per
 307 inhabitants. Kuwaitis requiring medical attention
 unavailable in Kuwait are sent abroad for treatment at
 government expense. Government grants are made also to
 widows, orphans, families with school children, and other
 categories of needy Kuwaitis.
 Kuwait's economy has too few indigenous workers. Thus,
 non-Kuwaitis, many of whom have been in Kuwait for more than
 
 
 1027
 a decade, comprise two-thirds of the approximately 400,000
 strong-labor force. Expatriate workers are found in all
 sectors and levels of the economy, although they occupy
 almost all of the lower paying positions. Nearly one-half
 of the Kuwaiti civil service are expatriates. Exnatriate
 workers often earn the same base pay as Kuwaitis, but
 receive less in fringe benefits. The benefits peculiar
 to Kuwaiti citizenship include: higher government salaries,
 additional government stipends, pensions, and the right to
 own real estate, shsres of publicly traded local companies,
 or a majority interest in business ventures. Resident
 expatriates are entitled to free medical benefits and to
 elementary and secondary schooling for their children in
 the public schools. Discontent over these differentials
 and other grievances, such as very expensive housing, is
 balanced by the fact that salaries in Kuwait for expatriates
 are much higher, and living conditions are generally as
 good or better, than those in their hona countries. The
 non-Kuwaiti work force can be divided roughly into those
 who consider themselves temporary "guest workers" in Kuwait,
 and those, (primarily Palestinians) who, for all intents
 and purposes, are permanent residents. Many of the temporary
 work force, particularly the semi- or unskilled workers in
 the construction field and common laborers, stay in Kuwait
 for considerable periods of time. In most cases their
 families remain at home and compile savings from remittances.
 In an effort to limit the foreign population, which now
 outnumbers Kuwaitis, the government is favoring contract
 workers who are recruited on short-term labor contracts to
 work on specific projects. They usually live in camps or
 crowded apartments under spartan, and at times unhealthy,
 conditions. Typhus cases have occurred, but the government
 is attempting to eliminate rodents which are believed to
 be the cause of the problem. The police occasionally raid
 the camps to catch persons who have entered Kuwait illegally.
 Contract workers have little contact with the permanent
 population. South Koreans, Indians, and Pakistanis, and to
 a lesser extent Malaysians, Bangladeshis, Thais, and
 Filipinos are coming to Kuwait in growing numbers despite
 these conditions.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Both Kuwaiti citizens and expatriate residents are generally
 free to-speak as they wish. Private opinions are not
 monitored or suppressed. The constitution (Article 36)
 guarantees freedom of opinion and of scientific research.
 While Kuwait's constitution contains similar guarantees for
 many basic civil and political rights, these guarantees
 often are stated conditionally, modified by such phrases
 as "in accordance with the conditions and manner specified
 by law."
 The Kuwaiti press is widely read in the region. There is no
 official newspaper. The Kuwaiti press is not subject to pre-
 publication censorship, but under Kuwait's press law
 newspapers may be suspended or closed permanently for
 violations of public morality or to enforce restrictions on
 political content. Criticism of the ruling family is for-
 bidden and any but the mildest criticism of government
 policies and high-level officials is discouraged. Phrases
 such as "spread dissension" and "contradict the national
 
 
 1028
 interest" are used to describe the grounds for newspaper
 suspensions. No publication ever has been closed
 permanently. During the past year, two newspapers were
 suspended, one of them twice. The longest of the three
 suspensions was for two days. Editors are criminally
 liable for violating prohibitions against attacking leaders
 of friendly Arab states or stirring sectarian strife.
 There have been no prosecutions to date. The mere existence
 of legislation which can close newspapers permanently,
 suspend their publication, or lead to criminal prosecu-
 tions of their editors is intimidating.
 Foreign books and periodicals generally are available in
 Kuwait. Foreign periodicals are censored and cannot clear
 customs without permission from the Ministry of Interior.
 However, this censorship is not rigid in practice, and
 the government usually admits most publications except
 those blacklisted by the Arab boycott of Israel. There
 is no attempt to prevent travelers from bringing foreign
 journals and books into Kuwait. Several books, including
 some by local authors, are banned from local bookstores
 because of their political content. One such author lives
 in Kuwait, lectures freely, and contributes commentaries
 and essays to the local press.
 Kuwait's constitution (Article 44) protects private assembly,
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings which are
 peaceful and not contrary to public morals. Any group of
 more than three people desiring to meet for public discussion
 (or to meet privately but issue a public statement) must
 receive explicit, prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly
 merely by ignoring the request. Such permission is not,
 however, required for "diwaniyyaq" traditional gatherings
 presided over by community leaders or family elders, which
 .anyone can attend and speak freely. No group has been given
 permission to hold a public demonstration in Kuwait since
 September 1979. Refusals over the past year of such requests,
 from certain religious leaders and from Iranian or Iraqi
 sympathizers, have been made on "security grounds."
 Kuwait permits the establishment of trade unions. The
 petroleum and banking industries and government employees
 are unionized. Kuwaiti citizens and expatriates resident
 in Kuwait for five years are permitted to join unions,
 although only Kuwaitis may vote in union elections or hold
 union offices. The right to strike is recognized officially.
 There is little apparent harrassment or persecution of pro-
 fessional groups, bar associations, scientific bodies, or
 labor unions.
 While Article 35 of the constitution declares that "freedom
 of belief is absolute," it states further that its practice
 is not to "conflict with public policy or morals." Kuwait's
 state religion is Islam and the Sharia is, by the constitution,
 "a main source of legislation." The ruling family and most
 prominent Kuwait families are Sunni Muslims. There is no
 policy of discrimination against Shi'ite Muslims, who
 constitute about one-third of Kuwait's citizenry. There are
 a number of expatriate Christian congregations in Kuwait.
 Non-Muslims are free to worship, but proselytizing of
 Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 
 
 1029
 b. Freedom or Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Kuwait citizens generally are free to travel inside and
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to return. There is
 some restriction of foreign travel for young men who have
 not completed their compulsory military service or been
 exempted. Those serving in the military must receive
 permission from the Ministry of Defense before traveling
 abroad. While there are not different legal standards
 regarding the internal or foreign travel or emigration of
 Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands can prevent their wives
 and children from leaving the country.
 There have been occasional instances, all occurring before
 1980, in which citizens' passports were suspended temporarily,
 both for criminal offenses and for outspoken criticism of
 the regime, particularly if done while abroad. Since 1977,
 representatives of societies, associations, and trade unions
 wishing to travel to and participate in international meetings
 have had to receive prior permission from the authorities.
 While Article 28 of the constitution says "no Kuwaiti may
 be deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto,"
 individuals have been stripped of Kuwait nationality and
 deported. This occurred in December 1980 when a local lawyer/
 politician attempted to re-enter Kuwait on an Iraqi passport.
 Under Kuwait law, any Kuwaiti accepting a foreign nationality
 'automatically loses his own.
 Non-Kuwaitis working in the country must have the sponsorship
 of a Kuwaiti citizen. Effectively, this gives Kuwaiti
 sponsors the power to restrict the job mobility and the
 continued residence of those expatriates who enter under
 their sponsorship. Those employed by government agencies
 are given residence visas which require an exit permit or
 "no objection" letter in order to leave the country. Non-
 Kuwaitis convicted of a crime routinely are deported after
 serving their sentences.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Traditionally, adult male Kuwaitis have had direct access
 to their tribal and religious leaders, the heads of the
 prominent merchant clans, and the Amir through the system
 of "diwaniyyas," to which.anyone could come and freely
 speak his mind. That custom has endured, as has the
 tradition that the Amirs should govern in consultation with
 other community leaders. High-ranking officials also are
 approachable through "wasta," the use of influential family
 members orzacquaintances as intermediaries in obtaining
 favors or a more favorable hearing for one's cause.
 Kuwait, upon independence, inaugurated a parliament
 composed of 50 deputies (elected by direct male suffrage
 and secret ballot) plus cabinet members sitting ex officio.
 Until 1976, when it was dissolved, the parliament served
 as an active sounding board for Kuwaiti public opinion.
 It was the parliament's reflecting of inter-Arab tensions
 which led    the former Amir to suspend it. A return to
 constitutional norms was promised within four years. In
 August 1980, the Kuwaiti government announced that a new
 parliament would be elected and convened by the end of
 February 1981. Only 60,000 of Kuwait's almost million
 and a half inhabitants are eligible to vote, two-thirds of
 whom have registered to do so.
 
 
 1030
 While Kuwaiti citizens have a measure of freedom for
 political participation, this is largely denied to expatriates,
 who now outnumber Kuwaitis 59 to 41 percent. This anomaly
 is particularly striking for the 300,000 Palestinians, the
 second largest group in the population. Kuwait has denied
 citizenship to members of the Palestinian minority, pending
 resolution of the Palestine issue. While expatriates in
 Kuwait are permitted considerable freedom in conducting
 exile activities, they have little say in the internal
 affairs in Kuwait. Expatriates who violate sanctions
 against their involvement in Kuwait's affairs may be
 summarily deported. Kuwait has been sparing in extending
 citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, with the
 exception of certain stateless bedouin.
 There have been appeals for women's suffrage, including
 those from the wife of the Crown Prince/Prime Minister.
 The issue may be addressed by the next parliament. On the
 other hand, the momentum for women's increased political
 rights has slowed with the revival of Islamic conservatism
 in the region.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty InternationaL (AI) prepared no report on Kuwait in
 1979 or 1980. There are no known current requests by
 Amnesty International or by other non-governmental organi-
 zations to examine human rights in Kuwait. A "Rights of
 Man Committee" was established in Kuwait in 1978 but does
 not appear active. Kuwait sent a delegation to the Second
 .UNESCO Regional Human Rights Conference, held in Cairo in
 1978. Kuwait's official declarations of support for inter-
 national observation of basic human rights often have been
 combined with sharp criticism of the West for alleged
 indifference to the human rights of the Palestinians.
 In December 1980, the government of Kuwait sponsored a
 conference in Kuwait on "Human Rights in Islam," in
 cooperation with the International Commission of Jurists,
 the Union of Arab Lawyers, and Kuwait University's Faculty
 of Law and Sharia. The conference brought together jurists,
 scholars, and human rights activists from across the
 Islamic world and received considerable attention in
 Kuwaiti media.
