 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure, a bicameral par-
 liament, a directly elected head of state, and an independent judiciary.
 The police and security organs are subordinated to the executive and judicial au-
 thorities.
 Austrias highly developed market-based economy, with its mix of technologically
 advanced industry and modern agriculture, affords its citizens a high standard of
 living.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria; individual rights and political free-
 doms are provided for in the Constitution and generally protected. However, there
 continued to be occasional reports of abuse by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is banned by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
 and Fundamental Freedoms, which is incorporated into the Constitution.
 There were occasional allegations of police brutality in 1994, as in previous years.
 Amnesty International accused the Government of inhuman and degrading treat-
 ment or punishment of foreigners in 1992 and 1993 while they were in detention
 pending deportation. The Interior Minister rejected the accusations as "referring to
 cases that occurred years ago (sic) and have since been invalidated." In one of these
 cases the accused police officer was charged, found guilty, and fined under the Penal
 Code, which prohibits tormenting or neglecting a detainee. Authorities could not
 verify other accusations or were unable to determine culpability. Amnesty Inter-
 national continues to look into judicial investigations of the complaints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary de-
 tention or exile.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours, except that in cases of charges of 'aggressive behavior" an investigative
 judge may within that period decide to grant a prosecution request (if any) for de-
 tention up to 2 years pending completion of an investigation. The grounds required
 for such investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for bail.
 A January 1994 reform of the law requires the investigative judge to evaluate an
 investigative detention at 2 weeks, 1 month, and every 2 months after the arrest.
 In the first quarter of 1994, the reform led to a 30-percent decrease of persons held
 in detention pending investigation, compared with the same period in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. Judges are appointed for life, and may not (in principle) be re-
 moved from office. Jury trials are prescribed for major offenses, and convicted per-
 sons have the right of appeal. Written charges must be presented to the accused,
 who has the right to be represented by a lawyer. Accused persons are presumed in-
 nocent, and trials are public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the protection of personal data collected, processed, or transmitted by
 government agencies, public institutions, or private entities. The Constitution pro-
 tects the secrecy of mail and telephone communications. A 1991 law introduced per-
 manent parliamentary control over the state police and the military secret service.
 Parliamentary subcommittees to oversee these organs were established in Septem-
 ber 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for by the Con-
 stitution, and are generally respected, although stringent slander laws tend to dis-
 courage reports of police brutality. Austria has a free and independent press, rang-
 ing from conservative to Communist. Publications may be removed from circulation
 if they violate legal provisions concerning morality or public security, but such cases
 are extremely rare. A 1992 law that lowered the minimum  sentences for public de-
 nial, belittlement, apprval, or justification of Nazi crimes has had the desired effect
 of increasing the conviction rate of accused neo-Nazis.
 Austrian radio and television are government monopolies but they present diverse
 points of view. There have been no known complaints of either direct or subtle cen-
 sorship. A law passed in July 1993 allowed for establishment of private radio sta-
 
 
 737
 tions. Austrians have wide access to international broadcasts via radio and cable tel-
 evision.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, except for Nazi organizations and activities (an
 exception stipulated also in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955). Public demonstra-
 tions require a permit from the police authorities, who are limited to considering
 only the public-safety aspect of the proposed demonstration, not its political purpose.
 Permits are routinely issued. The Law on the Formation of Associations sti ulates
 that permission to form an organ ization may be denied if it is apparent that the
 organization will pursue the iflegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-While the Constitution incorporates the Treaty of St.
 Germain, which restricts this freedom to religions deemed compatible with public
 safety and morality, no religions have been banned or hampered, and practitioners
 of all faiths worship free of governmental interference. To qualify as a recognized
 religious organization under Austrian law, a religious group must register with the
 Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-The Government does not restrict movement within or out of Austria
 (including emigration). Citizens who leave the country have the right to return at
 any time.
 As a result of a tightening of asylum regulations, applications continued to drop
 in 1994. A report by the Office of the U.N.High Commsioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) designates Austria as one of only two Western European nations that are
 "not a safe third country" on the grounds that the Austrian Government denied
 asylum to persons charged with crimes carrying the death penal, and that it incor-
 rectly interpreted the 1951 Convention on Refugees with regar to victims of civil
 wars.
 Human rights organizations continue to criticize a 1993 law establishing a quota
 system for foreign residents, because it makes no distinction between new immi-
 grants and those already resident as guest-workers, and it limits and delays family
 reunification.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution requires that national elections be held at least every 4 years.
 Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 19, and balloting is secret. The 183 mem-
 bers of Parliament's lower house, the National Council, are directly elected for 4-
 year terms, while the 63 members of the upper house, the Federal Council (whose
 powers are mainly advisory), are elected by the legislatures of the nation's nine
 provinces for terms of 4 to 6 years. The president (head of state) is elected by direct
 popular balloting. The chancellor (prime minister and head of government) is usu-
 ally the leader of the strongest party in Parliament. The two are usually from dif-
 ferent parties and are not necessarily elected simultaneously. The Government is a
 coalition.
 Women candidates did not fare as well in the 1994 elections as previously, and
 the number of women in the National Council decreased from 46 to 40. In the Cabi-
 net, women occupy 4 of the 16 ministerial positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not interfere with discussions or investigations by the
 media, public groups, or private individuals regarding allegations of improper activi-
 ties on the part othe authorities. International andrlocalhuman rights groups op-
 erate freely. Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg to implement the European Convention on Human
 Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for comprehensive protection against any of these kinds of dis-
 crimination in employment, provision of welfare benefits, and other matters.
 In October four letter-bombs were mailed to widespread targets in Austria, three
 of which have foreign connections: a German/Slovene publishing company; a church-
 run home for refugees; and an advisory board that assists foreigners. It is generally
 assumed that rightwing extremists were the perpetrators. Police have been inves-
 tigating intensively, but at year's end had made no identifications of suspects.
 w~omen.-Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women
 are still prohibited by law from night work in most occupations, and this ban is
 
 
 738
 sometimes used as a pretext for not hiring women. (Nurses, taxi drivers, and a few
 other occupations are exempted from this ban.) Austria will enter the European
 Union (EU) in 1995, and is to harmonize its law with relevant EU guidelines by
 2002, beginning in 1997.
 Sixty percent of women between ages 15 and 60 are in the labor force, and their
 numbers are continuing to grow. Despite substantial gains in women's incomes in
 private industry, these average 20 percent lower than those of men.
 Women are not allowed in the Austrian military, suggestions by politicians that
 women do mandatory civilian service, as do men, were rejected by the Women's Af-
 fairs Ministry and women's organizations.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service they remain underrepresented there. To remedy this, the Women's Omnibus
 Law wbich went into effect in January 1993 requires hiring women of equivalent
 qualifications ahead of men in civil service areas in which less than 40 percent of
 the employees are women; but there are no penalties for failure to attain the 40-
 percent target.
 Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their gender. The Labor Court can also award com-
 pensation from employers to victims of sexual harassment.
 Laws prohibit violence against women, but enforcement is often difficult. In cases
 of domestic dispute in which a woman has been physically abused, police may arrest
 the perpetrator only if he is caught in the act or the woman files a complaint. A
 court order forcing a man to stay away from his wife or from any specified woman
 generally takes 3 to 6 weeks to obtain. Official data for 1993 show 12,377 reported
 cases of male violence against women, 529 of which were rape cases, and 142 prison
 sentences for rape. Rape is punishable by 1 to 10 years' imprisonment.
 Women's organizations estimate between 3 and 10 percent of women become vic-
 tims of male violence each year. The Government has committed itself to combating
 famnil violence, under a campaign publicly supported by the Chancellor.
 Children-The Government has also declared itself committed to protecting chil-
 dren's rights and welfare. Austrian laws protect the vast majority of children's
 rights established in international conventions, and in some respects go beyond
 them.
 Each provincial government, and the federal Ministry for Youth and Family Af-
 fairs, has an "Ombudsperson for Children and Adolescents' whose main function is
 to resolve complaints about violations of rights of children.
 People With Disabiities.-Disabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education, and employment. Austrian law requires all private en-
 terprises and state and federal government offices to employ 1 disabled person for
 every 25 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work. Employers who do not
 meet this requirement must pay a fee to the Government, and the proceeds help
 finance services for the disabled such as training programs, wage subsidies, andi
 workplace adaptations. No federal law mandates access for the physically disabled;
 some public buildings are virtually inaccessible for those unable to climb stairs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice, Austrian trade unions have an important and independent
 voice in the political, social, and economic life of the country. In 1994, 53 percent
 of the work force was organized in 14 national unions, all belonging to the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (OGB), which has a highly centralized leadership structure.
 Individual unions and the OGB are independeat of government or political-party
 control, although formal factions within these organizations are closely allied with
 political parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution or
 in national legislation, it is universally recognized. Strikes have been comparatively
 few and usually of short duration. A major reason for Austria's record of labor peace
 is the unofficial system of "social partnership" among labor, management, and gov-
 ernment. At the center of the system is the Joint Parity Commission for Wages and
 Prices which has an important voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. Almost all large companies, private or state-owned,
 are organized. Worker councils operate at the enterprise leve, and workers are enti-
 tled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory boards of major
 companies. Collective agreements covering wages, benefits and working conditions
 are negotiated by the OGB with the National Chamber of &mmerce and its associa-
 tions, which represent the employers. Wage-price policy guidelines are set by the
 
 
 739
 Joint Parity Commission. A 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more
 than five employees to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employers found guilty of this are required to reinstate workers fired
 for union activities. Austrian labor and business representatives remain in disagree-
 ment over how to comply with the obligation under the International Labor Organi-
 zation's Convention 98 to provide legal protection to employees against arbitrary
 dismissals in firms with five employees or fewer.
 Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees regarding job-related
 matters are handled by a special arbitration court for social affairs. The OGB is ex-
 clusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leadership of the Chambers and
 the OGB are elected democratically.
 Austria has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 15. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of
 Social Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimums by job classi-
 fication for each industry. A worker whose annual income Ials below a poverty line
 (approximately $900 a month for a married couple) is eligible for social security ben-
 efits. The average Austrian has a high standard of living, and even the minimum
 wages are sufficient to permit a decent living for workers and their families.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements
 that set the workweek at 38 or 38.5 hours.
 Extensive legislation, strictly enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, provides for mandatory occupational health and safety standards.
 A law effective January 1, 1995, extends such protection to all workers. Workers
 may file complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which may bring suit
 against the employer on behalf of the employee; but this option is rarely exercised,
 as workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which file suits on their
 behalf.
