 NAMIBIA
 Formerly German South West Africa, Namibia has been ruled by
 the Republic of South Africa since 1915. The United Nations
 lifted South Africa's 1920 League of Nations mandate in 1966.
 However, South Africa refused to relinquish its possession and
 has ignored a 1971 advisory opinion of the International Court
 of Justice upholding U.N. authority over Namibia and calling
 for South Africa's immediate withdrawal. In 1978 the United
 States, United Kingdom, France, Federal Republic of Germany,
 and Canada drafted a proposal for Namibian independence agreed
 to in talks with South Africa, the South West Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO), and the neighboring states (known as the
 "Front Line States"). This proposal was adopted by the United
 Nations Security Council as Resolution 435 (UNSCR 435). It
 calls for the cessation of all hostilities, the phased
 withdrawal of South African forces, and free elections under
 U.N. supervision. South Africa has since said that it will
 not implement Resolution 435 without a satisfactory commitment
 by the Angolan Government on the parallel withdrawal of Cuban
 forces from Angola. In November 1984, the Angolans made a
 formal proposal on the numbers and timing of Cuban troop
 withdrawal. South Africa responded with its own proposals,
 including subsequently a proposed August 1, 1986,
 "date-certain" for the implementation of UNSCR 435 if a Cuban
 troop withdrawal agreement could be reached by that date. The
 date passed without an agreement. The United States is
 committed to the U.N. plan and has been playing a mediating
 role in negotiations between South Africa and Angola.
 A South African Government proclamation in June 1985 gave
 ostensible autonomy over internal affairs to a group of
 internal political parties, known as the Multiparty Conference
 (MPC). The MPC formed a "Transitional Government of National
 Unity," more widely known as the "Transitional Government"
 (TG). A number of parties opposed to South African rule
 refused to join the MPC and the TG. Among these parties was
 SWAPO, which is waging a guerrilla war against South African
 rule from outside the country but is still allowed to operate
 as a political party in Namibia, despite harassment by the
 authorities. A number of other parties, including a major
 part of the South West Africa National Union (SWANU), the
 oldest nonviolent opposition group, also refused to join the
 MPC. A South African-appointed Administrator General still
 sits in Windhoek but with reduced powers, and South Africa
 retains direct responsibility for defense, foreign affairs,
 and the constitutional status of Namibia. The United States
 and the rest of the international community do not recognize
 the TG and hold the Republic of South Africa responsible for
 the actions of the Namibian authorities it has appointed.
 A majority (60 percent) of the population of 1.2 million
 Namibians live by subsistence agriculture. The modern economy
 relies on mining, ranching, and fishing, A weak and unstable
 market for minerals, 6 years of drought only broken in
 1984-85, and overfishing by some foreign concerns,
 particularly from the Soviet bloc, have caused a lingering
 recession. Uncertainty about Namibia's
 political future has discouraged potential foreign
 investment. Tourism potential is one of the few bright spots
 
 
 297
 NAMIBIA
 on the economic horizon. Meanwhile, the South African
 Government provides over $500,000 a day in direct aid to
 Namibia.
 Most reports of human rights violations by government
 authorities or SWAPO involved actions taken in the war zone in
 northern Namibia since 1966 when SWAPO first turned to
 violence. Sporadic incidents of violence plague the entire
 country, but most of the fighting takes place near Namibia's
 border with Angola, especially in the Ovamboland region. The
 Ovambo ethnic group comprises approximately 50 percent of
 Namibia's population and provides the main support for SWAPO.
 In recent years, the combat has been conducted by small groups
 belonging to SWAPO's military branch, the People's Liberation
 Army of Namibia (PLAN). SWAPO mounts an annual rainy season
 infiltration of northern Namibia from bases in Angola to carry
 out sabotage missions. The South African defense force (SADF)
 and the South West African Territorial Force-(SWATF) attempt
 to root out the SWAPO teams and on a regular basis in 1986
 conducted "hot pursuit" operations across the border into
 Angola. Years of effective South African military operations
 in both Namibia and Angola have significantly weakened SWAPO,
 and guerrilla infiltration of Namibia dropped off in 1986.
 Government forces claimed to have killed over 645 SWAPO
 combatants by the end of 1986.
 In 1986 there were a number of civilian deaths attributed to
 both government security forces and to SWAPO, including some
 caused by mines or bombs reportedly planted by SWAPO in public
 places. In addition, there was a continuation of arbitrary
 government detention without access to counsel or visits by
 family members and of torture and other abuses by security
 forces. There are also restrictions on freedom of assembly
 and freedom of the press. A number of prisoners were released
 in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Namibia is an arena of guerrilla conflict, and there have been
 a number of deaths due to terrorist bombings. Post offices,
 schools, and other government buildings in the north are
 heavily barricaded and patrolled. SWAPO guerrillas have
 reportedly murdered some Ovambo civilians, apparently in an
 attempt to intimidate others from cooperating with the South
 African Government. SWAPO denied responsibility for the
 bombing of a Walvis Bay meat market in July which killed five
 persons, countering that the market is an implausible SWAPO
 target because it was frequented by blacks; SWAPO sympathizers
 claimed that government or government-backed groups were
 responsible in an effort to discredit SWAPO.
 The SADF and SWATF and the police have themselves been accused
 of killing captured SWAPO guerrillas. Military officials
 state that very few SWAPO guerrillas are captured, but they
 attribute this to the nature of the fighting and SWAPO's
 orders to its guerrillas not to be taken captive. Defense
 officials insist that they investigate all charges of murder.
 They also assert that the murders they have confirmed are acts
 of indiscipline and not policy. Critics contend that the
 
 
 298
 NAMIBIA
 SADF/SWATF sometimes take no action after being informed of
 instances of misconduct. In a highly publicized incident,
 charges against four members of government security forces
 accused of beating a civilian to death were dropped under
 direct orders from South African President Botha (see Section
 1.c.). The Government did prosecute several other security
 force members for brutality and sentenced several to prison,
 including a SADF soldier in January who received 6 years in
 prison for raping an Ovambo woman.
 Some clergymen and human rights activists have accused the
 police paramilitary unit previously known as "Koevoet"
 (Crowbar) of numerous atrocities including murder. The name
 "Koevoet" was dropped in mid-1985 when the unit came under the
 authority of the South West Africa police, reporting to the
 TG. The South African Government has on occasion agreed to
 pay damages, along with legal costs, to settle claims of
 alleged unlawful killings and assaults by Koevoet. Criminal
 prosecutions, for which a higher standard of proof is
 required, have been much rarer.
 A SWAPO member and former Robben Island prisoner, Immanuel
 Shifidi, was killed on November 30 when outsiders violently
 disrupted a peaceful SWAPO rally. There were credible
 allegations that some out-of-uniform members of a government
 security unit were among the outsiders. The police denied
 responsibility and began an investigation of the incident.
 Earlier the same week, security force officials accused SWAPO
 of murdering a church official. SWAPO denied the charges.
 b. Disappearance
 The security forces are not obliged to notify anyone when a
 person is detained and often hold detainees incommunicado for
 extended periods of time. They are sometimes accused of
 ignoring requests for information from family members and
 friends of those who have been detained. As a result, some
 Namibians have "disappeared" only to turn up later in
 detention cells.
 SWAPO reportedly uses abductions to win recruits, although
 SWAPO officials contend that all its recruits join
 voluntarily. SWAPO allegedly abducted 17 Ovambo school
 children in September for this purpose. This may have marked
 a revival of a tactic dropped years ago because of the
 negative publicity which resulted.  Government security
 forces pursued the alleged kidnapers into Angola and claimed
 SWAPO was forced to release the youths. A SADF officer said
 smaller scale SWAPO abductions remain a common feature of life
 in Ovamboland.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In 1986 political leaders, clergymen, and others regularly
 made detailed allegations that the police and security forces
 engaged in brutal treatment against civilians, both in and out
 of detention, including the use of solitary confinement and
 beatings. Several of these allegations have been confirmed.
 Government officials admitted using force to interrogate
 suspected SWAPO supporters whom they suspected of planting
 mines or bombs.
 
 
 299
 NAMIBIA
 The most notable case was that of Frans Uapota, allegedly
 beaten to death by four SADF soldiers in November 1985. The
 Transitional Government charged the four with murder, but
 South African President Botha intervened in June and certified
 under the Defense Act that the four had acted "in good
 faith." The TG, which claimed it was bound by Botha's order
 to withdraw the charges, subsequently asked not to be
 associated with such actions in the future. However, some
 legal observers claimed the TG did not have to comply with
 Botha's instruction. The South West African Bar Council
 condemned the dismissal of the Uapota case as a "coverup."
 Security forces also beat two boys during interrogation. The
 mother of one of the boys has sued South Africa's Defense
 Minister over the alleged brutality. In one case, the
 soldiers were fined; there was no known prosecution in the
 other case.   Security officials point to these court cases as
 proof that claims are investigated and, if valid, pursued in
 legal channels.
 In April a parents' group in Namibia and neighboring countries
 protested SWAPO forced conscriptions of their children as well
 as incarceration, torture, and killings. The group also
 protested the use of "psychological terror by the SWAPO
 Military Police comparable to Koevoet" and the repeated abuse
 of young girls and women in SWAPO camps. SWAPO denied the
 allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two key articles of security legislation, enacted into law via
 proclamations by the Administrator General (AG 9 and AG 26),
 give security forces broad detention power. AG 9 of 1977
 constitutes the legal basis for most detentions and permits
 30-day detentions without charge or access to counsel of
 anyone deemed to have committed an offense, to be planning an
 offense, or to have knowledge of an offense. However, the
 Windhoek Supreme Court ruled in February that persons detained
 under AG 9 were entitled to have access to attorneys.
 Originally, AG 9 applied only to the far northern areas of
 Namibia. However, since 1979 the "security districts" have
 been extended south, and now more than 80 percent of the
 population are subject to AG 9.
 In a report released in October 1986, the Van Dyk Commission,
 created in 1983 to study changes in security legislation,
 indicated that between 1977 and 1983 there were no
 prosecutions under AG 9, and that 80 percent of the detained
 were released within the 30-day limit. The report stated that
 security police had detained 2,624 people under AG 9 between
 1977 and the end of 1983, releasing 2,415 of these uncharged
 within the 30-day limit and another 157 before charges were
 referred to the Attorney General. The police detained 155
 people between January 1984 and April 1985. The defense
 forces (SADF AND SWAFT) detained 2,893 people between 1977 and
 the end of 1983. The defense forces detained 407 people
 between January 1984 and April 1985. Although the number of
 persons in detention at any one time fluctuates considerably,
 it was estimated that approximately eight persons were in
 detention under AG 9 at the end of 1986.
 In security cases, AG 26 allows detention for 180 days without
 trial, under authorization from the Cabinet (previously from
 the Administrator General). AG 26 provides several guarantees
 
 
 300
 NAMIBIA
 not provided by AG 9. It states that detainees are entitled
 to a copy of the arrest warrant and to reasons for the arrest
 in writing. It further stipulates that detainees are entitled
 to visits by medical practitioners and magistrates. AG 26
 provides for a Review Committee, but the Cabinet is not
 required to follow Review Committee recommendations. The
 record in enforcing AG 26 is mixed. Persons detained under AG
 26 are rarely aware of their rights and even more rarely have
 access to competent legal counsel. However, in at least three
 cases taken up by attorneys, legal action or the threat of
 such action won releases. The Government amnestied several
 SWAPO members held under AG 26 in March 1986. The TG said
 there were 24 people being held without charge under AG 26 in
 June 1986, an apparent decline from earlier in the year.
 There were an estimated 21 persons in detention under AG 26 at
 the end of 1986.
 Until mid-1985, Namibians detained under security legislation
 had no recourse to the courts. In various cases in 1985 and
 1986, attorneys sought to gain legal access to their clients
 or have AG 26 and charges under other laws invalidated,
 arguing that they violated the Transitional Government's 1985
 Bill of Fundamental Rights. These rights include one that
 guarantees "no one shall be detained for an indefinite period
 of time without a fair and proper trial by a court." In a
 1985 case, the Windhoek Supreme Court found that the Cabinet
 had failed to show sufficient cause and ordered the prisoner's
 release. However, in February 1986, in State v. Angula, the
 Supreme Court denied an appeal of seven SWAPO members charged
 under the South African Suppression of Communism Act and the
 Terrorism Act. South African Government attorneys
 successfully argued that the bill of rights did not apply,
 since the TG had not yet devised and won approval for a new
 constitution.
 The Windhoek Supreme Court, in what at the time was considered
 a potentially landmark decision, ruled in October 1986 that
 section 2(2) of the Terrorism Act was in conflict with the
 Bill of Rights and Proclamation 101, which created the TG.
 This decision, however, was struck down when South Africa's
 Bloemfontein Appeals Court, the highest Court of Appeal for
 Namibia, ruled in December that only laws passed after the
 TG's creation in June 1985 were subject to the Bill of
 Rights. This excludes all of the major security legislation,
 which accordingly still stands.
 There is no forced labor in Namibia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In an October 1986 report, the Van Dyk Commission, created by
 the Administrator General to make recommendations on the
 "adequacy, fairness and efficacy of legislation pertaining to
 the internal security of the territory," recommended the
 consolidation of all security legislation within one
 proclamation. Among the Commission's other recommendations
 are the principle that a defendant is responsible for proving
 his or her innocence if the State can prove that the crime
 occurred and if the accused had some knowledge of it (not
 specifically that the accused committed the act). In such a
 case, the accused is considered guilty until he or she can
 demonstrate innocence "beyond a balance of probability." The
 State must also prove that the act was perpetrated with intent
 to subvert authority, promote constitutional or political
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 301
 NAMIBIA
 change, or demoralize or intimidate the public. The
 Government's legal authorities consider this stipulation
 central to prosecuting alleged "terrorists," because it is
 much more difficult to prove guilt under regular criminal
 codes which presume the innocence of the defendant. The
 Commission also recommended that residents of the "operational
 area" in the north be held liable to provide information on
 SWAPO activities. The TG's Justice Minister has not yet
 proposed formal revisions in security legislation to the
 National Assembly.
 Some elements of the security forces, police and military, are
 seconded from South Africa and remain under Pretoria's
 ultimate jurisdiction. Thus, Namibians must seek recourse
 from the South African Government for alleged injustices. In
 one case, a Namibian sued South African Minister of Law and
 Order Louis Le Grange for unlawful arrest, wrongful detention,
 and maltreatment by the South African police. In March Le
 Grange agreed to pay approximately $15,000 and court costs to
 a Kavango shopkeeper. However, some observers say most
 alleged victims of wrongful detention or security force
 brutality do not press charges because of fear of increased
 government intimidation after they have given statements.
 Most detainees are held without charges under AG 9 and AG 26.
 However, those few who are brought to trial can expect a
 hearing based on the legal merits of their case. They have
 access to legal counsel and can expect the charges against
 them to be clearly stated.
 The judiciary (Supreme Court, magistrate courts) is
 independent of the executive (TG), but its authority is
 limited by TG and South African legislation and subject to the
 appellate function of South African courts. The Namibian
 judicial structure comprises two overlapping systems--one for
 whites, Westernized blacks, and coloreds, and another for the
 indigenous African people. In 1919 Roman-Dutch law was
 declared the common law of the territory.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Security legislation allows the security forces almost
 unlimited powers of search and seizure. In the operational
 area--the sectors along the northern border--invasion of homes
 is said to be routine. Cars are regularly stopped and
 searched when entering checkpoints to the northern region;
 they are also periodically stopped and scrutinized when
 entering or leaving government installations in the
 operational area.
 Politically active Namibians regularly complain that the
 authorities keep them under surveillance. Security police,
 often disguised as businessmen, reportedly have offered money
 to activists' friends in return for information on their
 movements.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Namibian newspapers are subject to South African press laws,
 including the Internal Security Act of 1950. These laws limit
 reporting on certain matters such as military affairs and
 
 
 302
 NAMIBIA
 prisons. In spite of this restriction, the Namibian press
 often contains lively and irreverent reporting, and its
 editorial writing regularly includes anti-South African and
 even pro-SWAPO comment. Newspapers have embarrassed the TG
 with disclosures of the salaries and perquisites provided to
 TG representatives. The installation of the TG, whose Bill of
 Fundamental Rights guarantees the freedom of expression,
 suggested a looser rein on the press. However, the Cabinet
 required a $9,000 deposit from the owners of the Namibian, a
 newspaper whose editorial slant is opposed to the Government
 and allegedly pro-SWAPO, before allowing them to publish the
 newspaper's inaugural edition on August 30, 1985. The
 newspaper's editor appealed to the court in September 1986 and
 won her case to have the deposit reduced. Only one other.
 paper, the Observer, was required to make a similar deposit,
 which is presumably being refunded as well. All other papers
 had been required to deposit $9.
 The Namibian has complained of regular harassment, including a
 fire in August 1986, break-ins, threatening phone calls,
 broken windows, and tire slashing.
 Publications which are banned in South Africa are also banned
 in Namibia. Several SWAPO publications have been declared
 'undesirable." However, Windhoek book periodical retailers
 carry many publications which one would not find in South
 Africa. Censorship laws seem to be less stringently applied
 in Namibia than in South Africa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All political parties must apply for permission to convene
 meetings. The Prohibition and Notification of Meetings Act of
 1981 bars any political party from holding a public meeting of
 a certain size if that party advocates violence as a means of
 changing the status quo. Under this provision, the Government
 limited the political activities of the legal SWAPO party,
 restricting the size of public meetings to 20 persons or less.
 The Windhoek Supreme Court ruled in July 1986 that, according
 to the TG's bill of rights, SWAPO could hold public meetings
 with prior approval because the court found that the group did
 not specifically advocate the overthrow of the Government by
 force. SWAPO subsequently held three public meetings, their
 first in 5 years. While the first two were undisturbed, the
 third meeting was violently interrupted by outsiders, some of
 whom were credibly alleged to be out-of-uniform members of a
 government security unit. The police then arrived and broke
 up the meeting by indiscriminately firing large amounts of
 tear gas, even at people fleeing the meeting or well away from
 the meeting site.
 The Government banned a march planned by the Roman Catholic
 Church and various political opposition groups (the ban was
 overturned by the Supreme Court). On December 4, the TG
 prohibited meetings to commemorate the "old location" incident
 of 1959, when several people were killed during a forced
 removal in Windhoek. The meetings ban was imposed under the
 Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956. The Government also detained
 church officials, not for their religious activities but for
 their alleged political opposition. Several officials of the
 Lutheran church (the largest church in Namibia) were detained
 in May, although some were released the next month. At the
 end of 1986, the authorities were investigating the political
 
 
 303
 NAMIBIA
 activities of the Council of Churches of Namibia (CCN), which
 is often seen as sympathetic to SWAPO. Both the CCN
 headquarters in Windhoek and a Lutheran church in Ovamboland
 were bombed in January (the CCN building being totally
 destroyed). The Government and SWAPO blamed each other for
 the bombings.
 Both Pretoria and the TG restrict non-Namibians from speaking
 out on political issues within the territory. The TG has the
 authority to ban outsiders from entering Namibia to give
 speeches. It used this authority in 1986 to prohibit a speech
 by a member of the South African United Democratic Front. The
 law also bans right-wing groups--including the Conservative
 Party, the Herstigte National Party, and the far right
 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging from speaking on plans for
 Namibian independence. This subject is reserved for officials
 of the South African Government. The Government arrested
 South African black activist Saths Cooper in February before
 he addressed a meeting on the black consciousness movement and
 its lessons for Namibia. Cooper was arrested for violating an
 old law prohibiting the entry of Asian people into the country
 without a permit. After the charges against Cooper were
 dropped, the Government later replaced the law with one that
 requires an entry permit for all persons not born in Namibia
 or who do not work for the Government.
 At least seven larger and several smaller labor unions are
 registered in Namibia, and all are nominally open to all
 races. However, only one has a sizable black membership: the
 Mineworkers Union of Namibia (MUN) based in Tsumeb. The
 Department of Civic Affairs reports that only the MUN and the
 Municipal Staff Association are functioning labor
 organizations. The MUN is represented in just one of the
 three mining firms, and neither union has been noticeably
 active. Migrant labor is a staple of the mining and fishing
 industries. Many of the migrant workers are Ovambos unwilling
 to risk being discharged and forced back to the operational
 area by loss of their income.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Namibians enjoy complete freedom of religion. Almost all
 Namibians are Christians. The Lutheran Church has by far the
 largest share of adherents: the 1985 merger of two Lutheran
 branches formed the evangelical Lutheran Church, to which 7
 out of 10 Namibians belong. The Catholic, Anglican,
 Methodist, and Dutch Reformed churches are also active. There
 is 1 synagogue, and there are approximately 20 Jewish families
 in Windhoek.
 Most church officials are openly critical of South African and
 TG policies and complain they are regularly harassed and
 inconvenienced, e.g., by passport denials, by the
 authorities. The TG reportedly delayed one education aid
 project sponsored by the Namibian Council of Churches until
 the project was taken over by a secular group. South African
 Defense Force officials frequently argue that clerics are
 SWAPO sympathizers and supporters. The clerics have denied
 allegiance to SWAPO, stating only that they wished to see
 Namibia become truly independent. The military conscription
 system makes no provision for conscientious objectors.
 
 
 304
 NAMIBIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The February 1985 order under the security districts
 proclamation states that no person may enter six northern and
 northeastern districts without first obtaining a permit issued
 by the police. The districts are Ovamboland, Kavangoland,
 Kaokoland, Eastern Caprivi, Bushmanland, and Hereroland East.
 Everyone must apply in person at a police station and fill out
 a form giving their reason for travel. Approval of such
 applications can take up to 2 weeks. Since the order was
 issued, several people have been denied permits. In at least
 one case, the police refused to give reasons for the denial.
 Two journalists were refused permission to travel to Kaokoland
 to cover a poaching trial against security officials.
 Clerics in northern Namibia complain that these regulations
 greatly restrict their ability to attend to their
 congregations, particularly when they must travel from
 Ovamboland into Kavangoland. One church leader was offered a
 multiple-entry permit, but he rejected it as an illegitimate
 special privilege.
 Though enforcement of the requirement that travelers present
 permits at roadway checkpoints leading into the northern
 sectors has reportedly grown lax, travelers without permits
 still risk being turned away. A dusk-to-dawn curfew in the
 operational area also restricts freedom of movement: Leaders
 of various churches petitioned the Supreme Court to end the
 curfew as being inconsistent with the Government's Bill of
 Rights. The Supreme Court rejected the petition December 5,
 and the curfew remains in force. In addition, the potential
 danger of land mines discourages travel on unpaved roads.
 The authorities control travel beyond South Africa through
 denials of passports or "travel documents", which are required
 of Namibians seeking to journey overseas. Those persons
 deemed to be sympathetic to SWAPO or who are officially
 associated with SWAPO are usually given passports valid for
 only 1 year rather than the regular 5-year period. Gwen
 Lister, editor of the Namibian, and SWAPO Secretary-General
 Toivo Ja Toivo are two persons who have been given the more
 restricted passports. In some cases, individuals are refused
 passports altogether, as in the 1986 case of Roman Catholic
 Bishop Kameeta. All persons entering South Africa or Namibia
 must have a passport and visa unless they can prove to be
 South African or Namibian by law or descent.
 In November 1985, the TG's appointed National Assembly passed
 a law requiring non-Namibians to apply for special permits if
 they wish to reside in Namibia for longer than 30 days. Three
 South Africans were deported in April 1986 under this
 "Residence of Certain Persons in South West Africa Regulation
 Act", which allows for the deportation of people who threaten
 the public order. The Act applies to all non-Namibians and
 those outside the Government and armed forces. However, the
 Windhoek Supreme Court ruled in November that the Residence of
 Certain Persons Act violated the Government's Bill of
 Fundamental Rights and thus was invalid. The TG has appealed
 the decision. Travel restrictions also allegedly occur at the
 local level. One of Namibia's 11 ethnic authorities, the
 Rehoboth Basters, reportedly jailed 24 Ovambos for being
 present in the Rehoboth area without residence permits. Such
 restrictions are illegal under the central Government's law.

 NAMIBIA
 There are approximately 80,000 Namibian refugees in other
 African countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Namibians do not have the right to change their Government.
 Ruled by an Administrator General prior to June 17, 1985, they
 are now ruled by South Africa through the Transitional
 Government which they did not elect and which is not
 accountable to them. Theoretically the TG has full control
 over all government portfolios, excepting defense and foreign
 affairs, which the South African Government retains. The six
 parties of the TG divided the cabinet seats among themselves
 after sustained negotiations. No elections were held. The
 Cabinet enacts legislation through a National Assembly, whose
 members were appointed by the six parties.
 In 1978 the prospect of independence led to the creation of a
 number of political parties seeking representation through the
 election mandated by United Nations resolution 435. At one
 time, some 47 political organizations existed, several of
 which had only a handful of members. In 1986 about a dozen
 political parties have credible structures and membership
 rolls. Six of these parties take part in the TG.
 The TG inherited a complex three-tier administrative
 structure. The first-tier is the central government level.
 The second-tier authorities are separate ethnic governing
 bodies representing each of the 11 officially designated
 population groups. Third-tier authorities, such as municipal
 governments and village management boards, provide local
 services. The control of facilities such as schools,
 hospitals, and libraries by the ethnic second-tier authorities
 results in the best available facilities being reserved for
 whites, who enjoy a much higher tax base. The issue of
 whether to dismantle the second-tier structure or, if not, how
 to amend it, is the most divisive question facing the TG.
 There is an informal plan, put forward in April 1986 by one of
 the TG parties, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), and
 another by two black-led parties, to replace the second-tier
 ethnic authorities with districts or provinces. The DTA plan
 calls for the formal division of the country into 19
 districts, while the plan proposed by the South West African
 National Union (SWANU) and SWAPO-democrats of the TG divides
 the country into 6 provinces. The DTA plan also would provide
 for one-man, one-vote for a 60-member national assembly, and a
 60-member senate. Throughout 1986 the Constitution Council
 continued to grapple with developing a draft constitution,
 which is due to be tabled in the National Assembly in early
 1987. According to the rules under which it was created, a
 two-thirds vote in the Assembly will be required to approve a
 draft, if a consensus cannot be reached.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Administrator General and the TG generally permit critics
 of Namibia's human rights situation to visit Namibia. For
 example, the Namibian Council of Churches (NCC) occasionally
 sponsors visits of persons and groups critical of the internal
 situation. According to Amnesty International's 1986 Report,

 NAMIBIA
 the Administrator General, in response to 1985 allegations of
 torture, issued a three-page document which stated that
 military personnel had been warned against mistreatment of
 detainees and "unlawful acts of violence." The Namibia
 Communications Center, an ecumenical agency based in London,
 chronicles reported human rights abuses in Namibia. The
 International Society for Human Rights Conference in London in
 March included considerable criticism of SWAPO's human rights
 record.
 The South African Government ordered officials of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross out of South Africa
 and Namibia in October 1986 in retaliation for the Red Cross
 Conference vote to expel the South African delegation from its
 conference in Geneva. However, this decision was rescinded in
 November.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Namibians are of diverse linguistic and ethnic origins. The
 principal groups are the Ovabo, whites, Damara, Herero,
 Okavango, Nama, colored (mixed race), East Caprivian, Bushmen,
 Rehoboth Baster, Kaokovelder, and Tswana. Namibia's
 population was estimated at 1.2 million in 1982 with Africans
 comprising almost 86 percent and the largest group, the
 Ovambo, constituting 51 percent of the total.
 In 1977 Judge T. Marthinus Steyn used his tenure as
 Administrator General to ease apartheid in Namibia. Laws
 prohibiting interracial marriage and sexual relations were
 repealed, and laws restricting the movement of individuals
 based on race were abolished. Today integrated facilities are
 the rule. Most hotels and restaurants are officially open to
 all races. However, at least one Windhoek restaurant
 blatantly maintains a whites-only admission policy, Several
 others seem to use more subtle methods to discourage black and
 colored patrons. Poverty restricts most blacks and coloreds
 from moving out of their respective townships into the white
 neighborhoods of Windhoek. In December 1985, Namibia's
 libraries, including the Windhoek public library, which were
 operated by the second-tier administration for whites, were
 opened to all groups.
 Namibia no longer has an equivalent of the South African Group
 Areas Act, which restricts areas of domicile by race, but
 economic factors keep the races largely divided. The TG is
 grappling, so far unsuccessfully, with devising an alternative
 to AG 8, the legislation which created 11 different ethnic
 second-tier authorities which provide for segregated education
 and other public services. Under the system, whites, who
 provide 90 percent of the country's tax revenues, pay only for
 the upkeep of white schools and services.
 The Cabinet recommended that all schools be opened to all
 races in 1987, but two parties in the TG, the White National
 Party of South West Africa and the "colored" Rehoboth Free
 Democratic Party which control their own schools, opposed the
 move, and the plan has been shelved for the 1987 school year.
 President Botha reportedly told TG officials in October that
 they should not go ahead with wholesale desegregation of the
 schools but rather continue to recognize group, as opposed to
 individual, rights.

 NAMIBIA
 Women encounter considerable difficulties in both traditional
 and modern settings. Under traditional practice, a woman is
 usually the ward of her father or, when married, her husband.
 She is never independent. Women in the modern sector complain
 of discrimination in employment and in financial affairs.
 Women's groups have been formed generally under the auspices
 of the churches. Women are represented in the National
 Assembly, though not in the Cabinet. In 1985 the Council of
 Churches helped establish a women's organization, the Namibian
 Women's Voice (NWV), whose representatives traveled to Nairobi
 for the U.N. conference marking the end of the U.N. decade for
 women. In Nairobi these 18 women joined 18 Namibians in exile
 and sat together as a united delegation. The NWV has
 undertaken projects commemorating the role of women in
 Namibia's history.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage in Namibia. The minimum working age
 is 15. Reliable information about the extent to which
 occupational health and safety standards are enforced in
 Namibia is not readily available.
