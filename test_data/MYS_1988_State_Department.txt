 MALAYSIA
 Since independence in 1957, Malaysia has had a parliamentary
 system of government based on free elections contested by
 several parties, almost all of which are racially based.
 Malaysia is a multiethnic society, with Malays comprising a
 bare majority of the population, and the remainder consisting
 of Chinese (about 33 percent), Indians (about 10 percent), and
 several smaller minorities. The ruling National Front
 (composed of three major and several minor parties) has won a
 two-thirds or better majority in the federal Parliament in all
 seven general elections since 1957, but opposition parties are
 active and vocal participants in the political system and
 occasionally hold power at the state level. A strong free
 market economy, abundant natural resources, and a relatively
 small population have helped Malaysia become one of the most
 prosperous of the developing countries.
 Internal security remains a concerr in Malaysia. A major
 Communist insurrection that began in 1948 and peaked in the
 early 1950*s still smolders in a few border areas, several
 hundred persons reportedly died in intercommunal rioting
 following the 1969 national elections, and the Government has
 explicitly classified the country's serious drug problem as a
 threat to national security. The Government cites all three
 of these factors as justification for laws allowing preventive
 detention of persons suspected of subversive activity or drug
 trafficking. Other laws empower the Government to restrict
 the right to free expression and association.
 Important human rights concerns in Malaysia in 1988 related to
 continued detention of some government critics and restrictions
 on freedom of association, freedom of the press, and the
 independence of the judiciary. Until the end of 1987, Prime
 Minister Mahathir's administration had been comparatively
 restrained in its use of Malaysia's Internal Security Act
 (ISA). By mid-October 1987, the number detained under the ISA
 had been sharply reduced to about 25 from 500 when Mahathir
 took office in 1981. However, in late October and early
 November 1987, in an effort it said was necessary to avoid
 serious racial strife, the Government detained 106 more
 persons under the ISA, closed 3 newspapers, and banned all
 public assemblies. By November 1988, all but 16 of those
 detained in October and November of the previous year had been
 released, and the 3 newspapers were publishing again.
 However, among the remaining detainees were five Members of
 Parliament, including several top leaders of the major
 Chinese-based opposition party;
 In 1988 Parliament amended the Constitution and several laws
 in ways that limit judicial review of executive actions. In
 addition, the Lord President (equivalent to Chief Justice of
 the U.S. Supreme Court) was dismissed by the King following an
 investigation by a special tribunal, composed of Malaysian and
 other Commonwealth judges, into charges of improper behavior.
 The Government charged the Lord President, among other things,
 with displaying bias and prejudice against the Government in
 speeches dealing with the independence of the judiciary. Five
 Supreme Court Justices were subsequently suspended for
 activities associated with the case. Acting on the
 recommendation of a special tribunal convened to hear the case
 against the five justices, the King ordered the immediate
 reinstatement of three of the justices and the dismissal of
 the other two.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or by any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention attributable to the Government or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of torture. Allegations of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are rare,
 although several Malaysian citizens who were detained by the
 Government in October 1987 claim that they were mistreated by
 security authorities, especially during the initial stage of
 their detention. Their allegations included charges of sleep
 deprivation, threats and verbal abuse, and, in at least one
 case, beating.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government can detain suspects without benefit of judicial
 review under three laws: the 1960 Internal Security Act
 (ISA), the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969, and
 the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985.
 The 1960 ISA, adopted by the British during the Communist
 insurgency of the 1950's, is aimed at controlling internal
 subversion. It empowers the police to hold for up to 60 days
 any person who may act "in a manner prejudicial to the
 security of Malaysia;" further detention (in renewable 2-year
 segments) must be authorized by the Minister of Home Affairs.
 The Minister must inform detainees of the charges against them
 and give them the opportunity to protest those charges to an
 advisory board. The advisory board reviews each case at least
 every 6 months. However, advisory board decisions and
 recommendations are not binding on the Minister. Since the
 recommendations of the advisory boards are never publicized
 and are often not revealed to the detainee, it is difficult to
 generalize about the regularity with which the recommendations
 are accepted by the Government. It is believed, however, that
 a recommendation to release a detainee is normally followed,
 although sometimes with a delay of a month or two.
 Prior to the ISA detentions of October 1987, the number of
 long-term ISA detainees had dropped from nearly 500 in 1981 to
 about 25. In October and November 1987, however, Malaysian
 authorities, citing the need to act to avoid serious racial
 strife, detained another 106 persons, including government and
 opposition Members of Parliament, social critics, academics,
 environmentalists, and religious activists. By November-
 October 1988, all but 16 of these detainees had been released.
 Some of those released are subject to various types of
 restrictions such as requiring them to report to the police
 periodically, to remain in their homes at night, or to refrain
 from engaging in political activities. In addition, in 1988,
 
 
 865
 MALAYSIA
 9 Malaysians from Sarawak and 23 from the northern States of
 Kedah and Perwak were arrested under the ISA as arson suspects
 and remain in custody. It is estimated that there are about
 100 persons currently under ISA detention, including 16 of the
 group of 106 detained in October 1987.
 In July 1988, the Parliament amended the ISA to place
 additional limitations on judicial review of detentions. The
 amendments validate detention orders regardless of textual
 inaccuracies in place or fact and prohibit legal challenges to
 detention orders. These amendments do not, however, proscribe
 judicial review of the October 1987 detention orders.
 The Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969 stemmed
 from that year's communal riots. The State of Emergency
 declared at that time has never been rescinded, although
 Parliament regained its legislative power in 1971. The
 Emergency Ordinance gives the Government the power to detain
 anyone "in the interests of the public safety or the defense
 of Malaysia." As under the ISA, detainees must be informed of
 the charges against them, and they can appeal to an advisory
 board. Prior to amendments in 1988, the Government could
 detain suspects under the Emergency Ordinance for a maximum of
 2 years. The 1988 amendments to the legislation, however,
 allow the Minister of Home Affairs to extend the period of
 detention, validate detention orders with defects, and
 prohibit legal challenges to the detention orders. In
 previous years, the Emergency Ordinance was used by Malaysian
 antinarcotics authorities to detain suspected drug traffickers,
 but, since enactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985, the
 Emergency Ordinance is no longer used for this purpose.
 The Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act of 1985
 was enacted by Parliament to give the Government a specific
 law under which suspected drug traffickers can be detained.
 Suspects can be held under this law for successive 2-year
 periods. However, certain due process safeguards not found in
 the Emergency Ordinance and the ISA were incorporated in the
 antidrug law. The police report on the detention must be
 submitted to an "inquiry officer" who then sends his views on
 the detention to the Minister of Home Affairs. Also, the
 opinion of the advisory board, following either its initial
 hearing or its periodic review of each case, is binding on the
 Minister. It is believed that about 890 suspects were in
 detention under this statute as of August 1988. As with the
 other two security statutes, the Dangerous Drugs Act was
 amended in 1988 to validate detention orders with certain
 defects and to prohibit legal challenges to detention orders.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ordinary (nonsecurity-related) civil and criminal cases are
 tried under a fair and open judicial system derived from
 British jurisprudence. Charges must be levied against a
 defendant within 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide
 within 14 days whether to bring the case to court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to represent
 clients without penalty to themselves. Bail is available, and
 strict rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may
 appeal lower court decisions to the federal courts and, in
 criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or
 local state rulers, as appropriate.
 
 
 866
 MALAYSIA
 Persons detained under internal security legislation and for
 certain classes of crimes, if their cases are brought to
 trial, are tried under special procedures contained in the
 Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. The accused
 is allowed counsel but sometimes does not receive a statement
 of the evidence prior to the trial; trial is by a single judge
 without a jury; and witnesses may be examined in the absence
 of the accused. Admissible evidence includes hearsay and
 secondary evidence, testimony of children and spouses,
 self-incriminating statements to police, and information from
 seized records or communications. If the accused is found
 guilty, the judge must impose the maximum penalty.
 The Malaysian judiciary has traditionally been regarded by the
 public and the legal community as committed to the rule of
 law. The judicial system has exhibited over the years an
 unusual degree of independence, not hesitating to rule against
 the Government in criminal, civil, or occasionally even major
 cases with political ramifications. An example of the latter
 was the High Court ruling in February 1988 that the dominant
 party in the Government coalition was illegally constituted.
 The Constitution was amended in 1988 to delete the clause
 vesting judicial power in the courts and substitute a clause
 stating that the jurisdiction and power of the courts are
 "conferred by or under Federal Law." Although the practical
 ramifications of this constitutional amendment have not been
 tested, some members of the legal community charge that this
 amendment strips the judiciary of its constitutional basis of
 authority, making it wholly dependent upon specific legislation
 passed by Parliament. Another constitutional amendment
 increases the discretion of the Attorney General to determine
 where court cases initiated by the Government are heard.
 In another development affecting the judiciary, the Lord
 President of the Supreme Court was dismissed by the King on
 August 8 following the recommendation of a tribunal which
 heard the Government's charges against him. These included
 bias and prejudice in speeches critical of the Government and
 writing a letter to Malaysia's King raising objections to the
 Prime Minister's criticism of the judiciary, thereby creating
 misunderstanding between the Prime Minister and the hereditary
 rulers. Five Supreme Court Justices were suspended for their
 actions related to the Lord President's case. A second
 tribunal appointed by the King ordered the immediate
 reinstatement of three of the justices. The other two were
 dismissed from office. Critics charge that one result of such
 actions will be to reduce considerably the inclination of
 judges to act independently of executive authority. The High
 Court Order of October 6, 1988, releasing ISA detainee
 Jamaluddin Othman is, however, an indication of continued
 judical willingness to disagree with the Malaysian Government
 on important issues.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Generally, these rights are protected by law. However, under
 the security legislation described above, the police may enter
 and search without warrant the homes of persons suspected of
 threatening national security and confiscate evidence from
 them.

 .ALAYSIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Includinq:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and, in practice,
 there are very few constraints on the freedom of expression in
 conversations or private communications. There are, however,
 some important limitations on freedom of speech and press.
 For example, the Constitution also provides that freedom of
 speech can be restricted by legislation "in the interest of
 security... (or) public order." Thus the Sedition Act
 Amendments of 1970 prohibit public comment on constitutionally
 protected but "sensitive" issues such as citizenship rights
 for non-Malays and the special position of Malays in society.
 Since 1970, however, the Government has brought only a few
 cases under the Sedition Act, and in the most recent incident
 in 1986 the defendant, the President of the Bar Council, was
 acquitted.
 The Constitution also provides for freedom of the press. A
 wide range of fact and opinion is available to the Malaysian
 public in newspapers and magazines published in all of the
 country's four major languages: Bahasa Malaysia, English,
 Chinese, and Tamil. Major international and regional news
 publications also circulate freely. However, this freedom has
 been subjected to important limitations. By virtue of the
 Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984, all domestic
 and foreign punlications must apply annually to the Government
 for a permit. In December 1987, the Parliament amended this
 act to broaden the legal definition of "malicious news" and
 make its publication a punishable offense, to expand the
 Government's power to ban publications which "alarm public
 opinion," and to prohibit court challenges to suspension or
 revocation of publication permits. An additional inhibiting
 factor is that the Government or the business arms of the
 leading political parties in the ruling coalition own almost
 all the major newspapers as well as all the radio and
 television stations. At the time of the ISA detentions in
 October 1987, the Government revoked the publication permits
 of three newspapers: The Star (English), The Sin Chew Yit Pao
 (Chinese), and the Watan (Bahasa Malaysia). Although this
 revocation order was rescinded in March 1988 and all three
 newspapers are now being published, the revocations and the
 series of legislative amendments described above have resulted
 in significant self-censorship by journalists and editors of
 the daily newspapers. Nevertheless, opposition parties,
 social action groups, and a number of private publications
 regularly provide detailed coverage of opposition political
 activities and print viewpoints strongly critical of the
 ruling coalition and its policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association, although limitation of
 those rights is permitted in the interest of security and
 public order. Thus the 1967 Police Act requires police
 permits for large public assemblies. In practice, until
 October 1987, few such gatherings, even for specifically
 political purposes, were prohibited. In October 1987, the
 Government banned all unauthorized assemblies. In 1988 there
 appeared to have been some loosening of the enforcement of
 Police Act restrictions allowing open campaigning by
 government and opposition candioates in a parliamentary
 byelection in August. Other statutes limit the right of
 
 
 868
 MALAYSIA
 association, such as the Societies Act of 1966, under which
 the Government can refuse registration to organizations which
 comment unfavorably on political or public issues. The threat
 of deregistration under the Societies Act tends to inhibit
 lobbying by public or special interest organizations, but it
 does not suppress such activity entirely. April 1988
 amendments deleted a section of the Act which made an entire
 society illegal if a branch is illegal, gave the registrar of
 societies additional power to restrict inspection of its
 documents, and made it a crime to render assistance to illegal
 societies. Another law affecting freedom of association is
 the Universities and University Colleges Act, which requires
 government approval for student associations and prohibits
 such associations from engaging in political activity.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and ethnic Malays
 are legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family
 relations and diet, by Islamic religious laws administered by
 state rather than by federal authorities. An Islamic
 religious establishment is supported by government funds, and
 it is government policy to "infuse Islamic values" into the
 administration of Malaysia. However, the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion, and the Government has refused
 to accede to pressures for the imposition of Islamic religious
 law beyond the Muslim community. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities,
 practice their faith with minimal interference by the
 Government. There are persistent allegations, however, that
 some state goirernments have been slow in approving building
 permits for non-Muslim places of worship. Also, the Government
 has limited the circulation of a popular translation of the
 Bible in Bahasa Malaysia. Conversion to religions other than
 Islam is permitted but not encouraged; proselytizing of
 Muslims is, and has long been, proscribed by law in some
 states and strongly discouraged in other parts of the country.
 Government sensitivity on religious questions was evident in
 the October 1987 ISA detentions of several Muslim and Christian
 teachers and activists. In March 1988, the Government released
 a "White Paper on the ISA Arrests" in which it asserted that
 some Muslim groups were creating confusion in the Muslim
 community by exaggerating the extent of Christian efforts to
 convert Muslims. The White Paper also said that a pastor of a
 local church who was detained in October 1987 had attempted to
 convert Muslims to Christianity, a practice which has been
 strongly discouraged for many years. The pastor has since
 been released. In addition, the White Paper asserted that
 some local Christian groups were guilty of subscribing to the
 "liberation theology concept upheld by the Marxist group." In
 response to the White Paper's charges, the Christian Federation
 of Malaysia argued that there are fundamental differences
 between Marxism and liberation theology, as accepted by the
 Vatican, and categorically denied any connection between its
 members and Marxist groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Aside from some former ISA detainees who have been released
 with special restrictions placed on their movements, the
 
 
 869
 MALAYSIA
 Government places no restrictions on the people's right to
 travel within the country and live and work where they
 please. There are also no known government restrictions on
 emigration. Since there are no known Malaysian refugees in
 other countries, there is no problem of repatriation.
 Although there have been a few cases of Malaysian citizens
 being denied passports on security grounds, Malaysians are
 generally free to travel abroad. There are some restrictions
 on travel by Malaysians to certain countries, such as Israel,
 South Africa, China, and some Soviet Bloc countries.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to more than 230,000
 Vietnamese refugees since 1975. It has cooperated closely
 with international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to third
 countries. Vietnamese refugees continue to arrive and be
 accepted at Malaysian camps at a rate of 6,000 to 13,000 per
 year (an estimated 13,500 in 1988) despite significant
 domestic opposition to Malaysia's traditional open door
 refugee policy. In April 1988, the Government announced its
 intention to phase out its major Indochinese refugee camp
 sometime in 1989 and its desire to convene an international
 conference on refugees under the auspices of the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHRC). Malaysia itself has
 resettled over 8,000 Khmer Muslim refugees, but has not
 accepted non-Muslim refugees for permanent settlement.
 According to government figures, more than 40,000 Philippine
 Muslims have legally settled in the state of Sabah since 1975.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British model.
 The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible to Parliament,
 from which they are drawn. National parliamentary elections,
 which the Constitution requires at least every 5 years, have
 been held regularly since independence in 1957 and have
 included opposition candidates actively contesting
 parliamentary seats. In addition, there are regular state and
 local elections involving candidates from several political
 parties. The opposition concedes that elections to date have
 been free and fair; votes are cast secretly and recorded
 accurately.
 Through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Malays
 dominate the ruling national front coalition of ethnic-based
 parties which has controlled Parliament since independence.
 However, non-Malays fill a number of cabinet posts. In August
 1986, the National Front won 148 of the 177 seats in the House
 of Representatives. Although the opposition regularly
 criticizes government policies within and outside Parliament,
 government positions generally prevail. Since 1957 there has
 been a peaceful transfer of power in the Office of Prime
 Minister three times, twice through resignation and once
 through death.
 In the most recent parliamentary elections, nine women won
 election to the Parliament. In addition, 10 women serve as
 Senators, 2 as ministers in the Government, and 3 as deputy
 ministers.
 Opposition parties such as the Islamic Party of Malaysia
 (PAS), have occasionally gained control of state governments.
 Non-Malay parties have also controlled state governments; for
 example the ruling party in the important state of Penang is
 
 
 870
 MALAYSIA
 largely Chinese-based, and in Sabah a predominantly Christian
 party is currently in power. In an important Parliamentary
 byelection in August 1988, a former UMNO Member of Parliament
 running in opposition to the Government was elected by a large
 majority.
 Eleven members of Parliament, 10 from opposition parties and
 one from the Government coalition, were included among the
 persons detained in October and November 1987. Five Members
 of Parliament from the opposition Democratic Action PArty
 (DAP), including the party leader and other top officials,
 remain in detention. Based upon the Societies Act, which
 proscribes detainees from holding office in legally registered
 societies, the Registrar of Societies has ruled that the five
 DAP leaders still in detention cannot continue in their party
 offices. The Government maintains that the DAP
 parliamentarians were detained in order to prevent an outbreak
 of communal violence like that which occurred in 1969.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government rejects criticism of its human rights record by
 international human rights organizations and foreign
 governments and maintains that it is the duty of Malaysia's
 citizens and media to counter efforts by outsiders to "tarnish
 the country's image". Officials also criticize local groups
 for "collaborating" with international human rights
 organizations in their studies of the human rights situation
 in Malaysia. Nevertheless, representatives of international
 human rights organizations have visited and traveled freely in
 Malaysia and are able upon request to meet with relevant
 government officials. In 1988 the Government permitted
 delegations from the International Committee of the Red Cross
 and the Human Rights Commission of the International
 Parliamentary Union to meet with ISA detainees as well as with
 relevant government officials. In addition, American
 officials and officials from other governments have met in
 Malaysia with their Malaysian counterparts to discuss human
 rights questions.
 While there are currently no organizations in Malaysia which
 deal specifically with the protection of human rights, in
 December a group of prominent citizens, including two former
 prime ministers, declared its intention to establish one. At
 present, a number of organizations, including the Bar Council
 and various public interest groups, devote some time to human
 rights activities. The Government tolerates their activities
 but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press
 statements. The Government has not acceded to any of the
 international covenants on human rights, generally maintaining
 that such issues are internal matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority which remains poorer, on average, than other
 Malaysians despite its political dominance. These government
 programs and policies limit, in varying degrees, opportunities
 for non-Malays in higher education, government employment,
 business permits and licenses, and ownership of new homesteads.
 
 
 871
 MALAYSIA
 There are no laws or regulations restricting the political and
 economic rights of women. Government policy supports their
 full and equal participation in government, education, and the
 work force. Women hold prominent positions in all sectors of
 the economhy. The position of women in society is conditioned
 by the cultural and religious traditions of the country's
 major ethnic groups. With a general resurgence of Islamic
 piety among Malays, many Malay women have in recent years
 tended toward close conformity with Koranic stipulations on
 women's roles.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act
 of 1967 govern the right of workers to engage in trade union
 activity. Unions may organize workplaces, bargain
 collectively with an employer, form federations and join
 international organizations. The Industrial Relations Act
 specifically prohibits any person from interfering with,
 restraining, or coercing a worker in the exercise of the right
 to form or participate in the lawful activities of a trade
 union.
 The Trade Unions Act, which is administered by the Registrar
 of Trade Unions, sets rules for the organization of unions,
 their recogniLion at the workplace, the content of their
 constitutions, election of their officers, and their financial
 reporting requirements. (Parallel acts set the rules for
 companies and societies.) The Act's definition of a trade
 union restricts it to representing workers in a "particular
 trade, occupation, or industry or within any similar trades,
 occupations, or industries." The Committee on Freedom of
 Association of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 concluded that the free choice of unions to which workers wish
 to belong should not in any way be limited by administrative
 authorities' interpretations of union rules insofar as these
 determine the scope of their membership.
 Some critics of the Government's policy toward labor unions,
 notably the American Federation of Labor and Congress of
 Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and Asia Watch, believe
 that the arrest of V. David under the ISA in the government
 crackdown late in 1987 (see Section l.d. above) demonstrated
 labor leaders' vulnerability to the Government, which critics
 assert, inhibits their carrying out legitimate trade union
 activities. Mr. David has declared publicly that questioning
 during his detention related only peripherally to his role in
 the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) and the Transport
 Workers' Union (TWU). He continues as MTUC Secretary General,
 campaigned successfully for reelection to that position in
 December, and has been allowed to travel abroad to trade union
 meetings.
 Federations of trade unions similarly may cover only a single
 trade or industry or similar trades or industries. The only
 labor federations currently registered are one for public
 servants and one for teachers. Two of the state-based textile
 and garment workers' unions have applied to register a
 federation and expect a favorable ruling from the registrar.
 The MTUC, the main labor body in the country, is registered as
 a society under the Societies Act (rather than the Trade
 Unions Act). Previous 14TUC efforts to register as a trade
 union federation under the Trade Unions Act were turned down
 
 
 872
 MALAYSIA
 because of its broad membership. In November, however,
 Parliament approved legislation which grants both the MTUC and
 the Malaysian Employers Federation the status and rights
 accorded trade unions, although both remain societies.
 As of December 1987, there were 409 individual unions in
 Malaysia with over 606,000 members (10.4 percent of total
 employment). Union membership has been stagnant since 1983,
 due in part to the decline of Malaysia's largest union, the
 National Union of Plantation Workers, resulting from the
 replacement of union-organized plantation workers by
 unorganized contract labor; and in part to the 1985-86
 recession, which particularly affected the most wage-based
 sectors of the economy. Unions are independent both of the
 Government and of the political parties. While unions are not
 permitted to engage in political activity, individual trade
 union leaders have served in Parliament (V. David, the MTUC
 Secretary General, is currently a Member of Parliament for an
 opposition party) and individual union members belong to
 political parties. Malaysian trade unions are free to
 associate with the appropriate international trade
 secretariats, and a number of Malaysian labor leaders play
 major roles in international labor affairs. The MTUC is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU). The Secretary General of the National Union
 of Plantation Workers is President of the ICFTU, and the MTUC
 Secretary General has actively participated in the ILO
 governing body.
 While strikes are legal and do occasionally occur, critics
 claim that this right in practice is severely restricted. The
 Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to
 notify the Ministry of Labor that a dispute exists before any
 industrial action may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial
 Relations Department can then become actively involved in
 conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a
 settlement, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to
 the Industrial Court, which effectively becomes compulsory
 arbitration. A strike is prohibited while the dispute is
 before the Industrial Court, and no action may be taken in
 respect of an award made by the Industrial Court. Industrial
 Court awards are the exception rather than the rule, however,
 representing only about 18 percent of all collective
 agreements registered in 1987. The remaining agreements were
 reached through bargaining between management and labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is the norm in Malaysian industries
 where workers are organized. Malaysia's system of
 conciliation and arbitration seeks to promote negotiation and
 settlement of issues without industrial action. However,
 Malaysian law, especially the Industrial Relations Act,
 restricts collective bargaining rights through compulsory
 arbitration.
 In a complaint to the ILO, the MTUC alleged that the 1980
 amendments contain prohibitive and oppressive antiunion
 provisions which erode the basic rights of workers, restrict
 union activities, and result in government and employer
 interference in the internal administration of unions. In
 1983 the ILO urged the Malaysian Government to amend these
 laws further to bring them into conformity with the ILO
 convention on the right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. Many union leaders also believe that creation
 
 
 873
 MALAYSIA
 of the Industrial Court to handle industrial disputes further
 weakened their collective bargaining rights.
 In 1987 the Government proposed labor law amendments which
 would have altered the definition of wages (used for
 calculating overtime pay) and would have clarified the legal
 status of in-house unions (nowhere mentioned in the Trade
 Unions Act). The proposals were withdrawn in the face of
 union opposition in favor of a general review of Malaysia's
 labor legislation, presented to the tripartite National Labor
 Council (NLAC) in May. Union leaders took exception to
 several of the revised proposals, particularly the amendment
 to clarify the legal status of in-house unions, one to
 classify all government departments as "essential services,"
 and one to restrict legal representation in Industrial Court
 cases. The first of these provisions was dropped from the
 amendments submitted to Parliament and approved in late 1988,
 and the other two were modified to meet, in part, union
 objections. The MTUC has welcomed parts of the package,
 particularly the provision granting it the status of a trade
 union and one making Industrial Court awards directly
 enforceable by application to the High Court. The MTUC also
 won more than it gave up on the definition of wages, employers'
 request to reduce retrenchment benefits, coverage of the
 Employment Act, and back pay in unfair dismissal cases.
 Employers gained modest reductions in annual and sick leave
 and a reduction of overtime rates from a maximum of 4.5 times
 basic pay to 3 times basic pay. The MTUC still opposes the
 amendment which restricts legal representation at Labor
 Ministry conciliation hearings (but continues to allow
 representation in the Industrial Court); and a provision
 allowing the Government to declare any industry an "essential
 industry."
 Labor standards in free trade zones are the same as those in
 the rest of Malaysia. Workers at many companies located in
 the free trade zones are unionized, especially in the textile
 and electrical products plants. Enterprises granted "pioneer"
 status (whether or not located in a free trade zone) are
 protected from union demands for terms of employment exceeding
 those specified in the Employment Act of 1955 during the
 period of their pioneer status (normally 5 years). The
 restriction does not apply to wages or benefits not covered by
 the Employment Act (see Section 6.e. below).
 Malaysia's electronic components industry, dominated by
 American and Japanese firms, has been the focus of
 unsuccessful union organizing efforts since the late 1970's.
 In 1980 the Government ruled that the electronics industry was
 sufficiently different from the electrical industry fox
 Malaysian law to preclude the existing Electrical Industry
 Workers Union (EIWU) from organizing electronics workers. In
 response to a complaint by the International Metalworkers
 Federation under ILO Convention 98, the ILO urged the
 Malaysian Government to "apply its legislation in a manner so
 as to allow representative trade union organizations" and
 recommended that the "legislation be interpreted in a less
 restrictive manner." Although there is no specific legal
 provision barring the formation of a separate union to
 represent electronics workers, the Government's application of
 the law has in practice made it impossible to form such a
 union. In late September, the Government announced that
 workers in the electronics industry would henceforth be
 allowed to unionize. In October, however, the Government said

 that permission applied only to in-house unions. The legal
 basis for this restriction remains unclear.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Malaysia is a party to ILO Convention 105 prohibiting forced
 or compulsory labor. Malaysia has effective legal sanctions
 against such abuses. Although the ILO has in the past
 criticized Malaysia for requiring prisoners and ISA detainees
 to work, Malaysia defends the practice as part of its prisoner
 rehabilitation program.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no
 child under the age of 14 may be engaged in any employment
 except light work in a family enterprise, in public
 entertainment, work performed by the Government in a school or
 training institution, or employment as an approved apprentice.
 It is illegal for children to work more than 6 hours per day,
 more than 6 days per week, or at night. The law is
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Malaysian wages are relatively high for its level of
 industrialization and higher than in all neighboring countries
 except Singapore. The Employment Act of 1955 sets working
 hours not to exceed 8 hours per day or 44 hours per week
 (5 1/2 days), sets overtime rates for hours in excess of
 those, and mandates public holidays, annual leave, sick leave,
 and maternity allowances for workers. Most such provisions
 are at least bn a par with standards in industrialized
 countries. Minimum standards of occupational health and
 safety are set by law and enforced by a unit of the Ministry
 of Labor. Severance benefits are provided under the Employment
 (Termination and Lay-off Benefits) Regulations of 1980. The
 Employees Provident Fund (EPF) Ordinance of 1951 requires
 employers and employees to contribute to a fully funded
 retirement program. Some 90 percent of workers are covered by
 either the EPF or the Government's own pension plan for public
 servants. The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1952, and the
 Social Security Act provide disability and workman's
 compensation benefits.
 There is no national minimum wage legislation, but certain
 classes of workers are covered by minimum wage laws: retail
 clerks, hotel and restaurant employees, cinema workers, and a
 few others, totaling approximately 140,000 workers. By local
 standards, and taking into account various worker benefits
 received by most workers, Malaysian wages provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families. The
 effective minimum wage for unskilled labor in the urban areas
 is about $90 per month. Plantation work is increasingly being
 done by contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants
 from Indonesia, in part due to a shortage of Malaysians
 interested in such work. Working conditions for contract
 workers often are significantly below those of direct hire
 plantation workers, many of whom belong to the National Union
 of Plantation Workers. Additionally, many of the immigrant
 workers, particularly the illegal ones, may not have access to
 Malaysia's system of labor adjudication.
