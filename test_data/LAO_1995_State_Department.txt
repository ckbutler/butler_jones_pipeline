 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic is an authoritarian, one-party state ruled
 by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP).
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is the main instrument of state control. MOI police
 maintain order and monitor Lao society and foreign nationals, including foreign offi-
 cials and diplomats. The degree of surveillance varies by locality, but overall has
 diminished in recent years.
 Laos is an extremely poor country. After the LPRP came to power in 1975, at
 least 350,000 people fled the country to escape the Government's harsh political and
 economic policies. Since 1986 the Government has largely abandoned its Socialist
 economic agenda. Economic reforms have moved the country from a moribund, cen-
 trally planned system to a growing market-oriented economy open to foreign invest-
 ment.
 There has been a general trend away from the harsh conditions that existed after
 the LPRP assumed power in 1975, but serious problems remain.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Even with ongoing eco-
 nomic liberalization, the adoption of a Constitution in 1991, and National Assembly
 elections in 1993, the Government only slowly eased restrictions on basic freedoms.
 Many of the rights stipulated in the Constitution have not been codified with imple-
 menting legislation. In practice, the Government restricts the freedoms of speech,
 assembly, andto a lesser extent, religion, even though they are provided for in the
 Constitution. Citizens do not have the right to privacy and do not enjoy a free press,
 although most Lao have ready access to a variety of reign  ia. Prison conditions
 remain harsh, and some societal discrimination against minorities persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There continued to be occasional
 killings in the course of the long-running, low-level insurgency in some areas north
 of Vientiane, where the Hmong ethnic group predominates.
 The road ambush is the most common manifestation of the insurgency. In 1995
 there were approximately 20 reports of killings as a result of ambushes of vehicles,
 trucks, or buses. For example, in February 8 Lao were killed when a passenger
 truck was attacked b a rup of about 10 persons armed with rifles. It is often un-
 clear whether the ambushers are politically or economically motivated.
 During 1995 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) completed its
 investigation of the murder in Khammouane province of a Hmong from
 Bolikhamxay province. Family members in the United States had accused the Gov-
 ernment of complicity in the murder. The UNHCR report concluded that there was
 no evidence of government involvement in what appeared to be a private incident
 involving smuggling goods across the Mekong river to Thailand.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 655
 In September 1993, Vue Mai, a Hmong leader who in November 1992 returned
 voluntaily to Laos from a refugee camp in Thailand, disappeared in Vientiane. No
 new information relevant to the case came to light in 1995.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the Government
 generally observed this principle in practice.                       _
 Prison conditions are harsh, but not life threatening. Prison authorities deny some
 prisoners regular family visits, and medical care ranges from inadequate to non-
 existent. Inmates sometimes resort to bribing their guards to obtain food and medi-
 cines. There is no independent monitoring of prison conditions. Prison conditions for
 women are fundamentally similar to those for men. The extent of sexual harassment
 inprisn is unknown but is not believed to be a serious problem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 some protections for those accused of crimes, such as a statute of limitations, but
 the Government does not fully respect these provisions. Those accused of hostility
 toward the regime are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods.
 There continued to be allegations that the Government has detained three Hmong
 males since 1992 because of their association with the United States prior to 1975.
 The Lao Government has thus far not responded directly to repeated inquiries about
 these allegations.
 Citizens do not have the protection of due process and may be arrested based on
 unsupported accusations without being informed of the charges or of the accusers'
 identities. The Government appears to resort to detention without due process rel-
 atively infrequently in cases involving social crimes such as prostitution, drug
 abuse, and gambling. Some jurisdictions are stricter than others in this regard.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trlal-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of judges and prosecutors and protects their decisions from outside scrutiny. In prac-
 tice, however, the courts, which are understaffed and poorly trained, appear to ac-
 cept recommendations of other government agencies, especially the MOI, in making
 its decisions.
 The judiciary is composed of district courts, provincial courts, and the Supreme
 Court.
 Although regulations provide for public trial, this sometimes amounts to public
 announcement of the sentence and not a true public trial. Politically sensitive trials
 have not been open to the public, although common criminal trials appear to be, and
 they increasingly are publicized in the media.
 There is provision for appeal to the provincial courts and the Supreme Court. Sen-
 ior government and party officials reportedly may also review sensitive political
 cases.
 The Constitution provides that all accused persons have the right to defend them-
 selves and that the Board of Legal Counselors has the right to provide legal assist-
 ance to the accused. The Government suspended the Board in late 1992, pending
 the introduction of rules regarding the fees and activities of private lawyers. The
 few private lawyers in Laos may still provide informal legal counsel, at least for civil
 cases, but they may not establish themselves as attorneys-at-law. According to the
 Criminal Code, defendants in criminal cases are entitled, at their own expense, to
 representation by a "rights protector" who may be any Lao citizen. In practice, few
 defendants exercise this right.
 Arrests are usually unannounced, and trials and convictions are not always pub-
 licized, thus complicating efforts to estimate accurately the number of political pris-
 oners. However, anecdotal reporting suggests that their ranks, reduced substantially
 by the closure of reeducation camps in the 1980's, continued to decrease in recent
 years. The exact number of political prisoners held is unknown but is not thought
 to be large. It likely is no more than several hundred, and quite probably substan-
 tially less.
 Three former government officials are serving 14-year sentences handed down in
 1992 for advocating a multiparty system and criticizing restrictions on political lib-
 erties. Also in 1992, three men detained since 1975 were sentenced to life terms for
 crimes allegedly committed during their tenure as officials under the previous re-
 gime. The Government claims that three other officials of the former government
 released in 1992 have chosen to remain in the same remote province where they
 and the six prisoners mentioned above were held.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 comitant with economic liberalization, the Government relaxed some elements of
 state control, including its rigorous police monitoring of personal and business ac-
 tivities and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the Constitution
 prohibits arrests or searches in homes without a warrant or authorization, the seu-
 
 
 656
 rity bureaus may authorize search and seizure by themselves rather than by judicial
 authority. The Government and the pary continue to monitor the citizemy sporadi-
 cally through a system of neighbrhood and workplace committees. The neighbor-
 had committees als have responsibility for maintaining public order and reporting
 "bad elements" to the police. Tese committees usually concern themselves mre
 with street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political activism. The
 degree of surveillance and control varies from province to province, but overall has
 diminished in recent years.
 The Penal Code forbids telephone monitoring without proper authorization, but
 the security bureaus are believed to authorize such monitoring themselves. The
 Government continued to monitor international mail and telephone calls, probably
 including some faxes, although the increasing number of such calls limited the scope
 of such surveillance.
 The 1991 Constitution stipulates that the "national community" owns all land.
 Private "ownership* is in the form of land use certificates, which can be bought,
 sold, and transferred to heirs. Many Lao who fled the country after 1975 have re-
 gained confiscated property after demonstrating their intent to repatriate.
 Contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners has increased in recent years as re-
 strictions, such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most
 foreigners' homes, are no longer enforced. The Government has eased the prohibi-
 tion against foreigners staying with Lao families in urban areas, and allows Lao
 citizens to marry foreigners but only with prior government approval. Marriages
 without government approval may be annulled, with the foreign spouse subject to
 fine or arrest.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Despite the Constitutional provisions for free-
 dom of speech and the press, the Government exerts broad control over the exercise
 of these freedoms and has reacted harshly to expressions of political dissent. Three
 persons arrested in 1990 after persisting in public criticism of party policies and
 calling for fundamental political and economic change each received 14-year sen-
 tences (see Section i.e.). The Penal Code forbids slandering the State, distorting
 party or state policies and spreading false rumors conducive to disorder. It also pro-
 hibits disseminating biooks and other materials that authorities deem indecent or
 that assail the national culture.
 All domestically produced newspapers and radio and television are controlled by
 the Government. Local news in all media reflect government policy; however, foreign
 news reports, including those from Western sources, are usually translated without
 bias. In recent years the Government has relaxed efforts to control the flow of infor-
 mation from abroad, and Thai and Western newspapers and magazines have been
 sold in the towns where there is demand for them. The Government temporarily
 halted the import of Thai newspapers for several months in mid-1995. The Govern-
 ment makes no effort to discourage reception of Thai radio or television broadcasts,
 which are widely listened to and watched in the Mekong river valley, where the ma-
 jority of the Lao population lives. However, the Lao-language television station, a
 Thai company inaugurated in Vientiane in 1994, was quietly merged into the Lao
 State Broadcast Corporation following disputes concerning management control and
 content.
 The Government requires registration of television satellite receiving dishes and
 payment of a one-time licensing fee on their installation, but otherwise makes no
 effort to restrict their use. In 1995 the number of such dishes continued to increase,
 both in major urban areas and in remote provincial and district towns. Cable News
 Network, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and several Thai stations are
 among the many channels available to satellite dish owners.
 The Government prohibits pornographic or politically inflammatory video cas-
 settes. In late 1994, the Vientiane municipality imposed restrictions governing the
 content of music played in nightclubs and outlawed karaoke in order to strengthen
 Lao culture against perceived erosion by foreign influences. Enforcement of these re-
 strictions has-been lax.
 The Government restricts academic freedom. Lao academicians have in the pat
 sometimes been denied permission to travel abroad for conferences or training. Invi-
 tations to visit and collaborate with foreign colleagues must be aproved by the Lao
 employer and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Education must ap-
 prove grants including those for research and study abroad. The Government also
 monitors and may restrict the activities of Western scholars doing research in Laos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government controls and
 organizes most large public gatherings except for religious, athletic, and communal
 events. The Penal Code prohibits demonstrations or protest marches aimed at caus-
 
 
 657
 ig turmoil and social instability, prescribing  nalties of from 1 to 5 years' impris-
 onment. The Government also bans undef' destabilizing subversive activities."
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to organize and oin asso-
 ciations, all associations are party-controlled and disseminate official policy. For-
 eigners are not allowed to engge in political activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion.- The Constitution contains provisions for religious free-
 dom. In practice the Government continues to restrict freedom of religion, especially
 for some Christian denominations.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. Although the Government permits foreign nongovernmental or-
 ganizations with religious affiliations to work in Laos, it prohibits foreigners from
 proselytizing. The Government also restricts the import of religious publications.
 The enforcement of these regulations varies by province. For example, the Catho-
 lic Church is unable to operate in the highlands and much of the north, but Catho-
 lics can openly attend churches and chapels in central and southern Laos. Several
 Protestant denominations operate over 100 churches throughout the country. There
 continued to be credible reports that local authorities sometimes detained clergy for
 allegedly criticizing other religions and harassed, arrested, and jailed other active
 clergy. The persistence of such reports underscores the continuing suspicion on the
 part of authorities toward some sections of the Lao Christian community. There
 were also unconfirmed reports that Lao Christians were sometimes barred from the
 party or government employment, and that some rural Lao were not allowed to con-
 vert to the Baha'i faith.
 By comparison, the Government openly encourages Buddhism and supports Bud-
 dhist organizations. High-ranking government officials routinely attend religious
 functions, and Buddhist clergy are prominently featured at important state and
 party functions. The Government permits Buddhist festivals without hindrance.
 Two mosques and a Bahai center operate openly in Vientiane.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emiaration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no domestic travel restrictions for citizens and private foreign
 visitors except in unspecified prohibited or insecure areas. Most citizens can easily
 obtain passports and exit permits from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for personal
 travel abroad. Border crossing permits for citizens to visit Thailand are routinely
 available from local village committees for a modest issuance fee, and the Govern-
 ment does not appear to interfere with persons desiring to emigrate. Except for
 around 30 persons convicted in absentia in 1975 for antigovernment activities, citi-
 zens have the right of return.
 The stated government policy since 1977 is to welcome back the approximately
 10 percent of  e   ulation which fled after the change of government in 1975. In
 recent years an increasing number of Lao living abroad returned to visit; several
 remained to operate businesses.
 Laos, Thailand, and the UNHCR are cooperating on the return of the Lao asylum
 seekers in Thai camps who volunteer to return to Laos. This program includes pro-
 visions for monitoring returnees to ensure that they are given the same rights and
 treatment as resident Lao. According to the UNHCR and voluntary agencies, re-
 turnees are not subject to discrimination or persecution, and returnees are allowed
 back with all the belongings they accumulated while outside Laos. There were no
 forcible repatriations to Laos in 1995- however, approximately 3,000 Lao were vol-
 untarily repatriated to Laos by the UNHCR during the year. No new Lao asylum
 seekers arrived in Thailand.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government, despite constitutional
 prvisions for the public election of National Assembly members. While the 1991
 Constit tion does not explicitly exclude the emergence of multiple political parties,
 it assigns to the ruling LPRP the leading role in the Lao political system. All can-
 didates had to have the approval of the LPRP before they could stand for the De-
 cember 1992 National Assembly elections, no other parties were allowed, and voting
 was mandatory. However, not all candidates were LPRP members and a few
 nonparty candidates won seats.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women do not play a significant role
 in government. Only 8 of the 85 members of the National Assembly are women, the
 52-member LPRP Central Committee includes only 2 women, and there are no
 women in the Politburo or the Council of Ministers.
 Lowland Lao males dominate the upper echelons of the party and the Govern-
 ment. Nonetheless, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of
 the Interior and 23 members of the National Assembly are believed to be members
 
 
 658
 of ethnic minority groups. Members of these minorities often adopt lowland Lao
 names as they are increasingly assimilated into mainstream Lao society, thus mak-
 ing it difficult to ascertain accurately the number of ethnic minorities in any organi-
 zation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies would face seri-
 ous obstacles, if it were permitted to operate at all. Laos generally does not cooper-
 ate with international human rights organizations. The Government has, however,
 permitted visits by officials of international humanitarian organizations and re-
 sponded to inquiries about specific human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law for all Lao citizens
 without regard to sex, social status, education, faith, or ethnicity. Although the Gov-
 ernment appears willing to take action when cases of discrimination come to the at-
 tention of high-level officials, the legal mechanism whereby a citizen may bring
 charges of discrimination against an individual or organization is neither widely de-
 veloped nor widely understood among the general population.
 Women.-Although not widespread, domestic violence against women occurs. Sex-
 ual harassment and rape are reportedly rare. In cases of rape that do go to court,
 rapists are generally convicted.
 The Government relies on the Lao Women's Union, a party-sanctioned organiza-
 tion, and youth organizations to educate girls and young women against the
 schemes of recruiters for brothels and sweatshops in Thailand and elsewhere. In the
 past, the Government has prosecuted some persons for involvement in such recruit-
 ing activities and appears willing to take action against organized prostitution.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for women, and the Lao Women's
 Union operates nationally to promote the position of women in society. However,
 traditional culturally based discrimination persists, especially among lowland Lao
 and some hill tribes.
 Many women occupy responsible positions in the civil service and private busi-
 ness, and in urban areas their income is often higher than that of men. The Family
 Code prohibits legal discrimination in marriage and inheritance.
 Children.-Government expenditures are inadequate for children's basic health
 and educational needs, and Laos' limited resources do not suggest any rapid expan-
 sion of funds to meet those needs. Violence against other persons, including chil-
 dren, is prohibited by law. Physical abuse of children is reportedly rare.
 People With Disabilities.-With donor assistance, the Government is implement-
 ing limited programs for the disabled, especially amputees. The law does not man-
 date accessibility to buildings or government services for disabled persons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides for equal rights
 for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them. However, some
 societal discrimination persists.
 Approximately half the population is ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao," and
 most of the remainder is a mosaic of diverse upland hill tribes who are Lao citizens
 if born in Laos. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese minorities, particu-
 larly in the towns, and a small community of South Asian origin. The implementa-
 tion in 1994 of the 1990 Law on Nationality provided a means for these Vietnamese
 and Chinese minorities to regularize Lao citizenship. While the Government encour-
 ages the preservation of minority cultures and traditions, minority tribes have little
 voice in government decisions affecting their lands and the allocation of natural re-
 sources. Hill tribe interaction with the Government is limited by poor transportation
 and communication links and a shortage of government resources.
 The Hmong are one of the largest and most prominent highland minority groups.
 They split along clan lines during the Vietnam War; many were strongly anti-Com-
 munist while others sided with the Lao and Vietnamese Communists. The Govern-
 ment repressed many of those who fought against it, especially those still perceived
 to be resisting its authority. There continued to be some reports of abuse, discrimi-
 nation, and harassment of Hmong who live in or near areas where insurgent attacks
 have occurred. Nevertheless, an increasing number of Hmong who fled the country
 after 1975 have repatriated to Laos without suffering persecution.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociaton.-Although the Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to organize and join associations, the party controls all associations and all
 conform to official party policy (see Section 2.b.).
 Subsistence farmers comprise an estimated 85 percent of the work force. The
 State employs the majority of salaried workers, although this is changing as the
 Government reduces the number of its employees and privatizes state enterprises,
 and as foreign investors open new factories and businesses. Under the 1990 Labor
 Code, labor unions can be formed in private enterprises as long as they operate
 within the framework of the officially sanctioned Federation of Lao Trade Unions
 (FLTU), which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. Most of the FLTU's 80,000 mem-
 bers work in the public sector, overwhelmingly as public servants.
 Strikes are effectively, but not categorically, forbidden and none occurred in 1995.
 With advice from the International Labor Organization (ILO), including from a
 foreign expert posted by the ILO to work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel-
 fare, the Government has revised its Labor Code in an effort to clarify rights and
 obligat;ons of workers and employers. The extent to which the FLTU is free to en-
 gage in contacts and affiliate with foreign labor organizations is unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives of the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority residing in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. The incidence of labor disputes is low. The
 Government sets wages and salaries for government employees, while management
 sets wages and salaries for private business employees.
 The Labor Code stipulates that employers may not fire employees for conducting
 trade union activities or for lodging complaints against employers about labor law
 implementation or for cooperating with officials on labor law implementation and
 labor disputes. Workplace committees are one mechanism used for resolving com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Labor Code, children
 under age 15 may not be recruited for employment. However, many children help
 their families on farms or in shops. The Labor Code accordingly provides that
 younger children may work for their families, provided they are not engaged in dan-
 gerous or difficult work. Such employment of children is common in urban shops,
 but rare in industrial enterprises. The MOI and Ministry of Justice are responsible
 for enforcing these provisions, but enforcement is ineffective owing to a lack of in-
 spectors and other resources. Education is compulsory through the fifth grade, but
 this requirement is rarely observed'in the rural areas or among the urban poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code has provisions for a broad
 range of worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in dan-
 gerous activities), safe working conditions, and higher compensation for dangerous
 work. The Code also provides for at least 1 day of rest per week for employees. Em-
 ployers are responsible for all expenses for a worker injured or killed on the job,
 a requirement generally fulfilled by employers in the formal economic sector. The
 daily minimum wage is $1.09 (1,000 kip), which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Most civil servants also face the problem
 of inadequate pay. However, few families in the monetized economy depend on only
 one breadwinner. Some piecework employees, especially on construction sites, earn
 less than the minimum wage. Many of these workers are illegal immigrants, par-
 ticularly from Vietnam, and thus more vulnerable to exploitation by employers. Al-
 though workplace inspections have reportedly increased, the Ministry o Labor and
 Social Welfare lacks the personnel and budgetary resources to enforce the Labor
 Code effectively.
 The Labor Code has no specific provision allowing workers to remove themselves
 from a dangerous situation without jeopardizing their employment.
