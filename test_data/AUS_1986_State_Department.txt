 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a longstanding, multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy operating within a federal system of government.
 The next federal elections must be held before March 1988.
 Australia's developed industrial economy, with important
 mining and agricultural sectors, provides most Australians
 with a high per capita income. Furthermore, the Government
 provides assistance for the minority of relatively
 disadvantaged citizens. Individuals are free to hold private
 property, to pursue their economic interests, and to organize
 trade unions.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. The Government makes a major effort to
 investigate reports of discrimination. Protection of the
 rights of Australia's approximately 180,000 Aboriginals is a
 demonstrated concern of the Government, which recognizes that
 they are the group in Australia most disadvantaged
 economically and by societal discrimination, currently and
 historically.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 Australian political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is respected. Prison conditions are good.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. Australia has
 ratified and fully respects International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 105 concerning forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to both a fair hearing and
 a fair public trial with an unimpeded right of counsel. Free
 counsel is provided to indigents accused of crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Australia is a
 nation of liberal political traditions and common law, and the
 Government does not interfere with the privacy of family,
 home, or correspondence.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A functioning democratic political system, an effective
 judiciary, and a large, diverse, and independent press combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While Australia does not have a Bill of Rights, it is a
 signatory to the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of assembly and
 expression.
 Australian law and practice afford workers great freedom to
 establish and to join trade unions, to choose their union
 representatives, to formulate union programs, and to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes with employers. Unions are extremely active and
 powerful. Industrial disputes are arbitrated by a system of
 industrial courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion. A provision in the
 Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state
 religion. Australians are free to practice what religion they
 choose and to maintain links with coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia, including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians participate in their government by electing a
 two-chamber Federal Parliament as well as numerous state and
 local bodies. Voting is compulsory in general elections for
 Australians 18 years of age and over.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is the Government's policy to respond to any communication
 it might receive from the United Nations alleging any
 violation of human rights in Australia. The Government also
 allows unimpeded access to all international and
 nongovernmental groups investigating alleged human rights
 violations.
 Internationally, Australia has been active in promoting human
 rights as a member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission, the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous
 Populations, and in other forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Australia's people have equal access to government services
 without reference to race, sex, religion, language, or social

 status. Basic food, shelter, health care, education, and
 social security benefits are guaranteed for all. Australian
 law prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, color,
 descent, or national or ethnic origin under the Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975.
 The Government acknowledges that the Aboriginal population is
 the most disadvantaged group in such areas as education,
 housing, health, and employment. It has a broad range of
 programs aimed at providing Aboriginals services available to
 other Australians, plus additional services to improve their
 socioeconomic conditions. Aboriginal land rights remain a
 controversial issue. The present Federal Government is
 committed to some form of land rights justice, preferably
 implemented by state legislation. It does not intend to
 proceed with national land rights legislation at this time.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. The minimum wage is
 reviewed every 6 months by the Federal Arbitration and
 Conciliation Commission with this in mind. A complex body of
 regulations and Commission decisions prescribes the 40-hour
 (often 38-hour) week, paid vacations, and health and safety
 standards in the workplace, as well as other benefits, for the
 overwhelming majority of Australian workers. Australia is in
 the forefront of countries adopting regulations protecting
 children from dangerous or unsuitable employment.
 Women constitute 39.5 percent of the Australian work force.
 Although women are beginning to enter jobs previously occupied
 only by men, they remain concentrated in a narrow range of
 occupations predominantly occupied by females, characterized
 by relatively low pay and low status. In 1986 the Government
 passed affirmative action legislation obliging employers to
 take corrective action where there is underrepresentation of
 women employees.
