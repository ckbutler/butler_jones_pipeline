 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule. The
 reigning monarch is Queen Margrethe II. A cabinet headed by
 the Prime Minister and accountable to the unicameral Folketing
 (parliament) has responsibility for government decisions.
 Since late 1982, Denmark has been governed by a four-party
 minority coalition led by Prime Minister Schlueter's
 Conservative Party. The coalition is dependent on support
 from other parties to maintain a parliamentary majority.
 The Danes have a free market economy with an extensive system
 of welfare protection for all citizens.
 Human rights are highly respected and well protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. The Constitution
 established the Folketing's Ombudsman, to whom any citizen may
 protest if he or she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated by
 any Danish national or municipal authority. Denmark also has
 a high degree of concern for the rights of minorities,
 particularly the indigenous populations of territories such as
 Greenland and Faroe Islands, which now enjoy broad powers of
 home rule. At the global level, Denmark participates actively
 in several international commissions concerned with the
 protection and preservation of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions did not
 occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Protection against torture and inhuman treatment is assured by
 law and respected in practice. A rehabilitation and research
 center for torture victims established in 1983 in Copenhagen
 treats patients in the refugee community. An estimated 150
 foreign torture victims obtain asylum yearly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 No person in Denmark can be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge has
 the authority to determine whether the person should be held
 in custody or released pending trial. The Constitution makes
 provision for bail. .Arrested persons have access to legal
 counsel of their choice or court-appointed attorneys.
 Non-Danish speakers are provided with interpreters at
 government expense. The occasional use of solitary
 confinement during the pretrial custody period has been
 criticized in the media, but police authorities maintain that
 the isolation system continues to be used only in cases
 involving the most serious crimes,.such as narcotics
 violations.

 DENMARK
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally public; judges are allowed to make
 exceptions to this rule only in certain circumstances, such as
 paternity and divorce trials. In criminal cases, trials are
 only closed when it is necessary to protect the privacy of the
 victim, such as in rape or child molestation cases, or when it
 is deemed necessary to protect the identity of a witness. To
 ensure a fair trial, Danish courts make extensive efforts to
 obtain the facts of a case, and the rights of the accused are
 carefully protected. All indigent defendants have the right
 to a court-appointed attorney at government expense. The
 defendant is free to change the court-appointed attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, searches of the home, seizure and
 examination of papers, and breaches of the secrecy of
 communications are prohibited in the absence of a judicial
 order, unless a particular exception is provided for by
 statute. These provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark has a free and open society. A person may express an
 opinion in written or oral form on any matter, subject to the
 condition that he or she may be held responsible in a court of
 law if there are charges of libel or malicious slander. Media
 representatives and private persons make full use of the
 freedom of expression. Criticism of the Government or
 government policy is not a punishable offense, and censorship
 is not practiced.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings or demonstrations which could constitute a
 danger to the public peace.
 Under the general agreement of 1960, workers and employers
 acknowledged each other's right to organize. Workers have the
 right to strike and bargain collectively. Labor agreements
 and legislation protect the rights of workers and employers
 and regulate the work environment. Approximately 85 percent
 of Danish wage earners are members of trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is
 recognized as the established church of Denmark. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all residents. No one may
 be discriminated against because of religious beliefs. These
 laws are strictly enforced in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel and to reenter Denmark.
 Denmark is a homogeneous ethnocentric society with
 
 
 895
 -DENMARK
 historically only a small number of nonnorthern European
 residents. However, these non-Danish residents have been
 accorded a high level of acceptance. Refugees and asylum
 seekers are provided with travel documents, when needed, which
 permit return to Denmark. Forced repatriation is not utilized.
 The Alien Act of 1983 spells out in detail the rights of
 aliens in Denmark and provides for appeal procedures when
 residence permission is denied.
 Since 1983 there has been a massive influx of asylum seekers.
 Over 20,000 people have asked for asylum (mostly Sri Lankan
 Tamils, Iranians, and Lebanese). Measures designed to protect
 the rights of potential refugees or asylum seekers include the
 establishment of a Refugee Board with authority to reverse
 decisions of the Alien Directorate and guaranteed access to
 legal counsel and interpreter service.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Prime Minister is appointed by the reigning monarch after
 consultation with the political parties represented in the
 Folketing. The 179 members of the Folketing are elected in
 free and open elections under a complex system of proportional
 representation designed to protect the rights of minority
 parties and to reflect the popular vote. Every Danish citizen
 18 years or over may vote. A political party must obtain at
 least 2 percent of the total vote to obtain representation in
 the Folketing. Nine political parties with a variety of
 political beliefs are currently represented. The Constitution
 states that parliamentary elections must be held at least
 every 4 years. The Government can be changed in an election
 or, as happened in 1982, by the resignation of the government
 in power and the formation of a new government composed of
 parties already represented in the Folketing.
 All Danish citizens and subjects are guaranteed equal
 protection under the law. The territories of Greenland and
 the Faroe Islands have home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. Native
 Greenlanders enjoy all the rights and privileges of other
 Danish citizens. In addition, Greenland and Faroe
 representation in the national Folketing is proportionally
 larger than that for continental Denmark, and Greenland has a
 special criminal code designed for local customs and
 conditions. Native Greenlanders freely participate in
 international ethnic organizations such as the Inuit
 Circumpolar Conference, based in Greenland, which has been
 recognized by the United Nations. Despite periodic
 disagreements between home rule authorities and the
 Government, there have been no formal accusations of human
 rights violations made against the Government.
 Section 4 Novernmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no complaints or requests for investigation of
 human rights violations.
 In September 1987, a Human Rights Center, mandated by the
 Folketing, was established as a private, government-funded
 institution to conduct research and provide information on a
 broad range of human rights issues.. Denmark is a party to
 various international human rights conventions designed to
 
 
 DENMARK
 promote and protect human rights. The Government's commitment
 to human rights issues is fully supported by the Danish
 population, as shown in opinion polls.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 The growing number of ethnically dissimilar refugees who
 require shelter, education, and public assistance has created
 pressure on the Danish welfare system and contributed to a
 rise in tensions between native Danes and refugee and
 immigrant groups. Although some opposition politicians have
 suggested that aliens be obliged to assimilate, Danish
 political leaders emphasize the need for Danish tolerance of
 the newcomers' culture and religion.
 The living standards and educational levels of native
 Greenlanders (Eskimos) are lower than those of other Danish
 citizens, but they are improving steadily, in part because of
 heavy spending on housing, health, and education programs by
 the Government.
 The Equal Rights Council has worked successfully to eliminate
 laws and regulations which contained sex discrimination
 provisions. In nonagricultural activities, women's average
 wages in 1985 were about 84 percent of those of men. Women
 hold positions of authority at all levels of society and
 actively participate at all levels of the political process.
 They are in positions of authority in political parties, local
 governments, and in the national Government. Women head three
 cabinet ministries and hold 28 seats in the Parliament.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage, but the lowest wage level set in any
 national labor negotiation is approximately the equivalent of
 $6.40 per hour. Denmark is now taking steps to reduce the
 standard workweek from 40 to 39 hours. The "ll-hour rule"
 stipulates that any worker has the right to rest for 11 hours
 before the start of the next day's work.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, and
 specific limitations described in detail in the Working
 Environment Act of 1975 apply to the type of work which may be
 performed by those between 15 and 18 years of age. This act
 also describes acceptable conditions of work, including safety
 and health; the general duties of employers, supervisors,
 employees, and suppliers; the performance of work; rest
 periods and rest days; and medical examinations. The act
 establishes a Directorate of Labor Inspections which ensures
 effective compliance with labor legislation.
