 ITALY
 Italy is a longstanding, multiparty parliamentary democracy. Executive authority
 is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by the president of the council (the
 Prime Minister). The Head of State (President of the Republic) nominates the Prime
 Minister after consulting with leaders of all political forces in Parliament. Par-
 liament was elected in free and democratic elections in April 1996. The judiciary is
 independent, but critics complain that some judges are politicized.
 The armed forces are under the control of the Government and Parliament. Four
 separate police forces report to different ministerial or local authorities. Under ex-
 ceptional circumstances, the Government may call on the army to provide internal
 security. For several years, the army has supported the police in general guard du-
 ties in Sicily and in the province of Naples, both of which are areas with high levels
 of organized crime, to free police officers for investigations and related work. The
 army left Naples at the end of 1997 and left Sicily by the end of the year. There
 were a number of credible reports that some members of the security forces commit-
 ted abuses.
 Italy has an advanced, industrialized market economy, and the standard of living
 is high. Small and midsized companies employ from 70 to 80 percent of the work
 force. Major products include machinery, textiles, apparel, transportation equip-
 ment, and food and agricultural products. The Government owns a substantial num-
 ber of enterprises in finance, communications, industry, transportation, and serv-
 ices, but privatization is moving forward at a measured pace.
 The Government respects the human rights of its citizens. The law and the judici-
 ary generally provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 However, there were problems in some areas. There continued to be reports of police
 abuse of detainees; such accusations are investigated by the judiciary. Despite the
 Government's approval of a law to reduce the number of inmates and the reform
 of judicial procedures to speed up trials, prisons continue to be overcrowded, and
 the pace ojustice remains slow. Lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. Societal
 discrimination against women and discrimination and sporadic violence against im-
 migrants and other foreigners continue to be problems. The Government has taken
 steps to combat child abuse and violence against women. Child labor persists in the
 underground economy but is investigated actively.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel or degrading punishment. However, there were
 some reports of abuse by police. Amnesty International (AI), the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), the United Nations Committee Against Tor-
 ture, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, and the Council of Europe's Commit-
 tee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) have reported instances in which police
 
 
 1316
 abused detainees, commonly at the, time of arrest or- during the- first 24 hours in
 custody, before detainees saw, an .attorney or a.judicial authority. Examples of mis-
 treatment include insults, -particularly those aimed at aliens or Roma, kicking,
 --punching, beatings with-batons, or deprivation of food. A high proportion of these
 -cases involved non-European union immigrants (mostly Africans), Roma, and per-
 sons held in connection with drug-related offenses. The U.N. Committee, the
 UNHRC, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, and Caritas have expressed con-
 cern over a possible trend towards racism. Amnesty International (AI), the UNHRC
 and the U.N. Committee have noted that, although authorities routinely investigate
 complaints of mistreatment in detention, some of the investigations lack thorough-
 ness. The U.N. Committee and the UNHRC also have questioned whether appro-
 priate sanctions were imposed on those found guilty. The CPT and the UNHRC
 have recommended that the authorities take more effective steps to safeguard de-
 tainees and inmates from mistreatment.
 In July the U.N. Human Rights Committee examined Italy's fourth periodic report
 on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
 (ICCPR) and released its findings. Reporting on action taken against torture and
 cruel or degrading punishment, government representatives stated that during the
 reporting period, criminal proceedings had been initiated against several hundred
 police and Carabinieri officers within the prison service. Criminal proceedings were
 initiated against 122 wardens who were accused of offenses against prisoners, which
 fall within a broad definition of torture. Cases currently before the courts concern
 accusations of physical injury and abuse of disciplinary or correctional procedures.
 The U.N. Committee recommended that a specific definition of and statement on the
 illegality of torture be included in Italian law.
 In August 1997, the Gallo Commission released its report on the 1992-93 U.N.
 peacekeeping operations in Somalia, which found that, in eight cases, human rights
 violations had been committed by rank-and-file soldiers. Midlevel and high-ranking
 officers were found remiss in their duties for being unaware of the actions of sol-
 diers under their command. The Commission urged that military authorities im-
 prove human rights training for conscripts and recommended that magistrates and
 experts on international human rights standards accompany troops during future
 peacekeeping missions. The Commission reopened its inquiry when further accusa-
 tions surfaced concerning human rights violations by Italian troops in Somalia, ac-
 companied by claims that high-ranking army officers did not intervene to prevent
 them. Its second report was released in late May with no further findings. However,
 one Somali witness heard by the Commission was arrested and charged as a suspect
 in the 1993 murder of Italian journalist Ilaria Alpi.
 Despite the construction of new facilities, the prison population continues to ex-
 ceed planned capacity by over 15 percent. In an attempt to remedy overcrowding,
 Parliament passed a law in May allowing persons sentenced to less than 3 years'
 imprisonment to apply for an alternative penalty within a period of 30 days after
 final sentencing. Overcrowding creates problems of poor sanitation and strains med-
 ical services. The law allows judges to release prisoners whose incarceration would
 prevent their access to appropriate treatment or endanger the health of other in-
 mates. AIDS is a major problem. More than 29 percent of the prison population is
 addicted to illegal drugs; of those, 13.6 percent are HIV positive. (A total of 5.8 per-
 cent of those who are HIV positive have AIDS). There were 55 suicides in 1997,
 compared with 45 in 1996.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards; however, the Govern-
 ment permits the independent monitoring of prison conditions by parliamentarians,
 local human rights groups, the media, and other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Detainees are allowed prompt and regu-
 lar access to lawyers of their choosing (although occasional lapses in this general
 rule have been alleged) and to family members. If detainees are indigent, the State
 provides a lawyer. Within 24 hours of being detained, the examining magistrate
 must decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed to an arrest. The inves-
 tigating judge then has 48 hours in which to confirm the arrest and recommend
 whether the case goes to trial. In exceptional circumstances, usually in cases of or-
 ganized crime figures, where there is danger  a attorneys may attempt to tamper
 with evidence, the investigating judge may take up to 5 days to interrogate the ac-
 cused before the accused is allowed to contact an attorney. The U.N. Human Rights
 Committee (ICCPR) recommended that this 5-day period be reduced and that all de-
 tainees have access to legal advice immediately upon arrest.
 Preventive detention can be imposed only as a last resort, or if there is clear and
 convincing evidence of a serious offense, such as crimes involving the Mafia, or
 those related to drugs, arms, or subversion. In these cases, a maximum of 2 years
 of preliminary investigation is permitted. Except in extraordinary situations, pre-
 
 
 1317
 ventive custody is not permitted for pregnant women, single parents of children
 under 3 years of age, persons over 70 years of age, or those who are seriously ill.
 Preventive custody can be imposed only for crimes punishable by a maximum sen-
 tence of not less than 4 years.
 Magistrates' interrogations of persons in custody must be recorded on audio tape
 or video tape to be admissible in judicial proceedings. Prosecutors are required to
 include all evidence favorable to the accused in requests for preventive detention.
 The defense may present any favorable evidence directly to the court.
 There is no provision for bail, but judges may grant provisional liberty to suspects
 awaiting trial. As a safeguard against unjustified detention, panels of judges (liberty
 tribunals) review cases of persons awaiting trial and rule whether continued deten-
 tion is warranted. Despite these measures, 44 percent of inmates were awaiting
 trial or the outcome of appeals, rather than serving final sentences. The Constitu-
 tion and law provide for restitution in cases of unjust detention.
 The law prohibits punishment by internal exile or exile abroad.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair judicial process.
 There are three levels of courts. There are three separate lower courts: The Prae-
 tor Court (offenses punishable by monetary fines or less than 4 years imprison-
 ment); the Court of Assizes (offenses punishable by more than 24 years' imprison-
 ment); ind the Tribunal Court (offenses that fall between the jurisdiction of the
 praetor and assizes courts). The Assizes Court of Appeals hears appeals from all
 three lower courts. Decisions of the Assizes Court of Appeals can be appealed to the
 highest court, the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court) in Rome.
 The law provides for trials to be fair and public, and the authorities observe these
 provisions. The law grants defendants the presumption of innocence. Defendants
 have access to an attorney sufficiently in advance to prepare a defense and can con-
 front witnesses. All government-held evidence is normally made available to defend-
 ants and their attorneys. Defendants can appeal verdicts to the highest 'appellate
 court.
 Cumbersome procedures slow the pace of justice. The National Statistical Insti-
 tute (ISTAT) reported the average duration of lower court trials (civil cases) at 3
 years and 4 months. The length of trials varies by region; those in the north are
 shorter than those in the south. The UNHRC report also noted that provisions of
 the ICCPR concerning promptness of trials were not always respected, citing the
 case of 10 police officers charged in 1990 in connection with the 1985 death of a
 man following severe mistreatment in a police station. Since 1990 the case has been"
 tried, appealed, and retried several times. In 1997* the Court of Cassation ordered
 another retrial and the case is still open.
 To speed up judicial proceedings,. a decree-law implemented in February allows
 cases involving crimes punishable by less than 20 years' imprisonment to be tried
 before a single judge.-                                -
 Since 1991 public prosecutors have conducted sweeping investigations of corrup-
 tion among the political and economic elites, and in the judiciary. These inquiries
 still have considerable public support. However, critics complain that some inves-
 tigating magistrates are influencedby political or other interests in choosing targets
 of inquiry, or fail to show adequate respect for the rights of suspects, for example,
 making excessive use of preventive detention (see Section 1.d.). The UNHRC report
 noted that lengthy preventive detention (which in certain serious offenses is per-
 mitted for up to 6 years) may constitute a violation of the right to a presumption
 of innocence and the principle of a prompt and fair trial. However, a recent decision
 of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the 31-month preventive deten-
 tion of a person accused of collusion with an organized crime organization was law-
 ful.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect this provision.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant
 and in carefully defined circumstances. Violations are subject to legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 strict the right of peaceful assembly, including protests against government policies,
 
 
 1318
 
 except in cases where national security or public safety is at risk. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations must notify the po-
 lice in advance. Professional associations, organize and operate freely. While allow-
 ing general freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit clandestine as-
 sociations, those that pursue political aims through force, that incite racial, ethnic
 or religious discrimination, or that advocate fascism.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right The Government subsidized several religions
 through tax revenue collection. Taxpayers who choose to do so can donate a percent-
 age of their income tax payment to the Roman Catholic, Adventist, Waldensian,
 Baptist, and Lutheran churches, the Assembly of God or the Jewish community.
 Other religious groups, including Buddhists and Muslims, have initiated necessary
 procedures to obtain this status.
 Nontraditional religious groups are free to practice their beliefs and proselytize,
 provided that they respect public order and general moral standards. In August
 1997 the Court of Cassation annulled a lower court decision that Scientology was
 not a religion, finding that the-lower court was not competent to rule on what con-
 stitutes a religion. The Court of Cassation further found that the issue of whether
 Scientology constitutes a religion must be readdressed by another court of appeal,
 in accordance with criteria established by the Constitutional Court.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in public schools as an optional
 subject. Students who do not opt to attend can elect to take an alternative course,
 or in some schools, have a free class period.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and- the"Government
 respects them in practice. Citizens who leave are ensured the right toreturn. The
 Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations assisting refugees. It provides first asylum to ref-
 ugees fleeing hostilities or natural disasters. Such refugees are granted temporary
 residence permits, which must be renewed periodically and do not ensure future
 permanent residence.
 The Commission on Foreigners in Italy estimates that there are hundreds of thou-
 sands- irregular foreigners in Italy. As of August 31, there were 28,612 foreigners
 temporarily residing in Italy for humanitarian reasons; 2,780 are in the process of
 requesting asylum. As of the-same date, 582 persons had been granted political asy-
 lum.
 Political asylum -is obtained according to the 1951 U.N., Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees. Amnesty International has noted that-Italy still lacks a spe-
 cific law on political asylum, but there is one pending before.Parliament..The immi-
 gration law passed in February levies high fines and penalties for-land,-air, and sea
 carriers that board passengers without documentation. There is-also a bill pending
 before Parliament that would require asylum seekers to possess identity-documents.
 - After his arrival in Italy in November, PKK leader Abdulan Ocalan -filed a request
 for political asylum. It is being processed through normal judicial- channels. A deci-
 sion is expected towards the end of February 1999.
 There were no reports of the forced expulsion of any person having a valid claim
 to refugee status.
 - TheGovernment finished closing the camps that had housed Albanian refugees.
 There are ,20 processing centers for persons claiming refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for-Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides, citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise thisright in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basisof-universal suffrage.
 There are -no restrictions on women's participation in government and politics.
 However, few- women hold elected -office: -Women hold 6 of 25 cabinet positions, 24
 of 325 Senate seats, and 69 of 630 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. A new associa-
 tion for women, EMILY Italia, was-founded recently to promote increased participa-
 tion of-women in politics.
 Section 4.. Governmental Attitude-Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation 6fAlleged- Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human.rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human-rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and. responsive-to -their views.
 
 
 1319
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex (except with regard to
 hazardous work), religion, ethnic background, or political opinion and provides some
 protection against discrimination based on disability, language, or social status.
 owever, societal discrimination persists to some degree.
 Women.-Legislation to protect women from physical abuse, including by family
 members, was updated and strengthened in 1996. The revised law makes the pros-
 ecution of perpetrators of violence against women easier and shields women who
 have been objects of attack from publicity.
 The law treats spousal rape the same as any other rape. Media reports of violence
 against women are common. An investigation conducted by the Rome police and the
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) Telefono Rosa reported 6,522 cases of domes-
 tic violence against women in Rome in 1997. In its annual report on violence against
 women, Telefono Rosa stated that 55.5 percent of the cases reported nationally in-
 cluded physical violence, an increase of 9.5 percent over the previous 2 years. Law
 enforcement and judicial authorities are not reluctant to bring perpetrators of vio-
 lence against women to justice, but victims sometimes do not press charges due to
 fear, shame or ignorance of the law. The Telefono Rosa report noted that the entry
 of more women into the police force has contributed greatly to increased cooperation
 by female victims of violence. The Government provides a hot line through which
 abused women can obtain legal, medical and other assistance. Women's associations
 also maintain several shelters for battered women.
 Telefono Rosa reported that sexual harassment in the workplace decreased in
 1997 and concluded that ad hoc provisions against sexual harassment in national
 labor contracts worked as a deterrent in both the public and private sectors.
 The media often report cases of trafficking in foreign women for the purpose of
 prostitution. The women (as well as their exploiters) are usually illegal immigrants
 and often reluctant to contact the police. Based on information from NGO s, the
 Ministry of Equal Opportunity estimates that 25,000 illegal immigrant women are
 engaged in prostitution in Italy, more than 5,000 of whom are exploited by traffick-
 ers. Prostitution itself is not illegal, but police can make arrests on charges of profit-
 ing from or exploiting the prostitution of others, which are criminal offenses. The
 February immigration bill provided an avenue of escape from traffickers by granting
 1-year residence/work permits to women who turn in their exploiters.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage, property, and inheritance
 rights. Males and females enjoy equal access and treatment with regard to edu-
 cation, health, and other government services. Many NGO's actively and effectively
 promote women's rights. Most are affiliated with labor unions or political parties.
 A number of government offices work to ensure women's rights. The Ministry for
 Equal Opportunity is headed by a woman. In addition, there is an equal opportunity
 commission in the office of the Prime Minister. The Labor Ministry has a similar
 commission that focused on women's rights and discrimination in the workplace, as
 well as equal opportunity counselors who deal with this problem at the national,
 regional, and provincial government levels. However, many counselors have limited
 resources with which to work.
 In 1997 the European Court of Justice found that a 1977 law that sought to pro-
 tect women from hazardous work, such as work in mines, quarries, and tunnels and
 work on night shifts, is in noncompliance with the European Union directive on this
 issue. In response, a proposed bill before Parliament contains provisions that revise
 the prohibitions on night shift work for women. The bill was passed by the Chamber
 of Deputies and is now before the Senate. Liberal maternity leave, introduced to
 benefit women, does add to the cost of employing them, with the result that employ-
 ers sometimes find it advantageous to hire men instead.
 According to research conducted by the CGIL Labor Institute, women's salaries
 are 20 percent lower than men's for comparable work. They are underrepresented
 in many fields, such as management and the professions. Women experience unem-
 ployment at a higher rate than men and their participation rate in the labor force
 is lower. Data for 1998 released by the ISTAT shows that while male unemployment
 was 9.4 percent, female unemployment was 16.8 percent.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare. Schooling is compulsory from age 7 to age 14. The dropout rate
 is high in middle and secondary school. On the average, oniy 56 students graduate
 from secondary school out of each 100 who enrolled in primary school 12 years ear-
 lier. Abuse of children is recognized as a societal problem. Social workers counsel
 abused children and are authorized to take action to protect them. The NGO
 Telefono Azzurro maintains two toll-free hot lines for reporting incidents of child
 abuse.
 
 
 1320
 
 Research conducted on behalf of the Government by a private institute estimated
 that the number of minors involved in cases of violence (including prostitution) was
 10,000 to 12,000. There were 1,880 to 2,500 minor-age street prostitutes, of whom
 1,500 to 2,300 were illegal immigrants, predominantly Albanians, and some Nige-
 rians. An estimated 90 percent of violence against minors is committed within their
 own families.
 In August the Parliament passed a law to combat. pedophilia, child pornography,
 the possession of pornographic material involving children, sex tourism involving
 minors, and the trafficking of minors. The law provides severe penalties, including
 up to 20 years' imprisonment for violence against minors younger than age 14 and
 for trafficking in minors, even if committed outside of Italy.
 People With Disabilities.-The law forbids discrimination against disabled persons
 in employment, education, or in the provision of state services. The law requires en-
 terprises with more than 35 employees to hire the disabled to staff 15 percent of
 their work force, directs that public buildings be made accessible to persons with
 disabilities, and stipulates a number of specific rights for the disabled. Compliance
 with these requirements, however, is still incomplete.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Immigrants and other foreigners face soci-
 etal discrimination. Some are subjected to physical attack. Roma encounter difficul-
 ties in finding places to reside. There are 60,000 to 80,000 citizens who are Roma.
 Sedentary Roma have more success in receiving equal treatment in the workplace
 and in the housing-market. Nomadic Roma tend to live in camps and to have more
 difficulty in these areas. Immigrant Roma (45,000 to 60,000), predominantly from
 the former Yugoslav states often are precluded from obtaining residence or work
 permits because they do not possess valid identity documents from their country of
 origin and can be deported. With no legal source of income available, they often turn
 to begging or petty crime. The interests of the Roma are represented by over 130
 nonprofit organizations, which, however, have funding difficulties.
 Racism Survey, an organization located in Milan, compiles a record of racist inci-
 dents. According to this group, in 1997 there were 668 cases of racial discrimination,
 violence, and intolerance. Other NGO's, such as Caritas, provide a broad range of
 assistance to immigrants throughout the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides. for the right to establish trade
 unions, join unions, and carry out union activities in the workplace. Some 40 per-
 cent of the workforce is organized. Trade unions are free of government controls and
 no longer have formal ties with political parties. The right to strike is embodied in
 the Constitution and is frequently exercised. A 1990 law restricts strikes affecting
 essential public services such as transport, sanitation, and health. Nonetheless, dur-
 ing a year in -which the overall number of work-hours lost to labor disputes was rel-
 atively low, strikes occurred in several public service sectors, especially air and
 ground transportation.
 Unions associate freely, with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and these rights are re-
 spected in, practice. By custom, although not by law; national collective bargaining
 agreements apply to all workers, regardless of union affiliation. The law prohibits
 discrimination by employers against union members and organizers. It requires em-
 ployers that have more than 15 employees and who are found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination to reinstate any workers affected. In firms with less than 15 workers,
 an employer must provide the grounds for firing a union employee in writing. If a
 judge deems the grounds spurious, he- can- order the employer, to reinstate or com-
 pensate the worker.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and generally it does not occur.
 However, some illegal immigrants and children were forced into prostitution (see
 Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 forbids the employment of children under age 15 (with some limited exceptions).
 There are also specific restrictions on employment in hazardous or unhealthful occu-
 pations for men under age 18, and women under age 21. The enforcement of mini-
 mum age laws is difficult in the extensive underground economy. The leader of the
 largest labor union estimates that there were 300,000 incidents of child labor, the
 majority-involving immigrants, but cases involving Italian children also have been
 reported in the press.
 
 
 1321
 Following the United Nations-sponsored Oslo International Conference in Novem-
 ber 1997, the Government, employers associations, and unions signed a charter in
 April that included: The extension of compulsory education from 14 to 15years of
 age; better enforcement of school attendance regulations; programs to reduce the
 number of school dropouts; more prompt assistance to families in financial difficulty;
 further restrictions on exceptions to the minimum age law; cancellation of all eco-
 nomic incentives or administrative incentives for companies found to make use of
 child labor, including abroad. The Prime Minister's office provided a toll-free tele-
 hone number to report incidents of child labor. The footwear and textile industries
 ave established a code of conduct that prohibits the use of child labor in their
 international as well as national activities, applicable to subcontractors as well. The
 law forbids forced or bonded labor involving children, and the Government generally
 enforces this prohibition effectively. However, some children were forced into pros-
 titution (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are not set by law, but rather
 by collective bargaining agreements. These specifyr minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform. When an employer and a union fail
 to reach an agreement, courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of
 practice in comparable activities or agreements.
 A 1997 law reduced the legal workweek to 40 hours from 48. Most collective
 agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour workweek. The average contractual work-
 week is 39 hours but is actually less in many industries. Overtime work may not
 exceed 2 hours per day or an average of 12 hours per week.
 The law sets basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation
 for on-the-job injuries. European union directives on health and safety have been
 also incorporated into the law; some provisions have already taken effect and others
 were phased in during 1997. Labor inspectors are from the public health service or
 from the Ministry of Labor. They are few in number, given the scope of their respon-
 sibilities. Courts impose fines and sometimes prison terms for violation of health
 and safety laws. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without jeopardy to their continued employment.
