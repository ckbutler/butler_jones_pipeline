 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy led by a constitutional
 monarch. As a Western democracy, Luxembourg insures that human
 rights are respected at home and works actively to promote them
 internationally. The country's economy is that of a highly
 developed industrialized state with a free enterprise system.
 Luxembourg continues efforts to treat women equally and its
 large foreign population fairly, and to engage labor unions in
 the decisionmaking process, together with management and
 government. The judicial and penal systems are fair and
 nondiscriminatory. The integrity of the person and civil and
 political rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and are
 protected in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Killing for political motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations for other motives is unKnown in
 Luxembourg. There are no indigenous terrorist organizations in
 the country. The one terrorist act which occurred during the
 past year (a failed bomb attempt against the Turkish Embassy)
 was believed to be the work of Armenian organizations based
 outside Luxembourg'.
 b. Disappearance
 Official abduction or secret arrest does not occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not practiced. Treatment of
 prisoners is exemplary. Prisoners have free choice of attorneys
 and are allowed visitors. A new modern prison for the entire
 country has been constructed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no prisoners in Luxembourg who are being detained in
 disregard of generally accepted principles. Habeas corpus is
 respected. Preventive detention does not exist. The law
 permits detention without charge for up to 24 hours following
 arrest. Persons can be ordered kept in jail pending trial, if
 so ordered by a judge. Exile is unknown in Luxembourg.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary, free from executive or
 military interference. Defendants have the right to legal
 counsel. They are charged no later than 24 hours after arrest.
 Charges are formally and clearly stated. There are military
 courts, but civilians are not subject to their jurisdiction.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 
 (1040)

 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to enter a
 private home. No forced entry has been alleged. Luxembourg's
 statutes prohibit other violations of the home such as
 electronic survaillance. Private correspondence is universally
 respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, religion,
 and assembly. Except for restrictions against pornography,
 there is no media censorship. There are neither intimidation
 nor threats by the Government against individuals or media that
 criticize, and the Government does not interfere with academic
 inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate, and strike,
 although by tradition strikes are rare in Luxembourg. Unions
 participate in a tripartite arrangement with government and
 management in the decisionmaking process on major economic
 issues. Virtually the entire work force is unionized. Unions
 and professional groups freely maintain contacts with
 international bodies in their fields. There are no limitations
 on orderly public meetings. No groups are denied or restricted
 free assembly.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion, and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of minority religions.
 However, the population is statistically 99 percent Roman
 Catholic, and this faith is deeply intertwined with the
 conservative culture of the country. Thus, a Roman Catholic
 consensus often surfaces on social issues; e.g., there is no
 Government funding for abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions regarding movement within
 Luxembourg, foreign travel, or emigration and repatriation.
 There are no barriers to potential immigrants from the European
 Community (EC) countries. The status of citizens of Spain and
 Portugal in Luxembourg (once admitted) is guaranteed by
 bilateral agreements and is identical to that accorded citizens
 of the EC--they cannot be deported. As far as Luxembourg's
 policy of admitting refugees, while it is not a country of first
 application, Luxembourg officials believe that, on a per capita
 basis within the EC, relatively liberal numbers of refugees have
 been admitted (notably Vietnamese).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 National elections are held every five years. In the elections
 of 1979, voter participation was 93 percent. The 59-member
 
 
 1042
 Chamber of Deputies is composed of members of seven political
 parties, elected on the basis of proportional representation.
 All citizens at least 18 years of age can vote. Luxembourg's
 sizable foreign resident population (26 percent) does not have
 the right to vote, although it enjoys the rights of free speech,
 press, assembly, movement, and religion, and may join
 organizations like labor unions which exert considerable
 indirect influence on the political process. Significant
 numbers of women hold political office, including the Foreign
 Minister and the Mayor of Luxembourg.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Luxembourg Governments have consistently supported international
 and non-governmental investigation of alleged violations, and
 the U.N. High Commission for Refugees has representatives in
 Luxembourg. Luxembourg is a strong advocate for the respect of
 human rights and consistently supports human rights in the
 Council of Europe, the EC, and the U.N. Freedom House rates
 Luxembourg *free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Luxembourg has adequate medical care, 99 percent literacy, an
 excellent school system, and little poverty. Women participate
 freely in political and economic life. Although significant
 numbers of women hold political office, women by tradition are
 less active in business affairs.
 A notable feature of the economy is the importance of one
 industry, steel, which accounts for a high percentage of
 Luxembourg's exports. However, the steel industry is undergoing
 basic restructuring and is declining gradually in terms of
 overall economic importance. The projected increase in the
 unemployment rate to about two percent in 1983 (an all-time high
 for Luxembourg) will in large part be the result of elimination
 of jobs in the steel industry. Vigorous efforts are underway to
 diversify the economy, partly through promotion of Luxembourg as
 a financial center and by establishing foreign industries in the
 country.
 Approximately 26 percent of Luxembourg's population of 366,000
 are foreigners, and although immigration is now low, the foreign
 population is growing gradually while the native Luxembourg
 population is declining. The net population growth rate is .10
 percent. Despite economic recession and increased unemployment
 in a society accustomed to virtually full employment, Luxembourg
 continues efforts to treat its large foreign population fairly.
 Moreover, in spite of the current economic challenges,
 Luxembourg remains notably free from social and political
 instability.
