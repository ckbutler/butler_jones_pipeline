 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The Yemen Arab Republic is one of the poorest and
 most backward countries in the Near East. It has
 no oil wealth and few other natural resources.
 Yemen was isolated from the outside world by the
 theocratic government of the Imam until the repub-
 lican revolution of 1962. The republican govern-
 ment has only recently begun to fulfill its respon-
 sibilities towards its citizens. Since .1962 the
 government's effectiveness has been limited by a
 long civil war and the need to extend and establish
 the authority of the state throughout the country.
 President al-Hamdi was assassinated in October 1977.
 His successor, Lt. Col. Al-Ghashmi, has pledged to
 continue the-foreign and domestic policies-of his
 predecessor.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is little evidence that torture, which is
 prohibited by law, does occur and that which may is
 not condoned by the government. Because of poorly
 developed governmental institutions and primitive
 social and prison conditions in remote parts of the
 country, the government is not always able to
 exercise complete control over prison or local
 officials.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Islamic law sanctions the severing of the hand of
 convicted thieves. Such punishment is not meted
 out to first or second offenders. Capital punishment
 by public beheading is provided for by law for murder
 and sabotage, but some offenses previously punishable
 by death, such as adultery, are now punishable by
 imprisonment only. Prisoners live under difficult
 conditions, but are not wantonly mistreated.

 Prisoners incarcerated in remote areas, in which the
 authority of the state is not yet fully established,
 are still sometimes subjected to cruel or degrading
 treatment, often a result of primitive prison con-
 ditions rather than conscious actions by local
 officials.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Yemen constitution and central government direc-
 tives provide that an accused must be brought before
 a court within one week of arrest and tried within
 three months. Detainees are permitted access to
 family and lawyers. There have been isolated in-
 stances in which local authorities have, on their
 own initiative, arrested and detained individuals
 for lengthy periods of time without adequate grounds
 or on the basis of hearsay or circumstantial evidence.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Yemenis can obtain fair public trials under the pro-
 cedures prescribed by Islamic law. Law courts in
 Yemen have a long tradition of fairness and impar-
 tiality. The judge, while impartial, plays an
 activist role in questioning the witnesses, seeking
 to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused.
 e. Invasion of the Hone
 Search warrants are not required, but traditional
 respect for the integrity of the home minimizes such
 governmental invasions.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Yemen Government policies have tended to be supportive
 of Yemenis' basic needs for food, shelter, health
 care and education. The needs of individuals have
 been met largely by private remittances from Yemenis
 working abroad. Relying largely on foreign aid, the
 government has recently unveiled a Five Year Development
 
 
 425
 Plan which seeks to alleviate the problems of the
 nation's poor through a variety of infrastructure,
 capital development, training and education and
 basic human needs programs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 While Yemenis are free to express their political views,
 the government does not tolerate-mass political rallies,
 which, in its view, are potential threats to the State's
 internal security.
 There is no evidence of religious intolerance. The
 small Jewish community resides in remote sections of
 the country and is accepted by the society. Its
 members are under no restrictions as to movement or
 emigration. Foreign Christians are also allowed to
 worship freely and Christian missionaries are per-
 mitted to operate hospitals-and.clinics.a.-Religious
 proselytizing is forbidden by law.
 There are active functioning non-governmental labor
 unions in Yemen. -
 Women in Yemen continue to lead a traditional and
 restricted existence. Glimmerings of change in
 their overall status are beginning to appear. -Women
 attend Sana University with male students and are
 increasingly employed in government offices. The
 Yemen Government is publicly committed to improving
 the status of women.
 The Yemen media are in a rudimentary stage of develop-
 ment. They are predominately government-owned and
 used to communicate. government- policies -and -positions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Yemenis are free to travel within and outside the
 country and to emigrate freely.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The opportunities for participation in the political
 process are limited. The republic is headed by a
 three-man Command Council. The consultative assembly
 was dissolved shortly after the late President al-
 Hamdi came to power in 1974. Political parties are
 forbidden.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests by international or
 non-governmental organizations to investigate human
 rights concerns in Yemen. The extent of Yemeni co-
 operation with such a request might depend on the
 nature of the organization and Yemeni perception of
 its objectives.
