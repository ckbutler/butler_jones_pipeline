 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy governed by a Prime Minister, a Council
 of Ministers, and a National Assembly. Mauritius declared itself a Republic on
 March 12, 1993. The Head of State is the President, who is nominated by the Prime
 Minister and confirmed by the Assembly, and whose powers are largely ceremonial.
 Fair and orderly national and local elections, supervised by an independent commis-
 sion, take place at regular intervals. There are four major political parties and sev-
 eral smallerparties. Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth's current coalition received
 a broad mandate in general elections in September 1991.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force of some 1,200 men and a 240-man Special
 Support Unit are responsible for internal security. These forces, under the command
 of the Commissioner of Police, are backed by a general duty police force numbering
 
 
 over 6,000. They are largely apolitical and generally well trained, but police abuse
 of suspects apparently increased during the year.
 The economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly textiles), sugar,
 and tourism. The rapid economic growth of the mid-198(Ps has s owed as a result
 of labor shortages and the global economic slowdown. The Government, with the
 help of international donors, is attempting to diversify the industrial base to favor
 high-technology, capital-intensive production, and new sectors, such as financial
 services.
 Political and civil rights are protected under the Constitution and respected in
 practice. The work of the Garrioch Committee, established by the Prime Minister
 in 1990 to conduct an independent review of several controversial laws, led to sig-
 nificant reforms. These included expansion of the freedom of assembly and abolition
 of the repressive Public Order Act, which permitted detention without charge or
 trial. The Government continued to delay the release of the Garrioch Committee's
 recommendations on amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, which effectively
 disallows the right to strike. The Government determines wages and benefits; collec-
 tive bargaining is not practiced. Societal discrimination and violence against women
 continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law and generally are not prac-
 ticed. However, there were increased press allegations, confirmed by attorneys han-
 dling civil rights cases, of police mistreatment of suspects. The abuse ranged from
 use of excessive force during arrests to beatings of suspects in custody. In Septem-
 ber, in a well-publicized case, two police officers were charged with having caused
 the death of a person in their custody. Some victims of police mistreatment have
 sued and been financially compensated for their personal injuries. No police officers
 accused of abuse were brought to trial in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution, detained persons
 have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their detention. Although
 the time limit for making this determination is not specified in law, in practice it
 is usually made within 24 hours. Bail is commonly granted. The Public Gathering
 Act, which replaced the Public Order Act on the basis of recommendations from the
 Garrioch Committee, no longer allows for indefinite detention without charge or
 trial.
 Exile is legally prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of
 Great Britain, consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and a
 series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Judicial Committee in the
 United Kingdom, and this is routine in the cases of death sentences. There are no
 political or military courts.
 The President, in consultation with the Prime Minister, nominates the Chief Jus-
 tice and in consultation with the latter, nominates the senior puisne (associate)
 judges. he President nominates other judges on the advice of the Judicial and
 Legal Service Commissions. The legal system has consistently provided fair, public
 trials for those charged with crimes. Defendants have the right to private or court-
 appointed counsel. The judiciary is also charged under the Constitution with ensur-
 ing that new laws are consistent with democratic practice.
 While a number of recent legal decisions went against the Government, the most
 significant being the Supreme Court's rejection of an attempt by the Prime Minister
 to strip the leader of the opposition of his seat in the National Assembly, legal spe-
 cialists and opposition politicians have warned against undue influence by the exec-
 utive over the judiciary. These concerns were highlighted by the resignation in Au-
 gust of a Supreme Court justice. The justice resigned after his stay of deportation
 of a woman who was 8 months pregnant was overruled on the direct order of the
 Prime Minister.
 There were no political prisoners in Mauritius in 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally respected in practice, but
 credible reports hold that the Government's intelligence apparatus occasionally
 opens mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders and other major
 figures. In September 1992, after a staff member of the Mauritius Broadcasting Cor-
 
 
 poration (MBC) alleged that a letter addressed to him had been opened, the Su-
 preme Court ruled that the MBC and other government organizations could not
 open the personal mail of their employees. The search of personal property or prem-
 ises is allowed only under clearly specified conditions by court order or by police de-
 cision if an illegal act has been committed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is protected by the
 Constitution and local tradition and is largely respected in practice. Debate in the
 National Assembly is lively and open. Whil  here are occasional complaints of gov-
 ernment influence in editorial policies, over a dozen privately owned daily, weekly,
 and monthly newspapers present varying political viewpoints and freely express
 partisan views. However, newspapers are subject to the constraints of strict libel
 faws, which, under the 1984 Newspaper and Periodicals (Amendment) Act, inhibit
 the ability of the press to criticize the Government. In 1991 two journalists were
 charged with giving out false information concerning a sea captain accused of fish-
 ing in Mauritian waters. The charges against the journalists were dropped in Feb-
 ruary 1992, but in March of the same year an appeal was filed by the Director of
 Public Prosecutions. This appeal was still pending at the end of 1993.
 The Government owns the 2 television and 3 radio stations, which broadcast in
 12 languages and dialects. Television and r-adio, which in the past tended to reflect
 government editorial and programming policies, have developed more independent,
 professional news reporting. Opposition politicians are given more air time than pre-
 viously and new current events programs featuring interviews with politicians from
 across the political spectrum have been well received.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Mauritians enjoy the right to
 form associations, including political parties, trade unions, and religious organiza-
 tions, although in practice all such organizations need government approval in order
 to operate officially. Mauritius has a multitude of such private orgai-izations.
 Political, cultural, and religious assemblies are commonplace. Under the 1991
 Public Gathering Act, police permission is required for holding demonstrations and
 mass meetings. Such permission is rarely refused. Although groups have sucessfully
 challenged police denials of permits, in 1993 r.o appeals were made. Groups com-
 plained that the time involved in the appeals process often makes the final outcome
 moot.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. Hindus are a majority, but
 Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly practice, teach, and proseltize.
 All religious institutions receive state subsidies in proportion to their memberships.
 There is no state-sponsored discrimination against any ethnic or religious commu-
 nity. The Government facilitates the travel of Mauritians who make the hajj. For-
 eign missionaries are not allowed to enter the country without a prior request from
 a local religious organization. Missionaries have faced the same difficulties as other
 foreigners in obtaining residence permits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 Foreign travel and emigration are also unrestricted. However, there is no blanket
 guarantee of repatriation, and there are no general criteria for processing repatri-
 ation applications. Applications from Mauritians abroad who lost their citizenship
 after acquiring a second nationality (estimated to be several thousand) are handled
 on a case-by-case and sometimes arbitrary basis. This remains an issue of political
 debate as more Mauritians abroad seek to reclaim their Mauritian citizenship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government through demo-
 cratic means. Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral National Asscm-
 bly, with executive direction coming from the Council of Ministers, currently headed
 by Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth, whose Alliance coalitions won elections
 in 1983, 1987, and 1991. The President, in accordance with the advice of the Prime
 Minister has the right to designate the person charged with forming a new govern-
 ment foliowing parliamentary elections or in a parliamentary crisis. Parliamentary,
 municipal, and village council elections are held at regular intervals. All citizens 18
 years of age and over have the right to vote and run for office.
 In the National Assembly, up to eight members are appointed through a complex
 "best loser" system designed in part to ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately
 represented. The governing (three-party) Alliance coalition controls 49 of the 66
 seats. The politicsl parties often match the ethnicity or religion of their candidates
 to the composition of particular electoral constituencies.
 
 
 Only 2 of Mauritius' 66 members of Parliament and 1 of its 25 ministers are
 women. There are no legal impediments to women assuming leadership roles. The
 Government is not actively trying to address this imbalance.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups monitor developments without governmental restric-
 tion. There have been no known requests by international organizations to inves-
 tigate human rights violations in Mauritius.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Traditionally, women have occupied a subordinate role in society, but
 the Government has tried to promote equality by eliminating various legal restric-
 tions, e.g., in laws dealing with emigration and inheritance and, in 1990, by remov-
 ing a legal bar to women serving on juries. Also, in 1989 the Government appointed
 "Equal Employment Opportunity Officers" in the major ministries to ensure the pro-
 motion of women's interests. However, the lack of a body of law mandating equal
 treatment for women limits these officers' effectiveness. Despite the growing number
 of women in the work force, there is no legislation requiring equal pay for equal
 work, nor arc there any specific provisions against sexual harassment in the work-
 place. Additionally, women still cannot transmit citizenship to their foreign-born
 children, and foreign husbands of Mauritian women cannot automatically obtain
 residence and work permits (as can foreign wives of Mauritian men).
 According to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare, physicians, at-
 torneys, and religious and charitable organizations, violence against women is wide-
 spread. There are no special provisions in Mauritian law concerning family violence.
 Police are generally reluctant to become involved in cases of wife beating. The Gov-
 ernment in 1989 established a family counseling service, managed by the National
 Council of Women, one of whose principal tasks is to provide counseling and legal
 advice in cases of spousal abuse. S.O.S. Women, a nongovernmental organization
 which provides assistance to abused women and works to sensitize the Mauritian
 population on women's rights issues, estimates that it is contacted by more than 150
 abused women each month. Rape and Incest Aid, a Mauritian nongovernmental or-
 ganization, has made progress in sensitizingMauritians to these issues. Victims are
 frequently informally referred to this group by the Mauritian elic.
 Children.-The Government's programs in the area of children srights and wel-
 fare are limited. Most are handled by the National Children's Council, a parastatal
 organization attached to the Ministry of Women's Rights. Most of the Government's
 resources in this area are concentrated on family counseling and sensitization on
 child abuse.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Although Mauritius has a Hindu majority,
 the country's active press and strongly egalitarian traditions mitigate against dis-
 crimination in all forms. Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, or caste is
 also prohibited by law. Nonetheless, underlying social tensions based on ethnicity
 and caste continued in 1993.
 People with Disabilities.-Mauritian law requires organizations that employ more
 than 10 persons to set aside at least 3% of their positions for people with disabil-
 ities. The law does not, however, mandate that worksites be accessible to the dis-
 abled. Several nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern about this
 lack of accessibility, which makes it impossible for people with disabilities to fill
 many jobs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Al-
 most 300 unions represent about 110,000 workers, just under 30 percent of the work
 force. Of these, 110 have less than 50 members. orkers are theoretically free to
 form and join unions and to organize in all sectors, including in the export process.
 ing zone (EPZ) which employs about 90,000 workers. However, in practice there are
 a variety of constraints under the 1973 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), such as the
 need to obtain government approval to register new unions. In addition, five unions
 in the EPZ were deregstered in 1993 because they became inactive, or because their
 membership dropped below seven. Less than 10 percent of EPZ workers are believed
 to be unionized. Unions can and do press wage demands, establish ties to domestic
 political parties and international organizations, and address political issues.
 In theory unions have the right to strike. However, in labor disputes the IRA re-
 quires a prestrike 21-day cooling-off period followed by binding arbitration, which
 has the effect of making most strikes illegal. Participation in a strike not approved
 by a court is sufficient grounds for dismissal.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While the right of association
 is guaranteed by law, excessive government intervention has distorted the collective
 bargaining process. The IRA's provisions for establishing wages bear little resem-
 blance to the traditional collective bargaining process, and the Government's re-
 straints on that process render it ineffective.
 A National Remuneration Board (NRB), whose chairman is appointed by the Min-
 ister of Labor, sets minimum wages by sector but also establish a wage structure
 based on length of service and job classification. The NRB thus sets wages for
 skilled and experienced workers whose earnings are well above the minimum wage.
 Wages and benefits for civil servants are established by the Pay Research Bureau
 (PRB) which prepares a wage scale for the civil service on the basis of the Sedgwick/
 Chesworth Report recommendations. After a 6-year hiatus, this report was pub-
 lished in May. While it gave wage increases which averaged 17 percent, labor
 groups criticized it for its inflexibility and opaqueness.
 In 1993 the salary increases granted in the PRB also served as cost-of-living ad-
 justments, which previously had been determined in tripartite negotiations. Ordi-
 narily, the government-established tripartite committee, chaired by the Minister of
 Finance and including employer and trade union representatives, meets once a year.
 Its recommendations are not always unanimous, however, and the Government
 makes the final decision.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) noted again in 1991 that the IRA
 does not give workers' organiations sufficient protection against acts of interference
 as provided for by ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collec-
 tively. The Garrioch Committee submitted its review of the IRA to the Government
 in May 1992. Despite government pledges to release the Committee's report and in-
 troduce amendments to the IRA by July 1993, at the end of the year neither had
 been done.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and not practiced. However, under the IRA the Minister of Labor can
 refer industrial disputes to compulsory arbitration, enforceable by penalties involv-
 ing compulsory labor provisions. The ILO continues to criticize this as being in con-
 flict with ILO Convention 105 on forced labor. There were no such cases in 1993.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum work age for em-
 ployment of children is 15. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing child
 labor laws, but enforcement is minimal. While there are cases of children under the
 age of 15 working illegally in the EPZ, the large, established EPZ factories do not
 hire children under 15. In fact, it is unusual to see employees much younger than
 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The NRB establishes minimum wages for 26
 categories of private sector workers (sugar, tea, transport, etc.) which apply equally
 to workers in the EPZ. Although originally established to set minimum wages for
 nonunion workers, the NRB has broadened its powers and issues remuneration or-
 ders that establish minimum wages, bonuses, housing, and transportation allow-
 ances, and other benefits for almost all private sector workers. About 85 percent of
 all private sector workers (including unionized workers) are covered by NRB orders.
 Employers and unions are free to negotiate wages and benefits above the minimums
 established by the NRB, but this is rare.
 Minimum wages are differ along employment sector and gender lines. Women are
 paid less in the agricultural sector on the stated assumption that their productivity
 is lower in this labor-intensive work. In the EPZ, the minimum wage is equal for
 men and women. The statutory minimum wage for an unskilled worker in the EPZ
 is $45 (approximately 800 Rupees) a month. The minimum wage for non-EPZ work-
 ers is about $54 (about 1000 Rupees) a month. However, given Mauritius' present
 labor shortage, the market rate is much higher, and most jobs include various bene-
 fits. The overall compensation package generally is sufficient to afford an acceptable
 standard of living. The Government mandates minimum wage increases each year
 based on inflation.
 The standard workweek in the industrial sector is 45 hours, but excessive over-
 time continues to be a problem in the EPZ. An employee may be required by an
 employer to perform up to 10 hours per week of mandatory overtime (at a higher
 hourly wage). With the employee's consent, he or she may work up to 20 hours of
 overtime per week (i.e., 65 hours).
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and working conditions are in-
 spected by Ministry of Labor officials. While the total number of industrial accidents
 has declined in recent years, the number of fatal accidents has risen. Enforcement
 is minimal and ineffective due to the small number of inspectors.
