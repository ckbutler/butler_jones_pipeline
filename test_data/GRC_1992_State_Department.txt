 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. The Govern-
 ment under Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, formed after free elections in
 April 1990, holds a two-seat majority in the Parliament. President Constantine
 Karamanlis, the largely ceremonial Head of State, was chosen by Parliament in
 he plie and security servies are subject to a broad variety of legal and con-
 stitutional restraints. Their activities are monitored by Parliament, a vigorous free
 press, the judiciary, human rights organizations, and other private groups.
 The Greek eonomy hasavery lr        ate sr wthastrong tradition of patron-
 age. To promote further economic development, Greece relies heavily on the Euro-
 pean Community (EC) for subsidies and loans. Government efforts to reduce the
 budget deficit and strengthen the private sector are hampered by, among other
 things, political polarization and opposition from labor unions and other groups.
 onstitution protects, and  e authorities respect, fundamental human rights.
 In 1992 an international human rights group issued a report alleging that Greek
 police, particularly the Narcotics Polie, as well as p risn guards at times tortured
 or ill-treated persons in custody during 1986-91. Greek officials have publicly ac-
 knowledged, in discussing terrorism, that police discipline needs improvement.
 There were a few reports, investigated and denied by the Greek Government, of
 Greek border guards and military personnel abusing Albanian illegal aliens, result-
 ing in four Albanians' deaths. The Greek and Albanian Governments took joint
 steps during 1992 to reduce border tensions and the danger of incidents.
 Other human rights problems include some continuing restrictions on freedom of
 apeecht association and religion, use of Article 19 of the citizenship code to revoke
 the citzenship of Greek citizens who are not ethnic Greeks, discrimination against
 Gypsies, and violence against women.
 RFSPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Neither government forces nor legal
 opposition groups engage in political killing. However, during 1992 there were alle-
 gations, denied by the Government, that Greek border guards and military person-
 nel killed four Albanians who had illegally entered Greece (see Section 2.d.).
 Terrorists carried out several shooting, bomb, and rocket attacks on police and
 public officials in 1992. In July terrorists fired an antitank rocket across a crowded
 street in downtown Athens in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the Finance
 Minister. The explosion killed a college student and wounded several other bystand-
 ers.
 As a result of the investigation into the case of accused drug dealer Suleyman
 Akyar, who was beaten to death in January 1991 while in official custody, the pros-
 ecutor wopwsd that three police officers be charged with using excessive force lead-
 ing to deat, a felony. This case is still under the magistrate's adjudication.

 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of from 3 years to life imprisonment. This
 law has never been invoked.
 An international human rights organization issued a report in late June describ-
 ing incidents occurring in 1990 and 1991 in which police and prison guards allegedly
 totured or ill-treated individuals or groups of people in their custody. An appendix
 summarizi    cases raised wi  the Greek authorities since 1986, included 54 alleed
 victims in 191. According to the report, methods of ill-treatment included punchnlg,
 kicking, and beating with sticks, clubs, or truncheons. Beating on the soles of the
 feet was also reported. Several persons charged with drug offenses reported that
 antinarcotics police struck them during interrogations.
 The Government conducted its own internal reviews and reported that police and
 guards in most instances had been exonerated. In a 1987 case, finally adjdicted
 in 1991, a policeman was sentenced to 3  years' imprisonment for unintentionally
 inflicting a fatal ijury on a man detained in a police station. In 1992 felony wrong-
 ful-death charges were recommended to a magistrate against three policemen in the
 death of a suspect in custody in 1991. This case remains under the magistrat's ad-
 judication.
 Although concluding that most of the allegations were groundless, the Minister
 of Public Order, in public statements about terrorism, acknowledged shortcomings
 in police discipline and promised corrective action. An official of the Ministry of Jus-
 tie acknowledged a small but growing problem of abuses in overcrowded prisons
 by overworked guards. A court in Piraes sentenced two former guards to 8 months'
 imprisonment for injuring a juvenile inmate in Korydallos prison. The prison system
 took steps in 1992 to relieve crowded conditions, including the opening of a new
 prison in Volos. Greece is using over $52 million in EC funding to improve prison
 conditions in fiscal years 1992--93.
 d. Arbitraly Arresty Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution req1uires udicial war-
 rants for all arrests except during the actual ommission of a crime. Te legal sys-
 tem protects against arbitrary arrest orders. A person arrested on the basis of a
 warrant or while committing a crime must be brought before an examining mag-
 istrate within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the
 release of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense (or the fourth day following the offense if charges are brought
 under the "antiterrrist" law) may be tried immediately, under "speedy procedure."
 All legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in "gey proce-
 dure" cases. Defen ants may ask or dely to provide time to pre    eir defense
 but the court is not obliged to grant it.The effective maximum duration of pretrial
 detention is 18 months for felonies and 9 months for misdemeanors. A panel of
 judges may grant release pending trial, with or without bail. A person convicted of
 a misdemeanor and sentenced to 2 years or less may, at the court's discretion, pay
 a fine in lieu of being imprisoned.
 Exile is unconstitutional and does not occur.
 e. Denial  Fair Public Trial.-yThe judicial system is characterized by three lev-
 els of courts, appointed judges, an examining magistrate system, trial by judicial
 panel, and the right of appeal by both pro vtion and defense. The independence
 of the judiciary is provided for in the  nstittiion, but there are credible charges
 that judges sometimes allow political criteria to influence their judgments.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open o
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses or national security matters. The latter provision is not abused. The de-
 fendant enjoys the presumption of innocence, the standard of proof of guilt beyond
 a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the right of access
 to the prosecution's evidence, the right to crossetxamine witnesses, andthe right to
 counsel. Lawyers are provided to defendants who need them.
 There are no political prisoners in Greece. There are, however, about 370 persons
 in jail for refusing, on religious grounds, to perform military service as Greek law
 requires (see Section 2.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Priacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Greek
 authorities comply with constitutional prohibitions against invasions of privacy and
 searches without warrants. Monitoring of personal communications is permitted
 only under strict judicial controls. Judicial warrants showing probable cause are r-
 auired for home searches, and there are limits on conducting such searches at night.
 
 
 791
 In 1992 the Parliament rescinded its 1989 indictment of a former prime minister
 and his former national intelligence service director for wiretapping.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution, and is respected in practice, but there are notable exceptions.
 Greek publications, representing a diverse and robust expression of political and
 ideological views, are published and sold freely but there are some restrictions. For
 exa      the Constitution allows for seizure, though not prior restraint, of publica-
 tions that insult the President, offend religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, ad-
 vocate violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose military and defense in-
 formation. Seizures are rare, however, and, according to one prominent human
 rights activist, did not occur in 1992. The law also forbids "insulting authority," and
 charges on these grounds are occasionally filed. In October three journalists with
 the newsprOas were sentenced to jail terms of 8 to 18 months, which could
 be satisfied y paying a fine, for insulting authority by suggesting that the Supreme
 Court imprope y accepted guidanc e f       Government. In September a leader
 of the Atens bus drivers union was charged with insulting authority by question-
 ing the Greek courts' independence in a speech. As of December, his casehad not
 ome to trial.
 Greek law prohibits "exposing the friendly relations of the Greek State with for-
 eign states to danger of disturbance," "spreadinj false information and rumors liable
 to create concern and fear among citizens and cause disturbance in the countys
 international relations," and "inciting citizens to rivalry and division, leading to  -
 turbance of the peace." That law was enforced on at least five occasions in 1992.
 Five cases were brought against groups or individuals for disseminating psters
 or publications critical of Greek government policy on Balkan and Macedonian is-
 sues. None of those charged was in jail as of December. In January 1992, six meme-
 brs of an organization were sentenced to 6/ months' imprisonment for putting up
 posters critical of government policy on the Macedonian issue. They have appealed
 their conviction. In April police in Athens arrested four students for distributing a
 leaflet entitled, "The Neighboring Peoples are Not Our Enemies. No to Nationalism
 and War. They were sentenced in May to a fine and 19 months in jail. They have
 also appealed their convictions. Also in May, police arrested five persons for distrib-
 uting a book about "working class perspectives on Balkan issues, denouncing the
 rise of Greek nationalism, and den    that the people of Greek Macedonia are
 strictly Greek. Their trial is scheduled for January 26, 1993. In August two men
 were charged in connection with statements the had made in a magazine interview
 in March about Macedonian issues. Their tria was scheduled for April 1993. Fi-
 naly. in December another person was sentenced to a year in jail for distributing
 a leaflet on Macedonian issues that referred to Alexander the Great as a "war crimi-
 nal". He is free, pending appeal.
 A 1991 law, desigetocomat terrorism, includes a section athorizing the Su-
 preme Court prosecutor to prohibit publicizing specific statements by terrorist
 groups (specifically, groups acting in concert to commit certain serious felonies, in-
 cluding murder). A 1991 offer by the Government to discuss this law with journal-
 ists' associations was not taken up in 1992. In September six publishers and editors
 were tried for violating this law in Athens. One defendant was convicted and sen-
 tenced to a fine and 6 months in ail (which may be satisfied by paying another
 ine). He appealed his conviction. rial ofthe other five defendants was adjourned
 until January 29, 1993.
 Private television and radio stations flourish in the absence of regulatory media
 legislation and air a wide range of political viewpoints. State-run stations tend to
 emphasize government views but allot time as well to opposition figures' activities.
 Television and radio stationslike the print media, occasionally are threatened by
 a local prosecutor for "insulting authority," but to date no charges have actually
 been filed.
 Academic freedoms are ptected by democratically chosen faculty organizations
 though such groups tend to be politicized. One professor reported that he resigned
 from a university because the faculty senate denied him permission to travel outside
 Greece during the academic term to take part in a program in the United States.
 Since such permission is usually pro form, the professor believed that the denial
 was a direct result of his public views on minority issues.
 Throughout much of western Thrace, where Turkish-speaking Greek citizens are
 concentrated, Turkish-language satellite television broadcasts are available to those
 with access to satellite grounbations. Turkish -language publications areuhublished
 and cireulate locally in Thrace, while newspapers and other periodieals from Turkey
 are distributed privately when brought in by taxis and travelers.
 
 
 792
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. Police permits are routinely issued for public demonstrations,
 and there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused.
 The right of association is provided for by the Constitution and is generally re-
 spected. In 1991, however a "Macedonian Cultural Center" in Florina, organized by
 Greek citizens of Slavic descent, lost an appeal of a lower court decision denying
 it registration because of the use in its title of the word "Macedonian," which the
 court held would cause "confusion." Government policy holds that Greek citizens of
 Slavic descent do not constitute a minority (see Section 5). The decision was ap-
 pealed to the Supreme Court, which has not yet heard the case.
 Greek authorities while recognizing a Muslim minority, do not recognize sepa-
 rately an ethnic Turkish minority (see Section 5).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discrimination against religious minorities. It also establishes the Greek
 Orthodox Church, to which 98 percent of the population at least nominally adhere,
 as the "prevailing" religion and prohibits proselytizing. The Greek Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses organization reported that, as of mid-December, 49 members of its faith were
 arrested for proselytizing, 25 were tried, and 3 were convicted and sentenced to 30
 days in jail (which may fe satisfied by paying a fine of less than $10 per day). These
 convictions were appealed. Two persons arrested in 1991 for proselytizing were ac-
 quitted in 1992. In contrast with past years, the Jehovah's Witnesses said that, ex-
 cept for one case, persons arrested for proselytizing were not jailed overnight. In No-
 vember a Greek Jehovah's Witness appealed to the European Court of Justice to re-
 verse his previous proselytizing conviction and to order repeal of the Greek
 anti proselytism law.
 Athough the Mormons have an active missionary program in Greece, no Mormons
 were arrested for proselytizing in 1992.
 All Greek men, irrespective of religion, are subject to the military draft, which
 does not provide for nonmilitary alternative service. Noncombatant alternative mili-
 tary service has been available since 1977, but the Defense Ministry said in 1992
 that no one had ever requested that option. As of October, about 370 draft refusers,
 nearly all of them Jehovah's Witnesses, were serving prison sentences of between
 3 and 5 years. About 185 were in Sindos military prison, where about 85 were able
 to work and thereby earn 2 days off their sentences for each day served. Another
 145 were in civilian agricultural prisons, where all were able to reduce their sen-
 tences by working, though living conditions were reportedly more austere than in
 Sindos. The Defense Ministry said its goal was to consolidate all imprisoned draft
 refusers at Sindos and to make work available to all prisoners there.
 Historically, Jehovah's Witnesses ministers were not granted the exemption from
 military service accorded under Greek law to clergy of -known religions.' However,
 in 1990-91, the Council of State, declaring that the Jehovah's Witnesses were a
 "known religion," ordered three clerics released who had refused induction. In 1992,
 however, in a case that sparked controversy in the press and Parliament, Pastor
 Tasos Georgiadis was arrested three times for draft refusal and each time was tried
 by a military court and acquitted. The Government replied to a question by a mem-
 ber of the European Parliament that the agency responsible for Georgiadis'
 rearrests and retrials, the Hellenic military's recruiting division, had relied on a rul-
 ing by the Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church that the Jehovah's Witnesses
 were "not religious...in character." In July after winning an appeal to the Council
 of State, Georgiadis was freed. Current poficy, according to a Defense Ministry offi-
 cial, is to send draft notices to Jehovah s Witnesses' pastors but not to act against
 any pastor who refuses induction until he has had the opportunity to complete an
 appeal to the Council of State, and to respect that Council's rulings. As of December,
 there were no Jehovah's Witnesses clergy imprisoned for draft refusal.
 Each church in Greece requires the ocal Orthodox bishop's permission to open
 and operate. Such permission is sometimes delayed or withheld, though religious
 services are often conducted while awaiting formal permission. In 1992 the Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses lost one case and had another pending in the Supreme Court in-
 volving operation of unlicensed houses of worship. The Witnesses said that they had
 referred both cases to the Council of Europe and that meantime both churches were
 in use.
 Mosques and other Muslim religious institutions operate in western Thrace,
 where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith reside. Some Muslims claim that
 Greek law weakens the financial autonomy of the 'wakfs," community funds used
 for maintaining mosques and for charitable works, by placing the wakfs under the
 administration of appointed muftis (Islamic judges and religious leaders). The Trea-
 ty of Lausanne contains language allowing minorities to control their charitable in-
 ,atlit.inns
 
 
 793
 In accordance with a 1990 presidential decree, the State appoints the three muftis
 in Greece, all resident in western Thrace. According to Greek government policy,
 muftis must be appointed because, in addition to their religious duties, they are ju-
 dicial functionaries who are paid by the State, with authority in many civil and do-
 mestic matters. The selection process includes formal consultations with local Mus-
 lim leaders. Some members of the Muslim minority accept this arrangement, while
 others oppose it, preferring to have muftis elected by the communities they will
 serve. In March Greece barred entry to three Turkish imams wishing to preach in
 Thrace during Ramadan because they had not sought invitations from official
 muftis.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution protects freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, and emigration. Ethnic Greeks intending to emigrate, and emigrants
 who return to Greece, experience no discrimination. However, Article 19 of the
 Greek citizenship code distinguishes between Greek citizens who are ethnic Greeks
 and those who are not. Greek citizens who are not ethnic Greeks may be deprived
 of citizenship if it is determined that they left Greece with the apparent intent not
 to return. But under Greek law, immigrants who are ethnic Greeks are recognized
 as Greek citizens and accorded full rights (see below). Most Article 19 cases involve
 Muslims, primarily persons of Turkish origin, from western Thrace.
 Proceedings under Article 19 are initiated on the basis of reports by local authori-
 ties in Greece or by Greek embassies or consulates abroad. The Interior Ministry
 holds a hearing at which the affected person is not present, nor is the affected per-
 son notified of the hearing. Those who lose Greek citizenship as a result of such
 hearings sometimes learn of this loss only when they seek to reenter Greece. Accord-
 ing to the Foreign Ministry, 138 persons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 in
 1992, of whom 16 filed administrative appeals. Three of these appeals were success-
 ful, while 13 were not. Despite assurances in 1991 that Article 19 would be abol-
 ished in 1992, the Government by year's end had not introduced the requisite legis-
 lation in Parliament to do so.
 Persons who lose their Greek citizenship under Article 19 have the right of "ad-
 ministrative appeal" to the Interior Ministry and may also appeal to the Greek
 Council of State and to the Council of Europe. Leaders of the Turkish-origin Greek
 community complain that the time and expense involved tend to discourage such ap-
 peals.
 Increasingly a transit country for economic migrants, Greece frequently offers
 temporary asylum, though rarely permanent resettlement, to a growing number of
 refugees from Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In late 1992, there were
 reports of increasing numbers of Iraqi Chaldeans and Kurds attempting to enter
 Greece illegally. There were reliable reports that two boats with such refugees had
 sunk in the Aegean, resulting in the deaths of most of those aboard. Greece has
 given temporary refuge to about 100 boat refugees.
 Since 1986 about 35,000 ethnic Greeks from the former Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics have entered Greece, with 3,107 entries recorded in the first half of 1992.
 These immigrants are recognized as Greek citizens and accorded full rights. Perma-
 nent resettlement in Greece is not usually available for nonethnic Greek refugees.
 Albanian border crossers, some of whom were armed and dangerous, occasionally
 clashed with Greek border forces and in a few instances reportedly suffered serious
 mistreatment. Albanian authorities in January claimed that Greek forces near
 Videlhova had beaten six Albanians, killing two. Albanian television in February
 claimed that Greek forces, forcibly repatriating a group of 100 Albanians, had mis-
 treated them, beating and burning a member of the group, Agur Emini. The Greek
 Government stated that its investigations showed no wrongdoing by border forces
 in these and other cases, but Greek officials informally indicated that several sol-
 diers had been disciplined for using abusive language.
 Both the Greek and Albanian Governments have attempted to alleviate the border
 situation. They agreed to open new consulates and border-crossing points and in
 July signed an agreement on cooperation in dealing with "urgent matters," such as
 the mass influx of immigrants. Followup meetings were held in December in Ath-
 ens, at both ministerial and working levels, to improve cooperation in border control
 and to find employment for some Albanians in Greece. In addition to the central
 Governments' discussions, local officials met informally along the border to cope
 with the large volume of border crossers, currently estimated by Greek officials at
 about 1,000 per day.
 
 
 794
 Section 3. Respect for Politimi Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 menit
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution guarantees full politi-
 cal rights for all citizens. See section 5 for allegations of some limitations on the
 ability of some Gypsies to vote. Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term.
 Members of the unicameral 300-seat Parliament are elected to maximum 4-year
 terms by secret ballot. Universal suffrage for those over age 18 is compulsory and
 enforced by fines and administrative penalties. Opposition parties function freely
 and have broad access to the media. Under a 1990 electoral law, no candidate may
 be elected whose party does not receive 3 percent or more of the nationwide vote.
 As a result, both current independent Members of Parliament, one of whom is of
 Turkish and the other of Gypsy origin, are unlikely to be reelected unless they run
 as candidates of one of the national parties.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of women in
 government or politics. Women's representation at the higher levels of Greek politi-
 cal life is steadily increasing. In 1990 women for the first time were elected to the
 r residencies of national political parties. Though small, the parties in question
 Communist and Left Alliance) are represented in Parliament. A female candidate
 nearly won the mayorship of Athens in 1990; women held 5 of the 51 ministerial
 and deputy ministerial seats in the Cabinet at the end of 1992. Women are rep-
 resented, though not yet widely, in the leadership of the two largest parties (New
 Democracy and PASOK).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations are allowed to operate freely. The Govern-
 ment has not obstructed human rights organizations' visits and investigations. One
 international human rights group complained that the Government was not forth-
 coming with information about cases the group raised.
 The Government generally respects the right of foreign diplomats to meet with
 Greek officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy, and such con-
 tacts normally take place without adverse reaction. However in August the Foreign
 Ministry protested to the US. Embassy a meeting between the U.S. Consul General
 in Thessaloniki and a group of people who call themselves "Macedonian" activists.
 In December the Prime Minister termed 'unacceptable" a meeting between a visit-
 ing U.S. Government official and two independent Muslim Members of Parliament
 on the grounds that the location (the Parliament building) was inappropriate, al-
 though foreign diplomats frequently meet with Members of Parliament in the Par-
 liament building. Both meetings had received negative press coverage. In neither
 case, however, did the Government seek to restrict future contacts.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The only minority Greece formally recognizes is a "Muslim minority," which is re-
 ferred to in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). The Muslim minority is comprised pri-
 marily of ethnic Turks or Turkish speakers, in western Thrace. The Government es-
 timates the Muslim minority in western Thrace at roughly 120,000 persons. In addi-
 tion to people of Turkish origin, it includes Pomaks (speaking a language akin to
 Bulgarian) and Gypsies. Some Muslims also live on Greek islands near the Turkish
 coast and in Athens and other industrial areas. Gypsies (both Christian and Mus-
 lim) are scattered throughout Greece. The north of Greece is also home to Greek
 citizens speaking or descended from speakers of one or more Slavic dialects.
 Government efforts to eradicate certain discriminatory treatment of Muslims in
 Thrace continued in 1992. Many complaints familiar from past years-greater im-
 pediments in buying land and in obtaining hunting, drivers', and tractor licenses;
 building construction and maintenance permits; permission to open, improve, and
 expand mosques; trade and commercial licenses; and land titles--did not recur in
 1992. Complaints that Muslims were disproportionately required to sell arable land
 to the State for public projects, a major allegation in earlier years, also did not recur
 in 1992. (In addition, see Section 2.c. for complaints about wakf administration.)
 Employment of Muslims in the public sector is much lower than the Muslim share
 of the population. Some Turkish-origin Greeks claim that they are hired only in
 small numbers for lower level public sector employment and rarely or not at all at
 higher levels. The Government cites many Muslims' lack of fluency in Greek, as well
 as the need for a university degree for high-level positions, as factors limiting the
 number of Muslims eligible for public employment.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 aR n p  d. Tn thp Knmntini digtri. in Thrace. where many members of the Muslim
 
 
 795
 minority live, the Office of the District Governor ("Nomarch") has interpreters avail-
 able.
 The Treaty of Lausanne guarantees the Muslim minority the right to Turkish-lan-
 Sguage education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Istanbul.
 Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular Turkish-language schools. Govern-
 ment disputes with Turkey over teachers and textbooks caused these secular schools
 serious problems in obtaining sufficient numbers and quality of faculty and teaching
 materials. There are only 656 places in Turkish-language secondary schools for
 Muslims, although there are over 9,000 Muslim elementary school pupils. Many
 Muslims reportedly go to high school in Turkey. Very few graduates of the Muslim
 secondary school system attend Greek universities.
 To address some of these problems, the Greek Government issued in 1992 new
 Turkish-language elementary texts, prepared in Greece, on a variety of subjects.
 Texts on mathematics and several other subjects were also received from the Turk-
 ish Government in mid-1991. The Greek Government reviewed their content in time
 for the beginning of the school year in September 1992 and either issued or re-
 turned them to Turkey with requested changes noted. However, some Turkish-origin
 Greeks objected to having their schools use teaching materials prepared in Greece,
 and, early in the school year between 20 and 30 persons seized the new texts from
 as many as 90 village schools. Those who seized the books said that they did not
 object to the books' quality. In September a court in Komotini sentenced three per-
 sons to 17 months in jail in connection with these book seizures; the sentences may
 be satisfied by paying a fine. Those convictions were appealed. As of December,
 more than 20 persons still faced theft charges; hearings are set for early 1993. The
 seized books have been returned.
 Some Turkish-origin Greeks complain that it is difficult to obtain permission to
 bring in teachers from Turkey or to hire Turkish-speaking teachers locally particu-
 larly for the secular Turkish-language middle schools in Xanthi and Komotini.
 Under a 1968 agreement, Greece and Turkey may annually exchange up to 35
 teachers each to serve, respectively, in Istanbuand western Thrace. In 1992 Greece
 sent 16 teachers to Istanbul, and admitted 16 of the 35 high school teachers whom
 Turkey nominated to teach in Thrace. Muslim villages usually elect Muslim-domi-
 nated local governments. In Komotini and Xanthi, both Muslims and non-Muslims
 hold seats on the town councils. The use of the word "Tourkos" ("Turk") is prohib-
 ited in titles of organizations, though individuals may legally call themselves
 "Tourkos." To most Greeks, the word "Tourkos" connotes Turkish citizenship and
 loyalties, and many object to its use by Greek citizens of Turkish origin. Use of a
 similar adjective, 'rourkoyennis" ("of Turkish descent/affiliation/ ethnicity"), is al-
 lowed (see also Section 2.b.).
 Members of non-Orthodox religions occasionally report difficulty obtaining occupa-
 tional licenses. In 1992 the Jehovah's Witnesses organization identified an account-
 ant and three teachers who it claimed had been kept from practicing their profes-
 sions on religious grounds, and a school principal who claimed to have lost a posi-
 tion as a school inspector after being questioned about his religious beliefs. As of
 December each of these persons had appealed to the Ministry of Education or the
 Council of State. Most Jehovah's Witnesses are able to work unhindered; one of the
 teachers mentioned above reportedly has a sibling, also a Jehovah's Witness, who
 teaches in apublic school.
 Northern Greece is home to a small number (unofficial estimates range from well
 under 10,000 to nearly 50,000) of Greek citizens who are descended from speakers
 of a Slavic dialect. Some still speak that dialect, and a few identify themselves as
 "Macedonians." Organizations of these citizens are not allowed to use the word
 "Macedonian" in their names. In 1991 the Thessaloniki appellate court upheld a ban
 against a cultural center in Florins on these grounds (see Section 2.b.). That organi-
 zation appealed to the Supreme Court, which had not ruled on the case by year's
 end. Individual citizens are free to speak the Slavic dialect in public and perform
 Slavic dances and music opecly.
 Unofficial estimates of the number of Gypsies in Greece range from 80,000 to
 140,000. Gypsies in Greece suffer the same problems that Gypsies suffer throughout
 Europe. Most Greek Gypsies are at least nominally Greek Orthodox, with Greek
 names, who speak Romany at home but Greek in public transactions. In western
 Thrace, where slightly over one-third of the population is Muslim, Gypsies tend to
 be Muslim, with Turkish names and some knowledge of the Turkish language. The
 Government estimates the Muslim Gypsy population to be 22,000. Official govern-
 ment policy is to encourage Gypsies to assimilate. For those who do not, illiteracy,
 poverty, crime, and social prejudice continue to be significant problems. Greek
 uman rights activists allege that some municipalities attempt to prevent settle-

 Gypsies are not allowed to vote and are excluded from a spectrum of government
 services.
 In March, alleedly in response to a series of armed robberies and other crimes
 ascribed to Gypsies, police raided some Gypsy encampments near Megara, rounding
 up most of the male inhabitants and holding them, in some cases overnight, for
 identification checks. A small number were arrested, mostly for outstanding mis-
 demeanor warrants. Critics charged that these police raids were racist and unconsti-
 tutional.
 There are broad constitutional and legal protections for women, including equal
 pay for equal work. Women are gradually entering traditionally male-dominated oc-
 cupations, including the higher echelons of business and government. Women police
 officers were assigned in 1992 to traffic control in high-visibility areas of downtown
 Athens, but such assignments are of the lowest status. The Governments General
 Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes coordinates efforts to remove barriers. Muslim
 women in western Thrace have the option of Islamic or civil marriage and Islamic
 or civil jurisdiction in domestic disputes.
 Violence against women is a problem identified by women's rights groups but
 there is a strong cultural bias against reporting cases of rape, incest, and wife beat-
 ing. There are no reliable statistics to indicate the extent of these problems. Police
 and local authorities generally do not intervene in domestic conflicts. The social in-
 frastructure for battered women is almost nonexistent, despite the EC's past fund-
 ing. Women's groups continue to press the Government, which, despite acknowledg-
 ing the need for more active measures, has yet to implement any specific remedial
 programs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution and in legislation passed in 1987 and amended in 1992. All workers, except
 the military and police, have the right to form or join unions of their own choosing.
 In 1992 approximately 35 percent of Greek workers (some 1.5 million wage and sal-
 ary earners) were organized in unions.
 Only the 5 most powerful public sector unions have dues-withholding provisions
 in their contracts. In the past, unions received most of their funding from a Ministry
 of Labor organization, the Workers' Hearth which distributed mandatory contribu-
 tions from employees and employers. Legislation passed in 1990 eliminated Work-
 ers' Hearth funding for labor unions effective in January 1992, and was the subject
 of a Confederation of Greek Labor (�SEE) complaint to the International Labor Or-
 ganization (1i0) in June 1991. A clause in the 1991 nationwide collective labor
 agreement, negotiated between employers and GSEE, allows unions to continue re-
 ceiving funds from the Workers' Hearth to cover their basic needs. The Parliament
 approved this clause in November 1992. Unions are now receiving Workers' Hearth
 funding.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brella confederations, one for civil servants and one for private sector employees.
 The unions are highly politicized, and there are party-affiliated factions within the
 labor confederations, but they are not controlled by political parties or the Govern-
 ment in day-to-day operations. There are no restrictions on who may serve as a
 union official. There are no restrictions on international contacts, and Greek unions
 maintain a variety of international affiliations.
 Legislation passed in 1990 qualifies the right to strike by requiring a skeleton
 staff during strikes affecting certain public services such as electricity, transpor-
 tation, communications, and banking. During strikes in September, a skeleton staff
 did not completely ensure that essential services continued uninterrupted. The Gov-
 ernment brought charges against unions and individuals for violating the legislation
 and, as of December 1992, lawsuits against the unions and individuals were pend-
 inMore than 250 strikes occurred in 1992, including a number in August and Sep-
 tember by public sector (including public utility) workers protesting the Athens city
 bus system's privatization and proposed social security system reforms. Public
 transportation and electric company strikes in particular caused considerable dis-
 ruption, the former turning violent in a few instances. The courts have the power
 to declare strikes illegal. The Government may also declare the "civil mobilization"
 of workers in case of danger to national security, life, or property, or the social and
 economic life of the country. The ILO believes this "civil mobilization* power violates
 the standards of ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association, and the ILO Commit-
 tee of Experts criticized it. The Government did not resort to civil mobilization dur-
 ing the strikes in August and September but instead used soldiers to drive some
 Athens city buses.

 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted in 1989 roviding for mediation proce-
 dures, with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. In 1991 the Ministry of Labor
 completed work on implementing procedures, and the legislation establishing a na-
 tional mediation, reconciliation, and arbitration organization went into effect in Jan-
 uary 1992. A government decree in early 1992 suspending annual negotiations be-
 tween public sector unions and public enterprises on wage levels and increases di-
 minished the scpe of the organization. This decree was the basis for a complaint
 lodged with the  he       tSEE for violation of ILO Conventions 98 and 87. These
 negotiations were suse nded because of a government-mandatd wage freeze in the
 public sector. The GSE also filed complaints for violation of the same L Conven-
 tions in September. These complaints concern legislation amending the election sys-
 tem in the journalists' union, limiting paid leave for trade union activities in the
 public sector, and recognizing the right of employers to denounce retroactively col-
 lective bargaining agreements that have been ratified by law. The ILO had not
 ruled on these complaints by the end of the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation passed in 1955
 and amended in 1990 ensures the right to organize and bargain collectively. There
 are no restrictions on collective bargaining for private sector employees. Having no
 formal system of collective bargaining, civil servants collectively negotiate their de-
 mands with the Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister, with which the final
 decision rests.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspetorate or the courts in-
 vestigate and work to resolve complaints of discrimination against union members
 or organizers. Court rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired
 union organizers. Greece has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor ti-Forned or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment   of Chidren.-The minimum age for employment
 in the industrial sector is 15, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum
 age is 12 in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are en-
 forced by occasional Labor nspectorate spot checks and are generally respected.
 However, families engaged in agriculture, food service, or merchandising often have
 younger family members assistingthem, at least part-time.
 e. Acceptabe Conditions of Worl.-tThe minimum wage is determined through col-
 lective bargaining between the GSEE and the empoyers' association. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all Greek workers. The minimum wage is sufficient for a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family.
 The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sector and 37  hours
 in the ublic sector. A 1989 law permitted more flexibility in business hours, pro-
 vided tbat the average workweek did not exceed the leg maximum over a period
 of time. A law that took effect in 1992 broadened this provision by significantly ex-
 tending legal operating hours for retail establishments. The law mandates paid va-
 cation of   i month per year and sets limits on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterizes health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charges that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, is inad-
 equate. After an explosion and fire at a petroleum refinery in September in which
 14 people were killed, the GSEE cited statistics indicating a fairly high number of
 job-related accidents in Greece over the past 20 years. Inadequate inspection, failure
 to enforce regulations, outdated industrial plants and equipment, and poor safety
 training of employees contribute to the accident rate.
