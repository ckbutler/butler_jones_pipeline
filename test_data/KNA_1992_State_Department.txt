 ST. KrTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations is a small two-
 island state with a democratic, parliamentary form of government. hIe Constitution
 provides the smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the Federation if certain enumerated procedures are followed.
 The country is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet, and a Legislative Assem-
 bly. The Governor General, with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of
 State. The Constitution requires general elections at least every 5 years. Elections
 were last held in 1989, again won by Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds and
 his People's Action Movement.
 Security forces consist of a small lice force, which includes a 50-person Specal
 Service Unit that receives some light infantry training, and a small Coast Guard.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane, tourism, and ight
 industry. Most commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar indutry
 (the ountry's largest economic enterprise) and 85 perent of all arable land are
 owned by a state corporation. Economic grwth improved in 1992, registering over
 6 percent. This exceptional growth was due partly to the success of a major resort
 hotel in Nqevis and to investor onfidence in plans to further develop the southeast-
 ern peninsula and a deep water port facility.
 Human rights ontinued to be generally respected durin. 1992, although the Gov-
 ernment continued to restrict access of the opposition politica party to government-
 controlled media.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that every person ac-
 cused of a crime must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these require-

 sistance is available for indigent defendants.

 However, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St. Kitts,
 and these media generally do not publicize adequately rallies and conventions held
 by the opposition political party, There is a religious television station and a pri-
 vately-owned radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, although each of the major
 political parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. The papers are free to
 criticize the Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International news
 publications are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meet-
 ings sponsored by political parties occur regularly, usually taking place without gov-
 ernment interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. Most church members belong to Protestant
 denominations. All groups are free to maintain links with coreligionists in other
 countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel inside and outside the country is unrestricted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are able to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty political system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot.
 Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' People's Action Movement (PAM) holds a ma-
 jority of seats in Parliament. However, on Nevis, Vance Amory and the Concerned
 Citizens' Movement won control of the Nevis Assembly in June, defeating the Nevis
 Reformation Party which was closely allied with the PAM.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed to date. There were no requests for investigations or visits by inter-
 national human rights groups in 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There were no reports of systematic discrimination based on race, sex, creed, Ian-
 guage, or social status. The role of women in society is not restricted by law. How-
 ever, the role of most women in the country is still circumscribed by culture and
 tradition. The Government created the Ministry of Women's Affairs to help redefine
 the role of women in society and to ensure that women's rights are promoted. Ac-
 cording to a Ministry official, violence against women is a problem, but gauing the
 extent of the problem is difficult because many women are reluctant to file com-
 plaints or pursue them in the courts. Despite this reluctance, there were publicly
 reported cases of both domestic violence and rape in 1992 and a few convictions. A
 special police unit works closely with the Ministry of Women's Affairs to investigate
 domestic violence and rape cases.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs, headed by Constance Mitchum, a lawyer and
 St. Kitts' only female Member of Parliament, continues to be active in counseling
 abused women, as well as in other aspects of women's rights.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The major labor union, the St. Kitts Trades
 and Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St. Kitts Labour Party and is
 active in all sectors of the economy. Membership appears to be declining, however,
 as the Government assumes some of the social welfare roles formerly played by
 unions. There is also an independent teachers' union, a union representing dock-
 workers in the capital city, and a taxi-drivers' association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes in 1992. Unions are free to form federations
 or confederations and to affiliate with international organizations. The islands'
 unions maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. There is no
 legislation governing the organization and representation of workers, and employers
 are not legally bound to recognize a union, but in practice employers do so if a ma-
 jority of workers polled wish to organize. Collective bargaining takes place on a
 
 
 485
 workplace-by-workplace basis, not unionor industry-wide. The Labour Commission
 is prepared to mediate all types of disputes, including wages, rights or interests, be-
 tween labor and management on an ad hoc basis. In p racice, however, few disputes
 actually go to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the
 Minister of Labour can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be
 brought before a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoriy Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of ChIdn.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14. The Labour Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the Commu-
 nity Affairs Division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. Local law
 mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acce tabe Conditions of Work-Minimum wage rates for domestic servants
 and retail store employees were established by law in 1984 and updated in 1989.
 These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a wage earner and family
 many _workers supplement wages by keeping small animals such as goats and chick-
 ens. Moat people live in extended families where there may be mere than one wage
 earner. The Labour Commission undertakes regular wage inspections and special
 investigations when complaints are received; employers found in violation are re-
 quired to pay back wages.
 The standarld workweek, although not legally mandated, is 40 hours in 5 days.
 Workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. While there are
 no specific health and safety regulations, the Factories Law provides general health
 and safety guidance to Labour Ministry inspectors.
