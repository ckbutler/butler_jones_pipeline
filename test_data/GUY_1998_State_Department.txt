 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana is a small nation making a slow transition
 to democracy. It has a multiparty political system based on proportional representa-
 tion. Citizens directly elect the President, but indirectly elect a 65-member unicam-
 eral parliament. The President appoints a prime minister and a cabinet. In Decem-
 ber 1997, citizens voted in free, fair, and nonviolent national elections. The Peoples'
 Progressive Party (PPP) and its Civic (C) partner won a parliamentary majority and
 PPP/C candidate Janet Jagan, widow of the late President Cheddi Jagan, was sworn
 in as President. The People's National Congress (PNC), the main opposition party,
 alleged that the elections were fraudulent and refused to recognize Janet Jagan as
 President, despite a preponderance of evidence compiled by several international ob-
 server groups and by a special Caribbean Community (Caricom) audit team, which
 indicated that the elections were free of manipulation. The PNC refused for seven
 months to take its seats in Parliament and mounted an antigovernment campaign
 of illegal street demonstrations in January and again in June. The demonstrations
 turned violent on a number of occasions. The judiciary, although constitutionally
 independent, is inefficient and often appears subject to government influence.
 The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) and the Guyana Police Force (GPF) are under
 civilian control. The GPF has the authority to make arrests and maintains law and
 order throughout the country. The GDF is a professional military responsible for na-
 tional defense, internal security, and emergency response. The President deployed
 
 
 649
 the GDF in January and again in June to help the police maintain public order and
 to control the PNC-led street demonstrations. In general, the security forces showed
 professionalism and restraint in attempting to control the demonstrations, even
 when opposition supporters turned violent or provocative. However, on some occa-
 sions, members of the police committed human rights abuses.
 Guyana is a very poor country. The economy, which for years was centrally
 planned and controlled, is based on a mix of private and state enterprises. Rice,
 sugar, bauxite, and gold are the major exports. Annual economic growth had aver-
 aged more than 6 percent over the previous 4 years. However, in 1998 this rate fell
 to less than 2 percent, hurt by poor weather and by an unstable business climate
 brought about by political unrest. The agricultural sector brings in a large portion
 of the nation's annual foreign exchange earnings, and the slowdown hurt the Gov-
 ernment's ability to service its high external debt. Per capita gross domestic product
 is estimated at $808, and over half the population lives in poverty. There are severe
 shortages of skilled labor, and the economy is constrained by an inadequate and
 poorly maintained infrastructure for transportation, power distribution, flood con-
 trol, and communications.
 Although the Government's human rights record improved slightly, serious prob-
 lems remained. The police continued to commit extrajudicial killings; however, they
 committed fewer such killings than in previous years, and police abuse of suspects
 also declined. The authorities took some steps to investigate these abuses more ef-
 fectively and brought charges against some individual policemen accused of killings.
 However, the Police Commissioner did not always comply with court orders and in
 general the police continued to commit abuses with impunity. Prison conditions are
 poor. The inefficient judicial system results in long delays in trial and lengthy pre-
 trial detention. Politically motivated bombings and opposition-led street demonstra-
 tions resulted in physical attacks on journalists and other citizens and caused one
 death. In addition, members of both major political parties engaged in propaganda
 that exacerbated racial tensions and social insecurity. Other human rights problems
 included societal discrimination against women and indigenous Amerindians, vio-
 lence against women and children, and incidents of discrimination stemming from
 the racial tensions between Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one politically motivated
 killing. On January 5, during a period marked by social unrest and political street
 demonstrations, a bomb attack on the studio of the National Television Network-
 a private television broadcasting company supportive of the governing PPP/C-
 killed 34-year-old security guard Seudyal Singh. The owner of the station issued a
 press statement indicating that he and his family had received death threats from
 a PNC activist prior to the incident. A police investigation failed to identify the per-
 petrator.
 In addition, police committed extrajudicial killings, although fewer than in pre-
 vious years. The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) reported that police
 killed 9 civilians through August, compared with 27 in 1997 and 18 in 1996.
 On June 19, police officers shot and killed 27-year-old Victor "Junior" Bourne in
 his home. According to police reports, officers shot and killed Bourne after he fired
 a weapon at them when they entered his bedroom. However, Bourne's wife and
 neighbors told local reporters that the police forcibly entered the house, executed
 Bourne in his bed, and then fired a shot into the wall in order to explain their use
 of lethal force. Although official police sources alleged that Bourne was wanted for
 robbery and drug trafficking, no arrest warrant had been issued against Bourne.
 The local press reported that Bourne had participated in an attempt to kill police
 superintendent Leon Fraser, and that Fraser ordered his execution in retaliation.
 In June a magistrate's court responded to pressure from Bourne's family's attorney
 by ordering a special coroner's inquest into his death. Chief magistrate Paul Fung-
 a-fat assumed the functions of coroner on a special basis for the case. At year's end,
 Fung-a-fat's inquest was in progress, but no public statements had been released.
 In July plainclothes police officers shot and killed 27-year-old George Jeffers. Eye-
 wituesses alleged that the officers, under the influence of alcohol, intervened in an
 altercation at a public dance and then used excessive force when Jeffers resisted ar-
 rest. The Police Commissioner convened a board of inquiry into the shooting and,
 on October 28, announced that the authorities had arrested constable Carlyle
 Alleyne and charged him with killing Jeffers. They also charged two other police
 with assault in connection with the case.
 
 
 650
 Some progress was made toward resolving the 1997 case of Adam Hescott, an es-
 caped prisoner whom police shot and killed. Again under pressure from a private
 attorney hired by Hescotes family, the courts charged corporal Ewart Hutson in the
 case and began hearing testimony in October.
 On November 24, a jury found constable Ridley Halley and corporal Jacqueline
 Charles guilty of the 1996 killing Ulric Lynch, a GDF soldier. The police officers
 shot Lynch, who was off duty, following an altercation outside a nightclub. This was
 the first time since independence that a court convicted a police officer of an
 extrajudicial killing or other major human rights abuse; however, the court did not
 sentence the convicted officers to any jail time.
 The GPF's standing orders officially permit the use of firearms only when other
 means have been exhausted. However, many justice authorities and human rights
 activists say that because of rising crime and pressure from urban businesses, which
 are often the targets of criminals, the Government has taken a lax attitude toward
 investigation of alleged police abuses. In general, police abuses are committed with
 impunity. The statutorily independent Police Complaints Authority (PCA) is re-
 quired to transmit all complaints to the Police Commissioner. Both human rights
 groups and the PCA have criticized the Commissioner for his failure to investigate
 these complaints properly. Even when police officers do face charges, most of the
 cases are heard by lower magistrate courts, where other specially trained-police offi-
 cers serve as the prosecutors. As a result, human rights activists question officers'
 commitment to prosecuting their own colleagues.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, the GHRA reported one incident in
 1998. In May police officers allegedly apprehended Mark Brown and took him to an
 unoccupied residence to interrogate him regarding the whereabouts of two wanted
 men. The GHRA reported that when Brown refused to disclose the location of the
 two men, the police beat him, pinned him on the floor, and threw acid on his chest,
 armpits, and genitals. At -year's end, the PCA claimed to be investigating Brown's
 allegations of police brutality.
 From 1995 to 1997, the GHRA received an average of 20 complaints per year from
 victims who had been beaten by police while in custody. In 1998 the GHRA reported
 a significant drop in direct complaints against police, with only the Mark Brown
 case having been reported as of September. However, inmates, attorneys, and judi-
 cial authorities provided credible evidence that police frequently turned a blind eye
 while other inmates beat, robbed, or otherwise mistreated "problematic" prisoners.
 The GHRA also reported fewer incidents of nonlethal police shootings in 1998. How-
 ever, in July police mistook Shawn Mohamed for a thief and shot him at his resi-
 dence. Mohamed recovered, and although no compensation was made, the GPF later
 released a statement regretting the incident and apologizing to the victim.
 Although the PCA is the principal body charged with looking into complaints of
 police brutality or abuse, it has no power to interview police officers or witnesses
 and must rely on material submitted by the police. The PCA refers cases of alleged
 abuse to the Police Commissioner. Investigations of such charges rarely result in se-
 rious disciplinary action, and most police abuses are committed with impunity. Offi-
 cers charged as a result of complaints to the PCA are routinely suspended for a few
 days and sometimes fined, but rarely jailed. Critics of this process complain that the
 police force is responsible for investigating itself.
 Georgetown's Camp Street prison, the country's largest, is extremely overcrowded.
 For most of the year, Camp Street held between 900 and 1,100 prisoners in space
 initially designed to hold 350. However, conditions in Camp Street improved some-
 what and no longer appear to be life-threatening. Conditions in the country's four
 smaller prisons generally are adequate. The only women's prison is at New Amster-
 dam, in a facility that holds men and women in separate dormitry-type buildings.
 In 1997, when the Director of Prisons reported that a prisoner had died in part due
 to overcrowding at the Camp Street prison, the Government responded by assigning
 more full-time nurse practitioners and pharmacists to the prison system and by re-
 quiring that doctors visit prisons more regularly. Prison directors and inmates re-
 ported that over the course of the year, medical coverage improved. The authorities
 reported no deaths related to prison conditions during the year. However, the GHRA
 still questioned the Governments commitment and continued to push it to improve
 health care in the prison system.
 In addition to overcrowding and a lack of medical personnel, poor staff morale is
 a serious problem within the prison system. Prison staffers are poorly paid and their
 salaries and benefits do not compensate for the on-the-job risks. Prison officials lob-
 bied the Government for increased funding to improve prison conditions. Prison offi-
 
 
 651
 cials encouraged efforts by local and international nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) to improve physical and sanitary conditions.
 Although sanitary and medical conditions in police station temporary holding fa-
 cilities vry, in almost all cases these conditions are -worse than those in the prisons.
 Some such jails are bare, overcrowded, and damp. Few have beds, wash basins, fur-
 niture, or utensils. Meals are normally unavailable; friends and relatives must bring
 detainees food and water. Cells rarely have sanitary facilities, and inmates are
 sometimes escorted by staff members outside the cells to use holes in the floor for
 toilets. Inmates generally sleep on a thin pallet on the concrete floor. Conditions in
 the East La Penitence police jail, where female prisoners are held until sentencing,
 are below the standard of the other jails and prisons in the country. The Brickdam
 lock-up in Georgetown has poor sanitation and dangerous conditions. One cell with-
 out plumbing or other facilities typically holds up to 30 detainees and is often the
 site of violence between inmates. Although precinct jails are intended to serve only
 as pretrial holding areas, some suspects have been detained there as long as 4
 years, waiting for the overburdened judicial system to take action on their cases.
 Prison officials were receptive to local and international NGO's requests to enter
 and inspect prison facilities. The GHRA participates as a member of the prisons' vis-
 iting committee, which investigates prisoner complaints, inspects diets, reviews pri-
 mary medical care services, and provides recommendations to prison authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that the authorities gen-
 erally respected in practice.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official. Police may arrest
 without a wa-rant when an officer witnesses a crime or at the officer's discretion
 in instances where there is good cause to suspect that a crime or a breach of the
 g eace has been or will be committed. The law requires that a person arrested and
 eld for more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Bail is gen-
 erally available, except in capital offense cases. In narcotics cases, magistrates have
 limited discretion in granting bail before trial but must remand persons convicted
 on narcotics crimes into custody, even if an appeal is pending.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial ofair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, law enforcement officials and prominent lawyers questioned the
 independence of the judiciary and accused the Government of intervening in certain
 criminal and civil cases. There are no institutional checks on the President or the
 ruling party when they seek to influence judges. However, the Government gen-
 erally respects the independence of the judiciary in human rights cases.
 The court system is composed of a High Court (the Supreme Court of Judicature),
 an appeals court, and a system of magistrate courts.
 Magistrates are members of the civil service and are trained lawyers. The mag-
 istrate courts deal with both criminal and civil matters. The Ministry of Legal Af-
 fairs headed by the Attorney General is the principal legal advisor to the State. The
 Director of Public Prosecution is statutorily independent and can file legal charges
 against offenders. The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law. This right is respected in prac-
 tice.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are caused by shortages of trained court personnel
 and magistrates, inadequate resources, postponements at the request of the defense
 or prosecution, occasional alleged acts of bribery, and the slowness of police in pre-
 paring cases for trial. The inefficiency of the judicial system is so great as to under-
 mine due process. The GHRA asserted that prisoners are often detained for 3 or 4
 years while awaiting trial; however, the authorities denied that delays were this
 long. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal may be made to higher
 courts. Appeals of some murder cases have experienced long delays. Trial postpone-
 ments are routinely granted to both the defense and the prosecution. However, pro-
 grams designed to improve legal structures, reform judicial procedures, upgrade
 technical capabilities, and improve efficiency of the courts are having a positive ef-
 fect.
 Although the law recognizes the right to legal counsel, in practice, with the excep-
 tion of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford to pay. There is
 no public defender system. The Georgetown Legal Aid Clinic, with public and pri-
 vate support, provides advice to persons who cannot afford a lawyer, with a special
 interest in cases of violence against women and criminal cases related to civil cases
 in such matters (e.g., assault as part of a divorce case). The Government provides
 a small cash grant for the clinic as well as the services of a lawyer from the Attor-
 ney General's office. Apart from these efforts, very few lawyers provide free services
 
 
 in criminal cases. Defendants in murder cases who need a lawyer are assigned an
 attorney by the court. The Guyana Association of Women Lawyers provides free
 legal services for civil cases only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respects them
 in practice. Law enforcement officials must obtain legal warrants before searching
 private homes or properties. Although the authorities generally respected these re-
 quirements, there were numerous reports of police officers searching homes without
 warrants, particularly in neighborhoods where narcotics trafficking is a problem.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Piess.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Citizens
 openly criticize the Government and its policies.
 The independent Stabroek News continued to publish daily, and a wide range of
 religious groups, political parties, and journalists publish a lively variety of pri-
 vately owned weekly newspapers. The overnment's daily newspaper, the Guyana
 Chronicle, covers a broad spectrum of political and nongovernmental groups. How-
 ever, throughout the year the Chronicle typically displayed a clear antiopposition
 bias.
 While the printed press flourished, a growing number of journalists charged the
 Government with failure to respect freedom of the electronic media. The Govern-
 ment owns and operates the country's three radio stations. There are no private
 radio stations, and private interests continued to allege that the Government either
 denied or failed to respond to more than 20 requests for radio frequency authoriza-
 tions. The Government maintained that it is unable to grant frequencies to private
 stations because there is no legislation governing their allocation. However, despite
 a similar lack of legislation to govern television frequencies, there were 17 independ-
 ent television stations in addition to the government station.
 The Ministry of Information censors the Internet and restricts public access to a
 variety of sites.
 In January and again in June, as part of a series of public protests (see Sections
 2.b., 3, and 5), supporters of the opposition PNC intimidated, harassed, and on one
 occasion beat journalists who were attempting to cover events. In the most serious
 incident, supporters who had gathered at PNC headquarters in June physically at-
 tacked journalists Ajai Baksh and Michelle Elphage and smashed their camera
 equipment.
 The Government -respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right. The Public
 Order Act requires police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commis-
 sioner has the authority to refuse permission for a public meeting if he believes that
 it will provoke a breach of the peace. In cases of refusal, applicants can appeal to
 the Minister of Home Affairs whose decision on the matter is final. When author-
 ized, political parties and other groups held public meetings and rallies throughout
 the country without hindrance.
 For several days in January and again in June, the PNC organized a series of
 unauthorized protests that intimidated citizens and disrupted business and govern-
 ment operations (see Section 3). Security forces made responsible attempts to con-
 tain these illegal gatherings, but on January 12 the protests turned violent. PNC
 supporters smashed shop windows, looted, and beat citizens (who were primarily of
 Indian origin) (see Section 5). The Government responded by placing a moratorium
 on public gatherings and marches. On January 14, the PNC organized a massive,
 peaceful march in direct defiance of this government order.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Members of all faiths are allowed to wor-
 ship freely, and there are no restrictions on foreign religious proselytizing.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission; the result of a law dat-
 ing from colonial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. In
 practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas without regard to the
 formality of a permit. Citizens are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to return.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian-organizations in assisting ref-
 
 
 ugees. The Government does not have a fixed policy on refugees or asylum but is
 studying draft model legislation prepared by the UNHCR. The issue of provision of
 first asylum did not arise; there were no reports of the forced return of persons to
 a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens enjoy this right and exercised it in free, fair, and nonviolent elections
 held in December 1997, which were nonetheless protested by the opposition. There
 is a multiparty political system based on proportional representation. Voters directly
 elect the President to a five year term of office, but indirectly elect the unicameral
 Parliament. Any citizen 18 years or older can register to vote. The presidential can-
 didate who wins a plurality of the popular vote also obtains a percentage of seats
 in Parliament equal to the percentage of the popular vote received. The political
 parties then decide who will hold the seats. A party leader can remove one of his
 party's members of Parliament and replace them at any time for any reason. The
 President appoints a cabinet and a Prime Minister who, with the President, exercise
 executive power. Citizens are free to join or support political parties of their choice
 and established nearly 20 new ones in 1996.
 Since Parliament is always controlled by the party in power, the legislature typi-
 cally provides only a limited check on the executive's power. Party leaders are free
 to hire and fire parliamentary representatives at will. If a Member of Parliament
 acts in accordance with constituents' wishes, but against the wishes of the party's
 leadership, he or she risks being dismissed.
 Guyana is a racially divided society in which the political party structure polar-
 izes the main ethnic groups. Winner-take-all elections exacerbate these tensions. In
 addition to choosing a president in December 1997, voters elected a new parliament,
 in which four political parties were represented. The two majorparties-the PPP
 and the PNC-are largely formed by Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese, respec-
 tively. As was the case during national elections in 1992, local and foreign independ-
 ent observers judged the election to be free and fair. However, the leader of the PNC
 stated that his party would not accept the election results, alleging that they were
 rigged. The PNC initiated court action and called on its supporters to demonstrate
 in the streets. In October the court began hearing testimony in the PNC case. It
 had not reached a verdict by year's end.
 These demonstrations became violent, with PNC supporters committing abuses of
 other citizens' rights (see Sections 2.b. and 5). In late January, a high-level Caricom
 delegation brokered an end to the civil unrest by striking a deal between the leaders
 of the PPP/C and the PNC. The accord called for institutional changes including
 constitutional reform and new elections within 3, rather than the normal 5, years.
 Also as part of this agreement, a Caricom team conducted an independent audit of
 the election results. Its report, released in June, found no evidence of electoral ma-
 nipulation or frand, corroborating similar appraisals from several international ob-
 server teams. Nevertheless, the PNC remained unmoved by Caricom's findings and
 returned to the streets. When the June protests also turned violent (see Section
 2.a.), Caricom again intervened to broker a second truce. In accordance with agree-
 ments signed in January and June by President Jagan- and PNC leader Desmond
 Hoyte, an extra-Parliamentary Constitutional Reform Commission (CRC) is to
 present a new draft constitution to Parliament and to the public no later than July
 1999. However, it took Parliament nearly eight months to agree on a formula to de-
 termine the CRC's composition and members had not yet been named by year's end,
 casting doubt on its ability to meet the deadline.
 There are no legal impediments to participation of women or minorities in the po-
 litical process, but women are underrepresented in government and politics. The 19-
 person cabinet includes 3 women, and the country's second-highest judge is a
 woman. The 72-member Parliament includes 12 women and 10 Amerindians, rep-
 resenting both major parties. As a result of the December 1997 elections, for the
 first time the President is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference. The GHRA is a nongovernmental orga-
 nization formed in 1979 with the participation of trade unions, professional organi-
 zations, various ethnic groups, and churches. It issues periodic press releases and
 publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. Various local church and
 neighborhood groups formed to criticize the Government's human rights policies or
 to demand action; the Government did not hinder their activities. Members of the
 
 
 654
 Government openly discussed human rights issues and made public statements in
 response to foreign and local human rights reports. The authorities did not interfere
 with the activities of human rights groups.
 In an effort to curtail appeals by death row inmates, on November 17 the govern-
 ing PPP/C forced a motion through Parliament authorizing the Government to with-
 draw from the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. Foreign Minister Rohee said the Government would reaccede to the protocol
 with reservations specifying that the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 would not have jurisdiction over death penalty cases.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status   -
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons regardless of race,
 sex, religion, or national origin. However, the Government does not always enforce
 these provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women, including domestic violence, is widespread.
 Rape, particularly of gis and young women, is common but still infrequently re-
 ported or prosecuted. Health professionals and NGO's report a high incidence of in-
 cest. Lawyers say that while more victims are reporting these crimes to the authori-
 ties, there is still a social stigma applied to the victim for doing so. Despite efforts
 by NGO's and the Department of Public Prosecutions to sensitize police officers to
 domestic violence, the police are often hesitant to interfere in cases of domestic dis-
 putes.
 In 1996 Parliament passed the Domestic Violence Act. In addition to defining do-
 mestic violence and establishing it as a crime, the legislation gives women the right
 to seek prompt protection. Magistrates can issue interim protection orders when a
 victim of abuse, a police officer, or a social worker fills out an application for protec-
 tion. A magistrate then evaluates the case and decides whether or not to replace
 interim orders with permanent orders. The Domestic Violence Act allows victims to
 seek protection, occupation, or tenancy orders. Protection orders prohibit abusers
 from being anywhere that the applicant lives, works, visits, or attends school. Occu-
 pation orders allow the victim and any children to remain at a home previously
 shared with an abuser, while the abuser must leave. Similarly, tenancy orders re-
 quire an abuser to leave a rented dwelling and continue to pay some or all of the
 rent.
 Although local NGO's that address the issue of domestic violence are relatively
 new, they work effectively together under tight budget constraints. While NGO's
 consider the Domestic Violence Act a positive step, they claim that it has had little
 effect on the overall situation of domestic violence in society. NGO's report that do-
 mestic violence crosses racial and socioeconomic lines. According to Help and Shelter
 (H&S), the first local NGO dedicated to fighting domestic violence, societal reeduca-
 tion is required in order to sensitize persons to domestic violence. As of July, H&S
 had counseled 843 people since it began offering counseling services in November
 1995. H&S reported that 62 percent of its cases involved spousal abuse and 10 per-
 cent involved child abuse. Another 10 percent of cases reported to H&S were rape
 cases and the vast majority of these-78 percent-were reported by victims age 16
 and under.
 In 1997 Parliament approved the Antidiscrimination Act, -which builds upon the
 prOvisions of the 1990 Equal Rights Act. The two laws provide a strengthened
 amework under which women and minorities may seek redress for discriminatory
 acts or practices. However, no case has ever been tried under the Equal Rights Act,
 and critics of the Antidiscrimination Act claim that the new laws are unlikely to
 be effective since the act-places enforcement responsibilities on the overburdened
 Chief Labor Officer. There is no legal protection against sexual harassment in the
 workplace. Legislation prohibits dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy, and dismis-
 sal on such grounds does not occur in practice. The Women's Affairs Bureau of the
 Ministry of Labor, Human Services, and Social Security monitors the legal rights
 of women. In December 1997, the Government opened the Women's Leadership In-
 stitute, which seeks to provide training and promote greater participation by women
 in government and the private sector.
 Legislation passed by Parliament in 1990 protects women's property rights in
 common law marriages and entitles a woman who separates or divorces to one-half
 the couple's property if she had been working and one-third of the property if she
 had been a housewife. Divorce by consent remains illegal. Legislation also gives au-
 thority to the courts to overturn a man's will in the event that it does not provide
 for his wife, as long as she was dependent on him -for financial support.
 Children.-At least half of the population lives in poverty, andchildren are more
 severely affected than any other group. Although the Government provides free edu-
 
 
 655
 cation through secondary school, the severe deterioration of the public education and
 health care systems has stunted children's futures. The public health system is in-
 adequate, and private health care is unaffordable for many children. Children are
 often not given the opportunity to attend school because their families need them
 to contribute to the household by working or providing child care.
 Concern continues to rise over the effects of domestic violence on children. Al-
 though the GHRA reported no deaths from child abuse in 1998, law enforcement
 officials stated that the vast majority of criminal child abuse cases went unreported.
 Media reports of rape and incest further indicated that violence against childen is
 a significant problem. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
 office, a disturbing aspect is the concept of the "girl child," in which teenage girls
 trade sexual favors for money, a practice condoned by their parents yet obscured by
 cultural norms. In a relatedpractice, parents demand monetary compensation fol-
 lowing the rape of a teng   aughter.    ofiesrscalwkrstflen
 The Domestic Violence  ct allows p     c                              appli-
 cation on behalf of an abused child.However, the administration of justice for chil-
 dren is characterized by a lack of social services or trained experts to deal with chil-
 dren fleeing sexual, physical, or emotional abuse. Many children also suffer from ne-
 glect or abandonment in a society where 3 percent of th population emigrates each
 year, often leaving children behind.
 People With Disabilities.-The lack of appropriate infrastructure to provide access
 to both public and private facilities makes it very difficult to employ the disabled
 outside their homes. There is no law mandating provision of access for people with
 disabilities.
 There are several special schools and training centers for the disabled, but they
 lack trained staff and are in disrepair.
 Indigenous People.-The small Anerindian population, which consists of nine trib-
 al groups, constitutes about 7 percent of the population. Most live in reservations
 and i    cages in remote parts of the interior. Their standard of iving is much lower
 than that of most citizens, and their ability to participate in decisions affecting their
 lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources is limited.
 Anerindian life is regulated by the Amerindian Act, legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. The act gives the
 Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and what is an Aner-
 indian community, to appoint Amerindian leaders, and to annul decisions made by
 Amerindian councils. It also prohibits the sale of alcohol to Amerindians and re-
 quires government permission before any Amerindia     n accept formal employ-
 ment, although these provisions generally are not enforced. Both individuals and
 Amerindian groups remain free to criticize the Government. In 1998 the Ministry
 of Amerindian Affairs admitted that the Aerindian Act is antiquated and ex-
 pressed a commitment to update it.
 The Governent has long maintained that it is committed to demarcate lands
 that have traditionally been the homes of Anerindians. However, the Government
 holds title to almost all the nation's land and is free to  as it wishes without con-
 sultation. The Government identified a total of 75 villages and reported that it had
 successfully demarcated the lands of 11 Amerindian communities by July. The Min-
 isr of Amerindian Affairs claimed that, in close consultation with Amerindian
 leaders, it would demarcate a total of 20 villages by year's end and another 20 in
 1999. However, local Amerindian NGO's regarded government consultations with
 Amerindians as mere public relations exercises and demarcation as a means of con-
 fining Amerindian communities so that the rest of what Amerindians considered to
 be their land could be offered as concessions to miners and loggers. (Most of the de-
 marcated titles to land were granted decades ago under the Amerindian Act and did
 not allow for the growth of Amerindian communities.) The Amerindian NGO's
 claimed that Amerindian leaders were not consulted properly and were pressured
 into uninformed decisions. The Government maintained that it would consider
 granting additional land rights to those communities that agreed to have their lands
 emarcated in 1998. However, as of year's end, the Government had taken no action
 to do so.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Longstanding ethnic tensions, primarily be-
 tween citizens of African and Indian descent, continued to influence society and po-
 litical life. Historical patterns of social organization have resulted in social and po-
 litical organizations coalescing around ethnic groups. This pattern of racial and eth-
 nic grouping has become politicized over the years, polarizing society along ethnic
 lines. Discrimination and exclusion continue to occur.
 These longstanding ethnic tensions were seriously exacerbated in the aftermath
 of the December 1997 election. Members of both the largely Indo-Guyanese PPP and
 the largely Afro-Guyanese PNC engaged in rhetoric and propaganda that fueled ra-
 
 
 cial tensions. In public statements PNC leader Desmond Hoyte frequently accused
 the PPP/C Government of carrying out a "systematic campaign of victimization and
 discrimination" against Afro-Guyanese. While incidents of discrimination did occur,
 Hoyte's exaggerated allegation of a systematic campaign fueled tensions between
 the Indo-Guyanese and Ar-uyanese communities. Some Indo-Guyanese citizens
 formed the Guyana Indian Foundation Trust, a group that claimed to promote legal
 and physical protection for the Indo-Guyanese community.
 The civil service and defense and police forces are overwhnelmingly stafed by lAfro-
 Guyanese. Recrnitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guyanese candidates for the uni-
 formed services generally have met with an unenthusiastic response, with most
 qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates opting for a business or professional career over
 military, police, or public service. However, in the aftermath of the 1997 election,
 the Government stepped up its efforts to recruit Indo-Guyanese for the security
 forces. The chief of staff of the Guyana Defence Force is Indo-Guyanese and there
 are other Indo-Guyanes officers in both the GDF and the police force. The Govern-
 ment sponsored various forums for discussion of racial problems and to promote in-
 clusion. It supported the work of NGO's that deal with these concerns.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of association
 and specifically enumerates workers' rights to form or belong to trade unions. In No-
 vember 1997, the Government enacted the Trade Unions Recognition Law, which re-
 quires employers to recognize the union chosen by a majority of the workers; the
 law is to take effect in 1999. "
 A pproximately 34 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union members
 work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises. Organized labor freely as-
 sociates in one major national federation, the Guyana Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), which is composed of 22 unions. There is a tradition of close ties between
 the trade union movement and political parties.
 Historically, the two major political parties wielded significant influence over the
 leadership of several unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles as
 party officials. This occasionally led to overt politicization of labor issues. For exam-
 ple, the Guyana Public Service Union organized a strike of customs employees in
 November, with explicit political support from the opposition PNC.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike. Strikes can be declared ie-
 gal if the union leadership did not approve them, or they did not meet the require-
 ments specified in collective bargaining agreements. Public employees providing es-
 sential services may strike if they provide the proper notice to the Ministry of Labor
 and leave a skeletal staff in place. There were few strikes in 1998, and none of those
 that did occur were prolonged or considered to be illegal.
 There is no legislation prohibiting retaliation against strikers or antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers. However, this principle is always included in the terms
 of resumption after a strike. Thenew recognition law defines and places limits on
 the retaliatory, actions employers. may-take against strikcers. Arbitration rulings,
 whenever agreed toby the contending parties, are legally enforceable.
 Unions and their federations freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean
 and international trade union and professional groups. All three of the major inter-
 national trade union federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Ministry of Labor certifies all collective bargaining agreements and
 has never refused to do so. Until enactment of the new bill, however, this right was
 not codified, and employers were not legally required to recognize unions or to bar-
 gain with them.
 Individual unions directly negotiate collective bargaining status, pursuant to the
 1993 repeal .of a regulation that required that all collective bargaining be negotiated
 through the TUC. Unions are dissatisfied with a provision granting the Ministry of
 Finance veto power over wage contracts negotiated by other ministries.
 The Chief Labor Officer and the staff of the Ministry of.Labor provide consults-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services.
 There are no ,export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 -or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it occurs. The Government pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employnent.-The Fac-
 tories Act and the Employment of Young Persons and Children Act set out mini-
 mum age requirements for employment of children. Legally, no person under age
 14 may be employed in any industrial undertaking and no person under age 16 may
 
 
 657
 be employed at night, except under regulated circumstances. The Government pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 The law permits children under age 14 to be employed only in enterprises in which
 members of the same family are employed. However, it is common to see very young
 children engaged in street trading in the capital. While cognizant of the situation,
 the Ministry of Labor does not employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws
 effectively. According to UNICEF, child labor in the informal sector is a problem,
 as is the practice of teenage girls trading sexual favors for money (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptabe Conditions of Work.-The Labour Act and the Wages Councils Act
 allow the Labor Minister to set minimum wages for various categories of private
 employers. However, there is no legislated private sector minimum wage. The mini-
 mum public sector wage is $63 (G$9,700) per month. Although enforcement mecha-
 nisms exist, it is difficult to put them into practice, and unorganized workers, par-
 ticularly women and children in the informal private sector, are often paid less than
 what is legally required. The legal minimum wage for the public sector is insuffi-
 cient to provide an adequate standard of living for worker and family.
 The Shops Act and the Factories Act set hours of employment; which vary by in-
 dustry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day or a 44-hour week
 requires payment of an overtime rate. However, if the initial contract stipulates a
 48-hour workweek, then the overtime rate applies only for hours worked in excess
 of 48 hours. The law does not provide for at least a 24-hour rest period.
 The Factories Act also sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Oc-
 cupational Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labor is charged with con-
 ducting factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out ths function. Workers canot remove them-
 selves fom dangerous work situations without jeopardizing continued employment.
