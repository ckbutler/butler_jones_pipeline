 ALGERIA
 President Liamine Zeroual, a former general, was elected in November 1995 to
 a 5-year term. Zeroual had previously served as president of a transition govern-
 ment established by the army in 1994, which included a National transition Council
 (CNT) as a surrogate parliament. The President controls defense and foreign policy,
 appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers, and may dissolve
 the legislature. The presidential election was competitive. Three opposition can-
 didates had some access to state-controlled television and radio anct also received
 heavy coverage in the independent press. According to government figures, Zeroual
 received 61 percent of the votes; losing candidates claimed that there were instances
 of fraud but did not contest Zerouars victory. The Government does not always re-
 spect the independence of the judiciary.
 After gaining independence in 1962, Algeria had a single-party state dominated
 by the ountys miitry leadership and supported by the bureaucracy and the Na-
 tional Liberation Front (FLN). Under the 1989 Constitution, there was to be a tran-
 sition to a pluralist republic with a strong president. The democratization process
 was suspene    and the FLNs rule ended in 1992 when the Army forced President
 Chadli Ben edid to resign, canceled the second round of parliamentary elections
 which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, and installed a ruling
 five-man High State Committee that banned the FIS and jailed many of its leaders.
 The cancellation of the elections in 1992 escalated fighting between the security
 forces and armed Islamist groups seeking to overthrow the Government and impose
 an Islamic state, which still continues.
 In a flawed popular referendum in November 1996, the Government obtained ap-
 proval of proposed changes to the Constitution, including provision of a secondpar-
 liamentary chamber and greater presidential authority. In June Algeria held its
 first parliamentary elections since January 1992, and elected the first multiparty
 Parliament in Algerian history. Provincial and municipal elections were held in Oc-
 tober. Although the election campaigns were marked by an increase in the openness
 of television and radio to political debate and discourse, international observers and
 political parties pointed out numerous problems with the conduct of the elections.
 The Government's security apparatus is composed of the army, air force, navy, the
 national gendarmerie, the national police, communal guards (a local police), and
 local self-defense forces. All of these elements are involved in counterinsurgency and
 counterterrorism operations and are under the control of the Government. The secu-
 rity forces were responsible for numerous serious human rights abuses.
 The economy is slowly developing from a state-administered to a market-oriented
 system. The Government has successfully implemented stabilization policies and
 structural reforms. However, privatization of state enterprises and the restructuring
 of the banking and housing construction sectors have just begun. Uncompetitive and
 unprofitable state enterprises constitute the bulk of the industrial sector. The state-
 owned petroleum sector's output represented about a quarter of national income and
 about 95 percent of export earnings in 1997. The agricultural sector, which produces
 grains, fruit, cattle, fibers, vegetables, and poultry, makes up 10 to 12 percent of
 the economy. Algeria is a middle-income country; annual per capita income was ap-
 proximately $1,600 in 1997. Officially, about 28 percent of the working-age popu-
 lation was unemployed in 1997, and about 70 percent of the people under the age
 of 30 could not find adequate employment. Some made a living from petty smug-
 gling or street peddling.
 The Government's human rights performance in 1997 reflected improvements in
 some areas, but serious human rights abuses continued. Citizens do not have the
 effective right peacefully to change their government. The security forces carried out
 extrajudicial killings, were responsible for numerous disappearances, routinely tor-
 tured or otherwise abused detainees, and arbitrarily arrested and detained or held
 (1403)
 
 
 1404
 incommunicado many individuals suspected of involvement with armed Islamist
 groups. On some occasions, security forces failed to intervene to prevent or halt
 massacres of civilians. Questions have been raised about security forces' indifference
 to, or complicity in, civilian deaths. Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, executive branch decrees restrict some of the judiciarys author-
 ity. Poor prison conditions, lengthy trial delays, illegal searches, and infringements
 on citizens' privacy rights also remained problems. The Government heavily
 censored news about security incidents and the armed groups. The Government also
 continued to restrict freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and movement.
 During the June legislative elections and the October municipal and provincial elec-
 tions, there were credible reports of irregularities such as government harassment
 of opposition party observers and fraud in vote-tally procedures. The Family Code
 limited women's civil rights, and domestic violence against women remained a seri-
 ous problem.
 Armed groups and terrorists also committed numerous serious abuses, killing
 thousands of civilians. Armed Islamists have conducted a widespread insurgency
 since legislative elections were canceled in January 1992. Islamist groups targeted
 government officials and families of security service members, as we? as people
 whose lifestyles they considered in conflict with Islamic values.
 Increasingly in 1997, armed groups massacred large groups of civilians, including
 infants, often in apparent retaliation against villages or families that had ceased
 providing support to them. Armed Islamists particularly targeted women; there
 were repeated instances of kidnapping and rape. Bombs left in cars, cafes, and mar-
 kets kiled and maimed people indscriminately. Some killings were also thought to
 arise from revenge, banditr, and .land grabs. By year's end, there were estimates
 that 6;000 to 7,000 people were killed in 1997, and that a total of 70,000 people had
 been killed during 6 years of turmoil.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were credible, reports that se-
 curity forces killed political opponents, particularly people suspected of being sym-
 pathizers of armed groups. In February Rachid Mujahid died while in police cus-
 tody. Authorities refused to release his body, which observers said bore marks of
 torture, to his family. Shortly after Algeria's top labor leader was killed in January,
 Mudjahid appeared on the government-owned television and claimed that he had
 been behind the killing. His claim appeared to have been made under duress. One
 week later, he was dead. In addition, there were credible reports that three citizens
 were killed by security forces in Beni Mered in February, that two citizens were
 killed by local self-defense forces in Tablat in March, and that a dozen citizens were
 killed by communal guards in el-Oumaria in April.
 There were also reports that on some occasions security forces failed to intervene
 to prevent or halt massacres of civilians. Questions have been raised about the secu-
 ri' forces indifference to, or complicity in, civilian deaths. Amnesty International
 reported that security forces did not intervene to stop the killings in three ter-
 rorist massacres near Algiers. In Has Rais on August 28, hundreds of persons were
 attacked, although an army barracks is about 300 feet away and other security
 forces were nearby. Security forces neither came to the assistance of the villagers
 nor apprehended the killers when they left. In Beni Messous on September 5, at
 least 60 persons were killed. When villagers telephoned the nearby army barracks
 for help, security forces refused to intervene, saying the matter was under the man-
 date of the gendarmerie. Telephone calls to the gendarmerie received no reply, and
 the attackers escaped' without any difficulty. In Bentalha on September 22, some
 200 persons were killed over the course of several hours. Survivors reported that
 security forces with armored vehicles were stationed outside the village and stopped
 some villagers trying to flee. However, the attackers were able to leave. The Govern-
 ment asserts that security forces cannot respond to attacks against civilians because
 an attack might be a setup for an ambush, because the security forces lack night-
 fighting equipment, and because terrorists might have mined the area.
 The Government maintains that the security forces resort to lethal force only in
 the context of armed clashes with terrorists. The Government also contends that,
 as a matter of policy, disciplinary action is taken against soldiers or policemen who
 are guilty of violating human rights. The government-linked National Observatory
 for Human Rights (ONDH) reported several instances in which military and secu-
 rity personnel were punished for abuses during the year.
 Armed groups targeted both security force members and civilians. Terrorists at-
 tacked civilians whom they regarded as instruments of the State or whose lifestyles
 
 
 1405
 they considered in conflict with Islamic values. Sometimes they killed in the course
 of armed robberies or to enforce local protection rackets. Some terrorist bombings
 seemed intended only to create social disorder by causing a high number of civilian
 casualties without any apparent concern for the particular target. Increasingly
 armed groups killed large groups of civilians, including infants, often in apparent
 retaliation against villages or families that had ceased providing support to them.
 In September a number of teachers were murdered in front of their students.
 In September the terrorist Armed Islamic Group (GIA) issued an official commu-
 nique in which it claimed responsibility for the ongoing violence, terming the mas-
 sacres "an offering to God" and pledging to continue. Activists from several political
 parties, including the two legal Islamist opposition parties, were killed in 1997, as
 were cultural and media personalities such as a popular filmmaker and a television
 station employee. During the municipal and provincial electoral campaign in Octo-
 ber, eight candidates were killed by terrorists. There were also instances throughout
 the year of terrorists stopping buses and cars and murdering civilian passengers.
 In some cases the victims apparently were murdered merely because they were
 young men of draft age eligible for military service. Terrorists also were responsible
 for the large massacres of civilians in Haouch Boughlef in April, El-Oumaria in
 May, and Larbaa in August. These collective massacres often resulted in the dis-
 placement of large numbers of survivors. The press reported that at least 313 per-
 sons were killed by terrorists within a 30 mile radius of greater Algiers during the
 last 3 months of the year. On December 31, over 300 persons reportedly were killed
 in the western province of Relizane.
 Terrorist bombs also killed hundreds of persons. In some cases, the terrorists tar-
 geted government buildings. In others they sought to retaliate against the families
 of members of the security services by exploding car bombs outside their homes.
 Terrorists also left bombs at several street markets during the year. In rural areas,
 terrorists continued to plant bombs and mines, often to prevent security forces from
 pursuing them following an attack.
 In January Algeria's top labor leader, Abdelhak Benhamouda, the Secretary Gen-
 eral of the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), was killed in front of UGTA
 headquarters. Benhamouda was well-known for being anti-Islamist, and he had
 been at the forefront of the calls for the cancellation of the 1991 legislative elections
 won by the FIS. Since 1993 at least 59 journalists and 120 foreigners have died in
 terrorist attacks.
 b. Disappearance.-There continued to be credible reports of disappearances, and
 security forces a ppear to have been involved in numerous cases. For example, in
 April journalist Aziz Bouabdallah was taken forcibly from his apartment by men in
 civilian clothing. He has not yet reappeared. A university professor was kidnaped
 as he left the university. His whereabouts also remain unknown. In July a surgeon
 who had been released from prison in 1995 after 4 years of detention without trial
 was abducted a few weeks after having been summoned by the police for question-
 ing. In addition, many previously-recorded cases remain unresolved. The Govern-
 ment asserted that terrorists disguised as security forces perpetrated numerous inci-
 dents.
 Terrorist groups kidnaped hundreds of civilians, including family members of se-
 curity service members. Sometimes the mutilated corpses of such victims were later
 found. In many other instances, however, the victims disappeared, and their fami-
 lies could obtain no information about their fate.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution and legislation ban torture and other cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment. However, according to human rights groups and lawyers, the po-
 lice regularly resort to torture when interrogating persons suspected of being in-
 volved with, or of having sympathies for armed Islamists. There were several credi-
 ble reports of torture at the Algiers police facility called Chateau Neuf.
 There were repeated reports that police applied to prisoners a technique called "le
 chiffon," in which a cloth soaked in noxious fluid was put in the victim's mouth.
 There were also reports that the police applied electric shocks to sensitive body
 parts and sexually molested female prisoners. Police beatings of detainees appeared
 to be common. Many victims of torture hesitate to make public allegations due to
 fear of government retaliation. The Interior Ministry in 1992 said that it would pun-
 ish those individuals who violated the law and practiced torture, but it has never
 revealed whether any of those individuals responsible for torture have been pun-
 ished. On more than one occasion, however, the police have stated in writing, in re-
 sponse to specific complaints filed by human rights organizations, that they would
 punish individual policemen found guilty of committing torture. In March the Na-
 tional Observatory for Human Rights (ONDH), which is affiliated with the Govern-
 ment, announced that "over sixty" soldiers, policemen, communal guards, and local
 
 
 1406
 self-defense forces members would soon face charges in regular criminal courts of
 violating individual liberties and committing torture. Specifically, the ONDH men-
 tioned: The case of a group of local self-defense force members who had abused a
 group of citizens in Bougara; the case of a policeman accused of having killed a civil-
 ian in Merouana; and the case of a communal guard who had used his weapons "for
 his own purposes" in Boufarik. The outcome of these cases is unknown. On Decem-
 ber 31, ONDH President Rezzag Barn told the Arabic-language daily newspaper, El-
 Khabar, that the ONDH registered several dozen individual cases of human rights
 violations during the year. Judicial proceedings were conducted in courts of military
 justice for military personnel and members of local self-defense forces and in civil
 courts for members of the security services. Rezzag Bara said the courts meted out
 very stiff sentences.
 There were unconfirmed reports that security services personnel were responsible
 for several instances of rape.
 Armed groups also committed many abuses such as beheading, mutilating,
 disemboweling, and dismembering theiir-victims, including infants and pregnant
 women. There were also credible reports of children being forced to drink the blood
 of their murdered parents. There were frequent reports of young women being ab-
 ducted and repeatedly raped, often for weeks at a time. The terrorists sought to jus-
 tify this sexual abuse by referring to it as "temporary marriage," but all other ob-
 servers, including Islamic scholars, uniformly condemned the practice as rape.
 Armed Islamist terrorists committed hundreds of rapes of female victims, most of
 whom were subsequently murdered.
 Prison conditions are poor, and prisons are very overcrowded. According to human
 rights activists, cells often contain several times the number of prisoners for which
 they originally were designed. Medical treatment for prisoners is available but is
 also severely limited.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or detention
 centers by groups such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or
 Amnesty International.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention; however, the security forces continued arbitrarily to arrest and
 detain citizens. The Constitution stipulates that incommunicado detention in crimi-
 nal cases prior to arraignment may not exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect
 must be charged or released. According to the Antiterrorist Law of 1992, the police
 may hold suspects in prearraignment detention for up to 12 days; they also must
 inform suspects of the charges against them. In practice, however, the security
 forces routinely ignore this 12-day limit.
 The most prominent case involving a prisoner held incommunicado is PIS Vice
 President Ali Benhadj; his family has heard nothing about him since mid-1995 de-
 spite repeated approaches to the Justice Ministry by Benhadj's lawyers. In addition,
 a number of lawyers who had defended suspects in security cases were held in in-
 communicado detention in 1997. There are credible reports that secret long-term de-
 tention facilities exist at certain military bases.
 The Antiterrorist Law of 1992 suspended the requirement that the police obtain
 warrants in order to make an arrest. During the year, the police made a few broad
 nighttime sweeps of neighborhoods in the Algiers suburbs in search of suspected ter-
 rorists and often detained suspects without identifying themselves. In some cases,
 they purposely arrested close relatives of suspected terrorists in order to force those
 suspects to surrender.
 The authorities released from prison senior FIS official Abdelkader Hachani and
 lawyer Ali Zouita, both of whom had been held for over 3 years without trial, and
 PIS President Abassi Madani. Abassi Madani, however, subsequently was placed
 under house arrest and allowed to receive only his family members.
 Persons accused of crimes sometimes did not receive expeditious trials. Hundreds
 of state enterprise officials arrested on charges of corruption in 1996 remained in
 detention. Two trials began in July for some defendants, including the Annaba state
 enterprise employees who staged a hunger strike in 1996 to protest the delay in
 their trials.
 Under the state of emergency, the Minister of Interior is authorized to detain sus-
 pects in special camps administered by the army. The Government closed the last
 camp in November 1995, and announced that it had released the 641 prisoners
 there, although there were subsequent reports.that some were rearrested later. The
 Government and other sources contended that some persons released from this pris-
 on had joined armed groups.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment and is not known to be practiced.
 
 
 1407
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice, the Government does not always respect the independ-
 ence of the judicial system.
 The judiciary is composed of the civil courts, which try misdemeanors and felo-
 nies, and military courts, which have tried civilians for security and terrorism of-
 fenses. There also is a Constitutional Council which reviews the constitutionality of
 treaties, laws, and regulations. Although the Council is not part of the judiciary, it
 has the authority to nullify laws found unconstitutional. Regular criminal courts try
 those individuals accused of security-related offenses, but there have been very few
 actual trials. Some observers maintain that, as a result of the 1995 abolition of the
 special security courts, long-term detentions without trial have increased, as the se-
 curity forces are reluctant to release suspects to ordinary criminal judges.
 According to the Constitution, defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty. They have the right to confront their accusers and may appeal the conviction.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to legal counsel. However, the au-
 thorities do not always respect all legal provisions regarding defendants' rights.
 Legal sources indicated that the judicial authorities violated due process more often
 in 1997 than they had in the past. For example, defendants were often detained
 without charge or denied access to a lawyer for longer than the legal limit. Some
 lawyers would not accept cases of individuals accused of security-related offenses,
 due to fear of retribution from the security forces. In July, Rachid Mesh, a lawyer
 known for defending suspects in security cases, was convicted on a charge that had
 not been revealed previously to his defense team. Neither his family nor independ-
 ent human rights observers were allowed to attend his trial. Defense lawyers for
 members of the banned FIS have suffered harassment, death threats, and arrest.
 There are no credible estimates of the number of political prisoners. An unknown
 number of persons who may be considered political prisoners were serving prison
 sentences because of their Islamist sympathies and membership in the FIB.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, 'Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, but the state of emergency
 authorizes provincial governors to issue exceptional warrants at any time. Security
 forces often entered residences without warrants. The security services also de-
 ployed an extensive network of secret informers against both terrorist targets and
 political opponents. The Government monitors telephones and sometimes dis-
 connects service to political opponents and journalists. Security forces detained rel-
 atives of suspects to try to compel the suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 Armed Islamists routinely entered private homes either to kill or kidnap residents
 or to steal weapons, valuables, or food. After massacres that took place in their vil-
 lages, numerous civilians fled their homes. Armed Islamist groups consistently used
 threats of violence to extort money from businesses and families across the country.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 but a 1990 law specifies that such speech must respect "individual dignity, the im-
 peratives of foreign policy, and the national defense." The state of emergency decree
 gave the Government broad authority to restrict these freedoms and to take legal
 action against what it considered to be threats to the State or public order. In
 March 1994, the Government issued an interministerial decree that independent
 newspapers could print security information only from official government bulletins
 carried by the government press service APS. In January shortly after the independ-
 ent press printed stories based on hospital sources that provided higher casualty
 counts than the official sources had provided, the Ministry of Interior reiterated this
 order. Reporting by government-controlled press organs regularly included deflated
 numbers of civilians and government forces killed and inflated terrorist casualty
 counts. In addition, the Ministry of Health forbids medical personnel such as doctors
 and nurses from speaking to journalists.
 Compliance with the government directive varied among independent newspapers,
 but they rarely reported information about security force losses. In September au-
 thorities withdew the accreditation of an Agence France Presse journalist when he
 published, after personally visiting the site of a massacre, a number of victims larg-
 er than the official figures had indicated.
 The Government's definition of security information often extended beyond purely
 military matters to encompass broader political affairs. In 1995 FIS officials who
 had been freed from detention in 1994 received direct orders from the Justice Min-
 istry to make no further public statements. This ban remains in force. When FIS
 president Abassi Madani was placed under house arrest in September, he was spe-
 cifically banned from talking to the press or making any public statements.
 
 
 1408
 Journalists at independent. newspapers often avoided printing stories about the
 security situation and Islamist groups in order to avoid difficulties with the Govern-
 ment. In September, for example, -the police summoned one journalist and ques-
 tioned him abut sources for articles written on the security situation. In one well-
 -publicized case, a court gave a number of journalists suspended sentences for pub-
 lishing information on the killing of six members of the gendarmerie in 1994. The
 independent, press remained free to criticize economic and social policy broadly; how-
 ever, in- general, journalists exercised self-censorship by not publishing specific criti-
 cism of specific officials.
 . The-Government frequently harassed journalists who wrote offending articles by
 putting them under "judicial control." This practice required them to check in regu-
 larly -with the local police. -It also prevented them from leaving. the country. For ex-
 - ample, when APS journalist Hadi Benaamane.-was released in April after serving
 more than 2 years in prison for having disclosed the place- where FIS Vice President
 SAli Benhadj was imprisoned, he was immediately placedunder-"judicial control."
 During the year, official pressure on the independent-press resulted in the sus-
 pension of the. last few pr-Islamist publications other than the publications of the
 two legal Islamist political parties. The independent weekly -El-Maweed,�known for
 its pro-Islamist stance and for its sharp criticism.of the security forces, was sus-
 pended indefinitely in January on the pretext of unpaid bills from the government-
 owned printing press. Also in January, the Government shut down the weekly Ech-
 Chourouq on charges of unpaid bills shortly after Ech-Chourouq published several
 strong attacks against the Prime Minister. Ech-Chouruq resumed publication in
 August. The pro-Islamist weekly E1-Kila'a also was suspended in January. In April
 the Government shut, down the independent daily A1-Ouma; allegedly because of a
 bad check, shortly after the newspaper printed a column criticizing the ruling Na-
 tional Democratic Rally (RN])) party.
 In January the .Government allowed the independent daily La Tribune to reopen.
 The Government had closed La Tribune in July 1996 after -t had carried, a cartoon
 that the Government alleged defamed the Algerian flag. A subsequent court decision
 - in September suspended'the newspaper for 6 months: Prior- to its suspension, La
 Tribune was among the foremost newspapers urging faster economic reforms and
 suggeating a settlement with the political leadership of the FIS; after it resumed
 publication, La Tribune noticeably reduced its editorial criticism of the Government
 on economic and other issues.
 Along similar lines, the independent daily EI-Alem Es-Siyasi substantially re-
 duced its editorial criticism of the Government in 1997 after the authorities targeted
 two of its reporters: The first was detained by the police for a week in March before
 being released with no explanation; the second, Aziz Bouabdallah, was seized from
 his apartment by presumed security -officials in civilian clothes in April and has not
 been heard from since (see Section 1.b.).
 The Government maintained an effective monopoly over printing companies and
 newsprint imports. Algeria's first private newspaper printing operation, Sodipresse,
 opened in March, but it was shut down by the Interior Ministry -only 2 weeks later
 after it printed an issue of the independent weekly publication Ech-Chourouq. In
 May Ech-Chourouq won a court case ordering Sia, one of the two state printing com-
 panies, to resume printing the publication, but Sia refused to abide by the verdict,
 and the authorities took no measures to enforce it. Ech-Chourouq resumed publica-
 tion in August following an absence of 7 months, but only because it found a small
 private company willing to publish it.
 The Government continued to exercise pressure on the independent press through
 the .state-owned advertising company, ANEP, which was created in 1996. All state-
 owned companies that wish to place advertisements in a newspaper must submit
 the item to ANEP, which then decides in which newspapers to place it. As it had
 done in 1996, ANEP provided significant amounts of advertising to particular publi-
 cations with an anti-Islamist editorial line and that did not undertake investigations
 of corruption. Other newspapers with different editorial policies received very little
 or no advertising, even though they had a larger national readership and sometimes
 offered cheaper advertising prices. This advertising is crucial in an economy in
 which state companies' output and government services still represent approxi-
 mately two-thirds of national income. For example, EI-Watan andE1-Khabar, two
 major independent dailies, received little or no advertising from ANEP in the latter
 part of the year.
 Since 1995 a Brussels-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) concerned with
 press freedom, the International Federation of Journalists (FIJ), has maintained an
 office in Algiers. The FIJ office is allowed to function but -has yet to receive the re-
 quired authorization from the Government.
 
 
 1409
 Radio and television remained under government control, with coverage biased in
 favor of the Government's policies. During the campaigns for bath the June legisla-
 tive elections and the October municipal and provincial elections it became easier
 for opposition political parties to present their views, but these appearances rep-
 resented only a small fraction of the total radio and television broadcast time. Much
 more coverage focused on the new government party created in 1997, the National
 Democratic Rally (RND). Opposition      members of Parliament, as well as
 progovernment deputies, received coverage in live televised parliamentary debates.
 Satellite dish antennas are widespread, and millions of citizens have access to Euro-
 pean and Middle Eastern broadcasting.
 Many artists, intellectuals, and university educators fled Algeria after widespread
 violence began in 1992. Few returned during the year. As a result, there were few
 academic seminars and colloquiums, although there appeared to be more in 1997
 than in 1996. The Government did not interfere with nonpolitical seminars; it did
 sometimes interfere with seminars that were more political in content. For example,
 in September at an international seminar on violence sponsored by the government-
 linked National Observatory for Human Rights in Algiers, the Government forbade
 the participants from discussing the ongoing violence in Algeria.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but the 1992 Emergency Law and government practice sharp-
 ly curtail it. Citizens and organizations must obtain a permit from the appointed
 local governor before holding public meetings. During the last week of October, op-
 position party supporters staged two protest marches peacefully although these had
 not been sanctioned by the Government. The following week, the Interior Ministry
 announced it would no longer permit unauthorized protest marches and would use
 force if necessary to prevent them.
 While it was generally easier for groups to hold meetings in 1997 than it had been
 in 1996, the Government nonetheless refused to grant permits on various occasions.
 The group Call for Peace, which is composed of political figures, lawyers, and jour-
 nalists, was denied permission to hold public gatherings on numerous occasions. The
 Government also blocked meeting requests by the Association of Victims of Terror-
 ism, the National Syndicate of Magistrates, and the Independent Syndicate of Uni-
 versity Professors. In February, however, the Government authorized a meeting by
 the opposition Workers' Party. In September the Interior Ministry prohibited one of
 the large youth associations from holding a national conference. Also in September,
 the Government rejected an application by one of the two Berber-based political par-
 ties, the Socialist Frces Front (FFS), to hold a march against terrorism, although
 the Government had authorized a similar march sponsored by the General Union
 of Algerian Workers (UGTA) in August. In November antiriot police prevented
 marches in Algiers by students and by parliamentarians protesting fraud in the Oc-
 tober municipal and provincial elections.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, but the 1992 Emergency
 Law and government practice severely restrict it. The Interior Ministry licenses all
 nongovernmental associations and regards all associations as illegal unless they
 have licenses. It may deny a license to, or dissolve, any group regarded as a threat
 to the existing political order. After the Government suspended the parliamentary
 election in 1992, it banned the FIS as a political party, and the social and charitable
 groups connected to it. Membership in the FIS is illegal. In their September call for
 a truce, FIS representatives proposed that the FIS be permitted to resume function-
 ing as a legal party, but the Government rejected this request, with President
 Zeroual stating that the "FIS dossier is definitively closed" in an October 1 speech.
 According to a 1989 law, all citizens except judges, army and security service per-
 sonnel, and members of the Constitutional Council have the right to join political
 organizations. In February the appointed legislature changed the law regulating po-
 litical parties, banning political party ties to nonpolitical associations. There were
 several political groups, including some centrist Islamist parties, such as the Move-
 ment for Social Peace (MSP) and An-Nahdah, which were able to conduct political
 activities, though not with complete freedom. In mid-1997 the Interior Ministry dis-
 solved a political party called the Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA), led
 by former president Ahmad Ben Bella, when the MDA refused to submit the names
 o its founding members in accordance with the new law on political parties. The
 Government permits some specialized groups to function such as human rights and
 women's rights groups, social welfare groups, youth associations, and regionally-
 based cultural organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion
 but prohibits discrimination based on religious belief. The Government respects this
 right in practice. It permits the small Christian and Jewish populations to practice
 their faiths without interference.
 
 
 1410
 The Government appoints preachers to mosques and gives general guidance on
 sermons. The Government monitors activities in mosques for possible security-relat-
 ed offenses. The Ministry of Religious Affairs provides some financial support to
 -mosques and has limited control over the training of imams.
 _.Conversions from Islam to other religions, are rare. Because of security worries
 and potential legal and social problems, Muslim converts practice their new faith
 clandestinely. The Shari'a-based Family Code prohibits Muslim women from
 marrying non-Muslims, although this regulation is not always enforced. The Code
 does not restrict. Muslim men from marrying non-Muslim women.
 In 1994 the GIA declared its intention to eliminate Jews, Christians, and poly-
 theists from-Algeria. The Christian community, composed mostly of foreigners, cur-
 tailed its activities. No -Christian religious figures were killed during the year, un-
 like 1996, when seven French monks-and the Catholic-bishop of Oran were killed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of domestic and foreign travel and free-
 "dom to emigrate. The Government generally respects these -provisions. It has, how-
 -ever, placed some journalists under "judicial control,"- which prevents them from
 leavingthe country (see Section 2.a.).
 In addition, the Government does not allow foreign travel by senior officials from
 - the -banned FIS. In September the Government placed- recently-released FIS presi-
 dent -Abassi Madani under house arrest (see Section l.d.). The - Government also
 does not permit young men who are eligible for the draft and who have not yet com-
 pleted their military- service to leave the country if they do not have special author-
 Sization; this authorization can be granted to students and to those individuals with
 .special family circumstances. .The Family Code does not permit females under 19
 years of age and males under the age of 18 to travel abroad without-their husband's
 or father's permission.
 -In July authorities suspended without pay a judge who had recently returned
 from a trip abroad to study judicial- independence and the rule-of law. Despite the
 fact that she had notified ,her superiors well in advance of her intent to participate
 in the program, she was charged with "unjustified absence" and her-,pay ceased as
 of-the day she departed. In October the Justice Ministry allowed her to begin work-
 ing at the Supreme Court but informed her that she would not be permitted to
 judge cases again for 2 years.
 Under the state of emergency, the Interior Minister and the provincial governors
 may deny residency in certain districts to persons regarded as threats to public
 order. The Government also restricts travel into four southern rovinces where
 much- of the hydrocarbon industry and many foreign workers are located, in order
 to enhance- security in those areas.
 The police and the communal guards operate checkpoints throughout the country.
 They routinely stop -vehicles -to inspect identification-papers and to search for evi-
 dence of terrorist activity. They sometimes-detain, persons at these checkpoints.
 The GIA in February 1996 warned.young -lgerians. of.draft age not -to travel
 across the country on pain of death for collaboration with-the Government; this
 warning remained in effect in 1997. Armed groups establish temporary roadblocks
 in various regions, including in the capital, to rob travelers of cash and vehicles or
 to kill them. According to credible reports, armed groups sometimes massacred
 groups of civilian passengers-at these roadblocks (see Section L.a.).
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum, and the Government
 occasionally grants asylum. The Government cooperates with the office of the Unit-
 ed Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other-humanitarian or-
 ganizations in assisting refugees. It also provided first asylum. For example, it co-
 operates with.the UNHCR on -programs to help refugee Sahrawis, the former resi-
 " 'dents of-the Western Sahara who left that territory after-Morocco took control of
 it in the 1970's. The Government also has worked with international -organizations
 that help the Tuaregs, a nomadic people of southern Algeria and neighboring coun-
 tries. There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 -Section 3. Respect-for Political Rights: The- Right-of Citizens ta Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite recent democratic improvements, citizens do not have the effective ability
 to change their government peacefully. -The strong prerogatives of the ,executive
 branch, supported by the entrenched power of the military and the bureaucracy,
 -prevent the exercise of citizen rights at local, regional, and national levels.
 "President Zeroual was elected in a November 1995 presidential election, officially
 winning 61 percent of the votes east. The Presidential campaign was generally free-
 ly contested. Three opposition candidates representing a spectrum of viewpoints had
 
 
 1411
 access to both the independent press and the government-controlled media, includ-
 ing radio and television. Their parties were permitted to hold rallies across the
 countr, and they had authorization to send observers to polling stations. There was
 an independent election commission to supervise the election process, but the oppo-
 sition parties complained that it did not carefully review complaints that it received
 about the conduct of the election.
 The President called a popular referendum in November 1996 to amend the Con-
 stitution, and 79 percent of the voters approved the changes, according to the Gov-
 ernment. There were no independent observers at the polling stations during the
 vote or the ballot counting. Political parties opposing the constitutional amendments
 suffered occasional harassment by local government officials and could not obtain
 access to the electronic media, which is government controlled.
 Under the Constitution, the President has the authority to rule by decree in spe-
 cial circumstances. The President must subsequently submit to the Parliament for
 approval decrees issued while the Parliament was not in session. The Parliament
 now has a popularly-elected lower chamber, the National Popular Assembly (APN)
 and a senate (the National Council), two-thirds of whose members are elected by
 municipal and provincial councils. The President appoints the remaining one-third
 of the Senate's members. Legislation must have the approval of three-quarters of
 both the upper and lower chambers' members. Laws must originate in the lower
 house.
 In June Algeria held its first elections to the APN since the January 1992 elec-
 tions were canceled and elected the first multiparty parliament in the country's his-
 tory. Candidates representing 39 political parties participated, along with several
 independent candidates. All competing parties and candidates were allowed to cam-
 paign actively and had access to radio and television, although there was some gov-
 ernment manipulation of the broadcasts. Under a system of proportional representa-
 tion, the government party won 154 seats, followed by the Islamist party MSP with
 69 seats, the National Liberation Front with 64 seats, the Islamist party An-
 Nahdah with 34 seats, the Berber-based Socialist Forces Front with 20 seats, and
 the Berber-based Rally for Culture and Democracy with 19 seats. Independent can-
 didates won 11 seats, the Workers' Party won 4 seats, and three other small parties
 won a combined total of 5 seats. Hundreds of international observers were present
 throughout the country. Some observers were refused access to certain provincial
 electoral commissions. Most observers felt that mobile polling stations, about 5 per-
 cent of all polling stations, did not furnish adequate guarantees of neutrality and
 transparency. In their final report, neutral observers stated that, of 1,258 (of the
 country's 35,000) voting stations that they assessed, 1,169 were satisfactory, 95 were
 problematic, and 11 unsatisfactory. On November 8, the provincial election commis-
 sions announced the results of their adjudication of the appeals filed by various po-
 litical parties. The RND lost some seats but remained the overall victor in the June
 Assembly elections.
 In February the appointed previous legislature, the National Transition Council
 (CNT), changed the law re  ating political parties. Under the controversial new
 law, parties require official approval from the Interior Ministry before they can be
 established. To obtain this approval, they must have 25 founders from across the
 country, whose names must be registered with the Interior Ministry. No party may
 seek to utilize religion, Berberism, or Arabism for political purposes. The law also
 banned political party ties to nonpolitical associations and tightened party finance
 regulations and reporting requirements.
 The existing political parties represent a wide spectrum of viewpoints and engage
 in activities ranging from holding rallies to printing newspapers. In late February,
 the Government -announced the creation of its own party, the National Democratic
 Rally. With the exception of the RND, the political parties sometimes encounter dif-
 ficulties when dealing with local officials, who hinder their organizational efforts.
 Parties' complaints, particularly claims of official favoritism toward the RND, in-
 creased during the period leading up to the June APN elections and the October
 municipal and provincial elections. The Government monitored private telephone
 communications and sometimes disconnected telephone service to political oppo-
 nents for extended periods (see Section 1.f.). Opposition parties have very limited
 access to state-controlled television and radio, but the independent press publicizes
 their views without difficulty. During the June and October elections, however, op-
 position parties were given much more access to the state media. Following the
 June elections, the state television transmitted the Popular Assembly debates live
 and uncensored.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are only 2 women
 in the Cabinet, and there are few others in senior government positions. Eleven of
 the 380 members of the lower house of Parliament are women. About 25 percent
 
 
 1412
 of the judges are women, and this percentage has been growing in recent years.
 None of the four candidates in the 1995 presidential election was a women. How-
 ever, a woman heads a workers' party. The major political parties all have women's
 divisions. The Government changed the electoral law in 1995 to ensure that women
 cast their own ballots, rather than permit their husbands or fathers to vote for
 them, as frequently happened in previous elections.
 The Government does not ban political participation by any ethnic minority group.
 The Berbers, an ethnic minority centered in the Kabylie region of Algeria, partici-
 pate freely and actively in the political process. Two political parties originated in
 the Berber-populated region of the country, the Socialist Forces Front and the Rally
 for Culture and Democracy. These two Berber-based parties had to conform with
 changes in the new party law that stipulate that political parties have 25 founders
 from across Algera.
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, do not play an important role in politics,
 due in large part to their small numbers, estimated in the tens of thousands, and
 their nomadic existence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 _ vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The most active independent human rights group is the Algerian League for the
 Defense of Human Rights (LADDH), an independent organization that has members
 throughout Algeria. The LADDH president is a lawyer who speaks out publicly
 about the general human rights situation. The LADDH is not allowed access to the
 authorities or to prisons beyond the normal consultations allowed between a lawyer
 and a client. Members of the LADDH have suffered harassment. Telephone service
 of their president, for example, was intermittently disrupted, and he and other
 LADDH activists received death threats from unidentified callers.
 There are.two other-human rights groups in Algeria. The Algerian League for
 Human Rights (LADH), an independent ,organization based in Constantine, is less
 active. The LADH has members throughout Algeria -vho follow individual cases. The
 other organization, the National Observatory for -Human- Rights (ONDH), is-a gov-
 ernment-affiliated, body, which was established by -the Government in 1992. The
 ONDH is mandated to report human rights violations to the authorities. It prepares
 an annual report with recommendations to the Government.
 There is an Amnesty International chapter in Algeria, but it does not work on
 cases in Algeria.
 In the spring the Government permitted teams of human rights activists from
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) as well as from the International Federation of
 Human Rights (IFHR) to visit Algeria. During the June legislative elections, the
 Government invited hundreds of international observers to monitor the elections. In
 July, however, the Government refused to grant visas to observers from either Am-
 nesty International or the IFHR to attend the allegedly public trial of lawyer Rachid
 Mesi, who was known for defending security case suspects. In September four
 human rights groups called for the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) to investigate human-rights, abuses in Algeria, particularly the allegation
 of goverrnnent-complicity in recent massacres. The .Government rejected their call
 for an international. investigation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on birth, race, sex, belief, or any
 other personal or social condition. The Government named a national ombudsman
 in 1995. Provincial representatives were designated in 1996 and 1997. They have
 a- mandate to accept individual grievances and to make them known to the authori-
 ties. The ombudsman presents an annual report to the President. The 1997 report
 indicated that most complaints were about allocation of public housing. The bu-
 reaucracy's unresponsiveness was a common complaint. Women continue to face
 legal and social discrimination.
 -Women.-Women's rights advocates assert that spousal abuse is common, but
 there are no reliable studies regarding its extent. Spousal abuse is more frequent
 in rural than urban areas, especially among less-educated people. There are no laws
 to protect women from spousal rape or abuse.  Battered women must obtain medical
 certification of the physical effects of the attack before they lodge a complaint with
 the police. According to women's rights advocates, fewer than half of the women at-
 tacked visit doctors for such certification. They also assert that the police and courts
 are lenient with men accused of beating their wives. Women's rights groups had
 great difficulty drawing attention to spousal abuse as an important social problem.
 
 
 1413
 Some aspects of the law, and many traditional social practices, discriminate
 against women. The 1984 Family Code, based in large part on Islamic law (Shari'a),
 treats women as minors under the legal gardianship of a husband or male relative.
 A woman must obtain a father's approvalto mary, for example. Divorce is difficult
 to obtain except in cases of abandonment or the husband's conviction for a serious
 crime. Husbands generally obtain the right to the family home in the case of di-
 vorce. Custody of the children normally goes to the mother- but she cannot enroll
 them in a particular school or take them out of the country without the father's au-
 thorization.
 The Family Code also confirms the Islamic practice of allowing a man to marry
 four wives-a rare occurrence. However, a wife may sue for divorce if her husband
 does not inform her of his intent to marry another wife prior to the marriage. Only
 males are able to confer citizenship on their children. Muslim women are prohibited
 from marrying non-Muslims; Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 Women suffer from discrimination in inheritance laws; in accordance with Shari'a
 they are entitled to a smaller portion of an estate than are male children or even
 a deceased husband's brothers. Females under 19 years of age cannot travel abroad
 without their husband's or father's permission (see Section 2.d.).
 While social pressure against women pursuing higher education or a career exists
 throughout the country, it is much stronger in rural areas than in major urban
 areas. Women constitute only 8 percent of the work force. Nonetheless, women may
 own businesses and enter into contracts; they pursue opportunities in government,
 medicine, law, education, the media, and even the armed forces. The 1990 Labor
 Law bans sexual discrimination in the workplace, but Labor Ministry inspectors do
 little to enforce this law.
 During the year, Islamic extremists often specificall targeted women. For exam-
 ple, there were numerous instances of women being killed and mutilated in mas-
 sacres. As many as 80 percent of the victims of massacres were women and chil-
 dren. Armed Islamist groups reportedly kidnaped young women and kept them as
 sex slaves for group leaders and members (see Section 1.c.).
 There are numerous small women's rights groups. Their main goals are to foster
 women's economic welfare and to amend aspects of the Family Law, although no
 such amendments have yet been passed. In March the Government established a
 National Committee for the Preservation and Promotion of Women.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to protecting children's
 human rights. It provides free education for children 6 to 15 years of age and free
 medical care for all citizens-albeit in often rudimentary facilities. The Ministry of
 Youth and Sports has programs for children, but these face serious funding prob-
 lems. Legal experts maintain that the Penal and Family Codes do not offer children
 sufficient protection. Hospitals treat dozens of cases of child abuse every year, but
 many cases go unreported. Laws against child abuse have not led to notable pros-
 ecutions against offenders.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Public enterprises, in
 downsizing the work force, generally ignore a law that requires that they reserve
 1 percent of their jobs for people with disabilities. Social security provides for pay-
 ments for orthopedic equipment, and some nongovernmental organizations receive
 limited government financial support. The Government also tries to finance special-
 ized training, but this initiative remains rudimentary.
 National [Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Berbers are an ethnic minority, cen-
 tered in the Kabylie region. Berber nationalists have sought to maintain their own
 cultural and linguistic identity while the Government's Arabization program contin-
 ues. As part of the National Charter signed in 1996, the Government and several
 major political parties agreed that the Berber culture and language, Amazigh, were
 one of the components of the Algerian identity. The Charter did not meet the de-
 mands of some political groups that Amazigh be made an official language. There
 are professorships in Amazigh and Berber culture at the University of Tizi Ouzou,
 and the University announced that in 1998 it would offer for the first time a degree
 in Amazigh and Berber culture. The government-owned national television station
 began broadcasting a brief nightly news program in Amazigh in 1996. Berbers hold
 influential positions in government, the army, business, and journalism.
 The Tuaregs, a people of Berber origin, live a nomadic existence and are relatively
 few in number.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to establish trade unions of
 their choice. About two-thirds of the labor force belongs to unions. There is an um-
 
 
 1414
 brella labor confederation, the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) dating
 from the era of a single political party and its affiliated entities. The UGTA encom-
 passes national syndicates specialized by sector. There also are currently some au-
 tonomous unions, such as a syndicate of Air Algeria pilots, another for airport tech-
 nicians, and another for teachers in the Kabylie.
 Workers are required to obtain governihent approval to establish a union. The
 1990 Law on Labor Unions requires the Labor Ministry to approve a union applica-
 tion within 30 days. Early in 1996 a second labor confederation, the Autonomous
 Syndicates Confederation (CSA), tried to organize the autonomous syndicates, but
 it did not gain wide support for this effort. It made its application in 1995 but still
 had not received its approval from the Labor Ministry at year's end. However, it
 continued to be allowed to function without official status. In February the Govern-
 ment refused to authorize the creation of an independent education syndicate in the
 city of Saida.
 The law prohibits unions from associating with political parties. The law also pro-
 hibits unions from receiving funds from foreign sources. The courts are empowered
 to dissolve unions that engage in illegal activities. The labor union organized by the
 banned FIS, the Islamic Syndicate of Workers (SIT), was dissolved in 1992 because
 it had no license.
 Under the state of emergency, the Government is empowered to require workers
 in both the public and private sectors to stay at their jobs in the event of an unau-
 thorized or illegal strike. According to the 1990 Law on Industrial Relations, work-
 ers may strike only after 14 days of mandatory conciliation, mediation, or arbitra-
 tion. This law states that arbitration decisions are binding on both parties. If no
 agreement is reached in arbitration, the workers may legally strike after they vote
 by secret ballot to do so. A minimum level of public services must be maintained
 during public sector service strikes.
 There were no major strikes during the year, although some smaller strikes over
 salary issues were organized by construction workers, educators, and automobile in-
 dustry workers.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations, affiliate with inter-
 national labor bodies, and develop relations with foreign labor groups. The UGTA,
 for example, has contacts with French unions and the American Federation of
 Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining for all unions, and the Government permits this right to be prac-
 ticed. The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and or-
 ganizers and provides mechanisms for resolving trade union complaints of antiunion
 practices by employers. It also permits unions to recruit members at the workplace.
 The Government has established an export processing zone in Jijel.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is in-
 compatible with the Constitution's provisions on individual rights. The Penal Code
 prohibits compulsory labor, including by children, and the Government effectively
 enforces the ban.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce
 the minimum employment age by making periodic or unannounced inspection visits
 to public-sector enterprises. They do not effectively enforce the law in the agricul-
 tural or private sectors. Economic necessity compels many children to resort to in-
 formal employment, such as street vending. The Government prohibits forced and
 bonded labor by children and enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law defines the overall framework for ac-
 ceptable conditions of work but leaves specific agreements on wages, hours, and con-
 ditions of employment to the discretion of employers in consultation with employees.
 The Government fixes by decree a monthly minimum wage for all sectors, however,
 this is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 In May the minimum wage was raised to $83 (4,800 dinars) per month; it was
 scheduled to increase to $93 (5,400 dinars) on January 1, 1998. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with the minimum wage regula-
 tions, although their enforcement is inconsistent.
 In 1997 the standard workweek changed from 44 hours to 40 hours, but with the
 same total monthly salary. There are well-developed occupation and health regula-
 tions codified in a 1991 decree, but government inspectors do not enforce these regu-
 lations effectively. There were no reports of workers being dismissed for removing
 themselves from hazardous working conditions.
