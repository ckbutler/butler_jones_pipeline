 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a one-party state ruled and controlled by the
 Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP). The VCP's constitutionally mandated leading
 role and the occupancy of all senior government positions by party members ensure
 the primacy of party Politburo guidelines, and enable the Party to set the broad pa-
 rameters of national policy. During the year, the Party continued gradually to re-
 duce its formal involvement in government operations, and allowed the Government
 to exercise significant discretion in implementing policy. The National Assembly re-
 mains subject to party direction; however, the Government made progress in
 strengthening the capacity of the National Assembly and in reforming the bureauc-
 racy. The National Assembly, chosen in elections in which most, but not all can-
 didates are approved by the Party (not all Delegates are party members), played an
 increasingly independent role as a forum for local and provincial concerns and as
 a critic of local and national corruption and inefficiency. The Assembly was more
 active in revising legislation and vetting and sometimes rejecting ministerial and
 other candidates for senior offices. Government officials have more latitude in imple-
 menting policies than in previous years. The judiciary remains subservient to the
 VCP.
 The military services are responsible for external defense, including the border de-
 fense force. The military forces are assuming a more important role as the ultimate
 guarantor of internal security, as they seek to establish themselves in public edu-
 cation and campaigns against perceived threats to society. The Government contin-
 ued to restrict significantly civil liberties on grounds of national security. The Gov-
 ernment's Ministry of Public Security (formerly the Ministry of Interior) controls the
 police, a special national security investigative agency, and other units that main-
 tain internal security. The Ministry of Public Security enforces laws and regulations
 that significantly restrict individual liberties and violate other human rights. The
 Ministry of Public Security maintains a system of household registration and block
 wardens to monitor the population, concentrating on those suspected of engaging,
 or being likely to engage in, unauthorized political activities. However, this system
 has become less obvious and pervasive in its intrusion into citizens' daily lives.
 Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Vietnam is a very poor country undergoing transition from a centrally planned to
 a more market-oriented economy. Estimated annual GDP per capita is approxi-
 mately $300. The Asian economic crisis caused a slowdown in trade and foreign in-
 vestment. However, because the economy is partially closed, it was cushioned some-
 what from the effects of the crisis. Agriculture, primarily wet rice cultivation, em-
 ploys two-thirds of the work force and accounts for about one-fourth of Gross Do-
 mestic Product (GDP). Primary industries, including construction, petroleum, gar-
 ments, footwear, and light manufacturing, showed continued growth, although at
 lower levels than in previous years. International financial assistance of about $2
 billion annually is equivalent to almost 10 percent of GDP. Particularly in Ho Chi
 Minh City and Hanoi, economic reforms have raised the standard of living and re-
 duced party and governmental control over, and intrusion into, citizens' daily lives.
 Reforms have created a popular expectation in urban areas of continued social,
 legal, educational, and physical improvements. However, many citizens in isolated
 rural areas live in extreme poverty.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor; although there was meas-
 urable improvement in a few areas, serious problems remain. The Government con-
 tinued to repress basic political and some religious freedoms and to commit numer-
 ous abuses. Although the VCP continued its efforts to reform procedures and inter-
 nal debate, the Government denied citizens the right to change their government.
 There were credible reports that security officials beat detainees. Prison conditions
 remain harsh. The Government arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens, including
 detention for peaceful expression of political and religious views. The Government
 denied citizens the right to fair and expeditious trials and continued to hold a num-
 ber of political prisoners. However, in two wide-ranging amnesties in September and
 November, the Government released more than 7,000 prisoners, most of them con-
 victed common criminals, but including some prominent political and religious dis-
 sidents. The Government restricts significantly citizens' privacy rights, although the
 trend toward reduced government interference in citizens' daily lives continued. The
 Government significantly restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and asso-
 ciation. The Government continued its longstanding policy of not tolerating most
 types of public dissent, although it made exceptions in some instances. For example,
 a number of persons circulated letters that were highly critical of senior leaders and
 called for political reform. The authors did not face reprisals; however, they were
 
 
 1091
 subjected to close surveillance by public security forces. The Government allowed
 citizens somewhat greater freedom of expression and assembly to express griev-
 ances, including by delegates in the National Assembly, citizens in local forums with
 delegates, and small groups of protesters outside government offices. The Govern-
 ment prohibited independent political, labor, and social organizations; such organi-
 zations exist only under government control. The Government restricts freedom of
 religion and significantly restricts the operation of religious organizations other
 than those entities approved by the State. However, in some respects, conditions for
 religious freedom improved during the year. For example, in many areas, local Bud-
 dhists, Catholics, and Protestants reported an increase in religious activity and ob-
 servance. The Government imposes some limits on freedom of movement. Societal
 discrimination and violence against women remained problems. Trafficking in
 women and children for prostitution within the country and abroad continued to
 grow, although the Government took steps to combat the problem. Discrimination
 against ethnic minorities and child labor are problems. There were some reports of
 forced child labor. There were reports that certain prisons employed forced labor,
 sometimes as part of commercial ventures. The Government restricts worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated extrajudicial killings. Little information was available on the extent of
 deaths in police custody or on official investigations into such incidents. There were
 no reports of deaths of inmates due to prison conditions during the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits physical abuse; however, police beat persons, including suspects
 during arrests, and also beat street children in their attempts to get them off the
 streets. There were no known reports of torture of detainees. Little information is
 available on the extent of police brutality during interrogations.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Conditions generally did not threaten the lives of
 prisoners, although anecdotal evidence suggests that the death rate among male
 prisoners was higher than among female prisoners. Overcrowding, insufficient diet,
 and poor sanitation remained serious problems. Conditions in pretrial detention re-
 portedly were particularly harsh, and there were credible reports that authorities
 sometimes denied inmates access to sunlight, exercise, and reading material. Most
 prisoners had access to basic health care and, for those with money, to supplemental
 food and medicine. However, some political prisoners were denied visitation rights,
 and there were reports that some prisons employed the use of forced labor, some-
 times as part of commercial ventures (see Section 6.c.). Prisoners sentenced to hard
 labor complained that their diet and medical care were insufficient to sustain
 health, especially in remote, disease-ridden areas. Several political prisoners with
 serious medical conditions were held under harsh conditions in remote prisons, with
 limited access to medical care. For example, Do Van Thac, sentenced to 14 (reduced
 to 12) years' imprisonment on charges of attempting to overthrow the Government,
 remained imprisoned in remote Nam Ha-province, despite reports that he had suf-
 fered a stroke and had heart disease.
 Dr. Doan Viet Hoat, a prisoner who was serving a 15-year sentence at the Thanh
 Cam camp, a remote and malaria-ridden area of Thanh Hoa province, was granted
 amnesty in September (see Sections 1.d. and I.e.).
 The Government did not permit independent monitoring of its prison and deten-
 tion system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued to arrest and
 detain citizens arbitrarily, including arrest and detention for the peaceful expression
 of their political and religious views. The 1990 Criminal Procedures Code provides
 for various rights of detainees, including time limits on pretrial detention and the
 right of the accused to have a lawyer present during interrogation. However, in
 practice the authorities often ignored these legal safeguards. Moreover, a 1997 direc-
 tive on administrative detention gives security officials broad powers to monitor citi-
 zens closely and control where they live and work for up to 2 years if they are be-
 lieved to be threatening "national security."
 The Government continued to utilize its 1997 decree on "administrative deten-
 tion," which gives authorities extremely broad powers to place persons under sur-
 veillance, to monitor citizens closely. The regulations, however, define administra-
 tive detention as an administrative penalty imposed on persons who break the law
 and violate national security, as determined by the definition of crimes in the Crimi-
 nal Code, but whose offenses are not yet at the level that warrants "criminal respon-
 
 
 1092
 sibility." Persons under administrative detention must live and work in a designated
 locality and remain subject to the management and education of the local authori-
 ties and population. There are reports that these measures are used against sus-
 pected political dissidents. The time span of administrative detention ranges from
 6 months to 2 years; the regulations apply also to persons under 18 years of age.
 The Ministry of Public Security is the lead agency in implementing the decree.
 The Supreme People's Procuracy approves the issuance of arrest warrants, but
 law enforcement officials appear able to arrest and incarcerate persons without pre-
 senting arrest warrants. Once arrested, detainees often are held for lengthy periods
 without formal-charges or trial. Nguyen Hoang Linh, a newspaper editor, was con-
 victed on October 21 of "taking advantage of democracy to damage the State" be-
 cause of articles that he had published that exposed corruption in the Customs De-
 partment. He was released immediately after his conviction, since he already had
 served his sentence of 1 year, 13 days. In general, as in Linh's case, time spent in
 pretrial detention counts toward time served upon conviction and sentencing.
 The Government detained two Cao Dai believers in Giang province in October.
 There were reports that the Government detained a number of Hmong Evan-
 gelical Protestants in the northwestern provinces for their involvement in church ac-
 tivities (see Section 2.c.) Among those believed to be held at year's end for political
 or religious activities are: UBCV monks Thich Thien Minh, Thich Hue Dang, and
 Thich Thanj Tinh; Catholic priests Reverends Mai Duc Choung, Nguyen Dinh Huy,
 Reverend Pham Ngoc Tan, Nguyen Van Chau, and Pham Tran Anh.
 There were credible reports that authorities moved juvenile offenders from reform
 schools to labor camp prisons without legal due process, upon their reaching the age
 of majority.
 Those arrested for the peaceful expression of views opposed to official policy were
 subject to charge under any one of several provisions in the Criminal Code that out-
 law acts against the State.
 No official statistics are available on the percentage of the prison population that
 consists of pretrial detainees or the average period of time that such detainees have
 been held. It is difficult to determine the exact number of political detainees, in part
 because the Government usually does not publicize such arrests and because the
 Government does not consider these persons to be detained for political reasons.
 The Government pressured several released prisoners, including Doan Viet Hoat
 and Dong Tuy, to leave the country and go into exile as a condition for their release.
 Dong Tuy remained in the country after his releale. Others were permitted to re-
 main in the country. The Government continued to employ internalisolation to re-
 strict the movement of certain political and religious dissidents. The leader of the
 Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich Huyen Quang, remained under admin-
 istrative detention in Quang Nga province and was prohibited from returning to his
 home pagoda in Hue. The Government claimed that he is not under any legal re-
 strictions but did not permit outsiders to verify his status.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendence of judges and jurors, in practice the Party controls the courts closely at
 all levels, selecting judges primarily for their political reliability. Credible reports
 indicate that party officials, including top leaders, instruct courts how to rule on po-
 litically important cases. The National Assembly votes for candidates that are pre-
 sented by the President for Supreme People's Court, president and Supreme Peo-
 ple's procurator. The President appoints all other judges.
 The court system consists of the Supreme People's Court in Hanoi, provincial
 courts, district courts, and military tribunals. The Supreme People's Court can re-
 view cases from the lower courts or tribunals. Separately, economic courts handle
 commercial disputes. Administrative courts deal with complaints by citizens about
 official abuse and corruption. The economic and administrative courts have ad-
 dressed few cases since their creation in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Local mass
 organizations, such as the Under the Fatherland Front, are empowered to deal with
 minor breaches of law or disputes.
 The Supreme People's Procuracy has unchecked power to bring charges against
 the accused and serves as prosecutor during trials. A judging council, made up of
 a judge and one or more people's jurors (lay judges), determines guilt or innocence
 and also passes sentence on the convicted. The relevant people's council appoints
 people's jurors, who are required to have high moral standards but need not have
 legal training.
 The Government continued its effort to develop the legal system as part of ex-
 panding the rule of law. In January it put into effect a commercial code that helps
 regulate business transactions. Many judges and other court officials lacked ade-
 quate legal training, and the Government conducted training programs to address
 problem. A number of foreign governments provided assistance to the Govern-
 
 
 1093
 ment to strengthen rule of law and develop a more effective judiciary. However, the
 lack of openness in the judicial process and the continuing lack of independence of
 the judiciary undermined the Governmentis efforts to develop a fair, effective, judi-
 cial system. In some cases, individual judges appeared to exercise independent judg-
 ment. For example, an administrative judge ruled in favor of a foreign
 businessperson in a tax dispute with a Vietnamese person.
 Trials generally are open to the public, although judicial authorities sometimes
 closed trials or strictly limited attendance in sensitive cases. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trial and to have a lawyer. The defendant or the defense
 lawyer have the right to cross-examine witnesses. However, in political cases, there
 are credible reports that defendants are not allowed access to government evidence
 in advance of the trial; to cross-examine witnesses, or to challenge statements. Little
 information is available on the extent to which defendants and their lawyers have
 time to prepare for trials. Those convicted have the right to appeal.
 The Government continued to hold persons for the peaceful expression of dissent-
 ing religious or political views. For example, Nguyen Van Thuan and Le Duc Vuoug
 continued to serve lengthy prison sentences for publishing a reformist newsletter.
 Nguyen Dinh Huy remained in-prison for trying to organize a conference on democ-
 racy in Ho Chi Minh City in 1993. Two of the seven imprisoned priests from the
 Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix were released. Some political prisoners
 were denied visitation rights.
 Amnesty International lists more than 40 prisoners held for political reasons but
 suggests that the total may be higher. Other sources put the figure at from 100 to
 150 persons. The Government states that it does not hold any political prisoners.
 However, the Government usually does not publicize the arrests of citizens for polit-
 ical reasons and frequently conducts closed trials and sentencing sessions.
 As part of a national day amnesty on September 2, the Government released more
 than 5,000 prisoners, most of them convicted criminals. It also released 2,600 more
 prisoners in November. Among those released were more than 2 dozen persons held
 for the peaceful exercise of their political and reli gous beliefs. Included in these am-
 nesties were prominent political dissidents Doan Viet Hoat, Nguyen Dan Que, Dong
 Tuy, Nguyen Van Bien, Pham Tuong, and Bui Kim Dinh; Nguyen Van Thuan; sen-
 ior monks of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam Thich Quang Do, Thich Tri
 Sieu, and Thich Tue Sy; Thich Khonh Tanh; Catholic priests Reverend Dinh Viet
 Hieu and Reverend Nguyen Chau Dat, Buddhist monks Thich Nhat Ban and Thich
 Knong Tanh, and a large number of other political and religious prisoners. Dr. Hoat
 left the coun  after being told by government officials that he could not leave pris-
 on unless he eft the country (see Section 1.d.). Dr. Que was told the same thing
 but refused to depart Vietnam; he was released anyway.
 The Government claims that there are no political prisoners, and states that these
 persons were convicted of violating national security laws. The Government does not
 publish lists of those imprisoned.
 f Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy of home and correspondence; however,
 the Government restricts this right significantly. It operates a nationwide system
 of surveillance and control through household registration and block wardens who
 use informants to keep track of individuals' activities. Citizens must register with
 police when they leave home, remain in another location overnight, or when they
 change their residence (see Section 2.d.). However, these requirements are not en-
 forced consistently; many citizens move around the country to seek work or to visit
 family and friends without being monitored closely. The authorities continued to
 monitor citizens, but with less vigor and efficiency than in the past, as they focused
 on persons whom they suspected of involvement in unauthorized political or reli-
 gious activities. There have been reports that some families have been unable to ob-
 tain household registration or residence permits, causing serious legal and adminis-
 trative problems. In urban areas, most citizens were free to maintain contact and
 work with foreigners, but police questioned some individual citizens and families of
 citizens with extensive or close relations with foreigners.
 The Government opened and censored citizens' mail, confiscated packages, and
 monitored telephone, electronic mail, and facsimile transmissions. The Party exerted
 little pressure on citizens to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist
 for villages, city districts, schools, workers (trade unions), youth, veterans and
 women. Membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government
 or in state companies and is vital for promotion to senior levels of the Government.
 At the same time, diversification of the economy has made membership in mass or-
 ganizations and the VCP less essential to financial and social advancement.
 The Government continued to implement a family planning policy that urges all
 families to have no more than two children; this policy emphasizes exhortation rath-
 
 
 1094
 er than coercion. In principle the Government can deny promotions and salary in-
 creases to government employees with more than two children. In practice the pen-
 alty is enforced only rarely.
 For others, there are no penalties for those with more than two children, but local
 regulations permit fines based on the cost of extra social services incurred by the
 larger family or reductions in state subsidies for those services. These penalties are
 not applied uniformly or universally.
 While foreign language periodicals are widely available in the cities, the Govern-
 ment occasionally censors articles about the country in foreign periodicals for sale
 within the country.
 The Government allowed access to the Internet beginning in January, and owns
 and controls the country's only Internet access provider. Five Internet service pro-
 viders compete for subscribers. There are fewer than 15,000 Internet subscribers
 and a handful of cyber cafes in major cities. The Government appeared to limit ac-
 cess to those persons who are allowed to have Internet accounts. Persons with Inter-
 net access in their homes were able to access most sites operated by Vietnamese
 exile groups abroad, although some computer firewails exist. Government authori-
 ties sometimes monitor which sites subscribers access. By law, access to satellite tel-
 evision was limited to top officials, foreigners, luxury hotels, and the press. The law
 was not enforced, and some persons in urban and rural areas have access via home
 satellite equipment. The Government generally did not limit access to international
 radio; however, it jammed Radio Free Asia.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.7--The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but in practice the Government severely limits these freedoms, es-
 pecially concerning political and religious subjects. Reporters and editors practiced
 self-censorship on sensitive subjects.
 Both the Constitution and the Criminal Code include broad national security and
 antidefamation provisions that the Government used to limit such freedoms strictly.
 The party and Government tolerate public discussion and permit somewhat more
 criticism than in the-past. For example, citizens could and did complain openly
 about inefficient government, administrative procedures, corruption, and economic
 policy. However, the Government imposed limits in these areas as well. In Septem-
 ber 1997, the Government adopted a directive requiring journalists to obtain ap-
 proval from the Ministry of Culture and Information before passing any information
 to foreign journalists. In October 1997, the party Politburo issued a circular under-
 scoring that media activities are "under the leadership of the State and the manage-
 ment of the party." Also in October 1997, journalist Nguyen Hoang Linh, the editor
 of a business newspaper, was arrested and charged with revealing state secrets. He
 was convicted in October, then released for time served for publishing articles de-
 tailing alleged corruption among customs officials.
 Retired General, war hero, and former party member Tran Do ignored govern-
 ment pressure to cease his critical writings against the Government and the party.
 The Government continued to prohibit free speech that strayed outside narrow
 limits to question the role of the party, criticize individual government leaders, pro-
 mote pluralism or multiparty democracy, or questioned the regimes policies on sen-
 sitive matters such as human rights. There continued to be an ambiguous line be-
 tween what constituted private speech about sensitive matters, which the authori-
 ties would tolerate, and public speech in those areas, which they would not. Several
 authors whose works attracted official censure in past years continued to be denied
 permission to publish, speak publicly, or travel abroad. Security forces harassed
 novelist Duong Thu Huong, and authorities revoked her passport.
 In November 1997, in connection with a demonstration in Binh Thai province, the
 Government imposed a temporary news embargo (see Section 2.b.),
 The party, the Government, and party-controlled mass organizations controlled all
 print and electronic media. The Government exercises oversight through the Min-
 istry of Culture and Information, supplemented by pervasive party guidance and na-
 tional security legislation sufficiently broad to ensure effective self-censorship in the
 domestic media. With apparent party approval, several newspapers engaged in in-
 vestigative reporting on corruption and mismanagement as well as in open and
 sometimes heated debate on economic policy. The Government occasionally censors
 articles about the country in foreign periodicals that are sold in the country. The
 Government generally did not limit access to international radio, except to Radio
 Free Asia, which it jammed (see Section 1.f.).
 Foreign journalists must be approved by the Foreign Ministry's Press Center and
 must be based in Hanoi. The number of foreign staff allowed each foreign press or-
 ganization is limited. The center monitors journalists' activities and decides on a
 
 
 1095
 
 case-by-case basis whether to a pprove their interview, photograph, film, or travel re-
 quests, all of which must be submitted 5 days in advance. Foreign ministry officials
 no longer accompany foreign ournalists on all interviews. The Government censored
 television footage and delayed export of footage by several days.
 The Government allowed artists some latitude in choosing the themes of their
 works. Many artists received permission to exhibit their works abroad, receiving
 exit permits to attend the exhibits and export permits to send their works out of
 the country. However, police and municipal cultural authorities prohibited several
 exhibits or removed selected works from authorized exhibits when they determined
 that the works strayed too far from what authorities considered the mainstream,
 made too much social commentary, or could have been interpreted as criticizing or
 making fun of the Government.
 The Government permitted a more open flow of information within the country
 and into the country from abroad, including the university system. Foreign aca-
 demic professionals temporarily working at universities said that they were able to
 discuss nonpolitical issues widely and freely in the classroom. Government monitors
 regularly attended, without official notification, classes taught by foreigners and
 citizens. Academic publications usually reflected the views of the party and the Gov-
 ernment, and exhibited greater freedom for differing views on nonpolitical subjects
 than for political ones.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is re-
 stricted in law and practice. Persons who wish to gather in a group are required
 to apply for a permit, which local authorities can issue or deny arbitrarily. However,
 persons routinely gather in informal groups without government interference. Dur-
 ing the year there were a number of small protests (of from 10 to 25 persons) out-
 aide government and party office buildings and the National Assembly hall. These
 protests usually focused on local grievances, and the authorities generally allowed
 them to run their course without retaliation. However, the Government does not
 permit demonstrations that could be seen as having a political purpose. However,
 it was more tolerant than in the past of occasional demonstrations by citizens about
 specific grievances against local officials. Nonetheless, the Government did not toler-
 ate extended demonstrations.
 In November 1997, there were extensive protests in Thai Binh province against
 provincial management and corruption. In response, national authorities removed a
 number of local officials accused of corruption, ended the demonstrations, detained
 some organizers, and imposed a temporary news embargo (see Section 2.a.).
 With a few exceptions, the Government prohibits the establishment of private,
 independent organizations, insisting that persons work within established, party-
 controlled organizations. Citizens are prohibited from establishing any type of inde-
 pendent organization, including political parties, labor unions, and religious or vet-
 erans' organizations. Such organizations exist only under government control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Both the Constitution and government decrees provide
 for freedom of worship; however, the Government continued to restrict significantly
 those organized activities of religious organizations that it defined as being at vari-
 ance with state laws and policies. The Government generally allowed persons to
 practice individual worship in the religion of their choice, and participation in reli-
 gious activities throughout the country continued to grow significantly. In some re-
 spects, conditions for religious freedom improved. In many areas, Buddhists, Catho-
 lics, and Protestants reported an increase in religious activity and observance. How-
 ever, government regulations control religious hierarchies and organized religious
 activities, in part because the party fears that organized religion may weaken its
 authority and influence.
 Religious organizations must obtain government permission to hold training semi-
 nars, conventions, and celebrations outside the regular religious calendar, to build
 or remodel places of worship, to engage in charitable activities or operate religious
 schools, and to train, ordain, promote, or transfer clergy. These powers lie prin-
 cipally with provincial or city people's committees, and local treatment of religious
 persons varied widely. In some areas, such as Ho Chi Minh City, local officials al-
 lowed religious persons wide latitude in practicing their faith, including allowing
 some educational and humanitarian activities. However, in other areas such as the
 northwest provinces, local officials allowed believers little discretion in the practice
 of their faith. In general, religious groups faced difficulty in obtaining teaching ma-
 terials, expanding training facilities, publishing religious materials, and expanding
 the clergy in training in response to increasing demand from congregations.
 Buddhism is the dominant religious belief, with many believers practicing an
 amalgam of Mahayana Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian traditions that is sometimes.
 called Vietnam's "triple religion." A Khmer minority in the south practices
 Theravada Buddhism. Three-fourths of the population are at least nominally Bud-
 
 
 1096
 dhist and visit pagodas on festival days. One prominent Buddhist official estimated
 that 30 percent of citizens are devout and practice their faith regularly.
 The Government requires all Buddhist monks to work under a party-controlled
 umbrella organization, the Central Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The Government
 suppressed efforts by the non-government-sanctioned Unified Buddhist Church of
 Vietnam (UBCV) to operate independently, and tension between the Government
 and the UBCV continued. Several prominent UBCV monks, including Thich Quang
 Do, were released in the September and November amnesties, but others continue
 to be imprisoned. The UBCV's leader, the venerable Thich Huyen Quang, was re-
 quired to remain in administrative detention (see Section 1.d.) in an isolated pagoda
 in Quang Ngai province and was not allowed to visit his home pagoda in Hue. There
 are no confirmed reports of a 1997 detention of UBCV monks. Worshipers in several
 Buddhist, Catholic, and Cao Dai centers of worship reported that undercover gov-
 erment observers attended worship services and monitored the activities of the
 congregations and the clergy.
 The Government eased its efforts to control the Catholic hierarchy by relaxing the
 requirements that all clergy belong to the government-controlled Catholic Patriotic
 Association. Few clergy actually belong to the Catholic Patriotic Association.
 Authorities approved the Vatican's ordination of a new archbishop in Ho Chi
 Minh City. In March a high-level Vatican envoy visited the country, and a number
 of Vietnamese bishops traveled to Rome, Italy for a synod of Asian bishops. Up to
 100,000 Catholics gathered in August at a Marian celebration in La Vang in the
 central part of the country and were able to worship and celebrate their faith freely.
 The local Catholic Church hierarchy remained frustrated by the Government's re-
 strictions, but has learned to accommodate itself to them for many years. During
 the year, a number of clergy reported a modest easing of government control over
 church activities in certain dioceses. The Government relaxed its outright prohibi-
 tion on the Catholic Church's involvement in religious- education and charitable ac-
 tivities, but still restricted such activity. The degree of government control of church
 activities varied greatly among localities. In some areas, especially in the south,
 churches and religious groups operated kindergartens and engaged in a variety of
 humanitarian projects.
 The Government allowed many bishops and priests to travel freely within their
 dioceses and allowed greater, but still restricted freedom for travel outside these
 areas. For example, the Government restricted such travel in many ethnic areas.
 Upon return from international travel, priests and nuns must surrender their pass-
 ports. The Government limits the Church to operating 6 major seminaries through-
 out the country, totaling approximately 500 students. The Government allowed the
 Church to recruit new seminarians only every 2 years. All stdents must be ap-
 proved by the Government, both upon entering the seminary and prior to ordination
 as priests. The number of graduating students is insufficient to support the growing
 Catholic population, now estimated at 6 million.
 The network of "Tin Lank" (Good News) churches, originally founded by the
 Christian Missionary Alliance, operated with slightly greater freedom than did other
 Protestant organizations. Independent of this group, a large number of Pentecostal
 "house churches" meet in members' homes, many of them in ethnic minority areas.
 Protestant church attendance grew substantially despite continued government re-
 strictions on proselytizing activities. The Government restricted Protestant con-
 gregations from cooperating on joint religious observances or other activities, al-
 though in some localities there was greater freedom to do so. Nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) reported continued arrests and government harassment of eth-
 nic Hmong Protestants for disseminating bibles and other religious literature in
 northern villages. There are credible reports that a number of Hmong evangelical
 Protestants were imprisoned in the northwestern provinces at year's end.
 Despite the Government's statement in 1997 that it had recognized Cao Dai le-
 gally and had encouraged Cao Dai sects to expand, some members of the Cao Dai
 religion were detained arbitarily. There were reports that in 1997 some Cao Dai
 members were subjected to persecution; there were no such reports during the year.
 Believers in the Cao Dai faith faced restrictions on their church operations, hier-
 archy, and clergy. The authorities detained two Cao Dai believers in October. Cao
 Dai congregations are active in Tay Ninh province, Ho Chi Minh City, the Mekong
 Delta, and Hanoi.
 Mosques serving the country's small Muslim population operated in Hanoi, Ho
 Chi Minh City, and several provinces in the southern part of the country. The Gov-
 ernment no longer has a policy of restricting exit permits to prevent Muslims from
 making the hajj. About 1 dozen Muslims made the hajj to Mecca during the year.
 In October the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance,
 Abdelfattah Amor, visited Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hue, and Tay Ninh provinces.

 He met with government officials and representatives of the government-sanctioned
 Central Buddhist Church, the Catholic Church, Cao Dai, and the small Muslim com-
 munity. However, Amor was prevented by security officials from meeting several
 senior representatives of the non-government-sanctioned Unified Buddhist Church
 of Vietnam (UBCV), including Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do, despite re-
 peated requests to do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens enjoyed freedom of movement within the country. How-
 ever, some local authorities required members of ethnic minority groups to obtain
 permission to travel outside certain highland areas. Officially, citizens had to obtain
 permission to change their residence (see Section 1.f.). In practice many persons con-
 tinued to move without approval, especially migrant or itinerant laborers moving
 from rural areas to cities in search of work. However, moving without permission
 restricted their ability to obtain legal work permits. Citizens are reuired to notify
 police if they intend to be away from their residence overnight an  must register
 with police anywhere that they stay overnight. These requirements are not always
 enforced strictly. The Government employs internal isolation.to restrict the move-
 ment of political and religious dissidents. The Government continued to use its 1997
 decree on administrative detention to restrict where citizens live and work (see Sec-
 tion 1.f.).
 Foreigners generally are free to travel throughout the country, except in some
 areas restricted on grounds of national security. The Government retained the right
 to approve travel to border areas, to some areas in the central highlands, and to
 some islands, but in practice foreigners can travel easily to most border areas with-
 out approval. However, on several occasions, local police detained and fined foreign-
 ers whom police said had ventured too close to international borders and other sen-
 sitive military areas.
 Early in the year, the Government ended its requirement that citizens traveling
 abroad obtain exit or reentry visas, although the Government sometimes prevented
 persons from traveling by refusing to issue passports to persons who wished to
 travel.
 Citizens must demonstrate eligibility to emigrate to another country and show
 sponsorship abroad, before the Government issues exit permits, which are required
 before a person is able to emigrate. Citizens' access to exit permits frequently was
 constrained by factors outside the law such as bribery and corruption. Refugee and
 immigrant visa applicants to the Orderly Departure Program (ODP) sometimes en-
 countered local officials who arbitrarily delayed or denied exit permits based on per-
 sonal animosities or on the official's perception that an applicant did not meet pro-
 gram criteria, or in order to extort a bribe.
 The ODP continued to resettle abroad immigrant and refugee beneficiaries, in-
 cluding Amerasians, former reeducation camp detainees, and family unification
 cases. Other nations operated smaller resettlement programs for Vietnamese citi-
 zens. There are some concerns that some members of minority ethnic groups, par-
 ticularly nonethnic Vietnamese such as the Montagnards, may not have ready ac-
 cess to these programs. The Government denied exit permits for emigration to cer-
 tain Montagnard applicants.
 The Government generally permits citizens who emigrate to return to visit, but
 it considers them Vietnamese citizens and therefore subject to the obligations of a
 Vietnamese citizen under the law, even if they have adopted another country's citi-
 zenship. However, emigrants are not permitted to use Vietnamese passports after
 they adopt other citizenship. Because overseas Vietnamese are considered a valu-
 able potential source of foreign exchange and expertise to Vietnam but also a poten-
 tial security threat, the Government generally encourages them to visit Vietnam but
 monitors many of them carefully.
 Vietnam and the United States continued to work together on the Resettlement
 Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees Program (ROVR) in processing several thou-
 sand Vietnamese who had returned from refugee camps elsewhere in Southeast Asia
 to apply for resettlement in the United States. Applicant interviews and movements
 to the United States were under way at year's end.
 Vietnam cooperated with the international community in implementing the Com-
 prehensive Plan of Action (CPA), which was in effect in Vietnam between 1989 and
 June 1996, to resolve the situation of the thousands of Vietnamese who departed
 the country illegally. In 1988, as part of the CPA, Vietnam had signed a memoran-
 dum of understanding with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
 increase acceptance of voluntary repatriates from camps in countries of first asylum,
 provided that there was financial assistance. The agreement included a commitment
 to waive prosecution and punitive measures for the illegal departure from Vietnam
 of persons who return under the UNHCR voluntary repatriation program. Vietnam
 
 
 1098
 also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees through direct visits.
 More than 110,000 Vietnamese have returned from countries of first asylum. Of
 those, more than 95,000 returned voluntarily. As many as another 13,000 were re-
 patriated involuntarily. Some of these persons had committed crimes in camps in
 countries of first asylum, were tried and convicted, and had served jail sentences
 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The UNHCR, which monitored re-
 patriates, reported that they do not face retribution or discrimination. Individual re-
 turnees have faced legal action after return on charges of illegal activities carried
 out either before departure (other than illegal departure) or after return. A ROVR
 returnee was executed after being convicted of blowing up an ammunition dump and
 causing injuries before he had left Vietnam originally.
 The Constitution allows consideration of asylum under certain circumstances for
 foreigners persecuted abroad. Otherwise, Vietnam does not have provisions for the
 granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the standards of the 1951
 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. There
 were no reports that any individuals requested asylum. In the 1970's and 1980's,
 Vietnam admitted refugees from Cambodia, most of whom were ethnic Chinese.
 More recently, between 1993 and 1995, Vietnam admitted 30,000 persons from
 Cambodia, mainly ethnic Vietnamese. The Government cooperates with the UNHCR
 and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports
 of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Party control over the
 selection of candidates in elections for the National Assembly, the Presidency, the
 Prime Ministership, and local government undermines this right. All authority and
 political power is vested in the VCP; political opposition movements and other politi-
 cal parties are not tolerated. The VCP Central Committee is the supreme decision-
 making body in the nation, with the Politburo as the locus of policymaking. A stand-
 ing board, consisting of the five most senior members of the politburo, oversees day-
 to-day implementation of leadership directives. The Government limited public de-
 bate and criticism to certain aspects of individual, state, or party performance deter-
 mined by the VCP itself. No public challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party state
 is permitted; however, there were isolated instances of letters critical of the Govern-
 ment being circulated publicly (see Section 2.a.).
 Eligible citizens are required to vote in elections, although there is no penalty for
 not voting. Citizens elect the members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the
 main legislative body, but the party must approve all candidates, most of whom are
 VCP members. Most National Assembly members belong to the VCP, although 15
 percent do not.'
 The National Assembly, although subject to party-control, played an increasingly
 independent role, as a forum for the expression of local and provincial concerns and
 as a critic of corruption and inefficiency. However, the National Assembly does not
 initiate legislation and may not pass legislation that the party opposes. Party offi-
 cials occupied most senior government and National Assembly positions and contin-
 ued to have the final say on key issues. During the year, the National Assembly
 continued to engage in increasingly vigorous debate on economic, legal, and social
 issues, including the banking sector management of the budget, land use, and how
 to handle public complaints. Legislators questioned and criticized ministers in No-
 vember in a session broadcast live on television.
 The law provides the opportunity for equal participation in politics by women and
 minority groups, but in practice they are underrepresented. Most of the top leaders
 are male. There is one woman in the Politburo and 25 in the 450-member National
 Assembly. Women hold a few important positions, including Vice President and sev-
 eral Ministers and Vice Ministers.
 The president of the National Assembly, who is also a Politburo member, is a
 member of an ethnic minority.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit private, local human rights organizations to
 form or operate. It generally prohibits private citizens from contacting international
 human rights organizations. The Government permitted the UNHCR and inter-
 national visitors to monitor implementation of its repatriation commitments under
 the Comprehensive Plan of Action and carried on a limited dialog with foreign
 human rights organizations based outside Vietnam.
 
 
 1099
 The Government showed increased willingness to discuss human rights problems
 bilaterally with other governments if such discussions take place under the rubric
 of "exchanges of ideas" rather than as "investigations." Several foreign governments
 held official talks during the year concerning human rights problems.
 In October the Government allowed a visit by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Re-
 ligious Intolerance. However, while the Special Rapporteur met with government of-
 ficials and representatives of both government-sanctioned and some non-govern-
 ment-sanctioned churches, security forces prevented him from meeting with several
 UBCV representatives, despite his repeated requests to do so (see Section 2.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, religion, or
 social class. However, enforcement of these prohibitions was uneven. Persons for-
 merly interned in reeducation camps on the basis of pre-1975 association with the
 government of the former Republic of South Vietnam continued to report varying
 levels of discrimination as they and their families sought access to housing, edu-
 cation, and employment. Some military veterans remain in detention. They and
 their families generally are not allowed employment with the Government. This pro-
 hibition is less important than in past years because of the growth in private sector
 job opportunities.
 Women.-International NGO workers and many women reported that domestic vi-
 olence against women was common. The law addresses the problem of domestic vio-
 lence, but authorities do not enforce it effectively. Many divorces reportedly are due
 to domestic violence, but many women likely remain in abusive marriages rather
 than confront the stigma of divorce.
 The Government, international NGO's, and the press reported an increase in re-
 cent years in trafficking in women both domestically and to other countries for pur-
 poses of prostitution. The Government is working with international NGO's to sup-
 plement law enforcement measures and is cooperating with other national govern-
 ments to prevent trafficking. Organized groups lure poor, often rural, women with
 promises of jobs or marriage and force them to work as prostitutes. Some women
 are kidnaped and sold as wives to men in other countries.
 While there is no legal discrimination, women face deeply ingrained societal dis-
 crimination. Despite extensive provisions in the Constitution, in legislation, and in
 regulations that mandate equal treatment, and although some women occupy high
 government posts, few women compete effectively for higher status positions. The
 Constitution provides that women and men must receive equal pay for equal work,
 but the Government does not enforce this provision. Despite the large body of legis-
 lation and regulations devoted to the protection of women's rights in marriage as
 well as in the workplace, and Labor Law provisions that call for preferential treat-
 ment of women, women do not always receive equal treatment. Nevertheless,
 women play an important role in the economy and are widely engaged in business
 and in social and educational institutions. Opportunities for young professional
 women have increased markedly, with greater numbers entering the civil service,
 universities, and the private sector.
 The party-controlled Women's Union has a broad agenda to promote women's
 rights, including political, economic, and legal equality, and protection from spousal
 abuse. The union operates micro-credit consumer finance programs and other pro-
 grams to promote the advancement of women. International NGO's and inter-
 national organizations regard the union as effective, but they and Women's Union
 representatives believe that much time is required to overcome societal attitudes
 that relegate women to lower status than men. The Government also has a Commit-
 tee for the Advancement of Women, which coordinates intraministerial programs af-
 fecting women.
 Children.-NGO's and international organizations reported that despite the Gov-
 ernment's promotion of child protection and welfare, children increasingly were at
 risk of economic exploitation. While education is compulsory, the authorities did not
 enforce the requirement, especially in rural areas where government and family
 budgets for education are strained; thousands of children work in exploitative child
 labor (see Section 6.d.). The Government continued a nationwide immunization cam-
 paign, and the government-controlled press regularly stressed the importance of
 health and education for all children. Reports from local sources indicate that re-
 sponsible officials generally took these goals seriously but were constrained by se-
 verely limited budgets. Despite some success, an estimated 3 million children lived
 in "especially difficult" circumstances, of an estimated 18 million children in the
 country.
 
 
 1100
 
 Widespread poverty contributed to continued trafficking in minors domestically,
 as well as to foreign destinations as prostitutes. Government agencies were engaged
 in combating this abuse. There was no information publicly available on the extent
 of child abuse (see Section 6.c.). Police beat street children (see Section 1.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-Government provision of services to the disabled is lim-
 ited, and the Government provides little official protection or effective support for
 the disabled. Government agencies responsible for services to the disabled worked
 with domestic and foreign groups to "identify measures" to provide protection, sup-
 port, and physical access for the disabled. Implementation is hampered by limited
 budgets. The 1995 Labor Law requires the State to protect the rights and encourage
 the employment of the disabled. It includes provisions for preferential treatment for
 firms that recruit disabled persons for training or apprenticeship and a special levy
 on firms that do not employ disabled workers. It is uncertain whether the Govern-
 ment enforces these provisions. The Government permitted international groups to
 assist those disabled by war or by subsequent accidents involving unexploded ord-
 nance and has developed indigenous prosthetics manufacturing capabilities. There
 are no laws mandating physical access to buildings.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government states that it is
 opposed to discrimination against ethnic minorities, societal discrimination against
 minorities is widespread. In addition there continued to be credible reports that
 local officials sometimes restricted ethnic minority access to education, employment,
 and mail services. Some central government officials, including the chairman of the
 National Assembly, are members of ethnic minorities. The Government continued
 to implement policies designed to narrow the gap in the standard of living between
 ethnic groups living in the highlands and lowland ethnic Vietnamese by granting
 preferential treatment to domestic and foreign companies that invest in highland
 areas. The stated goal of government resettlement policy in mountainous provinces
 is to move disadvantaged minorities from inaccessible villages to locations where
 basic services are easier to provide, but the effect of the policy sometimes has been
 to dilute the political and social solidarity of these groups. There were anecdotal re-
 ports that the Government continued to repress some highland minorities for sus-
 pected ties with resistance groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Unions are controlled by the party, and have only
 nominal independence; however, union leaders influence some key decisions, such
 as on health and safety issues, and on minimum wage standards. Workers are not
 free to join or form unions of their choosing; such action requires approval from the
 local office of the Party-controlled Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGOL).
 The VGCL is the -umbrella organization under which all local trade unions must op-
 erate, and it claims 4 million members in branches in each of the major cities and
 provinces. VGCL officers report that the VGCL represents 95 percent of public sec-
 tor workers, 90 percent of workers in state-owned enterprises, and 50 percent of pri-
 vate sector workers. The Labor Law requires provincial trade union organizations
 to establish unions within 6 months at all new enterprises with more than 10 em-
 ployees as well as at existing enterprises that operate without trade unions. Man-
 agement of those companies is required by law to accept and cooperate with those
 unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) and foreign governments are
 providing technical assistance and training to the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and
 Social Affairs and to the VGCL.
 The Labor Law provides for the right to strike under certain circumstances. The
 law requires that management and labor resolve labor disputes through the enter-
 prise's own labor conciliation council. If that fails, the matter goes to the provincial
 labor arbitration council. Labor courts, which were established in 1996 within the
 people's court system, heard a small number of cases but still are in the early stages
 of development and lack sufficient personnel because of government budget con-
 straints. The government-controlled labor unions stipulate written procedures for
 managing labor disputes that permit unresolved disputes to be arbitrated before a
 court. Unions have the right to appeal a council decision to the provincial people's
 court and to strike. However, the law prohibits strikes at enterprises that serve the
 public and those that are important to the national economy or national security
 and defense. These functions are defined by the Government and include electrical
 production, posts and telecommunications, railway, maritime and air transportation,
 banking, public works, and the oil and gas industry. The law also grants the Gov-
 ernment the right to suspend a strike considered detrimental to the national econ-
 omy or public safety. Strikes are prohibited in 54 occupational sectors and busi-
 nesses, including public services, businesses producing "essential" goods, and busi-
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1101
 nesses serving national defense under the Ministries of Public Security and Na-
 tional Defense.
 During the year, there were 60 spontaneous private and public strikes, primarily
 against foreign-owned or joint venture companies but also involved state-owned and
 private firms. The Government tolerated these strikes, even though most were spon-
 taneous or illegal. None were organized by the VGCL or its affiliate unions. The
 Labor Law prohibits retribution against strikers, and there were no credible reports
 of such retribution.
 Individual unions legally are not free to affiliate with, join, or participate in, inter-
 national labor bodies, and they do not do so in practice. However, the VGCL has
 relations with 95 labor organizations in 70 countries.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers must have the ap-
 proval of the provincial or metropolitan branch of the VGCL in order to organize
 unions in their enterprises, but they also can bargain collectively through the party-
 approved unions at their enterprises. In the past, the State generally set wages,
 since most employees worked for state companies. With the growth of the private
 sector and the increased autonomy of state firms, a growing percentage of compa-
 nies are setting wages through collective bargaining with the relevant unions. Mar-
 ket forces also play a much more important role in determining wages. The Labor
 Law prohibits antiunion discrimination on the part of employers against employees
 seeking to organize.
 There are a number of export processing zones and industrial zones, which are
 governed by the same Labor Laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits all forms
 of forced and bonded labor;, however, there were reports that it occurred. There were
 credible reports that some prisons employ the use of forced labor, sometimes as part
 of commercial ventures, without compensation to prisoners. The Government denies
 that this occurs. The Government periodically assesses required labor, or its mone-
 tary equivalent, in the construction of national infrastructure projects. There were
 no reports of forced labor on national infrastructure projects as in 1997.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 does not prohibit specifically forced and bonded labor by children, and there were
 some reports of such practices. A recent study of child labor in Ho Chi Minh City
 found cases in which poor families had entered into "verbal agreements" with em-
 ployers, who put the families' children to work; their salaries generally are sent to
 their parents. Officials state that juveniles in reeducation camps, which function
 much as reform schools or juvenile detention centers do elsewhere, are assigned
 work for educational purposes that does not generate income.
 The Labor Law sets the minimum age for employment at 18 years of age, but en-
 terprises may hire children beten n the ages of 15 and 18, as long as the firm ob-
 tains special permission from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs.
 The firm also must ensure that these young workers do not undertake hazardous
 work or work that would harm their physical or mental development. These occupa-
 tions are specified in the Labor Law; They cannot work more than 7 hours per day
 or 42 hours per week and must receive special health care. It is not clear whether
 authorities have the resources to enforce these regulations. Children as young as 13
 years of age can register at trade training centers, which are a form of vocational
 training. There were no reports that stat-owned enterprises or companies with for-
 eign investors used child labor.
 In rural areas, children work primarily on family farms and in other agricultural
 activities. They often begin working at the age of 6, and are expected to work as
 adults by the time they are 15. In urban areas, children work in family-owned small
 businesses. There are compulsory education laws that are not enforced effectively
 in rural areas, where children are needed to work in agriculture. However, the cul-
 ture's strong emphasis on education leads parents who can afford to send their chil-
 dren to school to do so rather than allow them to work.
 In 1997 the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced that Children below the
 age of 16 face increased risk of economic exploitation. The Government estimated
 in 1997 that approximately 29,000 children below the age of 15 were victims of ex-
 ploitative labor. That estimate may have been low, since most of these children are
 working in the informal sector. In 1997 UNICEF cited evidence of children working
 in gold mines and as domestic servants, or working up to 14 hours a day in hazard-
 ous conditions for meager pay or no payment.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Worh.-lThe Labor Law requires the Government to set
 a minimum wage, which is adjusted for inflation and other economic changes. The
 official monthly minimum   wage for foreign-investment joint ventures is $45
 (621,000 dong) in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and $40 elsewhere. The Govern-
 ment can exempt temporarily certain joint ventures from paying the minimum wage
 
 
 1102
 during the first- months of an enterprise's operations, or if the enterprise is located
 in a very remote area, but the minimum wage in these cases can be no lower than
 $30 (414,000 dong. These minimum wage rates are inadequate to provide a worker
 and family with a decent standard of living. However, many workers receive bo-
 nuses and supplement their incomes by engaging in entrepreneurial activities, and
 households often include more than one wage earner. A decreasing number of work-
 ers receive government-subsidized housing. The Government enforces the minimum
 wage only at foreign and major Vietnamese firms.
 The Labor Law sets working hours at a maximum of 8 hours per day and 48
 hours per week, with a mandatory 24-hour break each week. Any additional hours
 require overtime pay at 1.5 times the regular wage and 2 times the regular wage
 on holidays. The law limits compulsory overtime. It is uncertain how well the Gov-
 ernment enforces these provisions.
 According to the law, a female employee who is to be married, is pregnant, is on
 maternity leave, or is raising a child under 1 year of age cannot be dismissed unless
 the enterprise is closed. Female employees who are at least 7 months pregnant or
 are raising a child under 1 year of age cannot work overtime, at night, or in distant
 locations.
 The Labor Law requires the Government to promulgate rules and regulations that
 ensure worker safety. The Ministry of Labor, in coordination with local people's com-
 mittees and labor unions, is charged with enforcing the regulations. In practice, en-
 forcement is inadequate because of the Ministry's inadequate funding. The VGCL
 reported that there are 300 labor inspectors in the country but that at least 600
 are needed. Anecdotal evidence indicates that workers, through labor unions, have
 been effective in forcing changes in working conditions. There was no information
 available on the ability of workers to remove themselves from work situations that
 endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment.
