 LIECHTENSTEIN
 Thd Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy
 and parliamentary democracy whose present Constitution dates
 back to 1921. The reigning Prince is the Head of State. All
 legislation adopted by the unicameral legislature (Landtag)
 must have his concurrence. The Government, whose members are
 appointed by the Prince in agreement with the Landtag on the
 latter's proposal, is' responsible for the entire administration
 of the.State.
 The Principality's police force maintains internal order and is
 aided by a part-time auxiliary police force. Both organizations
 are under the control of the elected-Government and respect
 human rights.
 Despite its small size (29,000 population, of which over'
 one-third are foreigners) and limited natural resources,
 Liechtenstein.has developed during the last three decades from
 a rural agrarian society into a prosperous, highly
 industrialized, free enterprise economy'with an important
 service sector. Through a 1923.treaty, it participates in a
 customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its
 national currency. Unemployment is virtually nonexistent, and
 Liechtenstein enjoys one of the highest standards of living in
 the world.
 Individual human rights are ensured by the Constitution and
 protected in practice. As it has become increasingly involved
 in international forums during the past decade, Liechtenstein
 has demonstrated a strong interest in and commitment to the
 protection of human rights.

 procedure for judicial appeal, and the judiciary is separated

 a three-tier system of courts, a lower court, a high court, and
 a supreme court. The Constitution also provides for an
 administrative court, which hears appeals against any government

 in the Constitution, decides on conflicts of jurisdiction
 between the law courts and the administrative authorities and
 acts as a disciplinary court for members of the Government.
 There are no political prisoners.

 need a judicial warrant to search private property. No
 violations have been reported.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:

 An independent press, effective judiciary, and democratic
 political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and
 press. There are two newspapers, each representing the
 interests of one of the two major political parties. There are
 no television or radio broadcasting facilities within the
 Principality, but residents freely receive radio and television
 broadcasts from neighboring Switzerland, Austria, and Germany,
 and many are also cable television subscribers. Academic
 freedom is respected.

 Section 3 Respect for Political-Rights: The Right of'Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The monarchy is hereditary in the -male line. The unicameral
 legislature, comprising 25 deputies, is elected by the people
 every 4 years'by proportional representation. The Constitution
 provides for the right to vote, which is universal, equal,
 secret, and direct. A coalition of the two major political
 parties has formed the Government since 1938. Although there
 are some historical differences between these two parties, as
 well as disagreements over some local issues., a high degree of
 politicaJ"cohsensus exists, and.the rights of emerging
 opposition and splinter groups are respected. The electorate
 regularly irakes us' of its right to participate in initiatives
 and referehdums. Women gained the right to vote in national
 elections in 1984.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The only known human.rights group based in Liechtenstein,
 Justitia, is an informal group of'three or four pers6hs who
 monitor prison conditions. They do so without government
 restriction.    .
 There have been no requests for the investigation of human
 rights violations. Liechtenstein has consistently cooperated
 with international and nongovernmental groups in all areas of
 human rights and has demonstrated a particular interest in and
 support fo  )uman rights and minority rights in international
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Reiigion,.
 Language, or Social Status"
 Discriminatio bid on ra n, laniguage, or social status does
 not exist.,
 The equality of women is 'ot sp,ifially guarantee "in law.
 Several'-groups monitor .and proi~bte-women's 'rights. They report
 that the Government is cooperative with respect to their
 concerns and in some cases provided financial support. Alth6ugh
 laws are in place against discrimination in the workplace,
 these groups note that further implementation is necessary to
 ensure equal pay and other benefits for women. The
 discrimination that persists today is social and traditional,
 not legal, but it nevertheless hinders opportunities for women
 in fields that have been traditionally dominated by men.
 Violence against women is unusual. Wife beating is prohibited
 by law, and Liechtenstein has facilities through which women
 who are victims of violence may obtain help and counseling.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, including foreign workers in Liechtenstein, have
 the freedom to associate, join the unions of their choice, and
 select their own union representatives. The existing social
 peace, in part due to a high standard of living and an economy
 at full employment, has resulted in a low demand for organized
 worker representation. The one trade union comprises 13 percent
 
 
 1166
 LIECHTENSTEIN
 of the work force but looks after the interest of nonmembers as
 well. It is free to affiliate internationally.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain work
 categories, as outlined in work contracts and agreed to by the
 employees concerned. No strikes are known to have taken place
 in the last 25 years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law provides workers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. This right is recognized for all professions;
 however, because Liechtenstein enjoys the world's highest per
 capita income for a state without oil resources and because
 wealth is well distributed, it is rarely exercised. There are
 no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children under the age of 15 is prohibited.
 Children are required to remain in school for 9 years. Child
 labor laws are enforced by the Government, and adolescent
 workers are provided special protection by law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage; wages are among the highest
 in the world. Liechtenstein law sets the maximum workweek at
 46 hours in industrial firms and 50 hours in nonindustrial
 firms. In practice the average workweek is 40-42 hours.
 Workers under the age of 20 receive a minimum of 5 weeks of
 vacation. After 20, they receive a minimum of 4 weeks.
 Occupational health and safety standards are set by law and
 protect the worker in the workplace. A safe working
 environment is enforced'by a government Department for Worker
 Safety. The trade union also monitors working conditions.
 There were no allegations of worker rights abuses from any
 domestic or foreign source.
