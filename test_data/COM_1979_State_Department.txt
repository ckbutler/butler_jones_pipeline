 COMOROS
 Feudal rule and the dominance of Islam have long been
 the main characteristics of society in the impoverished
 Comoro Islands. This tradition survived through the
 French colonial period but was interrupted shortly after
 independence by the establishment in August 1975 of a regime
 headed by Ali Soilih, who gave a great deal of authority to
 the young and strove to modernize society, collectivize the
 economy, and reduce the role of the Islamic religion, often
 by brutal means. Ali Soilih was overthrown and killed in
 May 1978 in a coup effected by French mercenaries acting on
 behalf of former Chief of State Ahmed Abdallah, a wealthy
 merchant and the dominant figure in the Comorian Island
 of Anjouan. The new government headed by Abdallah denies
 any intention of returning to the past, but is definitely
 conservative in most respects.
 Ali Soilih's overthrow was greeted with genuine relief
 by most Comorians, as his government had become increasingly
 heavy handed and repressive. Ahmed Abdallah and his mer-
 cenary supporters, a number of whom remain in the islands,
 have ruled with a far lighter hand but have occasionally
 resorted to censorship and repressive action to discourage
 criticism and stop some manifestations of political opposi-
 tion. Ahmed Abdallah ran unopposed in the Presidential
 campaign of 1978 and was elected by a 99% vote.   Elections
 for various subordinate government positions and bodies
 were contested, but the officially backed candidates were
 usually elected. All political parties have been banned for
 a period of 12 years.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 A left-wing publication in a nearby country has reported
 and identified two individual cases of torture by the
 present government, both of which ended in the death of the
 victims, but the Department of State has no corroborating
 information. The new Federal Constitution, adopted on
 October 1, 1978, guarantees certain rights on the basis of
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and specifies that
 penal law and procedures are to be governed by federal law,
 but does not mention torture specifically.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Five persons were killed during the May 1978 coup, and Chief
 of State Ali Soilih was killed in the coup's aftermath under
 circumstances that are not clear. Conditions of detention
 have always been poor in the Comoros and prisoners have to
 depend on food provided by their relatives. Criminal
 prisoners, however, have traditionally been allowed out
 during the day to work on their fields.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 A number of persons, most of them former government offi-
 cials, were arrested immediately following the May 1978 coup
 
 
 49
 and are to be tried for crimes committed under the old
 regime. At an extraordinary session starting August 29,
 1979, the National Assembly began consideration of the
 establishment of a special court to try these individuals.
 According to a critical press article in a nearby country, a
 number of other individuals have been arrested since the
 coup on suspicion of plotting against the state. The
 government admits to holding about 20 persons from the old
 regime, but other estimates of individuals held for politi-
 cal reasons have gone as high as 50.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The new penal laws and procedures called for by the Consti-
 tution are yet to be established. The Constitution speci-
 fies the right of all citizens to trial, and to be defend-
 ed. The prisoners who are being held for acts committed
 under the Ali Soilih regime are the only ones to the Depart-
 ment of State's knowledge who have so far been denied tri-
 al. The Constitution guarantees the independence of judges
 and calls for public trials, "except in certain specified
 cases". The latter are not identified.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides qualified protection for the
 inviolability of the home "on the conditions prescribed
 by the laws of the Republic". No infraction of this.
 provision has come to the attention of the Department
 of State.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The economy of the Comoros was severely affected when
 the French ended their subsidies in 1975 following the
 island's unilateral declaration of independence. In
 1978 relations with France were restored, and France is
 providing military, technical, and financial assist-
 ance. International donor institutions, some Arab countries
 and Western Europe have also provided assistance to both
 the Ali Soilih regime and the present government. Ahmed
 Abdallah believes strongly in free enterprise and the
 principal government intervention in the economy at this
 time is price control at the retail level. Economic devel-
 opment plans have only begun to be formulated, primarily by
 newly arrived French counselors, upon whom the Comorian
 authorities are heavily dependent. Most of the islanders
 are illiterate and poor, living on subsistence agriculture,
 fishing, or working in the vanilla and essential oil
 plantations which provide the principal Comorian exports.
 There are serious deficiencies in food and clothing avail-
 ability, shelter, and health care.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 There is only one information medium, the national radio
 
 
 50
 which has always been government owned and operated.
 There have been two reported cases of outside publications
 being banned from the country and one of a foreign reporter
 being arbitrarily evicted. There have been a few instances
 of security forces breaking up gatherings of students who
 were demonstrating against the government. One such
 gathering occurred at the grave of Ali Soilih.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no obstacles to internal and external travel
 or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new Constitution guarantees everyone the right to
 vote. The government is reported to have used subtle
 intimidation measures to influence the various elec-
 tions held in late 1978 and the continued presence of a
 small number of mercenaries is a deterrent to the full
 exercise of political rights by the opposition. While
 opposition candidates did get a part of the vote, most
 government backed candidates won. Considerable liberty
 of expression was noted in the process of establishing
 the new government's institutions. The right of labor
 to strike is guaranteed by the Constitution but is not
 known to have been exercised. While the rights of women are
 guaranteed, their exercise is discouraged by tradition.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 In reply to Amnesty International's queries about the
 fate of Ali Soilih and the imprisoned members of his
 government, the Ahmed Abdallah government has stated
 that Soilih was killed trying to escape and affirmed
 that the detainees would receive fair trials in open
 courts which international observers would be allowed
 to attend.
 Amnesty International has also protested reported death
 sentences pronounced against four Comorian prisoners
 for acts which they had performed while officials of
 the Ali Soilih government. The four men are Salim Hamidi, a
 former Minister of Interior, Ali Toihir Kefe, formerly
 responsible for national defense, Amahada Mohamed, and Aboul
 Wahamed. The latter two men are identified simply as former
 members of the Ali Soilih government. The death sentence
 was reportedly pronounced by a special tribunal headed by
 President Ahmed Abdallah and composed of government min-
 isters which had been set up to try such cases. In a
 subsequent broadcast, the Comorian government denied Amnesty
 International's statement and said no death sentences
 had been pronounced.
