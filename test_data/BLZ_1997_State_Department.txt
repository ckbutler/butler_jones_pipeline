 BELIZE
 Belize is- a parliamentary democracy with a, constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 - independence from the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, a cabinet of ministers,
 -and a.legislative assembly govern the country. The Governor General represents
 Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of head of state. Both local and
 national elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis. The Govern-
 ment generally respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The Police Department has primary responsibility for law enforcement and main-
 tenance of order. The Belize Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for external security
 but when deemed appropriate by civilian authorities may be tasked to assist the po-
 lice department. Both the police and the BDF report to the Minister of National Se-
 curity and.are responsible to and controlled by.civilian authorities. There were occa-
 sional reports of abuse by the police.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, although. tourism has become the principal
 source of foreign exchange earnings. The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on
 preferential access to export markets for sugar and for bananas. The Government
 favors free enterprise and generally encourages investment, although domestic in-
 vestors are given preferential treatment over foreign investors in a number of key
 economic sectors. Preliminary estimates put 1997 gross domestic product growth at
 2.5 percent in real terms. Annual per capita income was about $2,540.
 The Constitution provides for, and citizens enjoy in practice, a wide range of fun-
 damental rights and freedoms. Principal human rights abuses include occasional use
 of excessive force by the police when making arrests, poor prison conditions, lengthy
 pretrial detention, political influence on the judiciary, judicial limits on freedom of
 the press, discrimination and domestic violence against women, and employer mis-
 treatment of immigrant workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or other inhuman punishment. However, the police
 occasionally used excessive force when making arrests. In September an escapee
 from police custody was brutally beaten when apprehended by 2 police officers, 1
 of whom struck the escapee 21 times with a baton. The incident took place in front
 of several witnesses, including a television news crew that broadcast the scene na-
 tionwide. The police department suspended the officer, and he is expected to face
 an internal disciplinary board at a later date. The Police Department, the Police
 Complaints Board, and on occasion special independent commissions appointed by
 the Prime Minister investigate allegations of abuse by officials. BDF representatives
 attended regional human rights conferences and noted that human rights have long
 been a part of their training curriculum.
 Prison conditions are poor. Conditions at the Hattieville prison-the nation's only
 prison-have steadily deteriorated since it opened in 1993 to replace the notoriously
 decrepit Belize City prison. Although designed to house 500 inmates, it now houses
 1,100 or about 6 prisoners per 10-by-12-foot cell. Inmates, especially those in the
 maximum security wing, are exposed to untreated sewage running in shallow
 ditches through the facility. The Hattieville prison includes a separate facility for
 women. There are no medical facilities and no health care providers resident at the
 prison. There is no separate facility for inmates with mental illnesses. Approxi-
 mately 20 percent of the inmates are non-Belizeans. There are rare reports of
 human rights abuses at the prison, in the form of physical brutality by prison war-
 dens. Incidents of gang and drug related violence in the prison are on the rise.
 There is no attempt at social rehabilitation, as indicated by a 75 percent recidivism
 rate.

 The Government took a few steps to address these problems. In July the Govern-
 ment renovated an old military barracks and converted it into a new juvenile deten-
 tion facility called the Youth Enhancement Academy, which will include a rehabili-
 tation program and some efforts at job training. Previously, 13- to 15-year-old chil-
 dren were jailed with hardened criminals. The Government also created the new
 prison position of coordinator general, subsequently filled by the former BDF com-
 mandant, which reports directfy to the Minister of National Security. In August the
 Ministry and the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights cosponsored a 2-day
 conference to discuss problems at the prison.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. The
 law requires the police to inform a detainee of the cause of detention within 48
 hours of arrest and to bring the person before a court within 72 hours. In practice,
 the authorities normally inform detainees immediately of the charges against them.
 Bail is granted in all but the most serious cases. In cases involving narcotics, the
 police cannot grant bail, but a magistrate's court may do so after a full hearing.
 Many detainees cannot afford bail, however, and backlogs in the judicial system
 often cause considerable delays and postponements of hearngs, resulting in an over-
 crowded prison and at times prolonged incarceration before trial.
 The Constitution forbids exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 notwithstanding constitutional provisions, the fact that prominent government lead-
 ers continue to practice law while in office brought the judiciary's independence into
 question. The appearance of judicial independence from the executive branch is also
 compromised because judges and the director of public prosecutions must negotiate
 renewal of their employment contracts with the Government and thus may be vul-
 nerable to political interference.
 The judiciary consists of the magistrate's courts, the Supreme Court, and the
 Court of Appeal. Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme
 Court may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some cases, including those resulting
 in a capital sentence, the convicted party may make a final appeal to the Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom.
 Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have constitutional rights to pre-
 sumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, a
 public trial, and appeal. Legal counsel for indigent defendants is provided by the
 State only for capital offenses. Trial by jury is mandatory in capital cases. The Su-
 preme Court and magistrate's'courts suffer backlogs aggravated by the inability to
 maintain a full complement of judges.
 An inordinate number of significant narcotics-related cases are taking years to re-
 solve. In these cases, defendants are often released on minimal bail payments. The
 nation's longest-running drug case, which took 5 years, finally concluded with a con-
 viction. The defendants, however, were released on a substantial bond pending an
 ape al.
 The'judicial system came under public scrutiny because of several high-profile
 irregularities. In one instance, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court overturned
 a lower court's sentence of four Colombians for narcotics trafficking, despite the fact
 that the case was not under the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal
 later overturned the Chief Justice's ruling. In another case, the Attorney General's
 office was deeply involved in the high-profile prosecution of an opposition political
 leader and questioned the impartiality of the jury when it acquitted the defendant.
 There are lengthy trial backlogs in the judicial system. One factor commonly cited
 is the low pay offered to judges, resulting in a high turnover rate. Two of the five
 Supreme Court justices resigned from the court effective January 1998, and the
 Chief Justice retired.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family,- Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 theseprohibitions, and violations are sub ect to legal sanctions. However, there were
 several cases in which the Government has expropriated private land. The law re-
 quires that the Government assess and pay compensation in such instances, but
 these cases take many years to settle.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press but also permits the authorities to make "reasonable provisions"
 in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 
 
 health. These provisions include forbidding any citizen to question the validity of
 the financial disclosure statements submitted by public officials. Anyone who ques-
 tions these statements orally or in writing outside a rigidly prescribed procedure is
 subject to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 3 years, or both.
 A wide range of viewpoints is publicly presented usually without government in-
 terference in six privately owned weekly newspapers (there is no daily press), half
 of which are directly affiliated with major political parties. All newspapers are sub-
 ject to the constraints of libel laws.
 In a notable exception to freedom of the press, in February the Supreme Court
 issued an injunction barring the nation's print and electronic media from reproduc-
 ing or commenting upon an article in the British press that attacked the Supreme
 Court for its position on capital punishment. The injunction stated that any repro-
 duction of the article in the press would be considered contempt of court and could
 prejudice several capital punishment cases before the Supreme Court. The major
 newspapers and media outlets filed legal challenges against the injunction but were
 not able to persuade the Court to lift it.
 The Supreme Court took a similar action in what was called the most significant
 prosecution since independence. A former deputy leader of the opposition who
 served as Attorney General under an earlier government was charged with commit-
 ting fraud and embezzlement during his previous tenure as the head of the Social
 Security Department. The Supreme Court imposed a gag order on the media barring
 commentary and significant reporting during the 6-week trial, citing its potential
 impact on the jury.   .-
 Since the first privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasting in
 1990, other stations have been established, broadening the audience's choices. Popu-
 lar radio call-in programs are lively and-feature open criticism of and comments on
 government and political matters. Through financial subsidies the, Government con-
 tinues to exert substantial editorial influence over-the nominafly autonomous Broad-
 casting Corporation of Belize (BCB) and its two radio stations; BCB once held a mo-
 nopoly on radio in the country.-The Government utilizes BCB studios and facilities
 -to produce partisan advertisements and party propaganda.
 There are eightprivately owned television broadcasting stations, including several
 cable networks in Belize City and the major towns. -he Government's Belize Infor-
 mation Service and two independent television stations produce local news and fea-
 ture programs. The Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA) regulates broadcasting and
 asserts its right to preview- certain broadcasts, such as those with political content,
 and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material from political broad-
 casts. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this authority during 1997 al-
 though thereeappeared to be ample opportunity to do so during'the aggressive and
 negative media campaigns each party waged during the year.
 The law provides-for academic freedom, and the Government respects it in prac-
 tice.
 b.-Freedom of Peaceful Assembly- and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and the authorities honor it in practice. Political parties and
 other groups with politicalobjectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The or-
 ganizers of public meetings-must obtain a- permit 36 hours in advance of the meet-
 ings; such permits are not-denied for political reasons and are routinely granted in
 practice.
 The Constitution permits citizens to form -and join associations of their choice,
 both political- and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 . The Government generally cooperates with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 -ugees In March the:UNHCRxdowngraded its mission to a liaison office and ceased
 all funding for the Government's Refugee Department, which had previously relied
 upon UNHCR to pay-all program costs, including department employees' salaries.
 The Government is searching for alternative sources of funding.
 A government committee to review applications for asylum meets weekly and in-
 cludes a UNHCR representative as a member. The Government turned down ap-
 proximately 100 requests for asylum in 1997. The Government honors the principle
 of first asyum, and most recently provided it to four persons in 1995.
 In the wake of the civil conflicts in Central America during the 1980's, over
 40,000 mostly Hispanic immigrants came to Belize, many of them entering illegally
 and living in the country without documentation. The Government has granted asy-
 
 
 419
 lum and allowed local resettlement of about 8,000 refugees. In a move criticized by
 the UNHCR, the Government reinterpreted its law to require refugees to live in
 Belize for 10 years before they can apply for citizenship, whereas nonrefugee resi-
 dents must only live in the country for 5 years before applying.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a democracy governed by a Legislative Assembly, with executive direc-
 tion from a cabinet of ministers headed by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel. The
 law requires national elections at least every 5 years.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 and older. National political parties include the People's United Party (PUP), the
 United Democratic Party (UDP), the National Alliance for Belizean Rights (NABR),
 and the People's Democratic Party (PDP). The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected
 in each party's membership. The Government changed hands (for the third time
 since independence in 1981) in 1993 when a coalition of the UDP and the NABR
 won 16 of 29 seats in the House of Representatives.
 No laws impede participation of women in politics; their scarcity in electoral poli-
 tics can be attributed to tradition and socioeconomic factors. Women hold a number
 of appointive offices, including three of nine Senate seats. One member of the 29-
 seat House of Representatives is a woman, but women in elective office are the ex-
 ception. None hold senior positions higher than membership on the executive com-
 mittees of the political parties.
 There are no laws impeding participation by indigenous people or minority groups
 in politics. There are Garifuna and Hispanic representatives at the national political
 level, but there are no Mayan representatives at that level.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their activities. The Human Rights Com-
 mission of Belize (HRCB), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with re-
 gional human rights organizations and partly funded by the UNHCR, operates free
 of government restriction on a wide range of issues, including refugee and agricul-
 tural workers' rights, cases of alleged police abuse, and cases of alleged illegal de-
 portations of Central American nationals. The HRCB publicizes, and urges police
 and other government bodies to act upon complaints it receives. After a period of
 inactivity in 1996, the HRCB gained new prominence through media reports of its
 grassroots workshops in local villages to educate citizens about human rights.
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and the Government
 cooperates with independent investigations of human rights conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of recently arrived Central American and Asian immigrants, continued to
 be a problem. The Government continues to reserve certain professions for Belizean
 nationals, granting permits and licenses to non-Belizeans only in specific cases.
 These occupations include fishing, souvenir manufacturing, sightseeing tours, ac-
 counting, insurance, real estate, and legal services.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. Women Against
 Violence, an NGO with branches throughout the country, runs a shelter for battered
 women and a hot line for rape victims.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women face social and economic
 prejudices. For example, women find it more difficult than men to obtain business
 and agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed women are con-
 centrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally low status and wages.
 A women's bureau in the Ministry of Labor and Social Services is charged with de-
 veloping programs to improve the status of women. A number of officially registered
 women's groups work closely with various government ministries in promoting so-
 cial awareness pro grams. Women have access to education and are active in all
 spheres of national life, but relatively few are found in top managerial positions.
 While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, female wage
 earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. There are no legal impediments
 to women owning or managing land or other real property.
 
 
 Children.-Education is compulsory for children ages 5 to 14. There is a family
 services division in the Ministry of Human Resources devoted primarily to children s
 issues. The division coordinates programs for children who are victims of domestic
 violence, advocates remedies in specific cases before the family court, conducts pub-
 lic education campaigns, and works with NGO's and the United Nations Children's
 Fund to promote children's welfare. There is also a national committee for families
 and children, chaired by the Minister of Human Resources. There is no societal pat-
 tern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not specifically mandate provision of ac-
 .cessibility for disabled persons nor prohibit job discrimination against them. The
 Government's Disability Services Unit, as well as a number of NGO's such as the
 Belize Association of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center for the
 Visually Impaired, provide assistance tophysically disabled persons. Disabled chil-
 dren have access to government special education facilities.
 Indigenous People.-There are a number of indigenous people loosely grouped
 under the general term Maya. The Maya have sought official recognition of their
 communal claims to land, but the Government has been reluctant to single out one
 ethnic gup for special consideration. The Maya reservations are not demarcated
 on official maps, and the Maya have filed suit to force the Government to accord
 recognition to their reservations. The Mayans have formed cultural councils and
 other groups to advance their interests, sometimes with the collaboration of NGO's
 concerned with environmental and indigenous issues.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Eleven independent unions, with approximately 11 per-
 cent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and pro-
 fessional workers, includng most civil service employees. Several of these unions,
 however, are inactive. The Ministry of Labor recognizes unions after they file with
 the office of registry. The law empowers members to draft the by-laws and constitu-
 tions of their unions, and they are free to elect officers from among the membership
 at large. Unions that choose not to hold elections may act as representatives for
 their membership, but the national Trade Union Congress permits only unions that
 hold free and annual elections of officers to join its ranks. Both law and precedent
 effectively protect unions against dissolution or suspension by administrative au-
 thority.
 The law permits unions to strike, but unions representing essential services may
 strike only after giving 21 days' notice to the ministry concerned.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties (the UDP and the PUP). Unions
 freely exercise the right to form federations and confederations and affiliate with
 international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining and unions freely practice it throughout the country. Employers and
 unions set wages in free negotiations, or, more commonly, employers simply estab-
 lish them. The Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked collective
 bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding coun-
 sel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily ac-
 cepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept the Com-
 missioner's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided that
 it is linked to some provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and-after a union
 is registered. Unions may freely organize, but the law does not require employers
 to recognize a union as a bargaining agent. Some employers have been known to
 block union organization by terminating the employment of key union sympathizers,
 usually on grounds purportedly unrelated to union activities. Effective redress is ex-
 tremely difficult in such situations. Technically, a worker may file a complaint with
 the Labor Department, but in practice it was virtually impossible to prove that a
 termination was due to union activity.
 The Labor Code applies in the country's two export processing zones (EPZ's).
 There are no unions in the EPZ's, however,.reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and laws forbid
 forced, compulsory, or bonded labor, and it is not generally known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Laws pro-
 hibit forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government effectively enforces
 this prohibition. The minimum age for employment is 14 years, or 17 years for em-
 ployment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from the Ministries of Labor and
 
 
 421
 Education enforce this regulation, although in recent years school truancy officers,
 who have historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have been less ac-
 tive. The law requires children between the ages of 5 and 14 to attend school, but
 there are many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is $1.12 (BZ$2.25), except
 in export industries where it is $1.00 (BZ$2.00) per hour. For domestic workers and
 shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed, the rate is $0.87 (BZ$1.75)
 per hour. The minimum wage law does not cover workers paid on a piecework basis.
 The Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing the legal minimum wage, which
 is generally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole source of income
 is inadequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most
 salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 The law sets the normal workweek at no more than 6 days or 45 hours. It re-
 quires payment for overtime work and an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patch-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and the Min-
 istries of Labor and Public Health enforce these regulations to varying degrees. En-
 forcement is not universal, and the ministries commit their limited inspection and
 investigative resources principally to urban and more accessible rural areas where
 labor, health, and safety complaints have been registered. Workers have the legal
 right to remove themselves from a dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
 The exploitation of undocumented Hispanic workers, particularly young service
 workers and possibly some agricultural workers, continued to be a major issue for
 the Government, the HRCB, and other concerned citizens. Banana farm owners are
 slowly moving the housing they provide for their workers away from the fields
 where poisonous pesticides are sprayed. Health clinics in the region report that the
 most frequently treated ailments are pesticide-related skin conditions. Company-
 provided housing often lacks electricity and water.
