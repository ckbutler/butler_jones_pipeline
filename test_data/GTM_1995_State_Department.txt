 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala's 1985 Constitution provides for election by universal suffrage of a
 one-term President and a unicameral Congress. It also mandates an independent ju-
 diciary and a Human Rights Ombudsman (PDH), who is elected by and reports to
 the Congress. On June 5, 1993, Congress elected then Human Rights Ombudsman
 Ramiro de Leon Carpio to finish the presidential term of Jorge Serrano, who had
 been constitutionally deposed from office following his attempt to suspend the legis-
 lature and judiciary. President de Leon's term of office ended in January 1996. On
 November 12, the first round of general elections for president, vice president, con-
 gress, and municipal offices resulted in no presidential candidate receiving an abso-
 lute majority. Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen of the National Advancement Party (PAN) won
 the runoff election held January 7, 1996, and took office January 14. Reflecting a
 greater opening for political activity, 24 parties, including a broad front coalition
 composed of civil sector, human rights, and labor leaders, campaigned in the free
 and fair elections.
 Peace talks between the Government and the leftist insurgent Guatemalan Na-
 tional Revolutionary Unity (URNG) continued. The parties achieved significant
 progress but fell short of their goal of an overall agreement by the end of the year.
 The Government and the URNGinsurgents reached an accordon indigenous rights
 on March 25. Although the overall indigenous agreement will be implemented only
 when a global peace accord has been signed, its human rights provisions took effect
 immediately. A 1994 Government-URNG accord led to the introduction of the U.N.
 Human Rights Verification Mission (MINUGUA) into Guatemala. MINUGUA's ex-
 tensive international presence, its verification of alleged abuses, its detailed periodic
 reporting, and its programs to strengthen civilian institutions serve as deterrents
 to human rights abuses and encourage greater human rights activism by civil soci-
 ety.

 The army and police forces operate with considerable institutional and legal au-
 tonomy, particularly in security and military matters. With President De Leon's
 mid-1994 suspension of enforcement of the Conscription Law, forced recruitment
 and recruitment of minors all but ceased. Officially, the army has 43,000 men, al-
 though outside sources commonly place the current numerical strength of the army
 at substantially less. The Minister of Government oversees the National Police and
 the Treasury Police, which share responsibility for internal security with the army.
 President De Leon replaced the Minister of Government and Director of National
 Police and placed a civilian in the position of Vice Minister of Government, which
 previously  a    en occupied by an army colonel, once again reducing direct mili-
 tary control over the police force.
 An estimated 340,000 men serve in rural civil self-defense committees called Civil
 Defense Patrols (PAC's), some of which conduct counterinsurgency patrols. Although
 the Constitution requires that service be voluntary, MINUGUA, the Human Rights
 Ombudsman's Office (PDH), and the Catholic Archbishop's Human Rights 0fice
 (ODHAG) reported that in some regions certain PAC's were still compell ig mem-
 bers to join or remain in the patrols, in violation of the Constitution, and that some
 PAC's killed members who chose to leave their PAC's. In a major and controversial
 decision, President De Leon decommissioned 33,000 military commissioners effective
 September 15. These were generally local civilian leaders who represented the army
 and served as intermediaries between the army and the civil defense patrol mem-
 bers. Security forces, especially PAC's and civilian military commissioners, commit-
 ted numerous serious human rights violations and generally enjoyed impunity from
 the law.
 The agricultural-based, private sector-oriented economy grew by approximately
 4.9 percent in real terms in 1995, raising per capita income about 1 percent. Coffee,
 sugar, and bananas are the leading exports, with more than half of the work force
 engaged in agricultural labor. Inflation was 8.6 percent. There is a marked disparity
 in income distribution, and poverty is pervasive, particularly in the large indigenous
 community. Approximately 80 percent of Guatemalans live in poverty, with 59 per-
 cent in extreme poverty. Gross national product (GNP) per capita is approximately
 $1,000 per year.
 Guerrillas, as well as leftwing and rightwing extremist groups, committed major
 human rights violations. Guerrilla abuses included death threats, the use of mines
 and explosives in civilian areas, attacks on military bases located near civilian
 areas, forced recruitment of minors, and reprisal attacks against the property of per-
 sons who refused to pay "war taxes."
 PAC's, military commissioners, members of the army, and police committed major
 human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, political kidnapings, phys-
 ical abuse, arbitrary arrest and detention, death threats, and forced recruitment.
 MINUGUA noted some positive developments, including minor improvements in the
 administration of justice, a more aggressive Police Department Office of Professional
 Responsibility, the successful suspension of military conscription, the virtual end of
 forced recruitment, and the decommissioning of military commissioners. Nonethe-
 less, government policy changes and a more aggressive stance by the Minister of
 Government and the Director of National Police have been insufficient to combat the
 impunity commonly ejoyed by fovernment security forces. The judicial system is
 often unable to ensure air tria s. Both legal and societal discrimination against
 women persisted, and violence against women is a problem. Societal abuse of chil-
 dren and discrimination against indigenous people continue.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-Politically motivated killings contin-
 ued with disturbing frequency. Because of the scarcity of law enforcement resources
 and a weak and ineffective administrative and judicial system, as well as wide-
 spread impunity and a lack of political will, the Government, with few exceptions,
 failed to investigate killings fully or to detain and prosecute perpetrators. The secu-
 rity forces (military, PAC s-, military commissioners, and the police) and rightwing
 extremist groups were responsible for political and extrajudicial killings, but with
 a reduced incidence compared to 1994.
 The PDH's office, which generally compiles data based on personal interviews
 with victims and their families, listed 216 cases of possible extrajudicial killings in
 1995, compared with 287 in 1994. Using media reports and interviews with victims
 and their relatives, the ODHAG reported 215 extrajudicial killings for the year,
 compared with 355 in 1994 and 248 in 1993. ODHAG labeled 18 of the extrajudicial
 killings in 1995 as definitely political and 133 as presumed political. For its part,
 
 
 420
 
 MINUGUA listed 103 extrajudicial killings for the period between February 21 and
 August 21. None of these human rights offices broke down the figures according to
 the organization believed responsible, but government security forces, military com-
 missioners, and PAC members committed such offenses.
 President De Leon replaced the Minister of Government and Director of National
 Police and appointed a civilian to the position of Vice Minister of Government,
 which previously had been occupied by an army colonel, reducing direct military
 control over the police force. These changes occurred amidst allegations of corrup-
 tion invclving the Minister and charges of excessive use of force by the police, par-
 ticularly surrounding the deaths and injuries in the August 1994 "La Exacta" farm
 occupation labor protest incident and the November 1994 University of San Carlos
 (USAC) student demonstration (see below).
 PAC members and military commissioners, who often represent the only day-to-
 day central government authority in outlying areas, are feared in many rural com-
 munities. They usually enjoy army backing and de facto immunity from prosecution.
 ODHAG and CERJ, an indigenous human rights organization, reported that the ex-
 ecutive branch failed to carry out arrest warrants against at least 30 military com-
 missioners and PAC members for their involvement in human rights crimes. PAC
 members and military commissioners are rarely convicted for their crimes. No mili-
 tary commissioner or PAC member accuse of committing a human rights related of-
 fense has been sentenced, although at least 14 (3 commissioners and 11 PAC mem-
 bers) were detained and under judicial proceedings at year's end.
 In a major, controversial decision, President-De Leon decommissioned military
 commissioners effective September 15. The 33,000 military commissioners were gen-
 erally local civilian leaders who represented the army and served as intermediaries
 between the army and the civil defense patrol members. Military commissioners
 served as the eyes and ears of the army in remote areas and played a central role
 in forced recruitment prior to the virtual abolition of that practice. Opinions vary
 as to whether the formal abolition of these positions and decommission of the com-
 missioners, although important steps, will make a major difference in practice.
 The National Police attempted to carry out arrest warrants for PAC members
 charged in the 1993 killing of anti-PAC activist Tomas Lares Cipriano, but 30
 armed PAC members forced the policemen to withdraw. The Government failed to
 carry out arrests on warrants issued against three other PAC members on four occa-
 sions between July 1993 and February 1995.
 Nine members of the Colotenango PAC surrendered on charges of responsibility
 for the Autiust 1993 killing of Juan Chanay Pablo, an anti-PAC demonstrator, and
 were imprisoned. Members of this group had allegedly been informed by the mili-
 tary that they would be released on personal bond upon surrender to the authori-
 ties. Of 13 accused in the killing, 8 are in jail, 4 remain at large, and 1 has died
 of natural causes. The National Police acted to protect witnesses and staged a recon-
 struction of the events in July. An active investigation was still underway at year's
 end.
 On January 8, USAC lecturer Abner Esau Avenado Estrada was assassinated by
 unknown individuals in Guatemala City. Avenado had reported receiving threats for
 more than 2 years prior to his death. MINUGUA concluded that the National Police
 were lax in pursuing an investigation of the incident.
 On January 27, another USAC professor, Apolo A. Carranza Vallar, disappeared
 after leaving his office at the Pan-American Health Organization. In May Erwin
 Gonzalez Barrientos, a self-proclaimed military informant, correctly identified the
 location of Carranza's body and charged that the Escuintla military zone com-
 mander was the intellectual author of the kidnaping and murder. In spite of Gon-
 zalez' claims, the Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa police chief is currently under arrest
 for the murder of Carranza.
 The Conference of Evangelical Churches of Guatemala, CIEDEG, charged the
 Public Ministry and the National Police with a careless investigation of the murder
 and mistreatment of several of its members and alleged that the Chimaltenango po-
 lice actively tried to impede it. On June 23, unidentified assailants brutally tortured
 and murdered Pastor Manuel Saquic Vasquez, coordinator of human rights for the
 Kachiquel Presbytery and member of the human rights group Defensoria Maya.
 Local authorities interred Saquic's body on June 26 in an unidentified grave. An-
 other member of the presbytery, Bartolo Solis Sunin, was kidnaped, interrogated,
 beaten, and released. Pastor Saquic had been a witness to the Solis abduction. In
 Augut 1994, Pascual Serch, also a member of the presbytery, was found dead.
 CIEDEG suspects that military commissioner Victor Roman Cutzal is the intellec-
 tual or material author of all three incidents. After the murder of the first judge
 handling the Pascual Serech case, an itinerant judge from the capital closed the
 case in favor of Roman. The case against him was reopened upon appeal to a higher
 
 
 court. In Augst a judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Roman, but he remains
 at large. CIEDEG members have received verbal and written threats, including an
 ultimatum for departure from the country.
 ODHAG and MINUJGUA have accused members of the army and the National Po-
 lice of directing an extrajudicial social cleansing campaign in which they or their
 agents kill minors and adults believed to have ommittec[ ommon crimes. ODHAG
 reports that street gangs, allegedly using police weapons, kidnaped, tortured, and
 fied fatal shots into the heads of thee street children from a rival gang. The Police
 Department's Office of Professional Responsibility is reportedly conducting an inves-
 tigation into these charges.
 On July 15, in the town of Amatitlan, two presidential guard personnel killed
 Conrodo Ramirez Garcia and wounded Candida Aquino Yansi and her son, Feliciano
 RanArez Yansi, according to the Ombudsman's office. Military courts responded rap-
 idly to the allegations, permitting the case against the accused to advance expedi-
 Anarmy "  patrol led by Lieutenant Canlo Antonio Lacan Chaclan killed 11 people
 and wounded at least 30 on October 5. The patrol entered the returned refugee com-
 munity of Aurora 8 de Octubre at the Xaman Ranch, Chisec, Alta Verapaz, for rea-
 sons which have not yet been clearly established. After a tense standoff during
 which the patrol was surrounded by an emotional crowd, the soldiers opened fire
 and withdrew from the village. Soldiers shot an 8-year-old boy in cold blood some
 distance from the scene of the original shootings. President De Leon accepted the
 resignation of Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez shortly after the shooting
 incident. Lieutenant Lacan Chaclan and 25 soldiers have been indicted and re-
 mained in jail awaiting trial at the end of the year.
 On December 5, an unknown gunman killed 9-year-old Magdalena Caal Coc and
 wounded 11-year-old Santiago Quix Caal in a temporary refugee settlement in
 Cantabal, Alta Verapaz. At year's end, active government and U.N. investigations
 were still underway, but the motive and perpetrators remain unknown.
 Captain Hugo Contreras, the Guatemalan army officer sentenced to 20 years in
 p rison after being convicted of ordering the operation that led to the June 1990 mur-
 der of Michael Devine, remains a fugitive following his May 11, 1993 escape from
 military custody. It is widely believed that some military officials facilitated
 Contreras' escape. The six enlisted men, each sentenced to 30 years for the murder
 of Devine, lost their appeal in the Supreme Court in May.
 Public allegations in March that army Colonel Julio Alpirez was involved in the
 Devine killing led Francisco Solbal Sontay-who was convicted in the killing-to de-
 clare that Alpirez and Colonel Mario Garcia Catalan were involved in the murder
 and the subsequent coverup. Solbal alleged publicly that Garcia Catalan ordered the
 Devine murder, and also had other participants in the killing murdered as part of
 the coverup. Solbal was unable to identify for investigators the exact location of the
 graves of the victims to carry out exhumations. Based on these allegations, the Pub-
 lic Ministry launched a new investigation to try to determine the intellectual au-
 thors of the murder and participants in the ensuing coverup, assigning Leopoldo
 Mejia Toc as the special prosecutor. The Fourth Court of Appeals dismissed charges
 against Garcia Catalan in August and denied an appeal by the Public Ministry that
 the investigation of his role in the murder continue.
 There was some progress in certain past high-profile cases. An appellate court
 ruled in April that, due to serious irregularities in the case against the six impris-
 oned defendants charged with the 1993 murder of former presidential candidate
 Jorge Carpio, proceedings had to begin anew. The Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights (IACHR) issued a resolution calling on the Government to take im-
 mediate protective measures to safeguard the survivors of the incident, family mem-
 bers of the victims, and the prosecutor assigned to the case.
 Six persons convicted in the killing of constitutional court president Epaminondas
 Gonzalez Dubon were sentenced to terms ranging from 2 to 12 years on December
 21. The Public Ministry is appealing the sentences as being too light. Although the
 Public Ministry ruled out any motive other than robbery, widespread speculation
 continues that Gonzalez was killed because he had decided to uphold the constitu-
 tionality of an extradition order to the United States for former Lieutenant Colonel
 Carlos Ochoa Ruiz on drug-related charges.
 A videotape filmed at the November 1994 USAC student demonstration showed
 policemen severely beating student Mario Lopez Sanchez after he was injured and
 incapacitated. Lopez later died from his injuries. Judicial proceedings against the
 police came to a halt in February after trial courts requested further investigation
 of the accused police officer. Another court denied a wrongful death lawsuit for 10
 million quetzals (approximately $1,810,000) filed by the Lopez family against the
 Government. The court ruled that the State cannot be held liable for damages and
 
 
 422
 injuries that occur in armed confrontations or civil disturbances. The Lopez family
 baa appealed this ruling.
 Also in February, the former Minister and Vice Minister of Government and the
 National Police chief were charged with issuing the general order to fire at the stu-
 dents in the November 1994 demonstrations. They were permitted to post a bond
 of 15,000 quetzales (approximately $2,630) pending further investigation. On Sep-
 tember 13, Carlos Venancio Escobar, Vice Commander of the Fifth Police Cors, was
 imprisoned in connection with the case. MINUGUA reports that since Lopez death
 there have been incidents of torture, kidnaping, and intimidation directed against
 several persons involved in the case.
 In Augst 1994, the National Police killed three persons while attempting to ar-
 rest workers who had occupied the La Exacta farm during a labor dispute. Since
 then the Ministry of Government has modified its procedures and has promoted im-
 proved discipline and greater restraint in the use of force (e.g., firearms are no
 longer used) in property eviction tactics employed by the authorities. MINUGUA re-
 pors, however, hat Public Ministry officials have neglected to carry out some of the
 basic investigative inquiries into the incident. In October the authorities arrested
 the departmental police chief and charged him with homicide and abuse of authority
 in connection with the La Exacta killings.
 The trial against the alleged intellectual authors of the 1990 killing of anthropolo-
 gist Myrna Mack has been paralyzed for several months in the pretrial investigative
 stage. The alleged intellectual authors have insisted that the convicted material au-
 thor, Noel de Jesus Beteta is innocent and that they cannot be charged as a result.
 In July a court ruled that Mack's sister, Helen, could serve as an additional plaintiff
 in the case. There has been no progress in the related case of detective Jose Luis
 Merida Escobar who was assassinated in 1991 while he was investigating the death
 of Myrna Mack.
 There were some limited developments in the 1985 Blake/Davis case. In February
 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in San Jose agreed to accept the case
 for review. The Government asked PAG members accused of the death to come in
 for questioning but they have not appeared. A key informant in the case reports
 thathe has suffered threats and intimidation.
 In January the Supreme Court overturned sentences and ordered a new trial for
 members of a police and army anticrime task force convicted of the April 1992 death
 of university student Julio Roberto Cu Qium and the injury of six other students.
 The 21 policemen charged originally received 30-year sentences, and the 9 soldiers
 involved received 14-year prison terms. Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, the Con-
 stitutional Court had dismissed two appeals filed by the defendants.
 The IACHR requested in April that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
 take legal action against the Government for having closed legal proceedings in the
 1988 "white van case" without resolving the indemnification issue raised by rel-
 atives of those kidnaped, tortured, and murdered by Treasury Police riding in a
 white van. The Government's investigation into the September 1994 murder of a
 leading witness and survivor of the case and his son is still underway. In June the
 Solicitor General stated that legal proceedings against several policemen remained
 pending
 ODHG reported that the Juarez family fled Guatemala because of repeated acts
 of intimidation and death threats by Coban army intelligence Captain Jose Luis
 Gonzalez Perez. The family accused Gonzalez of commanding a Coban-based "social
 cleansing" execution squad responsible for the 1994 death of their son, Juan Rene
 Juarez Gonzalez. ODHAG and the international community made repeated requests
 to the Defense Ministry'to remove Captain Gonzalez from his position and launch
 an appropriate investigation into these charges. On June 30, Captain Gonzalez was
 transferred as part of the army's normal rotation.
 There was no progress in resolving numerous other past extrajudicial killings, in-
 chuding the 1989 disappearances and murders of university students, the 1990 Hec-
 tor Oqueli Colindres and Gilda Flores killings, the 1990 disappearance of Maria Tin
 Tojin and her daughter, the 1991 disappearance of Diego Domingo Martin, the 1992
 kidnaping, torture, and murder of Huehuetenango peasant Lucas Perez Tadeo, the
 1993 shooting of street children Henry Yubani Alvarez and Francisco Tziac, the
 1993 shooting of student protester Abner Abdiel Hernandez Orellana, or past
 kidnapings and murders of various members of CERJ. The Government's inability
 to deter, prosecute, or punish those responsible for such offenses remains a major
 impediment to human rights progress.
 There was no progress in the investigation of two fatal 1994 police beatings. In
 the first case, police officers severely beat Victor Manuel and Mario Enrique Pineda
 Poron, killing Mario Enrique. The police also severely beat Juan Carlos Ruiz Rami-
 rez and Marco Vinicio Rodriguez. Riz Ramirez subsequently died from his injuries.
 
 
 b. Disappearance.-ODHAG reported 10 forced disappearances in 1995, all be-
 lieved to be politically motivated. The PDH's office received 77 complaints of forced
 disappearance, compared with 60 for 1994. The Government did not identify or pros-
 ecute the perpetrators of any of these disappearances. While motives in these inci-
 dents are difficult to determine, many of the victims were politically active.
 MINUGUA reported that, on March 17, Salvador de La Rosa Juarez left his home
 near Las Tronchos, Escuintla to perform patrol duties with a local military unit and
 later disappeared. Another patroller, later found murdered, warned the victim's wife
 to drp her investigation and told her that her husband was dead. Several days
 later, four young men, including two nephews of de La Rosa, were found dead.
 MINUGUA charged that the local police force conducted no investigation into this
 incident. The military has asserted that these matters do not fall within
 MINUGUA's jurisdiction and has refused to cooperate, in part because of alleged
 military ties to these incidents.
 On March 23, Arnoldo Xi, a community leader in Tixila, Purunha, Baja Verapaz
 and a member of CONIC (an indigenous human rights organization dedicated to
 saving Mayan culture) was reportedly wounded by gunfire and then abducted by
 armed men. He remained missing at year's end.
 The whereabouts of Lorenzo Quiej Pu, a member of CONDEG (an organization
 dedicated to helping Guatemalans who have been internally displaced due to the
 armed conflict), who disappeared in January 1994, remained unknown at year's end.
 Likewise, the disappearances of San Marcos PAC members Margarito Lopez and
 Obdulio Zapeta, army enlisted man Diego Chel Matom, and farmers Ramona Munoz
 and Maritza Gil, who were allegedly kidnaped in 1993 by guerrillas, remained unre-
 solved at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the integrity and security of the person. Nonetheless,
 many bodies were found in various parts of the country bearing signs of severe dis-
 figurement or mutilation. The PDHs office listed 9 potential cases of torture, com-
 pared with 18 in 1994. For the same period, ODHAG listed 5 cases of torture, com-
 pared with 17 cases in 1994 and 18 cases in 1993. Some of these cases were believed
 to be politically motivated.
 There were credible reports of mistreatment by members of the security forces,
 including sexual abuse of minors and adults, and use of excessive force by police
 at the time of arrest. Additional reports indicated that, especially in rural areas the
 army, civil defense patrols, military commissioners, and police all at times used ex-
 cessive force against the civilian population.
 MINUGUA reported that on January 2, USAC student Jorge Ottoniel de Loon Ra-
 mirez was abducted and interrogated violently about the activities of the Association
 of University Students and his alleged ties to slain student Mario Alioto Lopez
 Sanchez and the URNG. Another student was also abducted and seriously injured.
 Government security forces are believed to be involved in both incidents. On July
 26, a different student was briefly detained by armed men, shown a list with the
 names of 17 USAC students andalumni, and told that those named on the list
 would be killed. A number of the students on the list have reportedly stopped at-
 tending classes at the university and fled the capital.
 The PDI-rs office reported that on the evening of January 6, in Salama, Baja
 Verapaz, two Treasury Policemen illegally detained military commissioner Lauro de
 Jesus Gonzalez Ortiz. According to the PDH, the two police officers seized Gonzalez
 because they thought him responsible for an earlier shooting at a Treasury Police
 office. The officers involved allegedly used nightsticks and an electrical shock device
 to apprehend Gonzalez, rendering him unconscious and breaking his leg. The PDH
 has called for disciplinary action against these officers for their extralegal behavior
 and possession of the electrical device. The PDH has also demanded the enforce-
 ment of disciplinary action against the officers' supervisors for allowing such behav-
 ior and omitting facts in their investigation. No action has been taken in response
 to the demands of the PDH.
 Casa Alianza (CA), an organization dedicated to assisting street children, reported
 various instances in which the National Police abused street children. CA also re-
 rted that criminal charges agant the five policemen charged in the March 1994
 n ating of Luis Antonio Roldan Izeppi remain pending because two policemen
 have not testified. One policeman has left the force. Also according to CA, private
 security guards routinely- abuse street children. This type of abuse has led to the
 death of one minor, as did two cases of abuse by National Police and two others
 by unknown persons, for a total of five minors killed by abuse. Two National Police
 officers were released on bail, and one private security guard remains in custody.
 There have been no convictions. Guerrilla forces also occasionally abused the civilian
 population, especially in rural areas. Evidence of torture and severe mistreatment
 
 
 are also prevalent in murders arising from nonpolitical disputes, particularly those
 related to narcotics trafficking.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal safeguards, there were fre-
 quent credible reports of arbitrary arrest incommunicado detention, and failure to
 adhere to prescribed time limits in legal proceedings by the security forces. The
 Constitution requires that a court-issued arrest warrant be presented to a suspect
 prior to arrest unless he is caught in the act of committing a crime. Police may not
 detain a suspect for over 6 hours without bringing the case before a judge. The law
 also provides for bail and access to lawyers. There are 5,400 men and 277 women
 currently in prison. Reliable estimates suggest that about 70 percent have been sen-
 tenced and 30 percent are awaiting sentences. Prisoners are often detained past
 their legal trial or release dates.
 There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary detentions, although most
 accounts agree that the security forces routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus in
 cases of illegal detention. ODHAG has charged that prisoners are sometimes not re-
 leased in a timely fashion after completing their sentences due to the failure ofjus-
 tices of the peace to issue the necessary court order. According to the PDH's oNice,
 on January 6 National Policemen illegally detained Christian Daniel Espana
 Schmidt and Hector Alberto Ziguensa Aguilera and released them only in exchange
 for a sum of money. Police allegedly beat Espana Schmidt while they had him in
 custody. The Office of Professional Responsibility of the National Police concluded
 that the three officers involved in the apprehension had acted improperly. The PDH
 has recommended that the National Police director immediately fire the policemen;
 this has not happened.
 Humberto Miranda Ramos reported to MINUGUA that the local police chief and
 two of his officers had threatened and otherwise intimidated him. Miranda Ramos,
 a judge in San Benito, Peten, had ruled that a large number of arrests made by
 the police chief were illegal and began proceedings against him. Based on state-
 ments to the press by the police chief, MINUGUA believes the threats against Mi-
 randa Ramos are linked to the charges against the police chief. The Supreme Court
 filed a writ of habeas corpus in favor of the justice of the peace and ordered the
 police chief placed under house arrest, an order which, according to MINUGUA, he
 is igoring. Other implicated police officers have been transferred to different parts
 of the country.
 There were numerous reports that policemen illegally detained street children;
 the authorities rarely took action in any of these incidents.
 The Constitution prohibits exile. However, there are many instances of threatened
 individuals fleeing the country out of fear for their lives.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, the judicial system is dysfunctional and often unable to ensure a
 fair trial. International organizations, including MINUGUA, have commented on the
 Government's failure to investigate, prosecute, and punish many suspects, especially
 in cases involving members of the military and public security forces.
 The judiciary is composed of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, appellate
 courts, lower courts, and courts of special jurisdiction (e.g. labor courts). The Con-
 stitution provides that the Congress select Supreme Court and appellate court mag-
 istrates from lists prepared by panels comprised of active magistrates, the Bar Asso-
 ciation, and law school deans.
 Defendants have the right to be present at trials and to legal representation. The
 new Criminal Procedures Code, which came into effect in mid-1994, fundamentally
 alters the administration of criminal justice by strengthening the prosecutorial func-
 tion, establishing a criminal public defenders program, and instituting open adver-
 sarial proceedings at the trial phase. Its key precepts include the presumption of
 innocence of the accused, the right to be present at trial, the right to counsel, and
 the granting of release on bail.
 Because of the difficulty in implementing the new Code, however, the commitment
 to transform a dysfunctional judicial system into an effective one is being seriously
 tested. The legal obligation of the State (through its Public Ministry) to investigate
 crimes, prosecute offenders, and administer punishment has been severely ham-
 pered by the lack of preparation for the changes the Code introduces. The courts'
 response to human rights violations, as well as to general criminal activity, has
 been very slow. Competent authorities frequently do not conduct investigations even
 when they have informal knowledge of the identity of the perpetrators. Political will
 in the Public Ministry to pursue human rights cases vigorously is notably lacking.
 There is apparently no set procedure within the Public Ministry to govern criminal
 investigations and thus to ensure a viable response to criminal activity.
 Coordination between the Public Ministry and the National Police with regard to
 investigations is inadequate. Security forces personnel are reluctant to investigate
 
 
 425
 cases potentially involving colleagues. Police are poorly paid, relatively few in num-
 ber, and lack adequate resources and training. Judges and prosecutors are suscep-
 tible to intimidation and corruption and suffer from low pay, poor working condi-
 tions, and low morale. The Attorney General reportedly stated on September 6 that
 he was investigating corruption charges against several prosecutors. Such factors,
 combined with the lack of political will in the Public Ministry on human rights
 cases, the small number of prosecutors, and the interference of the Supreme Court
 with the lower courts, demonstrate the State's lack of commitment to combat the
 existing pervasive atmosphere of impunity.
 There are, however, signs that the reforms are taking root. Some 97 verbal trials
 had taken place under the new procedures by the end of 1995. Approximately 22
 of these trials resulted in auittals. Criminal elements murdered several of the
 prosecutors and magistrates who were implementing the new Code in apparent rec-
 ognition of the challenge it posed to their illegal activities.
 Members of the judiciary, as well as prosecutors, continued to receive threats, ei-
 ther in an attempt to influence current decisions or as reprisals for past decisions.
 According to the Secretary General of the Supreme Court, numerous judges received
 threats related to their case loads. At least one of the threatened judges has re-
 signed. On April 26, unknown persons broke into an Amatitlan court house, ran-
 sacked judicial records, stole files, and left a painted death threat for Judge Belter
 Mansilla. Two Public Ministry prosecutors were killed under suspicious cir-
 cumstances. One of the slain prosecutors was investigating the November 1994 mur-
 der of Karin Fleischmann, for which Ricardo Ortega del Cid has been charged. Or-
 tega had publicly threatened the previous prosecutor. Nine prosecutors also received
 threats. Officials from MINUGUA, ODHAG, and the PDH's office also received
 threats.
 Rampant corruption continues to impede the proper functioning of the police force,
 and there are credible allegations of some police involvement in narcotics traffick-
 ing. In numerous criminal cases, police were often unwilling to execute arrest war-
 rants.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home, correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, but the authorities regularly disregard these provisions. Elements of the se-
 curity forces continue to monitor private communications. Ministry of Defense offi-
 cials admit that the military monitors communications "when necessary." The 1993
 postal espionage case involving a Serrano administration presidential security staff
 member remains in the pretrial investigative stage. Many human rights workers al-
 leged surveillance of their movements and activities.
 MINUGUA reports that the military has honored the June 1994 presidential
 order to suspend all conscription, including forced recruitment. There have been iso-
 lated cases of minors enlisting voluntarily, in which the offices of MINUGUA and
 the PDH have been able to secure the release of the underaged recruits. The com-
 mander of military zone 22 was suspended in late August, in part because of
 charges of forced recruitment.
 The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, in some re-
 gions, army officers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders pressured men to be-
 come and remain members or extorted a fee from individuals in exchange for per-
 mission to resign. The PDH charged that military commissioners in Hacienda Vieja,
 Chimaltenango forcibly recruited community residents into PAC's. CERJ reports at
 least two instances in the combat-ridden Quiche department in which PAC members
 killed former PAC members or their family members in retaliation for their refusal
 to continue participation in PAC's.
 A minor and two adult PAC members were accused of killing a youth, Pedro
 Saquic, because of his father's refusal to remain in the PAC. Two of the arrest war-
 rants stemming from the case have been served; a third PAC member remains at
 large. San Marcos diocese officials reported that military commissioners threatened
 to fire their workers if they declined further participation in PAC's. There are other
 credible reports that individuals refusing to serve in PAC's suffered threats and
 other abuses.
 On March 3, a human rights group of El Eden, Quiche, invited the town mayor,
 the commander of military zone 22, the deputy ombudsman, and MINUGUA, as
 well as several organizations in the capital city, and local residents, to draw up a
 document certifying that eight individuals, four of them members of the human
 rights group, no longer wished to be a part of the PAC. According to the PDH office,
 the mayor, charged by law to hold the meeting, deliberately avoided calling it and
 had to be escorted to the session by ombudsman officials. A dozen armed military
 personnel from the Cari military base, including three officers, were at the meeting
 
 
 table. During the meeting, PAC supporters intimidated and harassed those who
 wanted to withdraw from the PAC, forcing the unresolved adjournment of the ses-
 sion. At year's end, there had been no reported reprisals against those who declined
 to patrol in El Eden.
 The PDI-'s office reported that soldiers surveilled Gustavo Adolfo Albizures
 Pedroza, an investigator for FAMDEGUA (a human rights organization dedicated
 to issues regarding individuals who disappeared and their families), when he was
 researching names of disappeared persons in old newspapers at the National Peri-
 odical Archive. The Defense Ministry has admitted that soldiers were present at the
 library when Albizures was carrying out his research but denies that they were
 surveilling him, even though pictures were taken of this surveillance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Guatemala's armed internal conflict entered its 35th year as both govern-
 ment and guerrilla forces continued to commit major human rights violations.
 Communities of People in Resistance (CPR), groups of displaced persons who have
 lived in remote areas to avoid army control and armed action since the 1980's, al-
 leged that the army continued to harass them throughout the year. While army ac-
 tivity continued in the highlands, security improved in the valleys, so that in 1994
 a number of CPR's descended from the mountains and established permanent vil-
 lages. During 1995 no CPR's descended to establish villages; by year's end there
 were very few CPR's left in the remote highlands.
 According to data compiled by MINUGUA, ODHAG, and the PDH's office, early
 in the year the URNG attacked civilian infrastructure targets, including electrical
 and communications facilities; collected war taxes; burned farms; and caused civil-
 ian injuries through the use of mines. After signing the March 24 accord with
 MTNUGUA, the URNG ceased its attacks on electrical towers and grids. However
 URNG gunfire attack on an army base at Alotenango struck civilian houses and
 killed various farm animals. The army often refrained from returning fire during
 attacks on its bases near civilian areas to avoid possible civilian casualties.
 MINUGUA has verified the accuracy of complaints of ranch owners against the
 URNG's practice of collecting war taxes. In one fairly representative case, a group
 entered a ranch in Quetzaltenango department and delivered a letter requesting a
 war tax, with the amount based on the amount of land on the farm. The guerrillas
 took an inventory of the farm, left instructions on how the money should be paid
 and took two Polaroid photoraphs of the farm administrator. They also questioned
 the workers as to whether they were being paid the legal minimum wage and at-
 tempted to interest a number of 14- to 16-year-old boys in joining their movement.
 Finally, they stated that although the tax was "voluntary  refusing to pay would
 be an indication that the farm's owners were not interested in maintaining good re-
 lations with the URNG.
 On March 29, guerrillas killed civilian Ofelia de La Cruz Garcia and wounded a
 soldier in a grenade attack on the military detachment in the Raxhua township in
 Chisec. Although the URNG denied responsibility for the civilian death, MINUGUA
 concluded that the attackers could have detected De La Cruz' presence.
 According to an army press release, two children seriously injured themselves
 after accidentally detonating a URNG-placed antipersonnel mine on March 24 on
 the banks of the Cuyumpa River in Huehuetenango. One of the victims also lost a
 hand. In another typical case, on July 19, an antitank mine killed one child and
 injured two others in Canton Chiguesha, Quiche. In response to MINUGUA queries
 about other incidents of civilian injuries caused by mine warfare, URNG leaders re-
 plied that their fighters accidentally overlooked these mines.
 During the period before the elections, guerrilla groups assembled captive audi-
 ences to listen to their political pronouncements. Armed guerrilla units occupied
 various towns for several hours to disseminate propaganda. Local military zone com-
 manders did not resist these incursions, and there were no confrontations or casual-
 ties. On March 25, four radio stations in the capital reported that guerrillas forced
 them to play URNG propaganda tapes.
 Terrrist bombings con noted by unknown perpetrators continued throughout the
 year. At least 11 explosive devices were detonated or deactivated in Guatemala City
 and another 5 throughout the country. Several of these devices were accompanied
 by URNG leaflets. Other bomb attacks were believed to be orchestrated by rightist
 groups opposed to the peace negotiations.
 On April 4, a bomb exploded several blocks away from the presidential palace
 while the President met with visiting U.N. Secretary General Boutrs Boutros
 Ghali. The explosion killed a USAC professor and injured his student assistant. The
 army claimed that the professor had ties to the URNG and had planned to disrupt
 the presidential meeting. In June two rocket propelled grenades exploded in the gar-
 den of retired general, deposed former president, and Guatemala Republican Front
 
 
 427
 (FRG) political party presidential aspirant Efrain Rios Montt. On several occasions,
 death threat lists with the names ofhuman rights and labor leaders and newspaper
 journalists circulated, but no one listed was injured or killed.
 MINUGUA verified that the army followed correct legal procedures in turning
 over to authorities captured guerrilla leader Timeto R. Navarijo Chutan. However
 MINUGUA reports that when guerrilla Emilio Paau Caal voluntarily surrendered
 at Las Pozas, Peten, the military detained him for 5 days, contrary to the law. A
 forensic report and MINUGUA confirm that Paau's body displayed cigarette burns
 attributed to torture by his captors during his time in army detention. In a letter
 to government authorities, MINUGUA called their attention to the army's illegal de-
 tention of Paau and the conduct of the judge and prosecutor, who never investigated
 the date Paau was handed over to the judicial authorities or the army's treatment
 of him.
 The URNG claima it holds no prisoners, and there were no reports of any captives
 in their custody at year's end.
 American lawyer Jennifer Harbury continued to search for the remains of her
 husband, guerrilla leader Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, who disappeared following a
 March 1992 clash between army and URNG forces. The military contends that
 Bamaca died in the battle, but reliable information indicates that the army captured
 Bamaca and held him for some indeterminate period, interrogating and ultimately
 killing him. Several legal developments in ongoing court cases related to Bamaca s
 diappearanc failed to shed aditional light on his at.
 The judge conducting proceedings in the slander charges brought by the Solicitor
 General against Harbury, in response to her public statements that she would file
 suit against the military if Eamaca did not reapear, held a final hearing on January
 12 and dismissed the case on January 27. In March there were new public allega-
 tions inking Colonel Juio Alpirez to Bac's death. Alpirez' involvement had pre-
 viously been alleged in Santiago Cabrera's testimony in Febrary 1992. On May 6,
 the Prosecutor General removed special prosecutor Leonel Machuca from the
 Bamaca case and replaced him with a new special prosecutor, Dr. Julio Arango.
 Arango tolerated death threats but resigned from the case on August 4, more from
 frustration at the Public Ministry's lack of political will to pursue the case than
 from fear. The Bamaca case was subsequently assigned to Retalhuleu District Pros-
 ecutor Silvia Jerez de Herrera.
 On May 22, a former army intelligence member Nery Angel Urizar stated that
 he had seen Bamaca alive after his capture and that another former URNG member
 and army collaborator had been killed and placed in Bamaca's grave. This was the
 first time that a former member of the military had publicly stated that the army
 had captured Bamaca alive. Also in May, the Public Ministry, acting on a rumor
 that Bamaca's remains were buried at the Cabanas military detachment in the De-
 partment of San Marcos, requested a judicial order to carry out an exhumation of
 that site. Although the order was legitimate, lawyers for the military obtained coun-
 termanding court orders to block two separate attempts to initiate the exhumation.
 MINUGUA is assisting the Public Ministry in its investigation as part of its support
 for due process. The case remained under investigation at year's end.
 On March 27, a guerrilla unit fired shots at a MINUGUA military officer in the
 Ixcan region as he descended from his vehicle to observe a banner posted by the
 guerrillas. The officer, wearing his blue U.N. beret, attempted to establish voice con-
 tact after the first round of fire. However, he was met by a second hail of bullets
 which hit his clearly marked MINUGUA vehicle and forced him to retreat.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. In addition to regular and open criticism of government policies, the media
 publicizes communiques from the URNG, leftist groups, and others opposed to the
 Government or its policies. Journalists admit, however, that in some particularly
 sensitive cases pressure and fears of reprisal result in self-censorship and limits on
 investigative reporting. For example, they rarely criticize the military or military of-
 ficers, or discuss topics which could be perceived to affect the interests of powerful
 economic groups and individuals. There are credible reports that hard-line elements
 of the military and their civilian supporters sponsored negative media campaigns
 directed at human rights activists and diplomatic officials for their support for
 human rights. Reports on human rights and narcotics trafficking are carefully writ-
 ten and sourced so that neither journalists nor their institutions are put at risk.
 Radio and television station owners observe that licensing procedures give the Gov-
 ernment powerful leverage over their editorial policies, but they have not cited any
 instances in which the De Leon Government attempted to abuse this power.
 
 
 428
 Continuing acts of political violence directed against journalists give credence to
 their complaints of pressure and coercion at the working level. ODHAG recorded 12
 separate political acts against the media: one extrajudicial killing, one attempted
 killing, nine acts of intimidation, and one case of torture. On July 20, shots were
 fired at the home of journalist Melida Rubio, who had previously commented on as-
 pects of the peace process. On July 24, four armed individuals attacked the Radio
 Solar station in Jutiapa, destroying some of the equipment and stealing the rest.
 On September 3, unknown intruders broke into the office of the CERIGUA press
 agency and stole a computer containing the agency's data base and list of subscrib-
 ers but did not take other valuable equipment and cash. MINUGUA denounced this
 incident as an attempt at intimidation and a violation of freedom of expression. Po-
 lice investigated but made no arrests.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. Peaceful demonstrations were common and demonstrators some-
 times occupied government institutions, including the presidential palace, a public
 bank, government ministries, and the supreme court building. In most of these
 cases, the police acted with restraint, and the authorities negotiated a peaceful de-
 parture of demonstrators. The Government did not interfere with political associa-
 tions, although the law requires organizations to obtain legal status, a cumbersome
 and expensive procedure.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 authorities respect it in practice. However, religious personnel are sometimes
 threatened andkilled by personal and political enemies for their activism in human
 rights, indigenous rights, land reform, and related fields. On April 27, ODHAG de-
 nounced intimidation and harassment directed at Guatemala City parish priest Fa-
 ther Luis Perez Bamaca, including repeated firing at his residence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict foreign travel, nor does it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. The authorities did not restrict movement inside the
 country except in some areas of conflict, where the army and PAC's limited travel.
 PAC leader and land speculator Raul Martinez of Kaibil Balam, Quiche, led ef-
 forts to oppose a scheduled return of several hundred former refugees to nearby San
 Antonio Tzeja. In late June, Martinez and his followers held hostage two MINUGUA
 officials, an official from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), a volunteer nurse, and a minister for 1 day in an attempt to have an
 arrest warrant against him withdrawn. Despite the earlier arrest warrant (based on
 a complaint bywUNHCR concerning threats by Martinez) and the hostage-taking,
 Martinez continued to live and work openly in his village with no interference from
 the authorities.
 Guerrillas continued to establish roadblocks to rob private citizens, extort protec-
 tion payments from businessmen, attack and drain petroleum trucks, and hinder
 travel in certain rural areas.
 Voluntary repatriation of refugees from Mexico continued. According to the
 UNHCR, 9,500 refugees returned to Guatemala in 1995, bringing the total to over
 16,000 since initiation of the program in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government by peaceful and democratic
 means, through secret ballot and universal suffrage for those 18 years and older.
 Members of the armed forces and police may not vote. Since the return to democracy
 and civilian rule in 1985, there have been seven free elections. International observ-
 ers concluded that the general elections for President, Vice President, Congress, and
 municipal offices held on November 12, were free and fair. Since none of the can-
 didates for President received an absolute majority, a runoff election was held Janu-
 ary 7, 1996, between Alvaro Arzu of the National Advancement Party (PAN) and
 Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemala Republican Front (FRG). Arzu won a close elec-
 tion, gaining 51.2 percent of the vote to Portillo's 48.8 percent, and took office Janu-
 ary 14, 1996.
 Reflecting a greater opening for political activity, 24 parties campaigned, includ-
 ing a broad-front coalition composed of civil sector, human rights, and labor leaders.
 The parties put forward 19 presidential candidates and thousands of candidates for
 congressional deputy and mayor. The election also was characterized by a greater
 participation by grassroots organizations and the left, incorporated into a newl
 formedcoalition  arty called the New Guatemalan Democratic Front (FDNG). A-
 though the URNG did not participate directly, in a radical departure from previous
 policy, it did call for voter participation in the election and agreed to a unilateral
 
 
 429
 cease-fire for the last 2 weeks of the first election period in return for political par-
 ties' commitment to abide by those peace accords previously agreed to by the Gov-
 ernment and the URNG. Other organizations including the Mutual Support Group,
 the Confederation of Guatemalan Widows (CONAVIGUA), the Rigoberta Menchu
 Foundation, and various unions also droppd their longstanding call for abstention.
 Representatives of the Assembly of Civi1 Sectors joined the ?eftist FDNG, which
 named several prominent community leaders as candidates for national deputy. In
 the end, the coalition picked up almost 8 percent of the vote and elected six depu-
 ties.
 Since the return to democratic government in 1985, Guatemala has had generally
 free and fair elections, according to international observers. There is, nevertheless,
 a tradition of political violence which accompanies elections, and voter turnout has
 been weak, reaching a low point of 15 percent in the 1994 referendum and 18 per-
 cent later the same year in the congressional election. Despite a widely publicized
 "gentlemen's agreement" in July signed by the Government and the leaders of the
 political parties there were several acts of violence, including assaults and murders
 eleved related to the campaign. Following the nationwide campaign by various
 groups to increase voter registration, more than 100,000 new voters registered, an
 increase of 5 percent over the nearly 3.5 million registered in 1994. Despite this in-
 crease, participation in the 1995 general elections was modest at 46 percent. Lack
 of transportation to polling places and voter apathy caused by lack of faith in the
 political party system both contributed to the poor turnout.
 There are no legal impediments to women a participation in politics, but women
 are underrepresented in the political arena. Nevertheless, women do hold some
 prominent political positions, including two cabinet posts. In the November elec-
 tions, 11 women were elected to the 80-member Congress. Two women also serve
 as Supreme Court justices and one as a Constitutional Court justice.
 Indigenous people enjoy equal rights under the Constitution. Some have attained
 high positions as army officers (including one general), judges, and government offi-
 cils, including a cabinet member and eight members of Congress. Ithe November
 elections, 40 indigenous candidates won mayoral positions (out of 300 municipali-
 ties), including the mayor of Quezaltenango the second largest city. Nonetheless,
 they are still underrepresented in politics due to limited educational opportunity
 and pervasive discrimination (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits local human rights groups to operate freely. However,
 as noted by MINUGUA, a pervasive attitude continued among rightwing elements
 of the army, military commissioners, and civil defense patrol members that human
 rights activists were really subversives tied to the URNG. The De Leon administra-
 tion, through its presidential human rights commission director, repeatedly threat-
 ened to expel foreign human rights activists, who the administration believes have
 violated the law through alleged participation in the takeover of public and private
 property. Although the directorate has never carried out this threat, this atmos-
 phere has caused some human rights activists and institutions to be targeted for
 unwarranted criticism, surveillance, and physical abuse.
 The Government-URNG accord led to the November 1994 introduction of
 MINUGUA into Guatemala. The U.N. Human Rights Verification Mission
 (MINUGUA) became fully staffed in 1995 and now numbers 305 personnel, with 8
 regional and 5 subregional offices. MINUGUA's extensive international presence, its
 verification of alleged abuses, its detailed periodic reporting, and its programs to
 strengthen civilian institutions serve as a deterrent to human rights abuses.
 MINUGUA's three comprehensive reports during 1995 documented both the Govern-
 ment's and the URNG's successes and failures in implementing the terms of the
 human rights agreement.
 In May CONAVIGUA director Rosalina Tuyuc denounced to Public Ministry offi-
 cials continued acts of intimidation by soldiers, military commissioners, and PAC
 members against CONAVIGUA members and reiterated a call for an end to the im-
 unity enjoyed by security forces for human rights related crimes. On April 9, a
 PAC member disabled CONAVIGUA member Maria de Leon Santiago by hitting her
 in the head with a stone and then proceeded to beat her as she lay on the ground
 bleeding. The PAC member in question had previously threatened Santiago accus-
 ing her of being a guerrilla. MINUGUA reported that the Public Ministry Las not
 carried out an investigation nor has the justice of the peace ordered the assailant's
 arrest
 On July 3, soldiers clubbed U.S. citizen Daniel Robert "Sky" Callahan on the knee
 with a rifle butt while he was filming a protest by peasants in a main Guatemala
 
 
 430
 City plaza. Four days later, on July 7, unidentified assailants abducted and severely
 beat Callahan and berated him for his filmmaking. Authorities promised a full in-
 vestigation, and the Ministry of Defense paid for Callahan's return trip to facilitate
 an investigation into the attack. At year's end, the investigation remained open but
 no suspects had been identified.
 Relations between the PDH's office and the executive branch were strained.
 MINUGUA reported that some security force agents intimidated and refused to co-
 operate with Ombudsman officials. High-ranking officials working in the fields of
 human rights and jurisprudence complained publicly and privately of receiving
 threats stemming from their interest in resolving cases related to human rights vio-
 lations, official corruption, and drug trafficking. On November 11, unidentified gun-
 men fired an automatic weapon at MINUGUAs Guatemala City regional office. Al-
 though identity of those responsible and the nature of the motive remain unknown,
 there is widespread belief that the shooting was intended as an act of political in-
 timidation. Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia also complained in August
 that the executive was neither funding his office adequately nor implementing his
 recommendations on human rights.
 Both the PDH's office and ODHAG continued to enjoy widespread public support
 and respect. Senior government officials also met numerous foreign officials and
 human rights monitors. After a persistent 14-year effort, Peace Brigades Inter-
 national, an international human rights organization which accompanies persons
 whose lives may be in danger for their political beliefs or activities, obtained govern-
 ment recognition. The absence of legal status did not prevent other human rights
 organizations from operating openly.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and
 rights and that the State must protect the life, liberty, justice, security, peace, and
 development of all Guatemalans. As the violations described throughout this report
 reveal, the Government is frequently unable or unwilling to enforce these provi-
 sions.
 Women.--CONAVIGUA and the PDH reported that violence against women, in-
 cluding domestic violence, remains common among all social classes. There is no
 specific law against domestic violence, although it is considered to fall under other
 statutes. Victims rarely report criminal sexual violence and relatively few rape
 cases go to court. The PDH reported complaints of spousa abuse committed by hus-
 bands have risen from 30 to 120 complaints per month due to increased nationwide
 educational programs, which have encouraged women to seek assistance. There are
 family courts, and judges may issue an ijunction against an abusive spouse or com-
 panion, which police are charged with enforcing. There is also a Women's Rights De-
 partment of the PDH, and various nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) provide
 medical and legal assistance and information on family planning.
 The Constitution asserts the principle of equality between the sexes. Nonetheless,
 women face job discrimination and on average receive significantly lower pay than
 men. They are primarily employed in low-wage jobs in the textile industry, agri-
 culture, retail businesses, and the public sector. More working women than men are
 employed in the informal sector of the economy, where pay and benefits are gen-
 erally lower. A 1989 survey reported that in Guatemala City women are
 underrepresented in high-income categories and overrepresented among poorly paid
 workers. Women may own, manage, and inherit property on an equal basis with
 men. In some cases, domestic laws remain discriminatory against women, such as
 the Penal Code's provisions on adultery. Only women may be charged with adultery,
 while men fall under a different statute which is more limited, difficult to prove,
 and carries a lesser penalty.
 Children.-The Constitution charges the Government with protecting the physical
 and mental health, as well as the moral well-being, of minors. These provisions not-
 withstanding, the Government consistently fails to devote sufficient resources to en-
 sure adequate educational and health services for children. The abuse of street chil-
 dren (see Section 1.c.) is a serious problem in major cities. Estimated numbers of
 street children range between 1,500 and 5,000, with the majority of these youths
 concentrated in Guatemala City. Corrupt police and military personnel or other
 criminal elements often recruit these children into thievery or prostitution rings.
 The Government and a number of NGO's operate youth centers, but the funds de-
 voted to them are not sufficient to adequately address the problem.
 In May the Presidential Human Rights Commission resumed weekly meetings of
 the Permanent Commission for Children, composed of representatives from Casa
 Alianza and from the judicial and executive branches, with the aim of addressing
 
 
 431
 the problems of street children. Relations between Casa Alianza and the National
 Police have ofen been strained.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the State should protect
 disabled persons. Nonetheless, physically disabled persons are discriminated against
 in employment practices, and few resources are devoted to combat this problem or
 otherwise to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation mandating provi-
 sion of accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution states that Guatemala is composed of di-
 verse ethnic groups and obliges the Government to recognize, respect, and promote
 the lifestyles, customs, traditions, forms of social organization, and manner of dress
 of indigenous people. Indigenous people comprise about one-half the population but
 remain largely outside of the countrs political, economic, social, and cultural main-
 stream. Indigenous pope suffered most of the serious human rights abuses de-
 scribed throughout tis report. Conscription, suspended by President De Leon, pri-
 marily targeted indigenous men in rural areas. Although the Constitution accords
 indigenous people equal rights, in practice, they have only minimal participation in
 decisions aecing teir lands, culture, traditions, and allocation of natural re-
 sources.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunities and thus have
 fewer employment opportunities. Many indigenous people are illiterate and do not
 speak Spanish. Linguistic barriers hinder interaction with the Government and
 limit access to public services, including the judiciary, since few officials speak any
 of the 21 indigenous languages. Indigenous persons arrested for crimes are often at
 a disadvantage due to their limited comprehension of Spanish. The new Criminal
 Procedures Code, which took effect in July 1994, states that, beginning in July 1996,
 the courts must provide interpretation to anyone requiring such services during
 criminal proceedings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide work-
 ers complete freedom of association and the right to form and join trade unions. The
 Government does not control unions. Major reforms to the Labor Code in 1992 man-
 dated concrete steps to improve worker rights by facilitating freedom of association,
 strengthening the rights of working women, increasing penalties for violations of
 laberlaws, and enhancing the role of the Labor Ministy and labor courts in enforc-
 ing them. All workers have the right to form or join unions, including public sector
 employees, with the exception of members of security forces. National Police officers
 have formed two ad hoc associations to discuss working conditions with the chief
 of police, and are in the process of forming a union.
 Approximately 8 percent of the work force, or 240,000 out of 3 million workers,
 are members oflabr organizations. The 993 registered unions in the country are
 independent of the Government and political party domination. Labor Code amend-
 ments simplified the process for unions to obtain legal status. The Minister of Labor
 further revised the admnistrative process, reducing the number of stps within the
 Ministry for consideration of union applications and establishing strict timetables.
 The Minister warned officials that noncompliance with the timetable could lead to
 dismissal of those responsible for the delay. These new regulations accelerated the
 approval procedure, and the backlog of union applications was largely eliminated.
 The Labor Ministry granted legal status to 95 unions in 1995. Of the registered
 unions, 834 ar in the private sector, and 159 are in the public sector. The Labor
 Ministry initiated a program to assist unions with their applications to avoid some
 of the pitfalls still  erent in the Labor Code.
 Workers have the right to strike, but Labor Code procedures make legal strikes
 cumbersome. Labor organizers criticize the requirement that two-thirds o the work-
 ers must approve a vote to strike, the prohibition of strikes by agricultural workers
 at harvest time, and the right of the Government to prohibit strikes which it consid-
 ers seriously harmful to the national economy. A strike by employees of La Aurora
 Zoo in April was the first legally authorized strike in 25 years. Those strikes that
 do occur, frequently in the public sector, are almost always called without legal au-
 thorization, and in practice the Government makes no effort to intervene on the
 basis of a strike's illegality. Nonetheless, the lack of legal approval for a strike can
 be used as a threat against strikers. Workers can be suspended or fired for failing
 to show up for work if a strike has not been legally approved.
 The law protects workers from retribution or formi ng and participting in trade
 union activities, but enforcement of these provisions varies. While an increasing
 number of employers accept unionization, many routinely seek to circumvent Labor
 Code provisions in order to resist union activities, which many view as historically
 confrontational and disruptive. An ineffective legal system and the inadequate level
 
 
 of penalties for violations have hindered enforcement of the right to form unions and
 participate in trade union activities. While penalties were increased in the 1992
 Labor Code reform, the previous Supreme Court (replaced in October 1994) delayed
 full implementation of the reforms.
 Trade union leaders and members continued to suffer instances of violence and
 abuse, including threats, assassination attempts, kidnapings, and physical harm.
 ODHAG reported that unknown assailants killed 2 unionists, injured 5, and threat-
 ened 19, although it was not always clear whether such violence was union related.
 Public sector union leaders, as well as unionists in the high-profile in-bond export
 sector, reported receiving threats against themselves and their families. Felix Her-
 nandez, Secretary General of FENASEP, a confederation of public employees
 unions, went into hiding for several weeks after threats were made on his life. He
 had exposed alleged corruption by the Ministry of Government in the purchase of
 police patrol cars. Flor de Maria Salguera, a maquila union organizer, was abducted
 from a bus and assaulted on May 17, and Olimpia Lara, the daughter of Health
 Workers' Union officer Luis Lara, was severely beaten on September 7. During a
 strike by his union, Ivo Garcia, secretary of the electrical workers' union, was kid-
 naped from his house on September 12 and held for 18 hours. The authorities began
 investigations of these cases, but none had been resolved at year's end.
 Unions may and do form federations and confederations and join international or-
 ganizations.
 An active "solidarity" movement claims approximately 250,000 members in over
 475 companies. Unions may legally continue to operate in workplaces which have
 solidarity associations, and workers have the right to choose between the two or be-
 long to both. The Government views these associations as civic organizations which
 need not interfere with the functioning of trade unions. The amended Labor Code
 stipulates very clearly that trade unions have the exclusive right to bargain collec-
 tively over work conditions on behalf of workers. Unionists charge, however, that
 management promotes solidarity associations to avoid the formation of trade unions
 or to rival existing labor unions. There are credible reports that some of these asso-
 ciations did not always adhere to democratic principles in their formation and man-
 agement and that workers are unable to participate fully and freely in decisionmak-
 ing. Similar credible charges are made against some trade union organizations. At
 the request of trade union leaders, the independent PDH, through its Office for Eco-
 nomic and Social Issues, receives complaints related to trade union activities. Union
 leaders and workers filed a number of complaints with the PDH during the year,
 and the Ombudsman has spoken out in public statements about labor conditions in
 varying sectors of the economy. The PDHcan investigate their complaints and issue
 a statement. The office has no enforcement powers ut can attempt to ameliorate
 the situation through publicity and moral suasion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. However, the practice of collective bargaining is lim-
 ited by the weak structure of the union movement, the requirement that 25 percent
 of the workers in a factory or business must be union members in order for collec-
 tive bargaining to take place, the lack of experience with this practice, and the pref-
 erence of management in many cases to avoid formal ties with trade unions. While
 both management and the unions honored some well-written collective contracts, in
 other instances both parties openly ignored and violated contracts. Most workers,
 even those organized by trade unions, do not have collective contracts to cover their
 wages and working conditions but do have individual contracts as required by law.
 Most workers receive the minimum wages established by bipartite commissions,
 which operate under the guidance of the Ministry of Labor.
 Employers cannot dismiss workers for participating in the formation of a trade
 union; workers file complaints in this regard with the labor inspectors for resolution.
 The Labor Code provides for the right of employers to fire union workers for cause,
 permits workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts, and requires the rein-
 statement of any union worker fired without cause. The revised Code prohibits em-
 ployers from firing workers for union organizing and protects them for 60 days fol-
 lowing the official publication of approval of the union. It also prohibits employers
 from firing any member of the executive committee of a union and protects them
 for an additional 12 months after they are no longer on the executive committee.
 An employer may fire a member of the union's executive committee for cause only
 after a trial and issuance of a court resolution.
 Labor courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued to be generally ineffec-
 tive. Although two new labor courts began to function, efforts to restructure and
 modernize the labor court system mhade little headway. A heavy backlog of labor
 cases continues to clog the courts due to corruption, inefficiency, and lack of re-
 sources. There is only spotty enforcement of the Labor Code, due to the scarcity of
 
 
 433
 labor inspectors, corruption, the lack of adequate training and resources, and struc-
 tural weaknesses (or the lack of political will) in the labor court system. Nonethe-
 less enforcement is improving as new labor inspectors complete training and begin
 work outside the capital, allowing the Ministry of Labor to increase significantly its
 rate of inspections. The Ministry conducted a series of inspections at farms and
 plantations in rural areas, especially in Alta and Baja Verapaz, and cited those em-
 ployers who were not paying the minimum wage. The number of ranches in these
 regions paying below minimum wage dropped from 42.6 percent of the total number
 inspected to 13.9 percent after the completion of the program The Ministry of Labor
 also reorganized the Labor Inspector Corps to permit some complaints to be heard
 at the Ministry of Labor rather than requiring that inspectors travel to each work
 site. The Ministry has also increased the number of court cases filed for failure to
 comply with the Labor Code and has begun an educational campaign on worker
 rights (especially the rights of minors and women workers), including providing
 some documents in indigenous languages.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout the country, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones (EPZ's). The laws governing EPZ's are not discriminatory on
 the subject of organizing trade unions or collective bargaining. While union leaders
 often blame employer pressures and unofficially restricted access to the EPZ's for
 their virtual inability to organize workers in these zones, labor conditions in the
 EPZ's are no different from those found outside the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced or
 compulsory labor, and the practice does not exist. However, human rights and indig-
 enous groups continue to charge that there is coerced participation in the PACs,
 and that this coercion violates prohibitions against forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution bars employment
 of minors under the age of 14 without written permission from the Ministry of
 Labor. However, children below this age are regularly employed. The laws prohibits
 minors from night work, extra hours (the legal workday for minors under age 14
 is 6 hours; for minors age 14 to 17, it is 7 hours), and from working in establish-
 ments where alcoholic beverages are served or in unhealthy or dangerous condi-
 tions. Laws governing the employment of minors are not effectively enforced, due
 to the shortage of qualified labor inspectors and structural weaknesses in the labor
 court system. While only 5,000 minors have permission from the Labor Ministry to
 work legally, thousands working without legal permission are open to exploitation,
 generally receiving no social benefits, no social insurance, no vacations, no sever-
 ance pay, and below minimum salaries.
 The Labor Ministry has a program to educate minors, their parents, and employ-
 ers on the rights of minors in the labor market. Economic necessity, however, forces
 most families to have their children seek some type of employment to supplement
 the family income. There are no export industries in which child labor is a signifi-
 cant factor. Child labor is largely confined to small or family enterprises, to agricul-
 tural work, and to the informal sectors of the economy.
 The Constitution provides for compulsory education for all children up to the age
 of 12 or to the sixth grade. However, less than half the population actually receives
 a primary education. Children in rural and indigenous areas are less likely to com-
 plete primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although the law sets minimum wages, the le-
 gally mandated minimum wage for most unskilled and semiskilled workers is not
 always paid. A bilateral committee representing labor and management in specific
 economic sectors is named each year to make recommendations for increases in the
 minimum wage. In the event that agreement is not possible, the Government may
 decree such increases. The minimum wage was raised by 10 percent in December,
 effective January 2, 1996. The new rate is $2.93 (17.60 quetzales) for industrial
 workers for an 8-hour workday, including a required hourly bonus and $2.66 (15.95
 quetzales) per day plus mandatory productivity bonuses for agricultural workers.
 The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide even a minimum standard of living
 for a worker and family. An estimated 80 percent of the population lives below the
 poverty line, including approximately 60 percent of those employed.
 The legal workday is 8 hours, and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 much longer hours remains in place due to economic conditions. The amended Labor
 Code requires a weekly paid rest period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders
 and human rights groups charge tat workers are sometimes forced to work over-
 time, often without premium pay, in order to meet work reqirements. Labor inspec-
 tors report that numerous instances were uncovered of suchabuses, but corruption
 and inefficiencies in the labor court system inhibit adequate enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the Labor Law, enforcement of standards that do exist is also inadequate. Work-
 
 
 ers have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations,
 and the law provides them with protection for their continued employment. How-
 ever, few wokers are willing to jeopardize their jobs by complaining about unsafe
 working conditions. When serious or fatal industrial accidents do occur the authori-
 ties generally take no legal steps against those responsible. The Labor Ministry pro-
 vides training courses for labor inspectors in health and safety standards but does
 not accord them a high priority due to scarce resources. The Government does not
 effectively enforce legislation requiring companies with more than 50 employees to
 provide on-site medical facilities for their workers, although most large employers
 do provide such facilities.
