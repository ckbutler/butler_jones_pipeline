 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain has been ruled since the late 18th Century by the
 Al-Khalifa family, which is predominant throughout the society
 and government. The head of state is chosen by the family from
 among its own members and is referred to as the Amir (Prince).
 A crossroads and trading center in the Persian Gulf since
 pre-historic times, Bahrain is a small island state which has
 in recent years assumed regional significance as a
 cosmopolitan, service-oriented financial and trading center for
 the Gulf.
 Bahrain, in 1931, was the first state on the Arab side of the
 Gulf to discover oil. Economic development ensued at an
 ever-accelerating pace, culminating today in a modern,
 free-enterprise economy dominated by the ruling family and by
 several wealthy merchant families. While the distribution of
 income is unequal, extreme poverty among Bahrainis is rare.
 Bahrain's oil revenues have been used to offer broad
 educational and social benefits to its citizens. The
 Government makes great effort to assure employment, adequate
 income levels, and fair treatment for native Bahrainis. As oil
 production declines, Bahrain's Government is searching for ways
 to diversify the economy in order to maintain the standard of
 living which has been achieved.
 Bahraini society is divided among Shi'a and Sunni Muslim
 religious communities. The Shi'a form a majority of the
 population, about 60 percent, but the ruling family is Sunni.
 Most Bahrainis are Arab, but a significant number are of
 Persian origin. Nearly one-third of the population is
 non-Bahraini, primarily South Asian temporary workers. Bahrain
 is a tolerant society and offers freedom of religious practice
 to its various communities.
 There have been both positive and negative developments in
 Bahrain's human rights situation in the past year. The start
 of elections for workers' representatives in selected major
 businesses will give Bahraini workers their first country-wide
 organization that can speak in their interests. However, the
 heightened security atmosphere which followed an unsuccessful
 Iranian-sponsored coup attempt in December 1981 by externally
 armed and trained shi'a subversives has resulted in alleged
 instances of harsh treatment of prisoners, arbitrary arrest,
 and imprisonment or summary deportations. The attempted coup
 has also delayed progress toward expanding political
 participation or restoring the National Assembly dissolved in
 1975.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Preedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no known instances of killing for political
 motives. There have been allegations that one of the
 instigators of the December 1981 coup apprehended by the police
 died under interrogation, but this claim appears to be
 unfounded. There have been no reports of terrorist killings in
 Bahrain.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been some reports of disappearances; it is assumed
 that security forces have detained suspected opposition
 
 
 1091
 elements incommunicado for varying -- in some cases, very
 lengthy -- periods. The Government did not respond to an
 inquiry by a private international group concerned with human
 rights concerning one such case. There have been no reports of
 abductions by any terrorist organization.
 c. Torture
 There have been reports that some of the coup attempt
 instigators were subjected to brutal treatment during
 interrogation. No investigation of these reports is known to
 have taken place. Physical measures and mental pressure
 probably-are incorporated into police interrogation procedures,
 but there is-no indication that severe to procedures, but there
 is no indication that severe torture is practiced on a
 systematic basis by Bahrain's security forces. In its report
 published in 1982, Amnesty International included among its
 concerns in Bahrain reports of torture.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 No physical punishments are administered as sentences for
 crimes. Little is known about prison conditions in Bahrain.
 The principal site of detention is located on a separate island
 and no visits there are permitted by non-government persons.
 Detainees are brought to the main island for family visits.
 Political offenders appear to receive longer prison terms than
 common criminals. Amnesty International has expressed concern
 about ill-treatment of political detainees, alleging that some
 six deaths in custody had been reported from 1977 thtough 1981.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been reliable reports that suspected opponents of
 Bahrain's regime have been arbitrarily detained. However, most
 detainees appear to be released after a period which may run to
 one or two months. Some may be held longer. Amnesty
 International has reported that in 1981 four prisoners who had
 been held without trial for more than five years were
 released. There is no right to habeas corpus.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 There are three separate court systems in Bahrain -- civil
 courts, Sharia courts, and security courts. The civil courts
 handle many commercial and all criminal cases. Questions of
 personal status such as marriage, divorce or inheritance are
 dealt with in the Sharia courts. Bahrain's criminal system
 provides that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty.
 Accused persons generally have the right to counsel and a
 public trial. A legal aid system has been established to
 provide a lawyer for those who cannot afford to pay one.
 Bahrain's judiciary is regarded as relatively independent of
 direct political pressure, although many leading judges are
 drawn from the ruling family. Appeals may be made from lower
 courts, both civil and religious, to their respective courts of
 appeals. Political defendants, such as the 1981 coup plotters,
 are tried in special security courts where there is no public
 trial nor recourse to the court of appeals. Unlike judgments
 from the appeals courts, sentences imposed by the security
 court can be referred to the Amir for clemency. A very small
 number of individuals (other than the December 1981 coup
 instigators) sentenced by the security courts are reported to
 be still in detention.
 
 
 1092
 g. Invasion of the Home
 There have been no reports of entries of homes without a
 warrant issued by a civil judge in the Ministry of Justice.
 Security forces apparently are, however, able to obtain such
 warrants with little difficulty. Wiretapping is widely
 suspected of being in use, but is probably not pervasive.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Bahrainis are free to express views critical of the Government
 in private, but publication of criticism directed toward the
 Amir or heads of state of friendly Governments, or regarded as
 tending to undermine public morals or public order, is
 restricted both by the State Security Law and by the 1979
 Publications Law. The latter requires journalists to obtain
 professional licenses from the Ministry of Information and
 gives the Ministry far-reaching authority to censor local media
 and to control importation of foreign publications. A new
 censorship committee, established in February 1982, reviews all
 requests for importation of information or entertainment
 materials, including literature, films, and tapes. Foreign
 journalists require advance, specific approval to visit the
 country, but permission is freely granted.
 All radio and television stations are government-owned.
 Newspapers are privately-owned. The editor of the largest
 paper is a former Ministry of Information official and his
 publications are regarded as semi-official. Media censorship
 has taken the form of shutting down temporarily a publication
 which prints material considered critical of the regime or is
 otherwise politically sensitive. Instances of such action have
 been rare. Media criticism of local officials for failing to
 rectify municipal concerns is tolerated and even encouraged.
 Belief in the existence of an extensive informer system and
 wiretapping operated by the security forces undoubtedly
 inhibits free speech.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are prohibited in Bahrain.
 Although the Constitution of 1973 recognizes the right of
 workers to organize, trade unions and strikes remain
 prohibited. However, the Government has encouraged the
 formation of elected workers' committees in some major
 businesses, and elections for the committees began in 1982.
 Committee representatives are empowered to discuss wages and
 working conditions with management, with unresolved differences
 to be settled by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
 Fifteen percent of employed Bahrainis will, in the next term,
 be represented by these committees; expatriate workers (over
 one-half of the work force) may participate in, but may not
 become leaders of, a national workers committee. Bahrain's
 labor law provides a significant and enforceable measure of
 recourse to Bahraini workers who feel they have been unjustly
 treated by an employer. Asian temporary workers are not so
 effectively protected and there is some exploitation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Bahrain. A variety of
 Islamic and Christian sects maintain places of worship and
 freely practice their religion in Bahrain. The teaching of
 non-Islamic religions outside of the confines of recognized
 
 
 1093
 religious establishments is not permitted. Bahrainis may
 convert from one religion to another, but non-Islamic
 proselytizing among Muslims is viewed negatively by society.
 Although the ruling family is of the Sunni sect, there are
 Shi'a Bahrainis in the cabinet. There are several Shi'a
 religious societies which promote the study of Islam and serve
 as social and sports clubs. The largest of these, with about
 1,600 dues-paying members, is the Islamic Enlightenment
 Society, which is not only permitted but receives personal
 contributions from the Amir. However, members of the Shi'a
 sect have been subjected to job discrimination and the numerous
 and active Shi'a religious establishments are subjected to
 close vigilance by the security forces. Security forces have
 in previous years forcefully broken up Shi'a religious
 processions, which occur annually during the Islamic calendar's
 month of Muharram. Such processions are emotional events and
 can quickly turn to political protest and even violence.
 Police continue to monitor such religious activities closely,
 but no incident of police interference by force occurred this
 year.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to travel
 abroad, and to emigrate. Although the 1973 Constitution
 prohibits exile as a form of punishment, some Bahrainis of
 Persian origin were summarily deported during early 1982, in
 the aftermath of the-December 1981 coup attempt. There is no
 known impediment to the right of a Bahraini citizen abroad to
 return to Bahrain, but deported citizens presumably would not
 be allowed to return without advance permisssion. Refugees are
 not forced to return to homelands from which they fled.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Bahrain is ruled by a hereditary Amir, while day-to-day
 government is in the hands of an appointed Prime Minister and
 cabinet. Governmental authority is distributed by the ruling
 family within its own ranks and among members of other leading
 families. At present there is no suffrage for either men or
 women. The average Bahraini is.able to participate in the
 political process only by means of informal contact with senior
 officials and by attending public audiences of the Amir. The
 Amir dissolved the elected Bahraini legislature in 1975, after
 20 months' existence, and there are no indications of plans to
 revive it. No political parties are permitted and none exist
 openly. There are two clandestine political groups which
 attract younger militant Shi'as -- the Islamic Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain, an Iranian-sponsored group responsible
 for the 1981 coup attempt, and the Islamic Call (Dawa) party.
 Both call for overthrow of the Government and establishment of
 an independent Islamic republic along Iranian lines. Both
 forms are believed to have several hundred members.
 There are also two underground leftist groups -- the Popular
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain-and the National Front for
 the Liberation of.Bahrain -- both of which have ties with
 revolutionary;-Arab regimes in the area. Both groups call for
 overthrow of the:Government and probably have-several hundred
 members each.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 
 
 1094
 Bahrain has not been the subject of resolutions or
 investigations by official international human rights
 organizations. Amnesty International is the only private group
 known to have visited Bahrain in the past year. A team sent in
 April 1982 to observe the trial of the arrested coup plotters
 was able to meet with government officials, but was not
 permitted to attend the trial. There are no non-governmental
 organizations in Bahrain established to protect individual
 liberties.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Sibuation
 The Government focuses attention and resources on meeting the
 economic and social needs of Bahrain's population, but
 discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion does
 occur, sometimes as a result of official policy. According to
 the 1981 census, Bahrain's population was 350,798, of which
 about 32 percent, including more than fifty-five percent of the
 labor force, was non-Bahraini. The Government has implemented
 generous and effective social policies in health and education
 in the last forty years, and free public health care is
 available to all citizens and residents; however, free
 education and subsidized housing are available only to
 Bahrainis. The Government's effective social insurance scheme
 does not provide the same measure of coverage for non-Bahrainis
 as it does for citizens.
 South Asian workers must often pay their Bahraini sponsor for
 the right to remain and work in Bahrain, and salary scales vary
 widely according to sponsor. Temporary residents are
 particularly vulnerable to massive rent increases imposed by
 local landlords. Recently, members of Bahrain's Shi'a
 community have encountered increased job discrimination as the
 result of political tensions following last December's coup
 attempt.
 The right to private property is protected. While foreigners
 other than citizens of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are not normally
 permitted to own real estate in Bahrain, their rights to
 possess other personal property are protected under law.
 Life expectancy in Bahrain is 64 years for men and 68 yearsafor
 women. Bahrain's official statistics show an infant mortality
 rate of 22 per 1,000 live births for 1981. Food and safe
 drinking water are available in adequate supply, although
 typhoid occasionally affects portions of the island. The
 prices of basic food items are subsidized by the Government.
 In 1982, primary school enrollment was 33,359, of whom 16,000
 were female. Approximately 65 percent of Bahrainis between
 ages of 4 and 19 attend primary or secondary schools; 54
 percent of them are boys and 46 per cent are girls. The
 literacy rate is currently estimated to be 74 percent (above
 age 10).
 Per capita income in 1981 was about $6,000. Although
 statistical data are not available, it is generally recognized
 that there is some poverty in Bahrain at the village level and
 among some of the foreign temporary worker communities. The
 Government, faced with declining oil revenues, receives
 financial support and project grants from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 and the United Arab Emirates. Virtually no taxes are imposed.
 From the 1982-83 budget, 13 percent was allocated to education,
 10 percent to health, 1.2 percent to housing, and 24 percent to
 social services.
 
 
 1095
 The Government continues to place strong emphasis on
 Bahrainization of most sectors of the economy, but presently
 the extremes of menial and high-skilled positions tend to be
 held .by expatriate employees. The Government's scheme to train
 10,000 Bahrainis over the next ten years in order to replace
 foreign workers holding skilled jobs is progressing. Many
 skilled Bahrainis have migrated to other Gulf states which can
 afford to pay them higher salaries.
 Bahraini women have traditionally constituted a "separate
 society" in accord with this country's Islamic heritage. It is
 impossible to judge how "equal" women's society was or is, but
 most Bahrainis continue to view the system as right and
 proper. The integration of male and female societies began
 with the development of a modern economy and women have
 increasingly taken on roles previously reserved to men. The
 number of Bahraini women in the work force increased from about
 1,000 to 12,000 between 1970 and 1980, and they now constitute
 12 percent of all Bahraini workers. The Government has enacted
 special labor laws to encourage female entry into the work
 force. Within the Government itself women hold a small number
 of senior positions. Women are granted sixty days paid
 maternity leave and entitled to nursing periods during the work
 day. Women may not be discharged for marriage or pregnancy.
