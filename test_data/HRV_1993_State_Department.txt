 CROATIA
 The Republic of Croatia declared its independence from the former Socialist Fed-
 eral Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA), assisted
 by paramilitary forces from Serbia/Montenegro and from Serb-inhabited areas of
 Croatia then attacked Croatia, ultimately establishing control over a quarter of
 Croatials territory. A cease-fire went into effect in January 1992. The February 1992
 peace plan negotiated by former U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and approved
 y the U  . Security Council (UNSC) as Resolution 743, aimed at normalizing life
 in the Serb-occupied areas through a multistage process including demilitarization,
 the return of displaced persons, reconstitution of police forces based on prewar eth-
 nic proportions, and negotiations leading to reintegration of the areas into Croatia.
 The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed in March to serve
 as peacekeepers and implement the Vance Plan. The areas of Croatia seized during
 the war were designated U.N. Protected Areas (UNPA's) and identified as Sectors
 North, South, East, and West. Adjacent to some UNPA's are "Pink Zones," Croatian-
 controlled territory in which UNPROFOR has a limited peacekeeping role.
 The UNSC extended UNPROFOR's mandate six times in 1993, including Resolu-
 tion 801, which for the first time identified the UNPA's as "integral" parts of the
 Republic of Croatia. The most recent UNPROFOR mandate extension, UNSC Reso-
 lution 871, expires on March 31, 1994. Little progress was made in implementing
 the Vance Plan in 1993. The 15,000-troop UNPROFOR mission was not able to pre-
 vent the outbreak of armed conflict between Croats and Serbs in January and Sep-
 tember, as well as the almost daily shelling of Zadar and other areas along the Dal-
 matian coast from the Serb-controllei areas of the UNPA's. Apart from the above
 exeptions, UNPROFOR's presene significantly abated the fighting in the UNPA's.
 UNPROF6R, however, was unable to demilitarize the UNPA's or begin repatriating
 persons displaced from their homes in the UNPA's.
 Although JNA forces left Croatia by the end of 1992, the UNPA's (except for part
 of Sector West) were under the control of heavily armed, aggressive Serbian ele-
 ments, defying UNPROFOR and continuing the "ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs.
 Two major outbreaks of fighting occurre in 993. The Croatian army in January
 launched an offensive to reestablish road connections between northern and south-
 ern Dalmatia by seizing a key area around Maslenica. In September Croatian forces
 launched a second offensive to capture several Serb-held villages near Medak, alleg-
 edly in retaliation for Serbian mortar fire against the town of Gospic. They de-
 stroyed 11 Serbian villages and killed at least 67 Serbs, including civilians. In Octo-
 ber the Government suspended several officers pending an investigation. Serbian
 forces responded with rocket and artillery attacks against Karlovac several Zagreb
 suburbs, and the Sisak oil refinery, killing many civilians. (See also Section 1.g.)
 The Constitution provides for a parliamentary system headed by a president in-
 vested with considerable powers. Dr. Franjo Tudjman, elected President in August
 1992, is in the second year of a 5-year term. He serves as the Chief of State, chairs
 the influential National Defense and Security Council, and appoints a Prime Min-
 ister who leads the Government. Dr. Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic
 Union (HIDZ), holds a majority of seats in both houses of Parliament.
 The Ministry of Defense oversees the armed forces, which include an army, a
 small air force, a small navy and a national guard reserve. The President is armed
 forces commander in chief. The Ministry of Interior manages the police. The once
 formidable Office for the Defense of the Constitution was disbanded in 1993. Some
 of the office's functions were incorporated into the Interior Ministry, and some were
 subsumed by a new National Intelligence Service. The armed forces were guilty of
 violations of humanitarian law during the year. Law enforcement agencies were
 criticized for severe human rights abuses.
 In the occupied UNPA's, "authorities" of the self-proclaimed and internationally
 unrecognized "Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK)" controlled all military and police
 functions. The Krajina Serb forces, numbering some 15,000-18,000 men, were orga-
 nized into an army and various "police" forces, with large amounts of weaponry at
 their disposal. These forces were heavily augmented from time to time by "volun-
 teers" provided by the Government of Serbia/Montenegro and by Serbian criminal
 warlords from other parts of the former Yugoslavia. In the immediate aftermath of
 both the Maslenica and Medak pocket incidents, the authorities in Serbia were reli-
 ably reported to have dispatched substantial numbers of "volunteers" to Sectors
 North and South to fight against the Croats. The firing of the FROG rockets on Cro-
 atian cities in September is almost certain to have been carried out with at least
 the implied consent of Serbian authorities. More fundamentally, Sectors North and
 South, as well as the southern portion of Sector West, are economically cut off from
 
 
 831
 trade or supply with or from any source except Serbia-via the northern corridor-
 or, for certain items, the Bosnian Serbs. All these forces were directly involved in
 a continuing pattern of serious human rights abuses against non-Serbian popu-
 lations as well as other Serbs.
 According to statistics compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), as of October 1993, there was a total of 247,000 Croatian and
 other non-Serbian displaced persons coming from areas under the control of the
 "RSK" and 254,000 Serbian displaced persons and refugees from the rest of Croatia,
 an estimated 87,000 of whom were inhabitants of the UNPA's.
 The aftereffects of the 1991 war, the massive refugee burden, the spillover from
 the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the absence of significant international financial as-
 sistance, the loss of export markets in the former Yugoslavia, and other factors con-
 tinued to stymie Croatian economic recovery. The Government made little progress
 toward privatization and a free market economy. Inflation ran at 25 to 30 percent
 per month until a stabilization program was introduced in October, and the average
 standard of living stood at less than 50 percent of its pre-1991 level.
 There were continued serious human rights abuses in areas of Croatia under gov-
 ernment control in 1993, although physical violence against Serbs declined. Abuses
 occurring near frontline areas were aimed at citizens of Serbian nationality and in-
 cluded killings, disappearances, physical abuse, illegal detention, harassment, de-
 struction of property including house bombings, loss of employment, and summary
 eviction from dwelling units. Other human rights problems included limitations on
 freedom of the press, arbitrary detention, and discrimination against minorities, es-
 pecially Serbs.
 In the Serb-controlled portions of the UNPA's, there was no evident commitment
 to ending human rights abuses against Croats, Hungarians, Slovaks, and other non-
 Serbs. Some of the Krajina Serb "authorities" continued to be among the most egre-
 gious perpetrators of human rights abuses against the residual non-srb population,
 as well as Serbs not in agreement with nationalistic policy. Human rights violations
 included killings, disappearances, beatings, harassment, forced resettlement, or
 exile-all part of the systematic campaign of "ethnic cleansing" designed to ensure
 Serbian dominance of the areas.
 Following the UNSC's establishment of a War Crimes Commission in 1992 to in-
 vestigate possible war crimes, the UNSC in February 1993 passed a resolution to
 create a War Crimes Tribunal. By year's end all the judges had been sworn in, and
 a chief prosecutor had been appointed. The Tribunal is to assess the culpability of
 alleged perpetrators of atrocities and to issue a comprehensive report on violations
 of human rights and humanitarian law. From September 1992 through June 1993,
 the United States Government submitted to the United Nations eight separate re-
 ports summarizing thousands of instances of killings, torture, rape, impeding deliv-
 eries of food and medical supplies to civilian populations, mass forcible deportations
 of civilians, and other violations of humanitarian law. In addition, the U.S. Govern-
 ment provided the United Nations with 400 refugee reports totaling over 1,000
 pages. Illustrative examples of these abuses appear in appropriate sections of this
 re At
 Wis section of the Country Reports addresses human rights within the territory
 of Croatia. Croatian responsibility for human rights abuses on the territory of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina is addressed in the report on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--Compared to 1992, there were fewer
 substantiated reports of politically motivated or other extrajudicial killings in 1993.
 One controversial murder case was resolved on October 13 when four policemen
 were convicted of the 1991 killing of Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) Vice President
 Ante Paraga. They received jail sentences of from 5 to 7 years. However, the Decem-
 ber 1992 murder of former trade union leader Milan Krivokuca remains unsolved
 despite reported continuing police investigation.
 Killings continued to occur in the UNPA's as part of the Belgrade-backed Serbs'
 program of "ethnic cleansing." In Sector South, for example, an elderly Croat woman
 who refused to flee the area was found with a meat hook through her neck and
 hand. Krajina Serb elements are credibly reported to have planted a bomb which
 killed 3 Croatian policemen and wounded 18 others on September 8 in Pakrac.
 In October a U.N.-sponsored forensic team, with the cooperation of the Croatian
 Government, excavated a mass grave site in Sector West thought to contain corpses
 of Serbs murdered during the 1991 fighting. Nineteen bodies were exhumed. All but
 two suffered gunshot wounds to the head. The Government opened criminal inves-
 
 
 832
 tigations, but by year's end no charges had been submitted to the court. The same
 forensic team attempted to excavate a mass grave at Ovcara near Vukovar but was
 prevented from doing so by Serbian obstructionism. (Some critics claimed that if
 UNPROFOR had asserted the right of the forensic team, the excavation would have
 been allowed.) This site is believed to hold the remains of over 170 wounded Cro-
 atian soldiers who had been taken from Vukovar hospital when the city fell and
 summarily executed by JNA troops.
 b. Disappearance.-There were fewer reported new cases of missing persons in
 1993, but there was little progress in solving previously reported cases. The Cro-
 atian Government's Office for the Victims of the War lists 7,857 persons "missing
 or forcefully disappeared in the territory of Croatia" as of the end of 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment. In practice,
 Croatian detention facilities generally meet accepted standards of order and amen-
 ities. It appears that treatment of combatants may also generally meet international
 standards. Croatian prisons generally appear to meet international standards of
 cleanliness and nutrition. Prisoners receive regular meals, adequate if not appetiz-
 ing. Jails are crowded but not to excess Family visits and access to counsel are
 available. Medical care is provided. There were allegations of mistreatment and
 physical abuse of some prisoners by guards.
 Conditions in prisons within the Serb-controlled UNPA's are reliably reported to
 be abysmal. Harsh treatment of non-Serbs is commonplace and unpunished. There
 were reports of torture and abuse in Serb-run prisons in the UNPA's. In a prison
 compound in Knin, for example, 10 Croat prisoners were secretly kept in a base-
 ment, without the knowledge of Red Cross officials, and forced to sleep on concrete
 floors. One released prisoner reported being beaten upon his arrival at the prison
 and then being registered with the Red Cross 8 days later. Prisoners at the
 compound were always kept inside and fed only twice daily.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains provisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused, but there were credible reports of abuse of
 pretrial and investigative detention. For example, nine members of the Dalmatian
 Action Party, including the husband of the party president, were placed in inves-
 tigative detention after being accused of bombing their own party office on Septem-
 ber 28. One of these detainees later was beaten by other prisoners. All were re-
 leased by the end of November.
 Under Croatian law, police normally seek arrest warrants by presenting evidence
 of probable cause to an interrogating magistrate. A suspect may be arrested without
 issuance of a warrant if police believe the suspect might flee, attempt to destroy evi-
 dence, or commit other crimes. If the suspect is arrested without a warrant, the po-
 lice have 24 hours to inform the local interrogating magistrate and must justify its
 decision to arrest without a warrant.
 After arrest, persons must be given access to an attorney of their choice within
 24 hours; if they have no attorney, one will be appointed by the interrogating mag-
 istrate from a list of public defenders. The interrogating judge must, within 3 days
 of the arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to  old  e arrestee in custody
 pending further investigation. The judge must justify the decision in writing, includ-
 ing the length of detention ordered. These decisions are appealable, either imme-
 diately or later in the detention period. The usual period of investigative detention
 varies from a few days to a few weeks but by law may be as long as 2 years. Ac-
 cused persons have the right to have their attorney present during the entire inves-
 tigation as well as during any appeal against investivative detention. In practice,
 arrestees are almost always bound over for investigation unless it is clear no case
 against them exists. Once the investigation is complete, the usual practice is to re-
 lease the accused persons on their own reconizance pending trial, unless the crime
 is a major offense or the accused is considered a public danger. There are no provi-
 sions for posting bail, although police will sometimes retain the accused's passport
 to prevent them from leaving the country.
 In the Serb-controlled areas of the UNPA's, virtually no safegurds exist against
 arbitrary detention. The use of detentions to intimidate non-Serbs continued in
 1993. Even politically moderate Serbs in the UNPA's were subjected to arrest and
 harassment. Three such individuals, who were active in an UNPROFOR-brokered
 dialog with the Croatian Government were imprisoned for a second time in 1993.
 Exile is constitutionally prohibited. however, the Croatian Helsinki Committee (a
 local oragnization with no links to Helsinki Watch) asserted that since 1991 as
 many as 10,000 houses, many owned by Croatian Serbs, have blown up or razed.
 In some cases, the residents were killed. In most cases, Croatian Serbs fled the
 country (see Section 5).
 
 
 833
 Exile, in the form of "ethnic cleansing," was employed aggressive]y and with the
 blessing of UNPA Serbian "officials" against Croats, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs,
 and other non-Serbs. For example, on July 19, 4 Croatian women were expelled
 from Sector South and during the week of August 6, 16 Croats were forced out of
 Sector East. UNPROFOR estimates that fewer than 400 Croats remain in Sector
 South. The leader of the Democratic Union of Hungarians from Croatia stated on
 June 28 that 8,000 citizens of Hungarian nationality had been forced to flee to Hun-
 gary, largely from Sector East, while another 2,000 had been displaced to other
 parts of Croatia because of Serbian "ethnic cleansing."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Croatian legal system consists of municipal
 and district courts, a Supreme Court, and a Constitutional Court. The High Judicial
 Council (with a president and 14 members from all parts of the legal community)
 appoints judges and public prosecutors. The House of Parishes nominates persons
 for membership on the Council, and the House of Representatives elects members
 to 8-year terms. The judicial process is not yet free of ethnic bias or political influ-
 ence.
 A defendant has the constitutional right to a fair trial by a competent court, to
 attend the trial, and to be represented by an attorney. The defendant must be in.
 formed of the charges and the evidence against him and may not be forced to admit
 guilt. Illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible. Counsel is provided to indigent de-
 fendants.
 In practice, the prosecuting attorney has leeway in deciding whether to bring a
 case against an individual. In cases considered "political," both the bringing of
 charges and the conduct of trials may be subject to outside influence. The arrest of
 leading members of the Dalmatian Action Party (see Section Ld.) and the case
 brought against Croatian Party of Right (HSP) leader Dobroslav Paraga raised ques-
 tions about the Government's motivation. Paraga and other senior party officials
 were brought to trial in 1993 for alleged activities endangering the Croatian State
 committed in 1991 and 1992. The charges arose from the fact that, when the war
 broke out, in the absence of an organized Croat army at the time, various groups
 formed paramililtary organs to fight the Serbs. One of the most active of these was
 the HSPs "Croatian Liberation Movement" or HOS, which operated in Slavonia
 (headquartered in Osijek) and contributed to the defense of Vukovar. When Croatia
 established its army, these groups were required to become part of the Croatian
 army or disarm. Refusing to do so, some HOS fighters continued to maintain their
 separate identity (if not actual military operations) well into 1992. To compel the
 dissolution of the HOS paramilitary forces, the Government brought Paraga and his
 chief lieutenants to trial, even thou  Paraga in the meantime had lost control of
 the "offical" HSP. Paraga, new ofmicial HSP leader Ante Djapic, and HOS com-
 mander Ante Djopic all were acquitted of the charges against them late in 1993.
 Observers have criticized cases of government prosecution of Serbs under Section
 236(I) of the Criminal Code, which prohibits "rebellion," arguing that some have
 been convicted on insufficient evidence. Tens of such trials took place in 1993, with
 many of the accused tried in absentia. Virtually all the accusedwere found guilty
 after trials before military courts. Many of these summary convictions, however,
 have been quietly expunged.
 According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights,
 an ethnic Serb working for the United Nations was arrested on September 1 on a
 charge of "armed rebellion," despite his having previously received clearance from
 the Croatian police. The Special Rapporteur reported that no indication of the spe-
 cific accusation against him was given and that his lawyer was denied access to any
 evidence or witnesses against him. He was tried in camera by a military court and
 on October 24 was released after being granted an "amnesty" for his alleged activi-
 ties.
 The Special Rapporteur's field staff investigated the case of a Croatian citizen of
 Serbian origin, arrested on December 12, 1992, in Zagreb on charges of having tor-
 tured Croatian prisoners of war (POW's) in the Glina camp. On February 18, the
 District Court of Zagreb found him guilty and sentenced him to 12 years' imprison-
 ment. although no substantial evidence was produced against him. Furthermore, in
 spite of being convicted as a civilian, he was exchanged under duress as a POW be-
 fore his appeal could be heard by the Supreme Court.
 The six-court military legal system tries cases involving members of the armed
 forces and national security matters. Civilians may be tried in this forum on certain
 security charges. Defendants have the same legal rights as those tried in civilian
 courts.
 Observers have decried the legal system in Serb-controlled UNPA's as a sham, de-
 scribing kangaroo courts which serve those in power as operating with bias and
 prejudice and outside of any semblance of the rule of law.
 
 
 834
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution declares homes inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant,
 and justification for the search of a home or other premises must be stated. Police
 may enter without a warrant or the owner's consent only if necessary to enforce an
 arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent serious danger to life or important
 property. In practice, Croatian authorities do not always adhere to these constitu-
 tional requirements. Throughout 1993, military police carried out illegal evictions
 from state-owned apartments without prior legal proceedings and in some instances
 using excessive force. The Croatian Defense Ministry insisted that it had inherited
 ownership of these proerties, while tenants often insisted on their right to the
 dwelling based on urchase or sublease. The Housing Commission of the Ministry
 of Defense often retused to address individual complaints. The military police also
 apparently ignored court rulings for the reinstatement of tenants. While authorities
 of the Housing Commission acknowledged that illegal evictions took place, they stat-
 ed that many illegal evictions were committed by displaced persons from the
 UNPA's who "take matters into their own hands" and that the authorities "must
 demonstrate understanding for those whose families have suffered from the Serbs,"
 especially "when it is well known that the tenants are active on the enemy side."
 The Constitution guarantees the secrecy and safety of personal data, but it is un-
 clear if such guarantees are adhered to in practice.
 Serbian "authorities" in the UNPA's showed no compunction in interfering with
 the rights of non-Serbs. In Sector South, UNPROFOR had to provide 24-hour protec-
 tion or a small Croatian village after local Serbian "authorities" announced they
 could no longer "protect" the inhabitants from the depredations of armed bands. A
 series of arrests of politically moderate UNPA Serbs in September, ordered by cer-
 tain Krajina Serb leaders, reportedly included scores of violations of privacy rights,
 including fire-bombings. Another serious abuse was the practice of forced resettle-
 ment which the Krajina Serbs continued to utilize in Sector East. They housed so-
 called Serbian refugees with local non-Serb or mixed marriage families against the
 occupants' will. After often severe harassment by their "guests," the rightful occu-
 pants moved out, thus "abandoning" their property to the Serbian immigrants. Eth-
 nic Croats remaining in the Serb-controlled areas of the UNPA's, along with some
 Serbian native residents of these areas, reportedly have become targets for the
 many gangs of criminals which have emerged among the Serbian immigrant popu-
 lation in the UNPA's, particularly Sector East.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 f/icts.-The January 1992 cease-fire between Croatian forces and the JNA and other
 Serb-led forces was accompanied by a peace plan negotiated by former U.S. Sec-
 retary of State Cyrus Vance. This plan aimed at normalizing life in the Serbian-
 occupied areas through demilitarization, the return of displaced persons, the recon-
 stitution of police forces, and negotiations for the reintegration of these areas into
 Croatia. The UNSC deployed UNPROFOR as peacekeepers in four U.N. Protected
 Areas (UNPA's), which were under the control of Serbian military and paramilitary
 forces. No progress was made in implementing the Vance Plan during 1993, and no
 general and complete cease-fire was agreed upon.
 Exchanges of fire and shelling between the Croatian army and Serbian forces in
 the Krajina area continued along the cease-fire lines at a low level throughout 1993.
 Krajina Serb artillery attacks were a daily fact of life for many Croatian commu-
 nities near the cease-fire lines thoughout 1993. Two major outbreaks of fighting oc-
 curred, with widespread loss of civilian lives and destruction of proprty. In January
 the Croatian army attacked Maslenica, in order to try to reestablish a transpor-
 tation link between the northern and southern Dalmatian coast and attempted to
 drive Krajina Serbian forces outside of artillery range of the area so that a bridge
 to the coast road could be built. The Serbian forces responded by stepping up their
 shelling of the bridgehead the Croats were trying to secure and of neighboring Cro-
 atian areas. When the fighting spread to the Peroca area, the Serbs critically dam-
 aged the Peruca dam by setting off charges they had placed in the dam many
 months earlier. Although the fighting caused civilian, principally Serbian, casual-
 ties, there are no reliable figures on either side.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur received reports of the deaths of seven elderly ethnic
 Serb civilians who were found dead following an attack by Croatian government
 forces against the village of Mirlovic Pole in the UNPA Sector South on September
 6. Four of the victims were reportedly executed, and three were apparently burned
 to death.
 In September, following reportedly sustained Serbian mortar fire on Gospic from
 several Serb-held villages in the Medak area, Croatian forces launched an attack
 to seize three such villages whose inhabitants were predominantly Serb. This area
 is situated in a "Pink Zone" near UNPA Sector South. After negotiating a cease-
 
 
 835
 fire and the withdrawal of Croatian forces, the field staff of the U.N. Special
 Rapporteur reported that 67 bodies were recovered, while another 25 persons were
 missing. Medical experts reported that several victims were shot at close rane.
 Some of the bodies were mutilated and showed signs of possible torture, including
 serious burns. Most of the victims appeared to be civilians, including a number of
 elderly persons. At least nine were women seven of them elderly. None of the vic-
 tims were children, and it was assumed that they had been evacuated before the
 attack occurred. Witnesses to the Croatian attacks reported that Croatian armed
 forces shelled civilian targets and, upon entering the villages, continued systemati-
 cally to destroy the villages with explosives, including grenades and mines. While
 denying the charge of atrocities, Croatian authorities relieved the military district
 commander and two subordinate commanders of their positions and launched their
 own investigation. The results had not been made public by year's end.
 After this Croatian attack, Krajina Serbian forces dramatically increased rocket
 and artillery attacks on several Croatian cities and towns. They shelled downtown
 Karlovac for several days, killing 7 and wounding 23 on September 10; they hit the
 Zagreb suburb of Lucko, nearby Samobor, and Jastrebarsko with rockets on succeed-
 ing days. They also shelled the Sisak oil refinery on September 9. During this large-
 ly indiscriminate shelling, dozens of civilians were killed, scores were injured, and
 many houses and buildings were destroyed.
 In addition to the deiberate shelling of the villages in the Medak pocket, the Spe-
 cial Rapporteur received reports that Croatian forces also engaged in deliberate
 shelling of civilian areas in the villages of Baljci, Vrlika, and Biljane Gornie.
 Krajina Srb formes continued a deliberate and indiscriminate campaign of artil-
 lery attacks on major Croatian cities and economic targets throughout 1993. There
 were numerous civilian deaths and injuries and extensive damage to schools, hos-
 pitals, and refugee camps, as well as houses and apartments. Gross violations of
 human rights remained commonplace in the UNPA's. Krajina Serb forces, operating
 with impunity and under the direct guidance of Krajina Serb "authorities," were di-
 rectly implicated in a continuing series of murders, rapes, bombings, and arson. The
 Serbian terrorist and wanted war criminal, Zelbko (*Arkan") Raznjatovic, a member
 of the Belgrade Parliament, operated in Sector East with the open support of local
 "authorities," setting up terrorist training facilities and a gas station and casino
 complex anA traveling to and from Serbia with no hindrance. On October 9, a party
 of 16 armed "VIP (very important persons) guards" from Arkan's units forced their
 way across the bridge from Serbia into UNPA Sector East. UNPROFOR ace-
 keepers who were guarding the crossing were beaten when they confronted the in-
 truders, and three were injured. UNPROFOR's protest to Serbia was not answered.
 In the areas under the control of the "Republic of Serbian Krajina," the organized
 and massive "ethnic cleansing" of Croats and other non-Serbs is largely a fait
 accompli. A climate of hostility and abuse against the few remaining ethnic minori-
 ties exists, and they continue to leave the UNPA's. Serbs who show any inclination
 toward or involvement in reconciliation with Croats are considered spies and trai-
 tors and are subject to harassment and intimidation by Serbian "authorities.*
 In Sector South and the Pink Zones, home to 44,000 ethnic Croats in 1991, there
 were reportedly only 1,161 ethnic Croats by year's end.
 On September 21, two former high-ranking members of the Knin authorities were
 accused of cooperation with Croats and arrested because of their participation in a
 social reconstruction project cosponsored by the United Nations and a nongovern-
 mental organization. A Serb who was the manager of the project was also arrested.
 In UNPA Sector East, most of the Croats have been driven out, and ethnic Hun-
 garians, Slovaks, and Gypsies were threatened. The Croatian population has
 dropped from 46 percent of the total in 1991 to approximately 6 percent, whereas
 the Serbian population increased from 34 percent to approximately 73 percent. The
 Hungarian population of the area dropped  by approximately 44 percent. There were
 reports of murder, rape and pillage, as well as brutal beatings against the remain-
 ing non-Serbs and the forcible recruitment of non-Serbs into the armed forces. In
 several reported cases, those who refused recruitment were beaten, imprisoned, and
 even killed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution guarantees freedom of thought
 and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media of com-
 munication, speech and public expression, and free establishment of institutions of
 public communication. The Government continued significantly to limit the exercise
 of certain of these rights. It used its ownership interest in print media and its near
 monopoly over distribution to limit media independence. The official Croatian news
 agency sometimes issued distorted reports about the fighting in Bosnia. In the Serb-
 
 
 836
 controlled portions of the UNPA's, freedom of speech and press virtually does not
 exist.
 The Constitution states that "any call for or incitement to war, or resort to vio-
 lence, national, racial, or religious hatred, or any form of intolerance shall be prohib-
 ited and punishable." There is an active and vocal political opposition which con-
 ducts a broad-ranging and open public debate in the print me ia and occasionally
 in the electronic media.
 Critics have charged, however, that local variations of slander and false informa-
 tion statutes constitute an infringement of free speech. One of the most prominent
 such cases in 1993 resulted in the conviction of an individual who claimed that large
 numbers of Serbian civilians were being held in Croatian POW camps. The defend-
 ant received a 6-month suspended sentence after an on-site investigation by the
 Russian Ambassador and a government team determined the charge was false.
 The Croatian Helsinki Committee alleged that Croatian authorities brought politi-
 cally motivated lea1 proceedings against top officials and activists of two minor op-
 position parties, w ic the Committee feared demontrated a tendency to inhibit po-
 litical pluralism. Under various pretexts, these cases were brought before the Mili-
 tary Solicitor's Office, which resulted in a significant restriction on defendants'
 rights. The head of the Military Solicitor's Office is also the chairman of a political
 party, which means that he is conducting trials of the chairmen or activists of rival
 parties. Members of the Dalmatian Action Party were arrested and accused of plant-
 ing explosives on their own property. Contacts with the detainees were not allowed,
 and the Helsinki Committee reported that some of them were physically abused (see
 Section 1.d.).
 The Government controls all national television broadcasting and all (save one)
 national radio stations and retains a controlling interest in two of the four news dai-
 lies. Although these state-controlled or heavily state-influenced media, particularly
 the press, frequently carry reportage critical of the Government, government control
 nonetheless ensures an overall editorial slant generally favorable to the Government
 and the ruling HDZ. The emergence of more independent mass media is hampered
 mainly by the absence of a clear commitment by the Government and the ruling
 party to that objective.
 A few newspapers continued to guard their independence. Novi List, a daily pub-
 lished in R-     was privatized in 1993 and asserted a strongly independent edi-
 torial line. The highly popular, independent, semitabloid weekly Globus continued
 to feature articles based on investigative journalism. The weekly Nedjeljna
 Dalmacija retained widespread respect for its independent orientation. A new intel-
 lectual bimonthly journal entitled Erasmus, launched in May and financed in part
 by the International Media Fund and the Open Society Foundation, provided an-
 other forum for topical public debate of sensitive political issues.
 The irreverent satirical weekly, Feral Tribune, was resurrected, although Feral's
 editor reportedly received a lecture at the Ministry of Culture for the tabloid's per-
 sistently crude, grossly personal attacks on Croatia's President. In early 1994, the
 editor in chief, a reservist who had already undergone military training, was con-
 fined to barracks for several weeks after failing to respond to a military callup. He
 appealed his induction and was released, and the Government stated that an ex-
 emption from further military service might be granted. Nevertheless, some observ-
 ers felt that the mobilization order was politically motivated as it happened imme-
 diately after the Feral Tribune ran a piece attacking Tudjman.
 The Government's politically inspired decision to compel the reprivatization of the
 respected Split daily Slobodna Dalmacija generated criticism. The new owners fired
 a number of prominent Slobodna journalists and shifted the paper's editorial stance
 closer to the Government's position on certain issues.
 The President of the Croatian Journalists' Society complained about the gap be-
 tween the principle and practice of press freedom and said that, while Croatia ac-
 cepted the principle of freedom of speech and information, in practice journalists
 were attacked for their views when they differed from state policies. For example,
 there were reports that military police assaulted several journalists covering an at-
 tempted eviction, dragging a female reporter away by her hair and hitting a camera-
 man in the face. The President of the Society said that privatization of the media
 was not leading to greater media freedom. State purchase of shares allowed the
 Government to continue to have a "controlling" voice in media. He also said that
 the Government exploited the extremely weak financial position of most newspapers
 to manipulate andpressure them. His remarks were nonetheless reported by all the
 government-controlled papers.
 The International Federation of Journalists in March suggested that Croatia's ad-
 mission to the Council of Europe should be delayed because it was "very concerned"
 about freedom of the press in Croatia. The Federation specifically mentioned the
 
 
 837
 privatization process and the question of the approriateness of having well-known
 ruling party members in charge of state television and newspapers.
 In May the Parliament responded to criticism from opposition party spokes-
 persons of the lack of media freedom by appointing a five-person multiparty commis-
 sion to investigate the situation and report to the legislature at its next session. By
 year's end, no report had been issued, but local press reports indicated a seven-
 member council for protecting the ress was established in December.
 International papers and journals remained available throughout government-con-
 trolled areas.
 Croatia has three major television channels, as well as regional stations in Zadar,
 Rijeka, Split, and Osijek. Zagreb-based Channels One and Two are part of the offi-
 cial Croatian Radio and Television (HTV) enterprise. The third, OTV-Youth Tele-
 vision, with a signal that reaches only the capital district, has an uncertain legal
 status and operates at the sufferance of the Government. Channel Two's popular,
 late night HTV show, "Frame by Frame," continued to carry interviews with major
 public figures as well as extensive replays of Western television coverage of events
 in the former Yugoslavia.
 HTV also began a periodic prime-time program featuring live, face-to-face debates
 between senior government and opposition figures, in which some of the most sen-
 sitive political issues of the day were hotly debated.
 There are private local radio stations operating under provisional licenses in Cro-
 atia, but their legal status is open to question in the absence of a national media
 law. Croatian radio on at least eight occasions refused to broadcast informational
 programs prepared by UNPROFOR. However, regular, lengthy, unedited interviews
 of senior UNPROFOR figures were prominently featured in the government-con-
 trolled and independent press throughout the year.
 Privatization of television and radio was a hotly debated topic in 1993 and has
 yet to be implemented. A government draft broadcast law providing for the alloca-
 tion of radio and television broadcast frequencies to new, private outlets is pending
 in Parliament.
 The House of Representatives' Committee for Human Rights and National Minori-
 ties expressed its dissatisfaction with television broadcasts on minorities. Members
 of the Committee who represent minority groups in Parliament criticized the tele-
 vision program for minorities "Prizma,* which they considered to be unfocused and
 of no use to minorities. They proposed to Parliament that a minority representative
 be included on the television administration board.
 The Croatian Helsinki Committee in July issued its first document about media
 freedom in Croatia, criticizing the Government's policy regarding freedom of the
 media. The document, presented to the Prime Minister, alleged that higher taxes
 were imposed on private newspapers than on dailies owned by persons connected
 to the Government. It said that the Government's monopoly of distribution, sales,
 and printing of newspapers hindered the development of a pluralistic press and was
 an indirect form of censorship. For instance, it cited different treatment of different
 papers regarding sales and distribution and the lack of access to television advertis-
 ing as methods used to restrict the independence of newspapers. It criticized the
 Government's failure to change the law that establishes the State's monopoly on
 Croatian radio and television and prevents the development of pluralistic private
 electronic media. It pointed out that the Government violated the Information Law,
 which prohibits a person with immunity from charges of libel from being a chief edi-
 tor, when both the chief editor of the daily Vjesnik and the Director General of Cro-
 atian Television are parliamentarians who are thereby immune from libel suits. Fi-
 nally, it criticized the Government's failure to implement the law calling for demo-
 cratic institutions, such as the constitutionally mandated Court for Human Rights
 and the Council for the Protection of Public Information, established by the Informa-
 tion Law passed in April 1992. Among its recommendations, the Committee said the
 process of privatizing the dailies Slobodna Dalmacia, Glas Slavonije, and Vecernji
 List and the weekly Danas should be reexamined.It also recommended the estab-
 lishment of oversight and coordination bodies to prevent discrimination, correct
 irregularities and secure equal treatment for all publications on the market.
 In the Serb-controlled areas of the UNPA's, martial law remains in effect, and
 there are no guarantees of press and other freedoms. Radio, television, and news-
 papers published elsewhere in Croatia are available in the Croatian-controlled por-
 tion of Sector West. In the Serbian-controlled UNPA areas, Serbian papers, usually
 published in Belgrade, are generally available, although the supply is sometimes
 sporadic. Lacking a functioning civil government, these Serb-controlled UNPA areas
 are effectively under martial law. There is one small paper published weekly or bi-
 weekly in Serbian in the Serb-controlled area of Sector North.
 
 
 838
 There are a few low-powered local radio stations broadcasting from Serb-held ter-
 ritory in some of the UNPA's, and Croat radio and television signals are received
 in these areas as well. The Serbian "TV Krajina," whose studios are in Petrova Gora
 and Knin, broadcast daily. Two other Serbian mobile studios also operate out of Bell
 Manastir and Plitvice.
 Academic freedom is generally respected in Croatia, but ethnic considerations re-
 portedly led to some dismissals of academics of Serbian nationality. A recently en-
 acted university reform law established a revised curriculum and created a govern-
 ment Council for Higher Education. There is apprehension within the academic
 community about the effects of this measure on faculty and programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides that
 all citizens shall be guaranteed the right to peaceful assembly and association for
 the protection of citizens' interests or the promotion of social, economic, political, na-
 tional, cultural, and other convictions and objectives. Citizens may freely form, join,
 and leave political parties, trade unions, and other associations. In practice, the
 rights of peaceful assembly and association are respected in Croatia. Permits are re-
 quired for rallies but are granted routinely.
 During 1993, political parties, refugee associations, womens gups and others
 held peaceful rallies and demonstrations without hindrance or incident. hese rights
 are also granted to other citizens, including members of the Serbian and Muslim
 communities. In Serb-contrlled areas, however, these rights are not respected.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. The Constitution guarantees
 freedom of conscience and religion and free public profession of religious and other
 convictions. All religious communities are equal before the law and separate from
 the State. Religious communities are free to conduct public services and to open and
 run schools andsocial and charitable institutions.
 Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam are the main faiths
 in Croatia. The majority of practicing Croats are Roman Catholic. The Government
 rovides an option of Catholic religious education in schools. There is also an active
 Jewish community in Croatia. The main mosque in Croatia is located in Z.greb,
 where it serves not only as a reliious center but also as a social aid office. There
 are no formal restrictions on religious groups. Croatian Protestants from a number
 of denominations as well as foreign clergy actively practice and proselytize in the
 country.
 Religion was so closely identified with ethnicity that religious institutions contin-
 ued to be targeted. An Orthodox Church in Osijek was dam aged by an explosion.
 The regional governor immediately deplored the attack and p rmisd state financial
 assistance to repair the damages. The Serbian Orthodox cathedral in downtown Za-
 greb remained open, and several other Orthodox churches and monasteries operated
 freely in government-controlled northern Croatia. Although the majority of the Or-
 thodox clergy left at the start of the war in 1991, a few Orthodox priests, most of
 them retired, remained to carry out religious duties.
 Most Catholic churches in the Serian-controlled UNPA's have been destroyed. On
 December 24, the unoccupied residence of the Serbian Orthdox Eparchy in Karlovac
 was blown up. The act was immediately condemned by Cardinal Kuharic, the Cro-
 atian Government, and the public. The identiy of the perpetrators is unknown. An
 investigation continued at year's end.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution states that anyone who is lawfully in Croatia has the
 right freely to move and choose a residence. Citizens have the right to travel abroad,
 to emigrate, and to return home. The right to enter or leave the country may be
 legally restricted under exceptional circumstances, if necessary to protect the legal
 order, health, rights, or freedom of others.
 There are restrictions on freedom of movement for all journalists and all male citi-
 zens from ae 18 through 55, in he cities and areas close to the demarcation lines
 (Osijek, Karlovac, Zadar, and Sisak). The press has reported on such restrictions.
 Journalists, as well as other individuals, must request permission to enter the con-
 flict zones. All males of draft age must also request permission from the local mu-
 nicpality draft board to travel aoroad.
 ee ingovernment imposed no significant restrictions on the movement of refugees,
 displaced persons, or national minorities already resident in Croatia, although there
 were several confirmed instances of refoulement of Muslim refugees. Regulations
 imposed in 1992 limiting the admission of new Bosnian Muslim refugees to those
 wit assured passage to third countries remained technically in effect. In practice,
 however, large nu dbers of new refugees from Bosnia, both Cr t and Muslim, en-
 tered and remained in Croatia in 1993.
 As of October, according to government figures, there were about 246,000 dis-
 placed Crsats in Croatia and a out 278,000 refugees from Bosnia, of whom about
 
 
 839
 190,000 were Muslim and the rest ethnic Croats. Together, the refugees and the dis-
 placed persons number about 520,000, of which 80 percent, approximately 410,000,
 were lodged in private homes, and 20 percent, about 110,000, were in collective fa-
 cilities such as camps, resort hotels, old army barracks, and schools. On the average,
 each day an additional 100 displaced persons and refugees are added, a slight ma-
 jority of whom are Muslims and the rest Croats. An estimated 20,000 to 30,000
 Bosnian Muslim refugees were not registered with the Croatian authorities; they
 were mostly men of draft age.
 There were incidents of harassment and abuse, including clandestine deportations
 by Croatian police into HVO hands, and bombings of Muslim refugee centers, al-
 though these rarely resulted in significant damage. There were allegations that the
 police and other Croatian authorities frequently refused to register newly arrived
 Muslim refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 To refurbish some tourist hotels in Dalmatia which had housed Bosnian Muslim
 refugees for nearly a year, the Government offered some 2,000 of these refugees ei-
 ther settlement in third countries or relocation to facilities elsewhere in Croatia. Ac-
 cording to U.N. observers, many refugees were not happy at having to leave the ho-
 tels, although there were no recorded instances of forcible eviction. Some of them
 resettled abroad, alleging that their departure from Croatia had not been voluntary.
 U.N. officials indicated that none of these refugees were forced to depart Croatia.
 The Government's treatment of Muslim refugees and other Muslims temporarily
 resident in Croatia became an issue as a result of a government investigation and
 raid on certain Middle Eastern relief agencies in Croatia in August. The police dis-
 covered evidence that some persons were involved in activities incompatible with
 their aid work status. This investigation led to the deportation of scores of Bosnian
 and other Muslims, which ended after the Government was criticized for illegally
 deporting refugees.
 On July29, the field staff of the U.N. Special Rapporteur received reports that
 Bosnian refugees in Zagreb, Samobor, Split, Pula, Varazdin, and the island of
 Obonjan were being expelled from Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some 1,500
 refugees were arrested in camps around the country towards the end of July. Almost
 500 were detained for alleged criminal activity, and 120 were deported to Bosnia
 and Herzegovina, in contravention of refugee conventions and commitments made
 by the Government to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. In one verified
 case, the civilian police arrested a large number of refugees in Zagreb. The Croatian
 authorities explained that they were conducting a police operation against "illegal"
 refugees without documents. However, most of those arrested had been previously
 registered by the Croatian authorities, while others had ap ropriate UNHCR docu-
 ments. Fifty-two refugees were taken to the border with ABosnia and Herzegovina
 where they were handed over to the Bosnian Croat (HVO) military police and de-
 tained. The detainees, who were predominantly Muslim, were told that they would
 be exchanged for Croats detained by Bosnian government forces. There were reports
 of abuse and torture in the detention center, as well as dangerous labor on the front
 lines.
 There continued to be isolated incidents of individual expulsions by the Croatian
 police, especially in the area adjacent to Herzegovina. For instance, on August 28,
 a Bosnian Muslim was reportedly arrested by Croatian police in Trogir and handed
 over to the HVO military police, although his documents were in order. In general,
 however, the Government stopped repatriating refugees after the UNHCR and for-
 eign governments, including that of the United States, publicly protested such ac-
 tions.
 In the UNPA's, Serbian threats against the remaining non-Serb population have
 produced a de facto coercive control situation for those people. Practices in the
 UNPA's include strict curfews, prohibition on the movement of clergy, strict limits
 on travel between towns and the front lines, and forced resettlement.
 Despite the establishment of UNPA's in March 1992, the goals of the Vance Plan
 were still not met by the end of 1993. Hostile Serbian elements, sustained by links
 with the Serbian Government in Belgrade, still control over one-fourth of Croatia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Croatia held multi party presidential and parliamentary elections on August 2,
 1992. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of incumbent President Dr. Franjo
 Tudjman won decisively, and he was returned for a 5-year term. The President exer-
 cises considerable power, authority, and influence but constitutionally is limited to
 two terms. In April President Tudjman appointed a new Prime Minister, Nikica
 Valentic, the fifth since the spring of 1990.
 
 
 840
 In elections for the second chamber of the Parliament (the House of Zupanije or
 Parishes), held in February, the HDZ again won a majority of the seats, and five
 other parties also won seats. These elections were generally regarded as free and
 fair. Serbian "authorities" in the UNPA's refused to allow residents to participate
 in these elections, just as they had in the August 1992 balloting.
 "RSK" authorities held elections in the UNPA's in December which neither
 UNPROFOR nor any other international body has recognized as legitimate. There
 were no international or other unbiased observers present, making it difficult to
 judge the degree of freedom in these elections or the presence of fraud. In the key
 December race for the 'RSK" presidency," no candidate reportedly won more than
 50 percent of the vote, so runoff elections were scheduled for January 23, 1994.
 There are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities in the po-
 litical process, but they are represented in small numbers in Parliament, the execu-
 tive branch, and the courts. Six women hold seats in Parliament, including one who
 serves as a vice president of the House of Representatives and two others who lead
 opposition parties.
 The federal election law provides for representation of all minorities in Par-
 liament, with proportional representation guaranteed for any minority that makes
 up more than 8 percent of the population. The Federal Election Commission des-
 igited 13 Serbs to "represent" the Serbian minority, who comprise 11 percent of
 the population. Eight of those 10 were elected as members of the Croatian People's
 Party. The remaining three parliamentarians were members of the Serbian National
 Party, which was constituted to promote the particular interests of Croatia's Serbs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Peace groups in Zagreb, Rijeka, and Osijek worked to prevent forcible evictions
 and other human rights abuses in their respective localities and brought their con-
 cerns to the attention of the local and national authorities. Similar human rights
 groups in Split, however, were harassed and intimidated by local extremists, and
 some of their members had their personal property vandalized or destroyed. A Cro-
 atian Helsinki Committee was formed in 1993, and its members met on several oc-
 casions with government officials to discuss human rights concerns. The Serbian
 Democratic Forum in Zagreb and its affiliate in Rijeka continued to document viola-
 tions of human rights against Serbs in Croatia. Other local human rights non-
 governmental organizations include, for example, the Human Rights Committee of
 the Union of Serbs in Croatia. Both the Serbian National Party (SNS) and the So-
 cial Democratic Union (SDU) have human rights committees. All these have been
 publicly and vociferously critical of the Government on occasion, for example, on the
 subject of alleged ethnic discrimination in the assignment of housing, as well as in
 other areas where they felt human or civil rights were not fully observed.
 Senior government officials, including the President, have met with international
 human rights experts and the local Helsinki human rights group. The Government
 cooperated in the excavation of suspected mass graves of Serbian victims of atroc-
 ities and in discussions of the treatment of Muslim refugees in Croatia. The Par-
 liament's Human Rights Committee also actively considered human rights and other
 social issues. The Committee Chairman has defined the Committee's role as that of
 "analyzing legislative proposals for their democratic content before they are pre-
 sented for legislative approval." The Committee, for example, was instrumental in
 building into the new law on registration of political parties criteria demanding that
 any new groups seeking registration show they are founded on "democratic values."
 It has also examined in detail allegations that evictions from state-owned housing
 were based on ethnic considerations. The Chairman also told the press earlier in
 1993 that like the UNHRC itself, his committee's mandate did not extend to consid-
 eration oF' individual cases of alleged human rights abuse, although, he said, more
 than 300 requests for such investigations had reached the Committee since its
 founding in November 1992.
 Serbian "authorities" in the UNPA's continued to obstruct investigations into al-
 leged violations of human rights by their forces. In one egregious incident, Serbs
 prevented the excavation of the suspected mass grave at Ovcara by a team of Unit-
 ed Nations experts.
 When refugees were arbitrarily arrested and held for repatriation during the sum-
 mer, U.N. officials were initially denied access to those arrested (see Section 2.d.)
 In areas where fighting or military operations were taking place, both Croatian
 and Serbian forces denied access to international observers, although the field staff
 of the Special Rapporteur was able to monitor human rights violations both in areas
 under Croatian government control and those controlledby the Serbs.
 
 
 841
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that all citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that members of all nations and minorities shall have equal rights in Croatia. One
 article provides for special "wartime measures" but states that restrictions shall be
 appropriate to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of citi-
 zens in respect of race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social origin.
 Women.-Violence against women reportedly increased in 1993. In general, it was
 part of the larger picture of increasing societal and family tensions as a result of
 economic disruptions and the unsettling effect of the continued conflict in occupied
 areas of Croatia. Women (and children) were especially subjected to violence at the
 hands of men, including demobilized soldiers, acting out their frustrations and
 stresses. Womens' groups, however, are devoting more attention to this issue, but
 there are social inhibitions against making "family" issues a subject for the courts.
 A center for the psychological and medical care of abused women was founded in
 Varazdin for 30 women and their families. A similar center was scheduled to be
 opened in Makarska, Dalmatia. A center for urgent psychiatric and medical aid for
 the victims of abuse was opened in Zagreb's Medvescak Medical Center and includes
 a 24-hour "hot line" which reportedly is well used. The French humanitarian organi-
 zation "Medecins du Monde" will also finance a program in Croatia for abused moth-
 ers and their children.
 The Croatian health service reportedly has established new, special protocols to
 insure comprehensive and effective treatment of female victims of rape, spousal
 abuse or other violence which apply both to hospitals and to outpatient clinics
 throughout the Republic. There are a number of other centers and programs offering
 psychological and medical care for abused women and others who have been trau-
 matized or tortured in the course of the war, offered both by local institutions, vol-
 untary agencies, and international organizations. The list of agencies that are part
 of a working group for social services and psychosocial services for those affected
 by the war has some 48 entries, including the 'Society for Psychological Assistance,"
 "Women's Help Now," "Evangelische Frauenarbeit," "The Center for Women War
 Victims," "Marie Stopes International," and "Biser." In November Tresnjevka
 opened its center to assist abused women.
 Women do not face legal barriers or discrimination in inheritance, marriage, fam-
 ily laws, and property rights.
 Gender-based support groups are relatively new, but Zagreb and several other
 large cities have started family crisis associations. An association of the "Women of
 Vukovar," who have missing relatives from the war in the east, and "Mothers for
 Peace" are active and operate without hindrance.
 Spousal abuse is present in Croatian society and is a subject of considerable pub-
 lic interest, freely discussed. One of the more popular late-night call-in radio pro-
 grams here, for example, frequently features abused spouses (or their neighbors)
 calling in to present their problems. Local newspapers in late 1993 reported in de-
 tail the case of the wife of one of President Tudjman's physicians, who divorced her
 husband following a beating so severe that several of her ribs were broken. The p-
 lice reportedly respond willingly to calls from neighbors regarding domestic dis-
 putes, for example if the neighbors indicate the likelihood that physical harm will
 occur. A well-established procedure for prosecuting cases of spousal abuse exists and
 is apparently effectively used, with the usual result being payment of large damages
 by the abusing spouse.
 Educational and job opportunities are generally available without regard to sex.
 Mothers are entitled to special protection at work. "Special protection" means em-
 ployed mothers whose children become ill may, upon presentation of a doctors cer-
 tificate to that effect, take paid leave (not counted against their own vacation time)
 to care for the sick child. Working mothers receive 180 days of paid leave after the
 birth of a child and may take up to an additional 30 months of unpaid leave without
 jeopardy to their employment. Prgnant women, mothers of handicapped children,
 and nursing mothers cannot be transferred to other work without their consent.
 Mothers of handicapped children also have the right to work only half-time (at half-
 pay, however) without jeopardizing their employment. All these provisions are well
 established, accepted by employers, and routinely observed.
 Childrcn.-There is no documented pattern of societal abuse or discrimination
 against children. Schools provide free meals for children. Day nurseries are avail-
 able in most communitites even for infants and, while their primary purpose is to
 support working single-parent mothers, they also provide an early education and so-
 cietal base for the children. Medical care for children is free, as are prescription
 
 
 842
 medications. They receive obligatory periodic medical examinations without charge.
 Children younger than 15 years are prohibited from employment and, as noted in
 Section 6 d safeguards app to the employment of children above that age.
 National/RaciallEthni Minorities.--Other sections of this report address serious
 human rights abuses suffered by persons based on their nationality, including cases
 of government abuse of ethnic Serbs.
 Constitutionally, Croatian Serbs enjoyed the same protection as other self-identi-
 fied ethnic groups in the country. In practice, however, there continued to be ever-
 present, subtle, and sometimes open discrimination against Serbs in such areas as
 the administration of justice, employment, housing, and the free exercise of their
 cultural rights.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur received several reports of the killing of Serbs and
 allegations that the Croatian authorities failed to conduct a proper investigation or
 to prosecute those responsible. For instance, it was reported that an elderly Serb
 woman was murdered and mutilated in her apartment in Sisak on July 30. Thepo-
 lice did not conduct a full investigation nor inform the family of any results. The
 neighbors of the victim were afraid to disclose information about the identity of the
 perpetrators, especially after the police approached them. There are credible reports
 of organized Croatian gangs such as the so-called Black Legions, which single out
 Serbian civilians for criminal attacks.
 Government sources report criminal proceedings were initiated against 126 per-
 sons of Croatian ethnic origin, 13 ethnic Serbs, and 8 persons from othe ethnic
 groups. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur stated that the authorities have not
 demonstrated a serious willingness to suppress such acts.
 In 1993 the police force was made up almost exclusively of ethnic Croats. The vast
 majority of cases involving violence against Serbs and mistreatment of Serbian pris-
 oners went unpunished. Meanwhile, the Government filed thousands of criminal
 charges against Serbs accused of "war crimes."
 The founder of the Serbian National Party, Milan Dukic, claimed that one of the
 main problems was that the Croatian and Serbian communities saw each other in
 terms of negative stereotypes fostered by media and nationalists on both sides.
 Criticism continued of the Government's performance in issuing citizenship pa-
 pers, new passports, and residence permits. The Interior Minister insisted that
 there had been no discrimination based on nationality in the processing of 550,000
 applications for Croatian citizenship. However, many who are not ethnic Croats felt
 that the delay in processing their cases or the refusal to grant them citizenship was
 due to discrimination. There were credible reports that citizenship applications of
 persons not born in Croatia, or who held significant positions in such federal institu-
 tions as the JNA, were occasionally delayed or refused for reasons of nationality.
 Foreigners and stateless persons may obtain asylum, unless it is sought in connec-
 tion with the commission of criminal offenses or violations of international law.
 Article 30 of the Law on Citizenship defines a "Croatian citizen" as "a person who
 has acquired this status according to the laws valid until the taking effect of this
 Law." The previous laws on citizenship, valid when Croatia was part of the SFRY,
 provided for "republic citizenship" of the "Socialist Republic of Croatia," but, accord-
 ing to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, republic citizenship within the SFRY was essen-
 tially symbolic and had little or no legal effect. SFRY law provided that Yugoslav
 citizens enjoyed the same rights and duties throughout the republics, without re-
 gard to republic in which they had citizenship. Furthermore. republic citizenship did
 not necessarily coincide with the republic in which an individual was born or en-
 joyed permanent residence, even if that person had always been domiciled in the
 republic.
 Thus, the Croatian Law on Citizenship had the effect of arbitrarily relegating to
 the status of aliens all those SFRY citizens who enjoyed lawful residence in the So-
 cialist Republic of Croatia but who did not enjoy Croatian republic citizenship. An
 exception was made, however, for those deemed to be members of the "Croatian peo-
 gle." Such ethnic Croats who were not Croatian citizens under the SFRY laws would
 e accorded Croatian citizenship if they submitted a written statement that they
 considered themselves Croatian citizens. This exemption was available not only for
 Croats who had registered places of residence in Croatia but also for members of
 the "Croatian people" who did not have a place of residence in the Republic of Cro-
 atia or did not have previous SFRY citizenship. Those who do not belong to the
 "Croatian people" must satisfy more stringent requirements through naturalization
 in order to obtain citizenship, even if they previously were lawful residents as SFRY
 citizens in Croatia.
 According to government sources, as of May 12, citizenship had been denied to
 12,708 applicants, 7,500 of whom were ethnic Serbs. The U.N. Special Rapporteur
 reported several cases of procedural obstruction in which the relevant authorities
 
 
 843
 refused even to consider applications, almost always on the basis of the ethnic origin
 of the applicant. Another cause for concern related by the Special Rapperteur was
 that, while an application for citizenship is pending, the applicant is considered an
 alien, even if that person previously enjoyed lawful residence in Croatia as a SFRY
 citizen, and is consequently denied rights such as social allowances, including medi-
 cal care, pensions, free education, and employment in the civil service. In practice,
 since the applicatuon procedure may take a considerable time, many applicants
 have been forced to leave Croatia because of financial pressure.
 The leader of the Serbian National Party complained that citizenship documents
 were not being granted as quickly to Serbs as to others. He also alleged that 200
 Serbs who worked in the Zagreb city administration were fired in 1 day under the
 pretext of 'rationalization."
 A delegation of Gypsies complained that local shops discriminated against them,
 some snack bars refused to serve them, and the police did not adequately inves-
 tigate their complaints. The Stranke Roma Hrvatske (Croatian Gypsy Party) in Za-
 greb reports there are currently about 120,000 persons officially registered as Gyp-
 sies who are resident in Croatia but say the actual figure for Gypsy residents is
 probably closer to 250,000 to 300,000 because "many simply do not bother to reg-
 ister." They say there is a "large" number of Bosnian Gypsy refugees in Croatia but
 the numbers are very difficult to estimate since the Gypsy population is so fluid.
 A great many Bosnian refugee Gypsies, for example, have continued to move on-
 ward to relatives in Hungary, Romania, or elsewhere.
 Religious Minorities.--Serious human rights abuses perpetrated against Muslims
 are addressed in other sections of this report.
 According to the 1991 census, 43,469 persons, 0.9 percent of the population of Cro-
 atia, identified themselvesd as Muslims. The largest concentrations were in Zagreb,
 where the 13,100 Muslims comprised 1.4 percent of the population, and in Rijeka,
 where 13,340 Muslims comprised 2.3 percent of the population. The largest percent-
 age was in Dubrovnik, where 2,866 Muslims comprised 4 percent of the population.
 The massive influx of refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina into Croatia since the
 war significantly increased the number of Muslims.
 Since the intensification of hostilities between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian govern-
 ment forces in April, the Croatian media regularly refer to Muslims as "aggressors."
 Coverage of atrocities committed in the conflict between the two groups appeared
 to be selective and one-sided, with little regard for the truth. At the same time inci-
 dents of discrimination and violence against Muslims in Croatia were rareiy re-
 ported in the press.
 On the Dalmatian coast, Muslim clerics and others in a position of authority were
 repeatedly harassed and threatened by local police and other authorities. In
 Dubrovnik, Split, and Zagreb, as well as other areas, shops and homes belonging
 to Muslims were reportedly damaged or destroyed, with little police response.
 There were reports that many Muslims were denied citizenship, although they
 were either born in Croatia or had lawful residence there for several years. In the
 villages of Rajevo Selo and Gunja near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, al-
 most 200 Muslims were reportedly denied citizenship. The United Nations verified
 many cases in which some members of a family were arbitrarily denied citizenship
 while others were not.
 People with Disabilities.-People with disabilities face few legal discriminatory
 measures. Education and job opportunites generally are available to them The seri-
 ous war-related injuries of increasing numbers of combat veterans have attracted
 growing attention to their needs. Although no specific legislation has mandated ac-
 cessibility for the handicapped, there is a growing social awareness of this issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except military and police personnel,
 are entitled to form or join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization.
 There is an active labor movement in Croatia with three national labor federations
 and independent associations of both blue-collar and white-collar members. In gen-
 eral, unions are independent of the Government and political parties.
 The right to strike is guaranteed in the Constitution and is limited only in the
 armed forces, police, government administration, and public services. Strikes by
 railroad workers, teachers, textile workers, and others occurred with increasing fre-
 quency during 1993, largely over the repeated failure of government-owned or gov-
 ernment-run institutions or industries to pay wages on time. For example, railroad
 workers received paychecks from 1 to 2 weeks late throughout the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely in Croatia. Because of the inflation problem and
 in reaction to newly introduced government austerity measures, the major public
 
 
 service unions found themselves engaged throughout 1993 in lengthy negotiations
 with the Government over wages and job security. Like fellow unionists, the federa-
 tions found that the Government was regularly late in meeting its payroll and in
 ensuringpayment of minimum wages.
 Many Croatian enterprises remain "socially owned," a condition of blurred owner-
 ship and managerial responsibilities which is a legacy of Socialist Yugoslavia. In the
 current transition to privatization and a free market economy, the unions are under
 pressure due to job losses, general unemployment in a weakened economy, and their
 own struggle to become genuine free trade unions.
 There is no formal body of law or practice dealing directly with antiunion dis-
 crimination issues.
 There are no export processing zones in Croatia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory work is con-
 stitutionally forbidden. There were no documented instances of coerced or forced
 labor. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is the agency charged with enforc-
 ing the constitutional ban on coerced or forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for youth em-
 ployment is 15 and is enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Under
 the Constitution, children may not be employed before reaching the legslly deter-
 mined age, nor may they be forced or allowed to do work that is harndul to their
 health or morality. Workers under 18 are entitled to special protection at work and
 are prohibited from heavy manual labor. Education is mandatory up to age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are national minimum wage standards.
 Public service unions are pacesetters for the rest of the work force, and they were
 in the forefront of continued efforts to encourage the Government to honor its com-
 mitments. The current minimum gross monthly wage in Croatia in December was
 roughly $96 (635,910 dinars). National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek,
 overtime pay, a half-hour daily break, and a minimum of 18 days of paid vacation
 annually. It is standard practice to provide a 24-hour rest period during the work-
 week.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Government and enforced by the Min-
 istry of Health. In practice, industries are not diligent in meeting standards for
 worker protection.
