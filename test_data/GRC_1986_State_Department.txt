 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically elected
 Parliament. The party or coalition of parties with a
 parliamentary majority names the Prime Minister and forms the
 Government. Several political parties vigorously and freely
 contest periodic parliamentary and municipal elections, the
 most recent of which were municipal elections in October
 1986. The President of the Republic, who serves as Head of
 State, is elected by Parliament.
 The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch of
 government and Parliament and operates within a civil law
 framework with precedents from Roman law and French and German
 sources. Police practices respect detainees' rights.
 A member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified as a developed country by United Nations
 standards. It has a tradition of state intervention in the
 economy and currently faces serious economic problems which
 are intensified by a bloated public sector.
 The full range of universally acknowledged human rights is
 guaranteed by the Constitution, which includes many of the
 provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. Greece ratified the European Convention on
 Human Rights in 1974, and in 1985 it recognized for a period
 of 3 years the competence of the European Commission on Human
 Rights to accept petitions from individual Greeks who wish to
 appeal human rights cases.
 The Government, many of whose members suffered abuses during
 the period of rule by a military junta (1967-74), is sensitive
 to the protection of individual freedoms. Most allegations of
 abuse fall in-the area of religious expression, which,
 however, is guaranteed within certain limits by the
 Constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no reports of politically motivated killing by
 government forces. The physical security of the individual is
 generally assured in Greece. Nevertheless, politically
 motivated terrorist acts have claimed a number of lives in
 recent years. In April 1986, the domestic terrorist group
 "November 17," whose earlier victims included U.S. and Greek
 officials, claimed responsibility for the assassination of
 Greek industrialist Dimitrios Angelopoulos. On June 9, Khalid
 Ahmed Nazal, a high-ranking member of the Democratic Front for
 the Liberation of Palestine, was killed by a gunman whose
 political affiliation is unknown.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrest, or
 clandestine detention.
 
 
 933
 GREECE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Since 1984, Greece has had legislation
 making the use of torture an offense punishable by sentences
 ranging from 3 years to life imprisonment. There were no
 reports of torture.
 Prison and detention facilities provide adequate health care
 and diet. No distinction according to social class, race,
 sex, religion, or type of conviction is made in the treatment
 of prisoners. Cases requiring medical treatment receive
 special attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited
 by family members 3 times per week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, and this provision is respected in practice.
 Preventive detention does not exist in Greece. A person
 arrested on a warrant or while committing a crime must be
 brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours and
 charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment
 or order the release of the detainee within 3 days of the
 examination unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit.
 The Constitution further states that the maximum duration of
 detention pending trial may not exceed a period of 1 year in
 the case of felonies or 6 months in the case of misdemeanors.
 A decision of a judicial council is required to extend these
 maximum durations (by 6 or 3 months, respectively) in
 exceptional cases. In practice, trials generally take place
 within 4 months of the submission of charges.
 Persons who have been arrested may petition a judicial council
 for release pending trial. The council is required by law to
 consider petitions within 5 days, but the limit is sometimes
 exceeded in practice. Release is granted only in special
 circumstances, e.g., for reasons of ill health, the standing
 of the individual in the community, or when it is unlikely
 that the individual will become a fugitive. The council may
 also impose other conditions, such as posting of a bond.
 Exile as a judicial remedy or government practice does not
 occur in Greece.
 The Constitution expressly prohibits forced labor, and no
 violations are known to have occurred in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 provided in practice. Defense lawyers are available to all
 accused. Court sessions are public unless, as provided in the
 Constitution, the court decides that privacy is required for
 the protection of victims, when juveniles or morals offenses
 are involved, or in matters of national security. The latter
 provision is not abused. A legal provision permits a closed
 hearing for the sensitive portion of cases dealing with public
 order. In such instances the court must publicly pronounce
 its "reasoned decision" on the matters heard privately. A
 defendant may appeal a court verdict to an appeals court.
 
 
 934
 GREECE
 Military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.  A 1983
 case involving the trial and sentencing of a U.S. serviceman,
 which did not meet standards of due process set forth in the
 applicable Status of Forces Agreement, is still under review
 by Greek authorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life is guaranteed by the Constitution. -
 No house search may be made except in conformance with
 specified legal standards and always in the presence of
 representatives of the judiciary. Warrants, issued by a
 district attorney (who is considered a judicial officer in
 Greece), are required for an official to enter a private
 home. These constitutional guarantees are respected in
 practice. A constitutional provision requires punishment and
 "liability for full damages to the sufferer" for violations of
 the sanctity of the home and for the abuse of power. The
 Constitution further guarantees privacy of correspondence and
 communication. No government abuses were reported in 1986,
 and private infractions were prosecuted by the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of the press and prohibits
 censorship. Opposition viewpoints are constantly presented in
 the active Greek press, and criticism of the Government is
 unhampered. Greece's television and radio stations are
 government owned and operated. The political opposition (both
 conservative and Communist) asserts that news and information
 programing reflects the political perspective of the governing
 party while its own views are neglected. The government
 response is that television is more open to the opposition
 than it was under the previous conservative government.
 During national elections, television time is given to all
 major political parties according to their electoral strength.
 The Constitution allows for seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the President, offend
 religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate a
 violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose
 military and defense information. No periodicals or
 newspapers are known to have been seized in 1986. Greece has
 strict libel laws. Violations of these laws are prosecuted
 under established legal procedures with the safeguards of due
 process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly-is guaranteed by the Constitution.  Limits
 may be imposed on outdoor public meetings, however, if police
 authorities determine that a serious disturbance of social and
 economic life is threatened. A few demonstrations by small
 extremist groups were prohibited in 1986 following such
 determinations.
 The right of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Workers and employers are free to
 
 
 GREECE
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing without
 previous authorization, to draw up their own constitutions and
 rules, elect their representatives, and formulate their
 programs. They are also free to join in confederations and
 affiliate with international organizations. In 1985 an
 estimated 35 percent of Greek wage and salary earners were
 organized in unions. Both employer and trade union
 organizations maintain relations with the International Labor
 Organization. Trade union and employer organizations are
 protected against dissolution by administrative authority.
 The right to strike is guaranteed by the Constitution and by
 statute to both public and private sector workers. Exceptions
 are made for judiciary functionaries and those serving in the
 security services, who are prohibited from striking. Other
 employees of the State or public corporations, whose operation
 is of vital importance in serving the needs of the society,
 may strike only after 4 days' prior notice to their employer,
 the relevant ministry, and the Ministry of Labor. Striking
 trade unions in such categories are required to supply the
 necessary staff to meet the essential requirements of the
 population during the strike. In 1984 the Government
 established procedures which place greater restrictions on the
 rights of public sector unions to strike. Although these
 restrictions are still criticized in some quarters, they have
 neither been enforced nor challenged in the courts. Civil
 mobilization legislation, which allows the Government to
 mobilize striking public sector workers it considers vital to
 the economy, has been questioned on constitutional grounds.
 The civil mobilization and ultimate dismissals of Olympic
 Airways flight personnel in 1986 for violating the law brought
 some international protests, but the courts upheld the
 Government's enforcement of the law.
 The main political parties in Greece maintain trade union
 affiliates, and most Greek trade unionists belong to or
 support one of those affiliates. In general, the trade union
 affiliates follow the guidance of their respective political
 parties. The Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) is
 currently controlled by PASKE (the governing Socialist Party's
 labor arm). Opposition labor factions boycotted or walked out
 of the GSEE congress in April 1986 and have charged--both
 domestically and in international forums--that the present
 administration is illegal. This charge has not been sustained
 by the courts.
 All Greek wage earners by law contribute 0.25 percent of their
 basic wage to a Ministry of Labor organ known as the Workers'
 Hearth. Employers make a matching contribution. The Workers'
 Hearth uses this fund to finance trade union activities,
 apportioning funds to the unions in accordance with membership
 figures. The Minister of Labor has discretionary control over
 8 percent of these funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits
 discriminatory practices against religious minorities, which
 in Greece include small communities of Muslims, Jews, and
 non-Orthodox Christians.
 The Constitution, nevertheless, establishes the Eastern
 Orthodox Church of Christ as the "prevailing" religion of
 Greece. In addition, it prohibits proselytizing by any
 religious group and bars exemptions for individuals from
 
 
 GREECE
 discharging their duties to the State (i.e., military service)
 by reason of their religious convictions. As a result of
 these provisions, certain non-Orthodox religious groups,
 particularly evangelical sects, have encountered significant
 difficulties of a legal or administrative nature.
 In the past, the constitutional prohibition on proselytizing
 led primarily to the prosecution of Jehovah's Witnesses,
 although other non-Orthodox religious groups were also
 affected. The courts have recently held, however, that simple
 distribution of literature does not constitute
 "proselytizing," thereby sharply reducing the number of
 arrests. In May 1986, an appeals court overturned the
 December 1984 sentences of three Protestant missionaries
 convicted of proselytizing and causing involuntary abandonment
 of home by a minor. In December 1986, the courts also
 convicted two local religious leaders who had attempted to
 prevent the distribution of religious materials by Jehovah's
 Witnesses.
 Non-Orthodox religious groups have experienced difficulties as
 well in obtaining permits for the construction of places of
 worship. A building permit must be obtained from the Ministry
 of Education and Religion, which, in turn, must consider the
 opinion of the Eastern Orthodox hierarchy. In the past, some
 evangelical religious groups have been denied such permits.
 These groups have then unsuccessfully appealed the
 Government's decision in the courts.
 The Constitution includes the provision that "no person shall
 be exempt from discharging his obligations to the State or may
 refuse to comply with the laws by reason of his religious
 convictions." Those persons most affected have been Jehovah's
 Witnesses who refuse on religious grounds to fulfill their
 military service obligation. In deference to them, the
 Government in 1979 modified the compulsory military service
 law to provide for alternative, noncombatant military
 service. Those refusing this alternative are tried by
 military courts and sentenced to military prison for a period
 twice that of normal service. Currently, a portion of this
 sentence may be served in a civilian minimum security prison
 (frequently agricultural) where each day served is credited as
 2 days toward fulfillment of the sentence. Referring to an
 unpublished report, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that
 between 1973 and September 1985, 776 Jehovah's Witnesses were
 prosecuted for refusing to fulfill their military obligation;
 Amnesty International reports that in 1985 some 283 of these
 were in prison.
 The Muslim minority of approximately 120,000, made up largely
 of ethnic Turks but also including Pomaks and some Gypsies, is
 principally located in Thrace in northeastern Greece. There
 are over 250 mosques in Greece. Citing a 1920 law, Muslims
 have disagreed with the manner of appointment in December 1985
 of a new religious leader (mufti) in one of the Muslim
 communities in Thrace. Greek authorities contend that this
 law has long been invalid and that all Muslim religious
 leaders, including the new mufti, have always been selected
 according to a method dating back to 1923, the date of the
 Treaty of Lausanne between Turkey and the Allied Powers.
 Under this system, the Government consults with Muslim leaders
 and then appoints the mufti from a list of qualified
 candidates.

 GREECE
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. This right is
 generally respected in practice. Persons intending to
 emigrate and those returning to Greece experience no
 discrimination. The Greek citizenship code authorizes
 expatriation of a citizen who is residing abroad with no
 intention of returning to Greece. Some Greek Muslims have
 alleged that their Greek citizenship was revoked while they
 were staying in Turkey. The Government states that the
 provision has been used very sparingly, and only after it has
 been determined that the citizen in question has severed
 material ties with Greece and established a permanent
 residence elsewhere.
 Some Greek Muslims have complained that they are issued
 passports valid only for 1 year instead of the normal 5-year
 period. Greek authorities state that this was the practice
 for a 6-month period, from January to June 1986, in an effort
 to control abuses by Greek citizens who stay abroad beyond the
 validity date of their regular passports and return without
 renewing their passport abroad at a Greek embassy or consulate
 as they should. According to Greek officials, the practice
 proved impractical and was discontinued.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 officials governing them. The opposition parties function
 freely, have access to the media, and hold public meetings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both the Constitution and the revised family law guarantee
 women the same individual, political, and social rights as
 men. Women leaders play a minority role in the political life
 of the country, with 11 women in the 300-member Parliament, 1
 woman minister and 2 deputy ministers in the Cabinet, and 5
 women out of the 51 regional governors. The position of women
 in Greek society has undergone rapid change in conjunction
 with the process of industrialization and modernization, with
 increasing proportions joining the salaried labor force. The
 Government has given concerted attention to the role of women,
 has instituted significant reforms in marriage, divorce, and
 property laws, and has expanded services to women in
 unemployment, family planning, and child care.
 The Treaty of Lausanne includes provisions relating to the
 educational and political rights of the Muslim minority, who
 are Greek citizens. Two Muslim members serve in the national
 Parliament. A Muslim political party was formed in 1985, and
 
 
 938
 GREECE
 its candidates ran in nationwide elections. Many villages in
 Thrace regularly elect Muslim mayors.
 Members of the Muslim community and Turkish-Muslim
 organizations located outside Greece have complained that
 Turkish-language teaching materials imported from Turkey are
 vetted by Greek officials, as are Turkish teachers assigned to
 Muslim schools. The Greek Government states that educational
 materials and teachers are examined to ensure they meet Greek
 standards, according to the terms of a 1968 reciprocal
 agreement with Turkey. Muslim leaders have also complained
 that Muslims are not allowed to purchase land from
 non-Muslims. Greek officials maintain that there is no
 impediment to the Muslim right to purchase land, and that
 purchases have been made.
 Tensions between Greece and Turkey have made each country's
 perception of the treatment of its coreligionists in the other
 country a highly emotional issue, and both countries have
 viewed human rights questions in the light of historical and
 political differences. There is no evidence, however, of a
 generalized pattern of official political, religious, or
 cultural repression of the Muslim community or a deliberate
 policy of discrimination by the Greek government.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for work in industry is 15. However,
 legislation and regulations provide higher minimum ages for
 work in specified areas or specific jobs, For example, those
 performing loading or unloading work must be at least 18 years
 of age, while workers for the ports of Piraeus and
 Thessaloniki must be 21.
 The minimum daily wage as of September 1, 1986 was
 approximately $12.50. The workweek is 40 hours in the private
 sector and 37.5 hours in the public sector. Minimum standards
 of occupational health and safety are provided for by
 legislation.
