 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 General Andre Dieudonne" Kolingba has headed the Government
 since his accession to power in h bloodless coup on September
 1, 1981. He holds all political power and is the final
 arbiter on all government matterz, but he has permitted some
 increased.popular- part~icipation in the political process,
 particularly on local quez-ions. In 1986 President Kolingba
 announced plans -for the creation of a single national
 political party--the Central African Democratic Assembly
 (RDC). Later that year, he introduced a new Constitution
 which was.subsequently approved in a national referendum on
 November 21, 1986. He was also elected to a 6-year term as
 President in that vote. The new Constitution provides for a
 bicameral Parliament which includes a National Assembly and an
 Economic and Regional Council, representing the principal
 economic and regional sectors of the country. General
 elections were held.on July 31,.1987 for the 52 seats in the
 National Assembly. One-half of the.delegates of the Economic
 and Regional Council will be selected by the President, while
 the other half will be elected by the members of the National
 Assembly.
 The Minister of Interior is in charge of the civilian police
 force.(gendarmerie). -These police normally man barriers on
 the major roads and keep records of.the movement of vehicles.
 The Prpsidency has its own security force, which has
 collateral responsibility with the border police for airport
 security. The Ministry of Defense also has a military police
 force (gendarmarie national), in addition to the armed forces
 which number about 3,800 soldiers.
 The Centr4l African Republic is a poor, landlocked, and
 sparsely p6pulated country. Most ofrits inhabitants derive
 their livelihood from subsistence-agiiculture. Only about 1
 percent of the population is university educated. The
 essentiolly frpe enterprise, agrarian economy, one of the
 world's, Jeast monetized, has suffered in the past from
 inadequately coordinated and implemented govegmnent policies,
 occasional diought, and a poorly trained work korce.
 Expatriates. dpminate the small manufacturing and commercial
 sectors Qf the economy.
 There was some.improvement in the human rights situation in
 1987. In particular, the 7-month trial of former emperor
 Jean-Bedel Bokapsa in..a civilian court dominated the 1987
 headlines. Bokassa,.who received the death sentence, had four
 defense lawyers--two Central African and two French--and was
 given ample time for preparing his defense, calling and
 cross-examining w tnesses, and presenting his version of
 events in open sessions. The trial was fully reported in the
 local news media, including full television replays each
 evening, and in the international press. This long trial set
 a precedent in Africa in recording abuses of limitless power.
 At the end of 1987, the Supreme Court was reviewing technical
 aspects of. the trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were noreports of killing or summary executions for
 political motives by government forces. However, the
 
 
 52
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Government again faced sporadic challenges from dissidents in
 the northwest corner of the country, although at a much
 reduced level from previous years. In the action, the army
 reportedly killed two rebels near Paoua in May, and guerrillas
 killed a village mayor from the same region in late July.
 Some reports allege that the two dissidents killed near Paoua
 might have been attempting to negotiate a surrender. In the
 northeast, Central African military forces ambushed a large
 band of "poachers" in May, killing some and arresting others.
 Also in this region a dissident group killed a gendarmerie
 commander from Birao in a shoot-out in March.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The penal code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against persons guilty of physical abuse. There are
 infrequent reports of beatings in prisons, where conditions
 are generally harsh and medical attention is sometimes
 inadequate. However, family members, legal counsel, doctors,
 and clergy generally have access to prisoners. It is not
 uncommon for selected prisoners, including prominent political
 detainees, to receive special privileges, including permission
 to leave the prison periodically.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 In the past, the Government has frequently detained suspected
 opponents without charge or trial. In 1986 according to
 Amnesty International's 1987 report, "few arrests of
 opposition political party supporters were reported in
 comparison to previous years." This trend continued in 1987.
 While some political detainees were still being held at the
 end of 1987, it is difficult to say precisely how many.
 Under local law, political detainees can be held without
 charge for as long as 2 months, but at that point detainees
 must either be formally charged or released. If they are
 charged, local judicial procedures (which are modeled on
 French procedures) allow for open-ended preventive detention
 while the public prosecutor prepares the State's case against
 the accused. In practice, some political detainees are held
 much longer than 2 months without formal charges being brought
 against them. In the case of common criminals, the law
 requires that they be brought within 96 hours before a
 magistrate who decides whether formal charges will be filed.
 Approximately five well-known political opponents live in
 exile. Several of them have been sentenced to death in
 absentia for crimes against the State.
 Thq Government has been cited by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) for being in violation of ILO Conventions
 29 and 105 for allegedly imposing compulsory labor on prisoners
 jailed for unauthorized political activities. However, the
 ILO case dates back to the early 1980's, and there are no
 reports since then of political prisoners being forced to
 perform compulsory labor. There is a local penal practice
 called "corvee," which administratively (and virtually
 automatically) sentences men without proper identification
 papers to 2 days' labor--usually cl-earing roadside weeds.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In most cases involving common criminals, the Government
 permits French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and
 openly applied and the laws to be properly executed. The new
 Constitution continues the provisions of the constitutional
 decree of September 21, 1985, which states that the judiciary
 "is guaranteed independence (from) the legislative and
 executive (power)." However, the President is the guarantor
 of that independence, notably in his role as "President of the
 Supreme Magistrative Council."
 A Special Tribunal comprising civilian magistrates and
 military advisers adjudicates political cases. The Special
 Tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that there is no
 appeal process although the possibility of presidential
 clemency does exist. Trials must be specifically authorized
 by the President. Political detainees have a right to legal
 counsel at all stages in the formal procedures before the
 Special Tribunal. Trials are open to the public, and the
 proceedings are often reported in the local media. President
 Kolingba has authorized the meeting of the Special Tribunal on
 a fairly frequent basis.
 On October 23, 1986, former emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa
 unexpectedly returned'-to the Central African Republic frod his
 exile in France. Bbkassa, who'was sentenced 'to death in
 abseneii'n 'f980 'fr crimes including mu'ider, cannibalism, and
 embezzlement, was imnediately detained on his return.
 Subsequently the 1980 verdict was annulled, and he was retried
 in the Bangui Criminal Couft. Of the-14 charges-igainst him,
 he was found guilty of 4--complicity in assassination,-arrest
 and imprisonmet of '-dhildren,, arbiirary, arrest and'
 sequestration, 'arid diversion %6f -ptlic funds and goods--and
 sentenced to d6ath- At the ehd  bf 1987, 'ihe proceedings were
 undeigddrfg judicial review b 'the Supreme Court, which has the
 right to overt'urn the    - edit If- echnical flaws are found in
 the triaf. fackibg that, -oily~residebtial clemency remains
 as a meang of changing Ehe -setlence.
 The number of p6litical pri'oners-is unknown. Major Gregoire
 Miango, a prominent political prisoner 4rrested in late 1983
 and released on April 14, 1986, remains restricted to his home
 town, where i   currently residis with his family.
 f. ArbitraryInterference witi Privacy,' Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 With the si~nifi-cant exception of politicalland security
 matters; the Government does not n6rmally interfere in the
 private lives of citizens. The law'f6rmal-ly prohibits the
 invasion of the home without a warrant, and this prohibition
 is not generally abused in civil and minor criminal cases.
 However, if a political crime is involved, Ordinance 81/035,
 which -instituted the 'Special rfibunal, authorizes searches at
 any timeahd af any'jdace. These searches have been conducted
 without specifi b-arrants. There is no forced membership in
 the RDCb-the only legal party.' There is no interference with
 the right to marry or haVe children as one chooses. Parents
 are free to teach their children religious beliefs'and
 practices, with the exception of the Jehovah's Witnesses
 (Section'2.c).

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak publicly about political developments or to
 criticize the Government is circumscribed although most people
 feel free to comment privately on political affairs. The
 Government prohibits the distribution of tracts and literature
 deemed to be subversive. A Central African journalist working
 for the Government, Thomas Kwazo, was sentenced in August to
 prison for an article he filed with a foreign press service,
 without the approval of his supervisor in the Ministry of
 Communication, about an alleged meeting between President
 Kolingba and ex-emperor Bokassa.
 Since July 1, 1986, there has been only one regularly
 published newspaper, which, along with others that appear
 sporadically, is carefully monitored by the Government. Radio
 and television are also controlled by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite Constitutional guarantees of the right to assembly,
 only assemblies of a nonpolitical nature can take place
 without government approval. Government forces quickly
 disband unlawful assemblies and in some instances participants
 have been arrested. Groups that register with the Department
 of the Interior can hold meetings. (Also see Section 3.)
 In May 1981, former President David Dacko suspended the
 General Union of Central African Workers, and no effective
 labor movement has existed in the country since that time.
 The Kolingba Government, which came to power in September of
 that year, never rescinded this suspension. The Government
 tacitly approves of an apolitical labor federation that exists
 mostly on paper and has no collective bargaining authority.
 The ILO has a case pending before it involving the Central
 African Republic's alleged violations of the right to freedom
 of association under ILO Convention 87. The Government has
 yet to provide the substantive information requested by the
 ILO committee reviewing the case.
 The right to strike exists in principle, although fear of
 government reprisals has dampened the enthusiasm of potential
 strikers. In response to a month-long student strike in
 March-April 1986, the Government has banned boycotts of
 classes and all demonstrations by school children and
 university students, except for those authorized by the
 Ministry of the Interior. Those violating this prohibition
 face up to a 3-year prison term.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With one notable exception, the Government does not generally
 interfere with religious activities. Religious organizations
 and missionary groups are provided religious freedom by
 Central African custom. No single religion predominates, nor
 does the Government appear to discriminate in favor of or
 against specific religions.
 There was a major departure from the Government's policy of
 noninterference in religious activities when the Minister of
 the Interior formally prohibited the activities of the
 Jehovah's Witnesses in February 19&6. This decree was aimed
 primarily against the foreign missionary Jehovah's Witnesses
 
 
 55
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 who had refused to participate in government-sponsored
 activities or to encourage allegiance to the Government. As a
 result, most foreign missionary Jehovah's Witnesses have left
 the country, and the four who remain avoid proselytizing,
 limiting their activities to administrative matters.
 Native-born adherents to the sect continue to meet and worship
 and have not experienced official interference for the past
 year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country,
 although there are road checkpoints and periodic civil
 conflict in the north. The right of voluntary travel and
 repatriation is recognized. Financial and educational
 constraints'rather than government controls act to restrict
 most foreign travel and emigration. No case of revocation of
 citizenship was reported in 1987.
 The country remains relatively hospitable to foreigners; the
 largest foreign population living either temporarily or
 permanently in the country is from Chad. Approximately 10,000
 Chadians live in Bangui, where they are generally engaged in
 small commerce, and along the northern border area, where they
 are engaged in farming and cattle herding. Due to the
 increase in political stability in Chad during the past 2
 years, most of the nearly 45,000 Chadian refugees living in
 the Central African Republic in 1984 and 1985 were voluntarily
 repatriated in 1985 and 1986. As of late 1987, the total
 Chadian refugee population in the Central African Republic was
 less than 3,000.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 However, since 1984, Kolingba has progressively reduced the
 military presence in favor of a civilian government, presently
 composed of 18 ministers, 5 secretaries of state, and 5 high
 commissioners. Although in practice he allows his Cabinet
 considerable leeway in the day-to-day activities of government
 administration, he makes all important policy decisions.
 The 1986 Constitution calls for a Parliament consisting of a
 National Assembly and an Economic and Regional Council. For
 the first time since he took power in 1981, Kolingba in 1987
 allowed public and private assembly for political purposes
 when 142 candidates for the newly created National Assembly
 were given 2 weeks to campaign for 52 seats--3 from each of
 the 16 prefectures and 4 from Bangui. Although the candidates
 were vetted by the Ministry of the Interior before they were
 61lowed to run, they were not required to be RDC members, and
 there is no indication any potential candidates were prevented
 for political reasons from running. Election results were
 announced on August 8, 1987 for all but two prefectures.
 While the delay in the northeastern province of Vakaga was due
 to transportation difficulties, voters returned to the polls
 on August 30, 1987 in the Nana-Mambere region as the first
 election was marred by irregularities. The results from these
 two prefectures were announced subsequently.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not welcome international or
 nongovernmental investigation of alleged human rights abuses
 but does not prohibit such investigations. Representatives of
 Amnesty International and the International Committee of the
 Red Cross visit Bangui periodically.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are more than 80 ethnic groups in the Central African
 Republic, each with its own language. About 70 percent are
 Baya-Mandjia and Banda. While President Kolingba appears to
 desire an ethnic balance in his Cabinet, preference for high
 government positions has occasionally been given to members of
 his Yakoma ethnic group (approximately 10 percent of the
 population).
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before
 the law without regard to race, ethnic origin, region, sex, or
 religion. The law notwithstanding, women have traditionally
 been accorded a lower status than men. For example, there is
 less emphasis on the importance of education for women, which
 is reflected in the low literacy level of the adult female
 population (19 percent), as compared with the adult male
 population (49 percent). The requirements of their work at
 home and in the fields prevent many women from receiving any
 formal education.
 Although polygamy is common, the legal system and traditional
 practice support the rights of the wives and all children of
 such marriages. A national women's organization exists and is
 supported by the Government. While there are no women
 ministers, secretaries of state, or high commissioners in the
 Kolingba Government, four women were candidates in the July
 1987 legislative elections.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law. While it is only loosely enforced, jobs are in such
 demand that children in the labor force are generally limited
 to working as helpers in family businesses, such as selling
 food products or cigarettes.
 Minimum wages have been established by the Government, and a
 social security system exists. The minimum wage for a manual
 laborer, for example, is about $40 per month, and about $140
 per month for a stenotypist. However, much labor is performed
 outside the wage and social security system, especially in the
 large subsistence agricultural sector, and probably does not
 meet the established minimum levels. The law sets maximum
 working hours for government employees and most people in the
 private sector at 40 hours per week. Domestic employees may
 work up to 55 hours. There are also general laws of health
 and safety standards in the work place, but they are neither
 precisely defined nor actively enforced.
