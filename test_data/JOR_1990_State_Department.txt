 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a Constitution granting
 the King broad powers. The King forms and dissolves
 governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy. The Prime
 Minister and the Council of Ministers (cabinet) exercise
 considerable responsibility over many issues. The
 Constitution also provides for a bicameral Parliament and an
 independent judiciary. The current lower house of Parliament
 was elected in November 1989 (the upper house is appointed).
 In 1990 the Government suspended most of the provisions of
 martial law which had been in effect in Jordan since the 1967
 war. Under martial law, the General Intelligence Directorate
 (GID) and Public Security Department (PSD) have broad powers
 to monitor segments of the population that they determine
 might pose a threat to the security of the regime. In January
 Prime Minister Hadran said his Government would seek
 legislation to formally end martial law within 4 to 6 months.
 At year's end, Parliament had not finished drafting the
 required legislation. In the meantime, the Government stopped
 implementing most martial law provisions. For example, GID
 certificates of good conduct are no longer required for most
 public sector jobs or for private sector jobs, and private
 groups and organizations do not need GID approval for public
 gatherings and activities.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in
 certain sectors, including communications, transportation, and
 heavy industry. The country has limited natural resources,
 and has traditionally depended upon financial assistance from
 abroad and expatriate remittances. Those revenues fell
 sharply in the late 1980's, contributing to a massive foreign
 debt, government deficits running at more than 25 percent of
 gross domestic product, a service-oriented economy with
 limited export capacity, and a greatly overvalued currency.
 Economic factors precipitated the riots of April 1989 (in
 which 12 persons were killed and 80 injured), following the
 Government's acceptance of International Monetary Fund and
 WorI Bank condittons for assistance in restructuring the
 economy.
 The failure to eliminate martial law entirely, the broad scope
 of police powers, the continuing ban on legally recognized
 political parties, and the denial of the right of citizens to
 change their government remain important human rights
 concerns. Nevertheless, there was further significant
 improvement in the human rights situation in-1990. The
 Government took several significant steps in implementing its
 program of political liberalization, including the release of
 some political detainees, the transfer of jurisdiction over
 several categories of crimes from military to civilian courts,
 the significant easing of restrictions on the press, and the
 elimination of traveI and work restrictions imposed on
 opponents of the Government. The Government also allowed
 numerous groups to organize as de facto political parties. In
 April King Hussein created a commission, whose members
 represent political opinion across the spectrum, to draft a
 National Charter which will be the basis for the future
 social, economic, and political development of the country.
 The King has said the charter will be submitted for approval
 to the people in a referendum, although the exact means of its
 popular consideration is still subject to negotiation. He has
 also indicated that once the charter is approved, the ban on
 political parties will be lifted. In allowing groups to

 organize as de facto political parties, the Government has not
 deniedpermission to any group on political or other grounds.

 problem in recent years, there was no evidence of"such
 ill-treatment or torture durri      .Pisoners may file
 ,complaints of mistreatment with the Ministry of Justice"
 which, with other agencies, will invept 'igate any allegations.
 AJo prisoners heldin the regular prison system are accessible
 to the International.Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which
 regularly inspects such detention facilities. The ICRC does
 not, though, have access to GID headquarters or detention
 facilities under its control.,
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Most persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code, which requires filing of
 formal charges within 48 hours. Persons may then be detained
 pending trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. In addition to
 ordinary crimes, the criminal code is generally applied to
 persons arrested for designated martial law crimes, which
 include espionage, bribery of public officials, trafficking in
 narcotics or weapons, black marketing, and security offenses.
 Security offenses are broadly defined, and some Jordanians,
 specifically members of the military, have reportedly been
 detained without charge and prosecuted in a martial law court
 for nonviolent activities. The only other reports of persons
 being detained without charge or trial are those involved in
 terrorist or subversive activ ities, e.g., members of the
 Palestinian Islamic Jihad. However, since the freezing of
 martial law early in the year, there have been no reports of
 civilians being prosecuted in martial law courts., There is no
 evidence that security forces during 1990 detained persons
 incommunicado. Persons apprehended crossing the border
 illegally are now returned to their country of origin or
 turned over to civilian authorities. In the recent past, such
 persons were detained by the security forces incommunicado or
 with limited outside access.
 The GID can detain a person without trial, for varying
 periods. However, .under martial law provisions, such arrests
 should be approved within a maximum of. 15 days by the Prime
 
 
 1499
 
 JORDAN
 Minister or by local administrators serving as military
 governors. Security detainees may be held without charge for
 indeterminate periods or may be formally charged and brought
 before the martial law court for trial.
 The last group of long-term administrative detainees known to
 be held in Jordan was released in December 1989. In January
 1990, new martial law directives abolished the jurisdiction of
 martial law courts over certain crimes such as violations of
 the law on firearms and ammunition; murder and attempted
 murder for purposes of revenge; murder and other offenses
 against officials because of their functions; violations of
 emergency provisions or orders; and forgeries of currency or
 passports as well as crimes relating to the law on resistance
 to Communism. However, crimes such as drug smuggling,
 membership in illegal organizations, or any other offenses
 against public safety remained under the jurisdiction of the
 martial law court.
 In early 1990 Jordanian authorities said they were considering
 alternatives to administrative detention without charge, such
 as the possibility of providing for judicial review of arrest
 orders and setting time limits for administrative detention
 cases, or eliminating entirely administrative detention
 without charge or trial. Nevertheless, by year's end no such
 action had been taken, and there were reportedly continuing
 instances of persons being detained without charge or trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Since the suspension of most of the provisions of martial law,
 most criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian
 courts. The legal code and the independent selection of
 judges help to assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open
 court, except in a few cases such as those involving sexual
 offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to be represented by counsel, to
 prepare a defense, to cross-examine witnesses, and to refrain
 from testifying. The court appoints- a lawyer for those who
 cannot afford one if the potential sentence is execution or
 life imprisonment. Either the defendant or the prosecution
 may appeal decisions to an appeals court in civilian cases,
 but the martial law court has no provision for appeal.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in a military court before
 a panel of three military officers trained in the law. In
 practice, the military court observes the law of criminal
 procedure, and defendants are given many of the same rights as
 in a civilian court. However, Amnesty International (AIJ has
 expressed concern that trials by the Martial Law Court "fell
 below international standards for fair trial." AI's-
 contention is supported in part by local lawyers who say that
 sentences in martial law courts are sometimes harsher than is
 proportionate to the crime, and that sometimes insufficient
 evidence is produced to substantiate convictions.
 No right of appeal exists from decisions of the military
 court; however, sentences of the court for martial law
 offenses must be ratified by the Prime Minister in his
 capacity as military governor. He has authority to increase,
 reduce, or annul the sentences. The cases are reviewed for
 fairness by a legal advisor or the Justice Minister before the
 Prime Minister makes a decision. The martial law courts also
 adjudicate all crimes committed by military personnel. In
 
 
 1500
 JORDAN
 these cases, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces must
 ratify the sentences. Critics contend that the Martial Law
 Court lacks independence and that confessions taken while the
 defendant is being held incommunicado are submitted as
 evidence.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 such as marriage, divorce, child custody, or guardianship.
 The Shari'a (Muslim religious law) applies to Muslims in these
 areas, and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar macters for members of
 the main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the
 cases of other religious groups. Shari'a law, however, must'
 be applied to questions of inheritance for all communities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Jordanian authorities generally respect the inviolability of
 the home. Police searches of homes require warrants, except
 in rare 'cases involving national security or the hot pursuit
 oi fleeing suspects. A magistrate must issue a search
 warrant. Reportedly, security personnel sometimes monitor
 telephones and correspondence, but the practice is not
 believed to be widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech and a free press,
 but permits censorship under martial law. During 1990 the
 Government stopped directly censoring the local press.
 However, the Goverfnent owns more than 50 percent of each
 major newpaper and, as a result of self-censorship, editorial
 opinion generally reflects the official view. The Government
 has on occasion counseled the press to refrain from
 inflammatory language, particularly in the very tense period
 following the Persian Gulf crisis.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government. Whether at Parliament, in the
 press, or at other public occasions, Jordanians frequently
 criticized government policies over the past year. Currently
 most journalists register with the Information Ministry and
 join the press association. Foreign newspapers and magazines
 are widely available but are subject to censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government readily granted permits required for public
 demonstrations, and dozens of mostly peaceful demonstrations
 by a wide variety of political and other groups were held in
 1990. Although the Governmeit continued to monitor some
 public gatherings, it allowed numerous groups and associations
 to gather for a variety of purposes, including political
 objectives. Although the ban on political parties has not yet
 been lifted, a variety of groups with whose policies the
 Government does not agree has been allowed to function, e.g.,
 the Communist Party. 'Except for groups associated with
 terrorist activity or which call for the overthrow of the
 regime, e.g., the Islamic Liberation Party, the Government has
 not used its power to dissolve existing associations or to
 prohibit new ones. The Government has allowed more than 80
 putative political parties to organize.. The Government
 
 
 1501
 JORDAN
 reinstated 436 persons who had been fired for political
 reasons, but failed to fulfill the Minister of Finance's
 pledge that all of the 1,000 employees who had registered
 complaints with the Civil Service Commission would be
 reinstated by the end of 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Well over 90 percent of Jordanians practice Islam, the state
 religion. The Government adheres to the constitutional
 guarantee of freedcm of worship. Laws making harassment of
 religious minorities a crime are enforced. A variety of
 Christian groups (including Catholic, Orthodox, Armenian, and
 Protestant) maintain churches, schools, hospitals, and other
 institutions. A small Baha'i community also exists, although
 since 1984 the Government has not recognized the Baha'i faith
 as a religion. A few foreign clergymen reside in Jordan.
 Although proselytizing among Muslims is forbidden, conversion
 by Muslims is not a criminal offense. However, there has been
 a report that in the spring of 1990 an Ahmadiya Muslim was
 subject to court action initiated by the Shari'a court in the
 town of Na'ur, south of Amman, on charges of heresy.
 The Baha'is have experienced some problems with the
 registration of community property and, in the case of a
 national center in Amman, two local Baha'i centers, and two
 cemeteries, were forced to do so in the names of individual
 community members. Two other cemeteries are held in the name
 of the community. Since Baha'is do not have a religious court
 of their own (after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, most Baha'is
 emigrated and the few remaining were unable ta maintain a
 sectarian court), they must marry in Shari'a court; most
 Baha'is are unwilling to do so.
 All religious groups must register with the authorities in
 order to obtain official permission to operate in Jordan.
 However, some groups have not registered but nonetheless meet
 without harassment.
 In addition to Raha'is and Ahmadis, the Government also
 restricts Jehovah's Witnesses. It is illegal for them to
 organize or assemble in Jordan. The Witnesses' religion
 prohibits them from taking oaths of allegiance, saluting
 flags, or serving in the armed forces. These religious
 restrictions are perceived by the authorities as evidence that
 Witnesses are unreliable and disloyal.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted, except in certain
 military zones. With a few exceptions (primarily military
 personnel and reservists who need permission for foreign
 travel>, the Government does not restrict emigration or
 foreign travel. Shortly after the convening of the new
 Parliament in November 1989, the Government ceased withholding
 passports for travel for political reasons. However, a
 married woman must present the written consent of her husband
 to obtain a passport and may be required to present the same
 type of permission when she wishes to travel abroad without
 her husband. Single women over 18 may obtain a passport and
 travel without any relative's approval.
 Children may have to present proof of their father's consent
 to leave Jordan. Citizens who have left Jordan have the right
 
 
 1502
 
 JORDAN
 to return-. There are no reported cases of revocation of
 citizenship for political reasons. Some citizens returning to
 Jordan, particularly those who have traveled to Communist
 countries, are questioned by the GID. Jordanians may possess
 dual nationality.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influx
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967
 Arab-Israeli wars. According to the most recent statistics,
 Palestinian refugees and their descendants registered with the
 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on the East
 Bank total 890,641. UNRWA estimates that another 200,000
 -refugees have failed to register for one reason or another.
 While these refugees are free to live anywhere, 216,695 of
 them still live in 10 refugee camps scattered across Jordan.
 The total includes refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and
 does not include a large but undetermined number of other
 persons from the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel who have settled
 in the East Bank since 1948. All Palestinian refugees
 residing in Jordan prior to August 1988 can obtain full
 validity Jdrdanian-passports. They have the unrestricted
 right to live, work, and own property in Jordan. Palestinians
 residing on the West Bank may obtain 2-year passports. The
 Government also issues temporary Jordanian passports to
 between 26,000 and 27,000 Gazans resident on the East Bank who
 can prove they were displaced prior to 1971. Jordan is unique
 among Arab states in having granted full citizenship to all
 Palestinians on the East Bank, i.e., to a refugee population
 exceeding its own indigenous population at the time. The
 Interior Ministry routinely grants permits for travel between
 the East Bank and Israeli-occupied territories. Jordan has
 granted asylum even in cases that have strained relations with
 neighboring states.
 As a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, hundreds of thousands
 of displaced persons have transited Jordan,-and many
 Jordanians who had lived in the Gulf area are returning.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Jordanian citizens, although entitled under the Constitution
 to elect members of the lower house of Parliament, are not
 ultimately in a position to change their system of government
 or its leaders. Executive and legislative powers are
 constitutionally vested in the King, who rules with the
 assistance of an appointed Council of Ministers. The
 Constitution may not be amended without the King's approval.
 Parliament is composed of an appointed senate and an elected
 lower house. It is overshadowed by the executive branch but
 has the right to propose laws and approve or reject treaties
 and laws proposed by the Council of Ministers. Article 53 of
 the Constitution allows the members of the Chamber of Deputies
 to propose a motion of no-confidence in the Council of
 Ministers or any individual ministers. If the Chamber casts a
 vote of no-confidence in the Council of Ministers by an
 absolute majority, the Council of Ministers is bbliged to
 resign. The Constitution also gives the King broad scope to
 postpone the election of a new lower house or the recall of
 the previous house. Most municipal and town councils are
 elected by popular vote. The person receiving the highest
 number of votes is traditionally confirmed as mayor by the
 Minister for Municipal Affairs and then by the Prime Minister.
 
 
 1503
 JORDAN
 After the election of the current Parliament, the Prime
 Minister chose several Members of Parliament to serve in the
 Cabinet. The new Parliament, prior to giving its vote of
 confidence in the current Government, conducted a lengthy
 public debate on the new Government's agenda, in which
 government policy was directly criticized. Women were
 enfranchised in 1973 and may also run for public office.
 While there is no legal impediment to women participating in
 government or politics, traditional, deeply held attitudes
 toward the proper role of women in society often discourage
 women from political activity or make it difficult for them to
 succeed. Several women ran for seats in the lower house of
 Parliament in 1989, but none was elected.
 Article 16 of the Constitution allows Jordanians to establish
 political parties, but all existing parties were dissolved in
 1957 and are currently banned under martial law. Since the
 campaign for the parliamentary elections in November 1989, the
 Government has increasingly allowed numerous groups to
 organize as de facto political parties. Both the King and
 members of the Government have indicated thatr after the
 completion of the National Charter, the ban on recognized
 political parties will be lifted. Article 18 of the election
 law amended in 1989- states that candidates may not belong to
 an unlawful organization. An unlawful organization is defined
 in the Constitution and in the electoral law as one whose
 "principles, goals and objectives are incompatible with the
 provisions of the Constitution."
 Early in 1990, a royal decree rescinded the 1953 Anticommunism
 Law. The Government also presented draft legislation to
 Parliament abolishing the law (which has been used sparingly
 since 1967). The legislation is under review by the lower
 house's Legal Committee. The Communist Party remains
 illegal. Nevertheless, its leader was elected to Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Individual cases of job discrimination are brought to the
 Government's attention by the Public Liberties Committee,
 comprised of members of Jordan's professional associations.
 However, there are no local organizations devoted exclusively
 to human rights.
 Representatives of foreign embassies and organizations such as
 the ICRC are allowed- access to most prisoners and detainees.
 The Government has sometimes responded positively to
 recommendations from such representatives. In its 1990
 report, Al noted that the Government had not provided specific
 information in response to inquiries about individual cases
 since 1987.
 In March the Government hosted an AI delegation in Amman.
 During the visit, the delegation was allowed to tour GID
 headquarters and inspect the interrogation section. The
 delegation also visited al-Swaqa Prison, where political
 prisoners have been held.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In general, there is no official discrimination based on
 ethnicity or religion. Legal equality between men and women
 
 
 1504
 
 JORDAN
 exists in some areas, but women are treated differently in
 matters of inheritance and divorce. Sons inherit twice as
 much as daughters under Islamic law. The son is required to
 use his-inheritance for the maintenance of his mother and
 sisters, while a female is free to retain her inheritance for
 herself. A man may obtain a divorce more easily than a woman,
 but he may have to pay considerable compensation based on the
 marriage contract. Women may also gain and retain custody of
 children until the children obtain their legal majority, but
 they may lose custody if-they remarry or live abroad. In
 addition, tradition constrains women's freedoms, and entry of
 women into professional and academic realms can spark
 resentment and opposition.
 The role of women in society has nonetheless been changing in
 recent years. Women account for at least half of the student
 body at the elite University of Jordan, and an increasing
 number operate besinesses and work in such professions as
 medicine, engineering, banking, and architecture. In 1990 the
 number of women lawyers in the Bar Association more than
 doubled, to over 200. However, professional women and members
 of women's associations believe that much more remains to be
 done to enable women to participate freely and equally in
 society.
 The extent of physical abuse of women is almost never
 discussed publicly, and no statistics are available. However,
 the experience of U.S. citizen wives of Jordanian men confirm
 that the problem exists at most levels of society. The Koran
 allows a husband to discipline his wife, which some may
 interpret as a license to discipline with force. Because of
 this Koranic principle, the issue is considered a personal one
 by the police and the- judiciary. Sources in the medical field
 say that-while they know wife-beating occurs, family and
 cultural norms constrain the victim from seeking medical or
 legal help. Wife beating is technically illegal and grounds
 for divorce; but legal sources report that the filing of
 divorce cases based on. thi grounds of wife beating is rare.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of-Association
 Jordanians are free to join trade unions, but foreigners, who
 comprise about one-third of the work force, may not join trade
 unions, often because of bilateral agreements with their
 countries of origin. About 10 percent of the Jordanian work
 force is unionized. Seventeen unions comprise the Jordan
 Federation of Trade Unions (JFTU). The Government and the
 security- apparatus have traditionally maintained an indirect
 control over the .JFTU's leadership, but there was some
 stirring for reform of -the-Federation in 1990. There are
 several.other unions that do not belong to the JFTU. Unions
 have almost no political role and confine themselves to
 representing their members in negotiating wages, working
 conditions, and layoffs.
 Unions' effectiveness varies widely. The JFTU belongs to the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and
 represents Jordanian workers at the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). Strikes are permitted only if the
 Ministry of Labor fails to act to arbitrate a labor dispute
 within 2 weeks after receiving a complaint from a union. In
 fact, strikes almost never occur. In 1989 employees of the
 Petra Bank staged the first strike in Jordan in more than 5
 
 
 1505
 
 JORDAN
 years. The strikers were successful in gaining some
 additional benefits and job security, but wages were not
 increased as a result of the strike. This outcome has been
 interpreted as reflecting the political liberalization that
 followed the 1989 parliamentary elections. Government
 employees, including the military, comprise at least half the
 work force-. There are no government unions. The Government
 does own shares in some companies, e.g., the electricity
 company, which allow their employees to unionize. Members of
 the military are prohibited by law from unionizing.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Jordan have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The unions comprising the JFTU function freely
 and without government interference or antiunion
 discrimination, in accordance with Article 23 of the
 Constitution. However, the ILO's.Committee of Experts has
 urged the Government to adopt a specific statutory provision
 protecting workers' organizations against acts of interference
 by employers.
 The officers of each union, as well as the JFTU executive
 committee, are elected annually by secret ballot. JFTU member
 unions regularly engage in collective bargaining with
 employers. Negotiations cover a wide range of issues,
 including salaries, safety standards, working conditions, and
 health'and life insurance for workers and their families. If
 a union is unable to, reach agreement with an eiployer, the
 issue is referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration.
 Union-employer-government relations are generally tranquil,
 and arbitration is rarely necessary. Duty-free trade zones at
 Aqaba and Zarqa are governed by the same labor provisions that
 apply countrywide. Workers employed in these zones are part
 of national unions and are thus allowed to organize and
 bargain collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution-forbids compulsory labor, which is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under age 16 may not work except in the case of
 professional apprentices who are allowed tQ leave the standard
 educational track and begin part-time (6 hours a day, no night
 shifts) training at age 13. Labor law protects those under
 age 16 from exploitatfo. in the workplace, and its provisions
 are effectively enforced by Ministry- of Labor inspection
 teams. There have been no reports of significant abuse of
 children in the labor market. If there are cases of children
 working, it is to help support a small family business, of
 which there are many in Jordan, and only in their freer time.
 Children are not taken out of school to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code
 enforced by a staff of 30 full-time Ministry of Labor
 inspectors. Other Ministry of Labor employees augment the
 inspection staff on a part-time basis. There is no legally
 mandated minimum wage, but the Government prepares and adjusts
 periodically a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based
 on recommendations of an advisory panel composed of
 
 
 1506
 
 JORDAN
 representatives of workers, employers, and the Government.
 Unskilled workers on average earn the equivalent of between $5
 and $8 per day, which is adequate to provide a famiiy with a
 decent living by local standards. However, the recent
 devaluation of the dinar and the economic effects of the
 Persian Gulf crisis have imposed a heavy burden on most
 sectors of the society.
 Maximum working hours are 48 hours per week, except in the
 case of hotel,*bar, restaurant, and movie theater employees,
 who may work up to 54 hours. Workers are entitled to a weekly
 day of rest, rest intervals during the workday, 2 weeks'
 annual paid leave, 2 weeks' annual sick leave, and severance
 pay. The law specifies a number of health and safety
 requirements for workers, including standards for bathrooms,
 drinking water, safety equipment, and first.aid equipment.
 Jordan also has a workers' compensation law.- The Government
 appears to administer and enforce its labor laws fairly and
 effectively% Jordan's social security laws cover all
 companies with more than five employees.
 The lower house of Parliament has in the past year formed a
 special committee on health and environmental safety, which
 works with'the Departments of Labor and Health to moni-tor
 odcupational and public safety. In the-past year, there has
 been a marked increase in the number of public service
 campaigns-these groups have initiated, e.g., antismoking
 campaigns, traffic safety programs, and antilitter programs.
 Such initatiyes are especially impressive in light of Jordan's
 current economic and political problems.
