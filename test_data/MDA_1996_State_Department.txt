 MOLDOVA
 Moldova gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994 it adopt-
 ed a Constitution that provides for a multiparty representative government with
 pwer divided among a president, cabinet, parliament, and judiciary. Parliamentary
 Speaker Petru Lucinschi, running as an independent was elected President in a
 second-round runoff election, replacing the incumbent Mircea Snegur. International
 observers considered the elections to be free and fair. Prime Minister Andre
 San   eli and the cabinet resigned immediately after the election, but agreed to re-
 main as caretakers until President Lucinschi could appoint a new government after
 his January 15 inauguration.
 Moldova remains divided, with      mostly  Slavic separatists controlling the
 Transnistrian region along the Ukrainian border. This separatist regime has en-
 tered negotiations with the national Government on the possibility of a special sta-
 tus for the region. Progress has been blocked, however, by the separatists' continu-
 ing demands for "tathood" and recognition of Moldova as a confederation of two
 equal states. The Organization for Security and Cperation in Europe (OSCE), the
 Russian Federation, and Ukraine act as mediators. The two sides have generally ob-
 served the cease-fire of July 1992, which ended armed conflict between them, but
 other agreements to normalize relations have often not been honored. A Christian
 Turkic minority, the Gagauz, enjoys local autonomy in the southern part of the
 country.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police. The Ministry of
 National Security controls other security organs. The Constitution assigns to Par-
 liament the authority to investigate the activities of these ministries to ensure that
 they comply with legislation in effect. There is also a protective service, which
 guars the President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker of Parliament. Some
 members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Moldova continued to make progress in economic reform. A privatization program
 based on vouchers issued to all citizens is virtually complete. However, the economy
 is largely based on agriculture, and agricultural privatization continued to lag be-
 hind. In April the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional a law slow-g the
 conversion of land belonging to agricultural collectives into private property. In Oc-
 tober the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional a law forbidding prvate
 agricultural land sales until 2001 and limiting the period when farmers could with-
 draw from collectives to a few months a year. Some 50,000 private farmers are offi-
 cially registered. Estimates of those persons seeking to register range from 100,000
 to 150,000. Private land holdings represent only 4 percent of the total land available
 for agriculture. Per capita gross domestic product is about $430.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, however,
 there are problems in some areas. The police occasionally beat detainees and pris-
 oners. Security forces monitor political fIgures, use unauthorized wiretaps, and at
 times conduct illegal searches. ison condtions remain harsh. The judiciary is sub-
 ject to the influence of the prosecutor's office. The Constitution potentially limits the
 activities of political parties and the press. Societal discrimination against women
 persists. Addressing a minority concern, the Constitution allows parents the right
 to choose the language of education for their children.
 The Transnistrian authorities continue to be responsible for human rights abuses,
 including pressure on the media, questionable detentions, and discrimination
 against Romanian/Moldovan speakers. Detailed information about the human rights
 situation in the region is difficult to obtain.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no verified reports of po-
 litically motivated killings either in Moldova or its separatist region. Information
 from Transnistria is, however, limited. In June the wife of a former Russian army
 special investigator being held without charge in Transnistria died under mysteri.
 ous circumstances. The investigator was released in October, but continues to suffer
 from a medical condition that considerably worsened while he was being detained
 because of a lack of adequate treatment.
 b. Disappearance.-A vice president of the independent television station, which
 at times has been pressured by the Government, was abducted by men wearing po-
 lice uniforms in January and has not been seen since. The Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs claims that its personnel were not involved and attributes the abduction to a
 private settling of criminal accounts.
 
 
 1038
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations of torture by the authorities, but there were credible re-
 ports that police sometimes beat prisoners and suspects.
 In late December 1995, the home of journalists Tamara Gorinci and her husband
 of the weekly Mesagerul was invaded by persons in police uniforms and the journal-
 ists were beaten. The weekly was running a series on corruption in the carabineri,
 a small, specialized police unit. There were other attacks on journalists from this
 publication, as well as others, in late 1995 and early 1996. Circumstances and iden-
 tities of perpetrators are difficult to establish. The perpetrators in one case were ar-
 rested, reportedly nonpolicemen who were engaged in a robbery attempt, but no ar-
 rests were made in the other cases.
 Conditions in most prisons remain harsh, with serious overcrowding. Spatial
 norms do not meet local legal requirements. Conditions are especially harsh in pris-
 ons used to hold people awaiting trial or sentencing; in September Council of Europe
 experts criticized the harsh conditions of the facilities for those in detention. These
 prisons especi'ally suffer from overcrowding, bad ventilation, and a lack of rec-
 reational and rehabilitation facilities. Conditions for those serving sentences are
 only marginally better. The incidence of disease, especially tuberculosis, and mal-
 nutrition is high in all facilities. Abuse of prisoners by other prisoners or jailers
 themselves, ostensibly for disciplinary reasons, has been reduced by the dismissal
 or retirement of some of the worst offending guards. The Ministry of Justice took
 over authority for the prisons, replacing the Ministry of Interior.
 Human rights monitors are permitted to visit prisons.
 After questionable trials, four Moldovans are serving sentences in Transnistria for
 terrorism-related crimes (see Section 1.e.). The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) was denied the possibility of visiting them despite numerous represen-
 tations to the Tiraspol authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants.
 Under the Constitution, a suspect may be detained without charge for 24 hours. The
 suspect is normally allowed family visits during this period. The 24-hour time limit
 was generally respected. If charged, a suspect may be released pending trial. There
 is no system of bail, but in some cases a friend or relative, in order to arrange re-
 lease, may give a written undertaking that the accused will appear for trial.
 Suspects accused of violent or serious crimes are generally not released before
 trial. The Constitution permits pretrial arrest for an initial period of 30 days, which
 may be extended to 6 months. In exceptional cases, Parliament may ap rove exten-
 sion of pretrial detention on an individual basis of up to 12 months. he accused
 has the ight under the Constitution to a hearing before a court regarding the legal-
 ity of his arrest. According to figures provided by the Ministry of Justice in October,
 1,746 persons were held in confinement awaiting trial.
 According to the Constitution, a detained person must be informed immediately
 of the reason for his arrest, and must be made aware of the charges against him
 "as quickly as possible." The accused is provided with the right to a defense attorney
 throughout the entire process, and the attorney must be present when the charges
 are brought. Many lawyers point out that in practice, access to a lawyer is generally
 granted only after a person as been detained 24 hours. If the defendant cannot af-
 odan attorney the State requires the local bar association to provide one. Because
 the State is unable to pay standard legal fees, a lawyer who is less than competent
 or energetic is often chosen.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent *udi-
 ciary. Although the prosecutor's office still has undue influence, the independence
 of the judiciary has increased since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Con-
 stitutional Court made several rulings that demonstrated its independence. In April
 the court overturned the Parliaments amendments to the land code that had in ef-
 fect halted land reform by preventing peasants from individually withdrawing their
 land from collective farms. Also in April the court ruled that President Snegur's at-
 tempted dismissal of Defense Minister dreanga was unconstitutional. In October the
 Court overturned a Central Electoral Commission decision to exclude a presidential
 candidate from competing in the November 17 election by questioning large num-
 bers of the signatures on her electoral petitions. The respective parties complied
 with these decisions.
 The Constitution provides that the President, on the nomination of an expert judi-
 cial body, the Superior Court of Magistrates, appoints judges for an initial period
 of 5 years. They may be reappointed for a subsequent 10 years, after which they
 serve until retirement age. This provision for judicial tenure is designed to increase
 judicial independence.
 
 
 1039
 The judiciary consists of lower courts, an appellate court, a Supreme Court, and
 a Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court provided for in the 1994 Constitu-
 tion came into existence in February 1995. A July 1995 law on judicial reforms spec-
 ified a system of appeals courts. There are district courts of the first instance and
 five regional tribunals. The ITer Appeals Court and the Supreme Court, which
 serves as a final court of appeal, are bth in Chisinau. The Supreme Court super-
 vises and reviews the activities of the lower courts.
 By law defendants in criminal cases are presumed innocent. In practice prosecu-
 tors recommendations still carry considerable weight and limit the defendant's ac-
 tual presumption of innocence. Trials are generally open to the public. Defendants
 have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses and p resent evidence. De-
 fense attorneys are able to review the evidence against t   cents when preparing
 their cases. The accused enjoys a right to appeal to ahigher ourt. Because the Gov-
 ernment has been unable to fund fully the new appeals courts mandated in 1995,
 most of the tribunals and the Higher Appeals Court are not functiong. Cases can-
 not be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, thereby creating a backlog of cases
 on appeal Court decisions involving the restitution of salary or a position are not
 always implemented.
 To date no pattern of discrimination has emerged in the judicial system. The new
 Constitution provides for the right of the accused to have an interpreter both at the
 trial and in reviewing the documents of the case. If the majority of participants
 agree, trials may take place in Russian or another acceptable language instead of
 Romanian/Moldovan.
 There continue to be credible reports that local prosecutors occasionally bring un-
 justified charges against individuals in retribution for accusations of official corrup-
 tion or for politca reasons. Prosecutors occasionally use bureaucratic maneuvers to
 restrict lawyers' access to clients.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 In Trananistria four Moldovans members of the "Ilascu Six," remain in prison fol-
 lowing their conviction in 1993 ?or allegedly killing two separatist officials. Inter-
 national human rights groups raised serious questions about the fairness of the
 trial, and local organizations alleged that the Moldovans were prosecuted for politi-
 cal reasons, solely because of their membership in the Christian Democratic Popular
 Front, a Moldovan party that favors reunification with Romania. Family memibers
 have been allowed access. However the Transnistrian "authorities" have refused to
 allow the ICRC access under standard ICRC terms and conditions, such as access
 to an entire detention facility and a private meeting. The most recent such attempt
 was in April.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondene.-Both
 prosecutors and judges may issue search warrants. In some instances searches are
 conducted without warrants. Courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally ob-
 tained. There is no judicial review of search warrants.
 The Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance with
 the law," but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected. It also
 forbids searches at night except in the case of flagrant crime.
 It is widely believe hat security agencies continue to use electronic monitoring
 of residences and telephones without proper authorization. By law the prosecutor's
 office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal investigation is
 under way. In practice the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security
 organizations and police and to prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the law provide for free-
 dom of speech and the press although with some restrictions. The Government does
 not abridge freedom of speech and the print media express a wide variety of political
 views and commentary. National and city governments own a number of news-
 papers, but political parties and professional organizations, including trade unions,
 als publish newspapers.
 There were several assaults on journalists engaged in investigations of alleged of-
 ficial corruption (see Section 1.c.). Circumstances and identities ofperpetrators are
 difficult to establish. The perpetrators in one case were arrested; they were report-
 edly nonpolicemen engaged in a robbery attempt. However, no arrests have been
 made in the other cases. It is too early to tell if these attacks have had an inhibiting
 effect on the willingness of the press to investigate corruption.
 Several independent radio stations broadcast in Mova, including a religious
 one. An independent television station broadcasts in the Cisinau area. The inde-
 pendent media outlets maintain news staffs and conduct a number of public interest
 programs. The Government owns and operates a television channel that covers the
 
 
 1040
 whole country as well as several of the major radio stations. The city government
 of Balti operates its own television and radio stations.
 Parliament removed language in the press law enforcing the prohibitions con-
 tained in the Constitution, which forbid contesting or defaing the State and the
 people," and political parties that "militate" against the country's sovereignty, inde-
 pendence, and territorial integrity. However, these restrictions remain in the Con-
 stitution. They appear to be aimed at journalists publishing material in favor of re-
 unification with Ronania or questioning the legal right of the Republic of Moldova
 to exist.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. However, Western Euro-
 pean and American publications do not circulate widely since they are very expen-
 sive by local standards. Some Russian newspapers are available, but do not cir-
 culate widely due to their expense. Moldova receives television and radio broadcasts
 from Romania and Russia. Cable subscribers receive Cable News Network, the US.
 National Broadcasting Corporation, Super Channel, Euro-News, and a number of
 other news and entertainment networks.
 Of the two major newspapers in Transnistria, one is controlled by the regional au-
 thorities and the other by the Tiraspol city government. The latter criticizes the re-
 gime from time to time. Other print media in Transnistria do not have large circula-
 tions and appear only on a wee y or monthly basis. Nonetheless, some of them also
 criticize locaI authorities. The one independent cable television station is under con-
 stant pressure from the authorities. It had to restrict its activity when it lost a libel
 suit brought by the local authorities this spring. Most Moldovan newspapers do not
 circulate in Transnistria. Circulation of all print media in Transnistria is greatly
 hampered by the local economic crisis, which is more severe than in the rest of
 Moldva.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 to peaceful assembly. The local mayor's ofce generally issues permits for dem-
 onstrations; it may consult the national Government if the demonstration is likely
 to be extremely large.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social and
 political organizations. Private organizations, inciuding political parties, are re-
 quiredto register, but applications are approved routinely. The onstitution de-
 ciares unconstitutional parties that "militate against the sovereignty, independence,
 and territorial integrity of Moldova.",
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally permits free practice of reli-
 gion. A 1992 law on religion codifies religious freedoms, although it contained re-
 strictions that could inhibit the activities of some religious groups. The law provides
 for freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to profess his religion
 in any form. It also provides for alternative military service for conscientious objec-
 tors, protects the confidentiality of the confessional, allows denominations to estab-
 lish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may not interfere
 in the religious activities of denominations. The law, however, requires that reli-
 gious groups register with the Government in order to hire noncitizens. The law also
 prohibits roselyizin g.
 Some Piotestant denominations are concerned that the prohibition on proselytiz-
 ing could inhibit their activities, although many denominations hold revival meet-
 ings apparently without official interference. To date the authorities have taken no
 legal action against individuals for proselytizing. The Salvation Army, however, was
 unable to register as a religious denomination because it did not meet the require-
 ment of having a Moldvan citizen as the organization's legal head.
 Although Eastern Orthodoxy is not designated the official religion, it continues to
 be a strong religious force and exert significant influence. In 1992 a number of
 priests broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is subordinate to
 the Moscow Patriarchate, in order to formhe e Bessarabian Orthodox Church. The
 Bessarabian Orthodox Church, which sees itself as the legal and canonical successor
 to the pre-World War H Romanian Orthodox Church in Bessarabia (the part of
 Molova between the Dniester and Prut rivers), subordinated itself to the Bucharest
 patriarchate of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Government has consistently
 refused to register the Bessarabian Church, citing unresolved property claims as the
 principal reason.
 The Jewish community, although small, is very active. Jewish leaders reported
 that their relations with the Government and local authorities were good.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within the country. Citizens
 generally are able to travel freely; however, there are some restrictions on emigra-
 tion. Close relatives with a claim to support from the applicant must give their con-
 
 
 1041
 currence. The Government may also deny permission to emigrate if the applicant
 had access to state secrets. Such cases, however, are very rare, and none were re-
 ported in 1996.
 Travel between Transnistria and the balance of the country is not prevented.
 There are regularly scheduled buses. However, the separatist "authorities" do stop
 and search both incoming and outgoing vehicles. They restrict the flow of informa-
 tion materials, preventing persons from bringing either Moldovan or Western publi-
 cations into the separatist region.
 Moldova is not a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of
 Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. The issue of providing first asylum has never arisen.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens voted in the first multiparty parliamentary elections in 1994, and in the
 country's second presidential election in November. Parliamentary Speaker
 Lucinschi, running as an independent, won a second-round runoff election on De-
 cember 1. International observers considered the elections to be free and fair. The
 peaceful transition of presidential power represents further progress in the transi-
 tion to democracy.
 The Transnistrian "authorities," however, refused to allow polling stations to be
 set up in the separatist region and restricted access of Transnistrian voters to sta-
 tions in the rest of the country. Turnout from Transnistria in the election was less
 than 2 percent of those eligible to vote.
 Preelection maneuvering caused a realignment of the various registered political
 parties in the country, plus a fragmentation of the leftist parties represented in Par-
 lament, including both the former ruling party, the Democratic Agrarian Party, and
 its close ally, the Socialist/Unity Bloc. Incumbent President Snegur is moving to be-
 come leader of the rightist opposition, in preparation for parliamentary elections to
 be held by February 1998. Supporters of President-elect Lucinschi have also moved
 to establish their own party to compete in these elections. Leftist and agrarian
 groups are seeking to form coalitions.
 The Constitution adopted in 1994 provides for the division of power between the
 popularly elected President, the Cabinet, the Parliament, and the judiciary. The
 President, as Head of State, in consultation with the Parliament, appoints the Cabi-
 net and Prime Minister, who functions as the Head of Government. However, a min-
 ister can only be dismissed with the assent of the Prime Minister.
 In March the President tried to dismiss the Defense Minister, an army general,
 by using his powers as Supreme Commander of the armed forces. In April the Con-
 stitutionial Court ruled that the general's position as a government minister meant
 that he could not be fired without the assent of the Prime Minister. The President
 im  ediately accpted the Court's decision, thereby averting a constitutional crisis.
 Many observers thought that the incident showed a possible deficiency in the Con-
 stitution regarding the sharing of executive powers between the offices of the Presi-
 dent and the Prime Minister.
 Parliamentary elections must take place no later than every 4 years. Given the
 fragmentation of some of the parliamentary parties as well as the possible need to
 revise the Constitution, a number of parliamentarians called for parliamentary elec-
 tions following the presidential elections. Early elections may be necessary if Presi-
 dent-elect Lucinachi has difficulty forming a government.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social and
 political organizations. A controversial article states, however, that those organiza-
 tions that are engaged in fighting against political pluralism, the principles of the
 rule of law, the sovereignty and independence or territorial integrity of the republic
 of Moldova' are "unconstitutional." Opposition parties, some of which favor rapid or
 eventual reunification with neighboring Romania, have charged that this provision
 is intended to impede their political activities.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice barring the participation of women
 or minorities in political life. However, women are generally underrepresented in
 leading positions of political parties. Women hold only 5 of 104 parliamentary seats.
 The Association of Moldovan Women, a social and political organization, competed
 in the 1994 elections, but was unable to gain parliamentary representation. Rus-
 sian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and Gagauz minorities are represented in Parliament.
 Debate takes place in either the Romanian/Moldovan or Russian language, with
 translation provided.
 
 
 1042
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongoernmental In-
 ve8tigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups exist. The local Helsinki Watch organization
 maintains contacts with international human rights organizations, as does the Hel-
 sinki Citizens Assembly, whose president is the chairman of the Parliament's
 Human Rights Commission. Human rights groups operate without government in-
 terference.
 The Government has welcomed and supported the work of the OSCE, which has
 had a mission in the country since 1993 to assist with finding a resolution for the
 separatist conflict. The OSCE participates in the Joint Control Commission-corn-
 posed of Russisn, Moldovan, Ukrainian, and Transanistrian members-which reviews
 violations of the cease-fire agreement. The mission now generally enjoys access to
 the "security zone* along the river dividing the separatist-controlled territory from
 the rest of Moldova.
 Moldova has cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) in the past, permitting visits to prisoners from the 1992 conflict (since re-
 leased).
 Since 1993 Transnistrian separatist authorities have not allowed the ICRC access
 to the four members of the "Blascu Six" still in prison (see Section I.e.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that persons are equal before the law regardless of race,
 sex, disability, religion, or social origin. There are remedies for violations, such as
 orders for redress Of grievances, but these are not always enforced.
 Women.-Women a-used by their husbands have the right to press charges; hus-
 bands convicted of such abuse may receive prison sentences (typically up to 6
 months). Public awareness of the problem of violence in families is not very high
 and no special government programs exist to combat spousal abuse. According to
 knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal to police or the courts for
 protection against abusive spouses because they are embarrassed to do so. Police
 generally do not consider spousal abuse a serious crime. However, when cases d
 reach a court, they appear to be treated seriously. Women and legal authorities re-
 port that spousal abuse is not widespread. Through November theitry of Inter-
 nal Affairs recorded 276 cases of rape or attempted rape. A newly formed women's
 crisis rup believes that the number of rapes is greatly underreported.
 The aw provides that women shall be equal to men. However, according to statis-
 tics, women have been disproportionately affected by growing unemployment. By
 law women are paid the same as men for the same work. Although still victimized
 by societal discrimination, anecdotal evidence suggests that women are more em-
 ployable than men (being seen as more flexible, better workers) and are working
 because of economic necessity. There are a significant number of female managers
 in the public sector;, the president of Moldova's leading private sector bank is a
 woman.
 Children.-There is extensive legislation designed to protect children, including
 extended paid maternity leave and7 government supplementary payments for fami-
 lies with many children. Ten years of basic education are compulsory, followed by
 either technical school or further study leading to higher education. The health sys-
 tem devotes extensive resources to child care. No special problems concerning child
 abuse came to light in 1996 nor is there a societal pattern of abuse of children, but
 child support programs suffered from inadequate funding along with other govern-
 ment programs__
 Peope WithDisabilitiesThere is no legal discrimination against people with dis-
 abilities. However, there are no laws providing for accessibility of buildings, and
 there are few government resources devoted to training people with disabilities. The
 Government does provide tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the dis-
 abled.
 Religious Minoritiesa-The Bessarabian Church has been harassed by unknown
 persons, including a grenade attack in September on the Metropolitan's (the presid-
 ing Bishop's) house, which caused no deaths or injuries and only small material
 damna..
 Nat  oallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The population is about 4.3 million, of which
 65 percent are ethnic Moldovans. Ukrainians (14 percent) and Russians (13 percent)
 are the two largest minorities. A Christian Turkic minority, the Gagauz, lives pri-
 marily in the southern regions of the country. They are largely Russian speaking
 and represent about 3.5 percent of the population.
 The 1990 Citizenship Law offered an equal opportunity to all persons resident at
 the time of independence to adopt Mldovan citizenship. The OSCE's Office of
 
 
 1043
 Democratic Institutions and Human Rights described the law as being very liberal.
 The law permits dual citizenship on the basis of a bilateral agreement, but no such
 agreements are in effect. In 1994 the Parliament voted to delay until 1997 imple-
 mentation of the language testing called for in the Language Law of 1989 which was
 due to begin in 1994. The principle inherent in the Language Law is that, in dealing
 with any official or commercial entity, the citizen should be able to choose the lan-
 guage to use. Officials are therefore obligated to know Russian and Romanian/
 Moldovan '   the degree necessary to fulfill their professional obligations." Since
 many Russian speakers do not speak Romanian/Moldovan (while educated
 Mldovans speak beth languages), they argued for a delay in the implementation
 of the law in order to permit more time to learn the language. Addressing a minor-
 ity concern, the Constitution provides parents with the right to choose the language
 of instruction for their children.
 In the separatist region, however, discrimination against Romanian/Moldovan
 speakers continued. Schools in the area are required to use the Cyrillic alphabet
 when teaching Romanian. Many teachers, parents, and students objected to the use
 of the Cyrillic script to teach Romanian. They believe that it disadvantages pupils
 in pursuing higher education opportunities in the rest of the Moldova or omanma.
 (Cyrillic script was used to write the Romanian language in Moldova until 1989,
 since "Moldovan," as it was then called, was officially decreed during the Soviet era
 to be a different language than Romanian, which is written in the Latin alphabet.
 The 1989 Language Law reinstituted the use of the Latin script.)
 As a result of an agreement between the Government and the separatist authori-
 ties, 19 schools in the separatist region obtained permission in January 1995 to use
 the Latin alphabet, with salaries and textbooks to be supplied by the Moldovan Min-
 istry of Education. Implementation was modest during the 1995-96 school year,
 largely due to bureaucratic obstacles imposed by authorities in the separatist region.
 Separatist authorities rescinded permission a few weeks after the 1996 school year
 opened in September, with the schools closed by local police and Cossacks. Teachers
 from these schools were taken from their homes in the evening and held for ques-
 tioning for a number of hours before being released. Separatist authorities in early
 October detained several teachers for 6 days before releasing the At least one
 teacher from such a school was fired. At year's end, the schools were open but teach-
 ing Romanian in Cyrillic script.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions which was
 enacted by Moldova's then-Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 pendent trade unions. Laws passed in 1989 and 1991, which give citizens the right
 to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal basis for the formation
 of independent unions. The 1994 Constitution further declares that any employee
 may found a union or join a union that defends workers' interests. However, there
 have been no known attempts to establish alternate trade union structures inde-
 pendent of the successor to the previously existing official organizations that were
 part of the Soviet trade union system.
 The successor organization is the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).
 GFTU's continuing role in managing the state insurance system and its retention
 of previously existing official union headquarters and vacation facilities provide an
 inherent advantage over any potential organizers who might wish to form a union
 outside its structure. However, its industrial or branch unions are becoming more
 independent entities; they maintain that their membership in GFTU is voluntary
 and that they can withdraw if they wish. Virtually all employed adults are members
 of a union.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 the members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There were several labor actions
 seeking payment of wage arrears, including a number of strikes by teachers in var-
 ious parts of the country. High unemployment, both hidden and official, led to work-
 er concern about job security.
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations.
 GFTU is currently negotiating membership in the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, and hopes to accede in 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law, which is still based
 on former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights. However,
 wages are set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government, man-
 agement, and unions. On the national level, the three parties meet and negotiate
 national minimum wages for all categories of workers. Then, each branch union rep-
 resenting a particular industry negotiates with management and the government
 
 
 1044
 ministries responsible for that industry. They may set wages higher than the mini-
 mum set on the national level and often do especially if the industry in question
 is more profitable than average. Finally, on te enterprise level, union and manage-
 ment representatives negotiate directly on wages. Again, they may set wages higher
 than had negotiators on the industry level.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership psitions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. This law has not been tested in Moldova.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition ofForced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. No instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for unrestricted
 employment is 18 years. Employment of those ages 16 to 18 is permitted under spe-
 cial conditions, including shorter workdays, no night shifts, and longer vacations.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is primarily responsible for enforcing
 these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a role. Child labor is not used
 in industry, although children living on farms do sometimes assist in the agricul-
 tural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a legal minimum monthly wage of $4
 (18 Moldovan lei), but this is used primarily as a basis for calculating fines. The
 average monthly wage of approximately $41 (184 Moldovan lei) does not provide a
 decent standard of living for a worker and family. Lowest wages are in the agricul-
 tural sector, where they average approximately $23 (102 Moldovan lei a month).
 Due to severe budgetary constraints, the Government and enterprises often do not
 meet payrolls for employees. The Constitution sets the maximum workweek at 40
 hours, and the Labor Code provides for at least 1 day off per week.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the workplace. The
 unions within GFTU also have inspection personnel who have a right to stop work
 in the factory or fine the enterprise if safety standards are not met. Further, work-
 ers have the right to refuse to work but may continue to draw their salaries if work-
 iag conditions represent a serious threat to their health. In practe however, the
 depressed econoic situation has led enterprises to eonomize on  ety equipment
 and generally to show less concern for worker safety issues. Workers often do not
 know their rights in this area.
