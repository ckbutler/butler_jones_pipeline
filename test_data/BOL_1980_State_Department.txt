 BOLIVIA
 Despite a wealth of natural resources, vast territory,
 and minimal population pressures at this time, Bolivia
 is the poorest nation in South America. Deep social
 cleavages and the severe political instability that has
 plagued this country since its independence from Spain
 in 1825 have contributed to this condition.
 Since 1978, the frequency of changes of government has
 increased. Between July, 1978 and July 1980, there were
 three general national elections and four military coups.
 The latest such coup, led by army General Luis Garcia
 Meza Tejada on July 17, 1980, ousted the civilian govern-
 ment of interim President Lydia Gueiler. The coup also
 ended the progress that had been made in restoring consti-
 tutional democracy and destroyed the favorable human
 rights climate that characterized the transition from
 military to civilian government begun in 1977 by President
 Hugo Banzer.
 Immediately upon seizing power, the Garcia Meza regime
 began a systematic campaign of oppression designed to
 gain control of the country and eliminate opposition.
 Hundreds of people were arrested and many were beaten
 and tortured. Some were killed. Pockets of resistance
 in the mines were eliminated by military force.
 A curfew imposed and vigorously enforced throughout the
 country remains in effect. The regime abolished trade
 union rights, established press censorship, and prohibited
 unauthorized meetings. The military regime arrested
 scores of foreign priests and missionaries and detained
 and expelled several foreign correspondents. Twenty-
 nine Americans were arrested during the first six weeks
 following the coup. In no case did the regime notify
 the American Embassy of their arrest, nor was consular
 access to the imprisoned Americans granted save in two
 cases. Other foreign nationals and diplomatic missions
 were treated in similar fashion.
 The regime initially attempted to discredit internationally
 recognized human rights institutions such as Amnesty
 International, which have reported continuing abuses,
 and it threatened groups from international labor organiza-
 tions such as the Inter-American Regional Organization
 of Workers (ORIT), the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the Latin American Workers
 Confederation (CLAT), and the World Confederation of
 Labor (WCL) by arresting or mistreating their representa-
 tives when they visited Bolivia to ascertain the state
 of human rights observance.
 To date, the regime has not accounted fully for political
 prisoners. Paramilitary and security forces continue
 to arrest persons suspected of anti-regime sentiments
 or activities. Bolivian asylees, including deposed Presi-
 dent Gueiler, were allowed to leave Bolivia only after
 prolonged delays. In addition, restrictions continue
 in force on the press and on the free functioning of
 labor unions and political parties.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The government of President Lydia Gueiler respected Article
 12 of the 1967 constitution which prohibits physical
 and mental torture. This is not true of the de facto
 regime headed by General Garcia Meza.
 There are reliable reports by eyewitnesses of repeated
 and methodical beating of blindfolded prisoners by masked
 officials at the ministry of interior and at offices
 of the armed forces intelligence branch (G-2) in La Paz
 since the July 17 take-over. Reportedly, men and women
 were routinely intimidated and subjected to physical
 and mental torture, forced to implicate themselves and
 others believed to be unfriendly to the regime, and punish-
 ed for their political beliefs or associations. Electric
 current is said to continue to have been applied to prison-
 ers to force confessions at the ministry of interior
 as late as September. Many prisoners report they were
 robbed by their captors of money, watches, rings, and
 other personal items.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Under the Gueiler government there were no political
 prisoners. Conditions for prisoners accused of breaking
 civil or criminal laws were deficient because of insuf-
 ficient economic resources available for the construction,
 maintenance and operation of penal facilities.
 The Garcia Meza regime, on the other hand, has systematical-
 ly engaged in mental and physical abuse of political
 prisoners. There are reliable reports that persons were
 made to lie down in manure at the armed forces headquarters
 in La Paz after their arrests. American journalist Mary
 Helen Spooner was kept in a closet at the interior ministry
 in La Paz for several days without lights or windows
 and threatened with death unless she cooperated with
 her captors. Even though President Garcia Meza on Sep-
 tember 16 denied that prisoners had been tortured or
 abused, since then at least one eyewitness saw paramili-
 taries at the armed forces headquarters beat a young
 man and burn him with cigarettes as his father was made
 to watch. Another reliable witness reported talking
 to a woman in jail who had been tortured with electric
 current in an effort to make her reveal the names of
 her exiled husband's friends.
 The regime's paramilitaries are understood to have also
 threatened the families of individuals in hiding with
 beatings, rape, and death unless they report on the where-
 abouts of their loved ones. There are reliable reports
 that officials of the Garcia Meza regime have threatened
 with harm, beaten, robbed and harrassed non-Bolivians
 they considered "extremists* or accused them of activities
 against the regime. Such was the case with three American
 Marines attached to the Embassy who, after their arrest
 on minor charges in August, were robbed and physically
 abused by regime officials. "Russian Roulette" was played
 with one of the Marines in an unsuccessful attempt to
 force him to reveal classified information. In the case
 of several representatives of an international labor
 
 
 350
 organization who were arrested while visiting Bolivia
 with the full knowledge and consent of President Garcia
 Meza, interior ministry officials abused them, severely
 beat one of them, and robbed them of their money and
 other personal documents and possessions.
 There are also credible reports of the killing of miners
 and peasants at Caracoles Mines, Department of Oruro,
 by troops sent in to pacify the town, and there are reli-
 able reports of the deaths of soldiers and miners at
 Huanuni and Miraflores Mines as a result of fighting
 at those sites.
 Inhuman acts like these overshadow the treatment of common
 prisoners held in state jails. The regime has vehemently
 denied reports that such acts have taken place but has
 made no effort to investigate and sanction any offenders.
 Most prisons are old and overcrowded. Corruption is
 a fact of life, with prisoners paying off their guards
 for the privilege of outings. Rehabilitation programs
 are non-existent.
 c.   Disappearances
 Disappearances did not take place under the government
 of President Gueiler. Under the military regime, however,
 paramilitary forces acting on direct orders of the minister
 of the interior, Army Colonel Luis Arce, have conducted
 warrantless searches of homes, and arbitrarily arrested
 people suspected of opposition to the regime. The regime
 refuses to identify persons held, and, as described below,
 will not or cannot give an accurate estimate of the number
 of detainees. Identification of detainees and the loca-
 tions of their detention have been complicated by the
 regime's denial of the existence of detention camps such-
 as those known to exist at Puerto Cavinas, Puerto Rico,
 and others in eastern Bolivia.
 The governing junta and cabinet officials have made no
 efforts to curtail abuses by security forces, and have
 publicly sanctioned repressive actions by those forces
 as necessary measures.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The government of President Lydia Gueiler respected the
 right of habeas corpus established in Article 18 of the
 1967 Bolivian constitution. Under her government, as
 in the past, persons could be arrested and legally held
 for brief periods without charge. Article 9 of the consti-
 tution requires that detainees be either charged or re-
 leased within 24 hours, and efforts were made to adhere
 to this provision.
 Since the July 17 coup, several thousand people have
 been arrested for real or imagined opposition to the
 military regime, for not carrying proper identification,
 or for violating curfew rules. Most of these have been
 released, but some remain under detention. In the months
 immediately following the coup, government figures on
 the number of detainees were highly suspect. Spokesmen
 for the regime disagree on the numbers of detainees;
 Interior Minister Luis Arce asserted in August that the
 number of detainees did not exceed 500 persons; a few
 days later the Minister Secretary to the president, Colonel
 Mario Escobari, told a foreign newsman the number of
 persons detained at the time did not exceed 2,500.
 
 
 351
 
 The Garcia Meza regime routinely violates constitutional
 provisions for habeas corpus.  Persons suspected of
 anti-regime sentiments or activities have been arrested
 and held without being charged for longer than the 24
 hour period the constitution allows. Generally, they
 are not informed of the reasons for their detention.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons arrested in Bolivia are entitled by law to a
 fair public trial. Since the July 17 coup, however,
 there have been no trials of accused political prisoners.
 Some prisoners have been sent to work camps .in the interior
 while others have been expelled. Many Bolivians who
 gained asylum in embassies were not allowed to leave
 the country until nearly three months after the coup
 and have been forbidden to return.
 The judicial process moves slowly. Some criminal cases
 take years to complete because of inherent faults in
 the judicial system -- antiquated procedures, shortage
 of qualified personnel, etc. Defendants may hire their
 own counsel, and may confer with them in private.
 The Bolivian narcotics law enacted in June 1979, remains
 in effect. The law specifically sets higher fines for
 foreign nationals convicted of violating.the various
 rules governing drug enforcement. This expressly violates
 Article 6 of the Bolivian constitution which guarantees
 equal treatment under the law to all persons regardless
 of origin. Since the lawts enactment, numerous foreign
 nationals have received stiffer fines than Bolivian citi-
 zens similarly convicted. Five American citizens have
 been so affected to date.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is constitutionally protected.
 There were no reports of invasions of the home during
 the Gueiler government. During the Garcia Meza regime,
 however, warrantless searches have been made of the houses
 of persons thought to be opposed to the July 17 coup.
 Often, when homes have been searched, the security forces
 involved in the warrantless entries have stolen personal
 effects.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Despite the best intentions of many serious Bolivian
 planners and technicians, Bolivia has failed to fashion
 and carry out on a continuing basis an effective program
 of balanced economic growth.
 Governmental instability and corruption have hampered
 implementation of a consistent, coherent, rational develop-
 ment program, encouraged visionary schemes, and created
 job insecurity among university-educated technical and
 professional sectors. Intellectuals and workers alike
 have found the need to go abroad to earn a livelihood.
 Developmental policies in the 1971-77 period put externally
 borrowed resources to the task of creating vast, often
 impractical industrial and construction schemes. Public
 
 
 352
 sector industries helped burden the country with a large
 foreign debt, bloated payrolls and benefits, and production
 which would be noncompetitive even for the Andean Pact
 region were it not for subsidies. The debt stood at
 some $3.5 billion contracted, $2 billion disbursed as
 of July 31, 1980. Meanwhile, this potentially agricul-
 turally rich nation slipped into dependence on foreign
 sources for much of its basic foodstuffs.
 While all Bolivian governments since 1952 have professed
 strong support for promoting the livelihoods and living
 standards of the peasants and urban wage-earners, benefits
 have tended to favor the latter over the dispersed rural
 population (which still constitutes the vast majority),
 adding to an urban "pull" factor of growing intensity.
 Most urban wage-earners have been brought into the social
 security system, which is more appreciated for its medical
 benefits than for its very modest retirement or disability
 payments. Governments have expressed concern over the
 severe shortage of low-cost housing units.
 Public education is free and, in urban areas, generally
 available when not suspended owing to periods of govern-
 mental change or political unrest. Funds spent by the
 central government on education and cultural affairs
 represented 25 percent of central government expenditures
 in 1979, compared to about 14 and 17 percent for the
 military establishment and for debt and interest payments,
 respectively, according to World Bank figures.
 Educational reforms and outreach begun in 1952 attempted
 to bring a basic level of literacy to most Bolivian youth,
 and integrate the Indian peoples into the national (or
 Spanish) culture. Except in the most isolated areas,
 Bolivian youth in the rural areas (where over. half the
 population still lives) can count on at least three years
 of schooling.
 Following the latest military coup, primary schools re-
 opened only a few days later than the normal post-winter
 holiday reopening. The military regime continues, however,
 to keep the universities closed. A government-sponsored
 national education committee is currently analyzing the
 university system.
 The major benefits provided by governments to the poor
 have been some foodstuff subsidies and low energy charges
 (including low hydrocarbon product prices internally).
 These have not only been expensive for the Treasury,
 but have promoted the diversion of goods away from the
 legal, domestic market, to contraband exports. Since
 October 1980, the government has given indications that
 it would soon end all domestic subsidies, with no signifi-
 cant compensating adjustment of salaries.  Implementation
 of these measures now appears to have been postponed
 at least until January, 1981. Despite numerous promises
 over the years, no government has extended social security
 to peasants.
 The government projects a 1980 population growth rate
 of 2.64 percent. The gross birth rate and gross death
 rate are 44 and 15 per thousand respectively. The median
 age of the estimated 5.3 million people in 1980 is about
 18. Given the 1980 release of 1976 census figures indi-
 cating a 4.6 million population, all Bolivian data await
 correction if only to correspond to revised population
 figures. Life expectancy at birth in 1978 was 52.
 
 
 353
 The ratio of national population to medical doctors,
 according to World Bank figures, was 1850:1 in 1977.
 Few governmental rural health care delivery projects
 exist and many rural clinics have been the result, in
 large part, of missionary efforts. Poor health conditions
 and malnutrition take a heavy toll. Intestinal diseases
 among infants and respiratory illnesses among miners
 are particularly virulent. 158 of every 1,000 babies
 born do not live beyond one year; 180 per 1,000 cumula-
 tively do not reach age 5. The toll is hardest on rural
 children: 291 per 1,000 fail to reach age 5 as compared
 to 186 per 1,000 for urban residents, based on 1976 census
 data.
 Bolivia has very low population density. Large areas
 generally considered suitable for colonization have seen
 some government settlement projects and somewhat more
 successful spontaneous movements from the high mountain
 plain to the lowland valleys. However, the toll taken
 by tropical diseases, isolation from family and familiar
 settings, and lack of adequate governmental support ser-
 vices reduce popular interest to participate in these
 types of activities as currently structured. The popula-
 tion remains concentrated in the highlands..
 Of some 1 million households counted in the 1976 census,
 over 60 percent had no piped water supply, 34 percent
 had access to potable water and only 11 percent have
 piped water within the house. The same census found
 78 percent of households without any form of sewage dis-
 posal. Although governments have attempted low-cost
 housing projects, the average Bolivian lives in adobe
 quarters that must be considered rudimentary. The govern-
 ment considered Bolivia short of some 113,000 housing
 units, based on the 1976 census, and delivered only some
 1,000 units in 1978-1979, and those went to public sector
 workers.
 According to 1978 World Bank figures, fifty-one percent
 of the population was engaged in agriculture, 25 percent
 in services, and 24 percent in industry. Mining, however,
 represented 78.5 percent of the value of legal exports
 according to preliminary 1979 figures.
 Gross domestic product (GDP) increases in the period
 1971-77 were inflated by borrowing, advanced in expectation
 of unrealized petroleum findings, and incurred for essen-
 tially inefficient and unrealistic, large public-sector
 industrial projects. While per capita GDP rose slightly
 in this period from $238 to about $292 in terms of constant
 1970 dollars (according to the government data), 1979
 estimated per capita GDP was only $289 in 1979 constant
 dollars. Given the labor strife of the first four months
 of 1980, negligible private or public real investment,
 and a 56 percent increase in the La Paz consumer price
 index in the year ending August 1980 (with the performance
 of the index moderated by then price controlled items),
 no improvement is to be expected in 1980 per capita GDP.
 By mid-1980 debt service consumed as much as 65 percent
 of legal export earnings, hampering the government's
 ability to implement social programs. Following the
 July 1980 coup, the Garcia Meza regime has shown greater
 concern with social control for regime maintenance than
 with economic planning. Uncertainty regarding interna-
 tional assistance levels clouds the picture as national
 
 
 and international lending institutions reexamine their
 Bolivian commitments. The fate of the regime, the degree
 to which it endures and continues to resort to repression
 and the success of any package of economic measures
 will largely set the basis for the Bolivian economy for
 1981 and the direction for the conditions of life of
 the population.
 Caution must be exercised in evaluating Bolivian statis-
 tics outside of the financial sector. Population size
 is uncertain and the validity of national income statistics
 is questionable. The customs service is underdeveloped
 and has little control over contraband exports (flour,
 gasoline, cocaine) and contraband imports (automobiles
 and electronic goods). GDP estimates collapse in the
 face of the large black markets and the meteoric rise
 in the cocaine trade in 1980.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Under the civilian government which ruled until July 17,
 Bolivians enjoyed all these freedoms. Since the military
 regime took power, however, all of these freedoms have
 been abolished or severely curtailed.
 Many radio stations and opposition newspapers have been
 closed. All news programs on television or radio come
 from the regime's own news service, "Radio Illimani*.
 Newspapers have published stories containing criticism
 of the regime, although editors have been chastised if
 news adverse to the regime is published, or if news the
 regime considers important -- e.g., honors received by
 a Bolivian abroad -- is not given wide coverage. In
 the most recent example of press freedom curtailment,
 on December 29 the minister of interior ordered the closing
 of the national circulation Catholic daily Presencia
 because of alleged slurs against Bolivian womanhood.
 Several journalists and TV newscasters who have angered
 the regime for their reporting have either been arrested
 or have been expelled from the country. Similarly, people
 are not allowed to criticize the regime openly in the
 streets or at their places of employment. Many have
 been arrested on accusations made by former friends and
 coworkers. Several have lost their jobs as a result
 of their arrests.
 Immediately following the coup, the regime instituted
 a curfew and prohibited unauthorized gatherings by citi-
 zens. It authorizes only demonstrations in support of
 its policies.
 The regime ostensibly permits freedom of worship, but
 has taken action against feared or suspected political
 activities by religious organizations. Many priests,
 ministers and missionaries have been arrested either
 on suspicion of espousing ideas contrary to official
 policy or because of accusations of cooperation with
 "extremists". Church services have been interrupted.
 Priests and nuns have been arrested and beaten.  Many
 have had to flee the country, seek asylum at the Papal
 
 
 355
 Nunciature, or go into hiding. Church buildings have
 been entered and searched without warrants. Despite
 such measures, the Catholic Church is still a potent
 force and has been outspoken in its criticism of the
 regime. In a public pronouncement Church leaders argued
 successfully against implementation of a stringent new
 public security law.
 Labor unions have been severely restricted and their
 funds frozen by the regime. The headquarters building
 of the principal labor confederation is being razed by
 the military and will be replaced by a parking lot.
 The regime has appointed new 'Labor Coordinators' to
 run union affairs in the place of elected officials.
 Many labor leaders have been arrested, sought asylum
 at embassies, left the country on their own, lost their
 jobs, or are in hiding. There is no collective bargaining
 and workers do not have the right to strike.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Following the July 17 coup, many Bolivians sought asylum
 at foreign embassies in La Paz. The most notable asylee
 was former President Lydia Gueiler. She remained almost
 three months at the Papal Nunciature until the regime
 allowed her to depart for Paris. Hundreds of other asylees
 were granted safe conduct passes and permitted to leave
 Bolivia only after unreasonable delays of more than two
 months. The passports of many asylees have been stamped
 to prohibit their re-entry.
 Bolivians are not presently allowed to travel freely
 within their own country. Many citizens have been sent
 to distant towns in the interior of the country. Such
 persons cannot return to their homes and must report
 daily to the authorities.
 Neither the Gueiler government nor the Garcia Meza regime
 have encouraged or prohibited immigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As part of the political liberalization initiated by
 former President Hugo Banzer in 1977, Bolivian citizens
 21 years of age and older were allowed to vote. Labor
 unions and political parties of different ideologies
 were permitted to exercise their functions freely under
 the Gueiler government.
 One of the first acts of the Garcia Meza regime was to
 restrict or ban all labor union and political party activi-
 ty. Its most repressive tactics were directed against
 members of political parties it considered extreme left-
 ists. The results of the June election giving Popular
 Democratic Union presidential candidate Hernan Siles
 Zuazo 38 percent of the valid votes cast were annulled.
 There has been no indication that the regime has plans
 to return to constitutionalism. On the contrary, high
 officials of the regime have indicated they believe that
 Bolivians are not ready for democracy. Political parties
 in general, while not officially outlawed, are severely
 restricted in their operation, particularly those labeled
 as "leftist". Although an official advisory council
 to the junta includes some civilians associated with
 
 
 356
 former kesident Hugo Banzer's political party, the council
 has no policy making powers.
 Generally speaking, women do not enjoy an economic or
 political place in Bolivian society equal to that of
 men. There are exceptions. The most notable recent example
 was Lydia Gueiler Tejeda, who was designated interim
 President on November 16, 1979 and governed Bolivia until
 the July 17 coup.
 Although most Bolivians are either Indian or have Indian
 blood, there nevertheless exists overt racial discrimina-
 tion against persons of Indian or mestizo ancestry.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Gueiler government was much more open to international
 and non-governmental review of human rights practices
 in Bolivia than the Garcia Meza regime. The Permanent
 Assembly for Human Rights (PAHR), the country's principal
 non-governmental organization monitoring compliance with
 international conventions on human rights, flourished
 during the former, but is the subject of persecution
 by the latter's security forces.
 Several PAHR members have been arrested, including the
 asembly's president, Father Julio Tumiri, who was released
 to house detention at a monastery near Cochabamba in
 October after more than three months' imprisonment.
 Others have left the country or gone into hiding after
 being accused of protecting the rights of extremists
 and opponents of the regime.
 Despite repeated assurances to the contrary, the Garcia
 Meza regime has failed to live up to international commit-
 ments regarding the observance and furtherance of htman
 rights. It has come under severe criticism by the Organiza-
 tion of American States and the Andean Group for this
 failure.
 The regime did permit the visit of representatives of
 the International Labor Organization in October and at-
 tempted to use their visit to show that international
 accusations against the regime were false. All press
 statements concerning the visit were zade by regime spokes-
 men. Three representatives from Amnesty International
 also were permitted to visit Bolivia from November 12
 to 25. The conclusions of their visit have not been
 made public at this time. The military regime has invited
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission to visit Bo-
 livia. However, no date for such a visit has been arrang-
 ed. It has not responded to an August 8 request of the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission, the regional
 body most directly concerned, to conduct an investigation
 of the state of civil, political and human rights in
 the aftermath of the July 17 coup.
