 IRAN
 For the last three decades Iran has been engaged in a
 forced pace modernization of its economy and social
 system. During this period the Iranian Government has
 faced major internal and external challenges. Twice in
 this century, Iran has been partially occupied by the
 Soviet Union, whose objectives continue to be of major
 concern to the Iranian Government. Internally, Iran
 has faced strong opposition to its modernization and
 reform programs -- from both the entrenched landowners
 and conservative religious leaders and from the far
 left. Following a near takeover of the government by
 the communist Tudeh Party in 1953, the advocacy of
 communism was made illegal. In more recent years, small
 groups of extreme rightist and leftist terrorists, who
 have received substantial foreign support and training,
 have murdered a number of Iranian officials and six
 Americans.
 Since World War II, Iran has given high priority to
 economic development, providing such human needs as
 health care, social services, housing and education,
 and to the national integration of an ethnically and
 linguistically diverse population. Political power
 increasingly was concentrated in the monarchy. The
 government has dealt firmly -- and at times harshly --
 with persons from both left and right charged with
 committing acts against state security, or believed to
 constitute a serious political threat. Iran has relied
 on a military court system separate from the normal
 civilian court system when dealing with persons sus-
 pected of crimes against state security. Although
 procedures of this court have not adequately protected
 due process, some potentially significant improve-
 ments in this system were instituted during the past
 year.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Iranian Penal Code prohibits torture and provides
 severe penalties for violators. While the Government
 
 (351)
 
 
 352
 of Iran has not said so publicly, there are reliable
 reports that several relatively low-ranking officials
 have been tried and convicted for violations of
 the code. The Shah has publicly stated that torture is
 not now practiced.
 The 1976 report of Amnesty International offered
 documentation on specific cases of alleged torture
 going as far back as the 1960s. Amnesty's 1977 report
 does not refer to any cases of torture. The Interna-
 tional League for Human Rights 1976-77 annual review
 mentions torture. In Congressional testimony of
 October 26, 1977, the Chairman of the Executive Com-
 mittee of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)
 stated that the ICJ was not aware of any case of
 torture in Iran for at least the previous ten to
 eleven months. The Department of State itself has
 received in recent months significantly fewer allega-
 tions of torture in Iran than was the case in previous
 years and does not believe torture has been used
 recently.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Individual complaints as well as the reports of various
 international human rights organizations allege that
 prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners
 continue to be inadequate. The Government of Iran is
 attempting to improve prison conditions and treatment
 of prisoners. In 1977, at the initiative of the
 Iranian Government, the International Committee of the
 Red Cross twice inspected Iranian prisons. The U.S.
 Government has not seen the ICRC's reports of these
 inspections inasmuch as they are confidential and only
 for the use of the government concerned. Several
 foreign journalists also visited prisons within the
 last year. We believe the Iranian Government is
 committed to prison reform and that prison conditions
 have indeed improved.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Cases of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment have oc-
 curred. In 1976, it was our estimate that the number
 
 
 353
 of state security prisoners ranged between 3,300-
 3,700. During 1977, however, a series of amnesties
 and the normal completion of prison terms reduced
 the total to about 2,200, of which the large majority
 were in jail for crimes involving violence or conspir-
 acy to commit violence.
 Iranian law combines in one organization -- SAVAK (The
 State Organization for Security and Intelligence) --
 the duties of both the police and the examining magis-
 trate. In some cases, SAVAK has appeared to use its
 authority to arrest without a warrant anyone suspected
 of involve ment in a crime against state security.
 Pursuant to the French system, from which the procedure
 was copied, SAVAK-then has carried out an initial
 investigation and determined initial charges. Some
 individuals have been held up to several months while
 investigations were being conducted. During initial
 detention, counsel has not been provided for the
 detainee, and contact with family and friends has been
 prohibited or severely restricted.
 Amnesty International and the ICJ have criticized the
 combining in SAVAK of police and magistrate duties and
 the holding of prisoners for lengthy periods, sometimes
 incommunicado, without formal charging. An ICJ
 official representative presented to the Shah specific
 proposals for separating the police and magistrate
 functions and Amnesty International has also discussed
 the possibility of change with the government.,
 We also believe that the separation of these two
 functions would improve due process procedures.
 The Code of Military Procedures section dealing with
 bail-and initial charges against detainees has been
 changed by an amendment, which went into effect in
 December 1977. The key portion of the wording requires
 that a detainee "be questioned within 24 hours after he
 is brought before the examining magistrate who shall
 thereupon issue an appropriate warrant, be it a
 warrant for the release of the accused on bail or for
 his imprisonment." The ICJ representative questioned
 
 
 354
 whether this wording will offer sufficient protection
 to an individual in view of possible delay before the
 arrested person is brought before the magistrate.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil and criminal cases, except for the relatively
 few having to do with state security, are tried in
 the civilian court system in which full gurarantees
 of civil rights exist. In its 1976 report, the ICJ
 examined this regular judicial system and found it
 generally satisfactory. Administrative reforms
 enacted in the summer of 1977 have significantly
 speeded up trials in these civilian courts. Students
 and others brought to trial in civilian criminal
 courts have come before a judge within four days
 to three weeks time, depending on the complexity of
 the case. This is a significant improvement over
 conditions which pertained through most of the 1970s.
 Those accused of a crime related to state security, as
 defined in Iranian law, are tried before Iranian
 military courts and under the relevant legal code for
 these courts. Between 1973 and 1977 most of the state
 security trials were in camera, and the system appears
 to have contained important due process deficiencies.
 Potentially significant amendments to the military
 court code came into effect in December 1977. Now
 "civilian defendants may make their choice among
 civilian defense attorneys" (Article 182). The same
 article grants "complete freedom to the defense coun-
 sel." Under Article 184, counsel is now granted "up to
 15 days" (previously, five days) to study the case
 prior to trial. Article 192 has been changed so that
 "military tribunals shall always hold public sessions
 unless, in exceptional cases where a public session may
 be deemed to be against the public order, national
 interest or accepted moral standards." In the latter
 cases, the court will make a decision on the basis of
 the prosecutor's request for trial in camera. Article
 203 previously declared that "in the pronouncement of
 the verdict, the judges are free subject to the
 provisions of law." The new wording says judges
 "subject to provisions of law and with due regard to the
 
 
 355
 character of the defendant will pronounce their verdict
 in complete liberty and independence."
 The ICJ representative has stated that his organization
 views these amendments with "cautious optimism", while
 other non-governmental organizations have questioned
 the adequacy of the changes. The coming months should
 demonstrate the real significance of the changes and
 the extent to which important due process deficiences
 have been removed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Iran's constitutional law of 1907 states "Everyone's
 house and dwelling is protected and safeguarded. No
 one may enter forcibly into any dwelling except by
 order of and in conformity with the law." In normal
 practice, police officials apply to local magistrates
 for a warrant when they wish to search a home. Securi-
 ty police have acted in some instances without such a
 warrant.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Meeting the economic and social needs of Iianians,
 particularly the poor, has been emphasized by the
 government for nearly two decades, especiallysince the
 Shah gained secure control of the government in the
 early 1960s and instituted major economic and social
 development plans and the reform-program known as the
 Shah-People Revolution.
 Iran has had five-year development plans since the
 late 1940s, but it has been only since the 1973 in-
 crease in oil prices that the government has had
 significant financial resources to implement its,
 plans. Roughly two-thirds of 'the Iranian Government's
 total spending in the period 1973-78 can be classified
 as outlay for economic development and social welfare
 programs. Per capita income is now about $2,000.   The
 Shah-People Revolution emphasizes the fulfillment
 
 
 356
 of human needs. A major land distribution and reform
 program, initiated in the early 1960s, ended Iran's
 traditional feudalism and benefically affected at
 least a third of the population directly and perhaps
 another 30 percent indirectly. An early reform in-
 volved a profit-sharing scheme for industrial workers.
 A more recent addition to the program provides a stock
 divestiture system to pass 49 percent of the ownership
 of certain industries to workers and farmers. A
 literacy corps has helped over two million Iranians to
 read and write. A similar program related to health
 has helped move the services of doctors and nurses out
 into rural areas. During the past 15 years, life
 expectancy has increased from 41 to 53 years. An
 extension and development corps gives basic technical
 advice to the rural poor. Houses of Equity have
 been formed in many villages to provide prompt court
 service in minor cases covering a wide range of subjects.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Iranian law prohibits the advocacy of communism,
 attacks on the monarchy or the basic tenets of the
 political system, and advocacy of violence. The
 interpretations given at any particular time by the
 authorities as to what constitute violations of these
 prohibitions have on some instances limited freedom
 of speech, press and assembly.
 Foreign publications of many viewpoints, including
 some sharply critical of Iran and the Shah, are
 widely sold. Domestic newspapers and journals (radio
 and TV are government-owned) are bound by the restric-
 tions noted above and receive governmental guidance on
 how to treat what the government regards as sensitive
 issues -- particularly foreign policy and security
 matters. Government domestic policy and program
 implementation are discussed and criticized in the
 local media.
 
 
 357
 In a March 1976 report on Iran, an ICJ representative
 concluded that there are limitations on freedom of the
 press and freedom of speech resulting from the penal-
 ties which have been imposed for expression of dissent.
 In a brief comment in its November 1976 report, Amnesty
 International referred to "the suppression of political
 opposition" and an "atmosphere of fear."
 The PEN American Center has protested the government
 of Iran's alleged mistreatment of some writers and
 urged the re-activation of the Writers Association of
 Iran. So far, the government has not permitted the
 re-establishment of the Writers Association.
 According to law, labor in Iram is free to organize.
 The Iranian Workerd Organization, a governmentally con-
 trolled union, represents 17 federations which in turn-
 are composed of 750 unions having about 600,000 mem-
 bers. Strikes are illegal, but a substantial number of
 wildcat walkouts do occur.
 The Shia sect of Islam predominates in Iran, but the
 country is proud and supportive of its long history of
 religious tolerance which permits religious minorities
 to practice their faith openly and participate fully in
 civil life.
 Restrictions on the right of assembly are applied to
 persons seen by the Iranian authorities as advocating
 subversion, violence-or communist doctrines., Restric-,
 tions have been particularly tight on university
 campuses and have led periodically to clashes between
 security forces and students.and other dissidents. In
 November 1977, several gatherings involving students
 and others expressing opposition to the political
 system or complaining about alleged human rights
 violations were forcibly disbanded by the police.
 Some injuries resulted from this police action.
 About 200 individuals were arrested, but most were
 later released; fewer than 100 have been charged.
 It is expected that they will be tried for misdemeanors
 before the civil court system.
 
 
 358
 
 In January 1978, a clash took place in Qom between
 local police and demonstrators. The demonstrators
 were objecting to a newspaper attack on a conservative
 relgious leader, living in exile in Iraq, on the
 anniversary of the land reform and liberalization of
 women's rights carried out by the Shah's government 15
 years before. After unsuccessful police efforts to halt
 the protest march, shots were fired and up to 14
 people were killed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Iranians enjoy extensive freedom of movement within
 Iran and abroad. The government has denied passports
 to some individuals who the government believes will
 engage in activities abroad detrimental to the country.
 The provision, rooted in Islamic law, that a wife must
 have her husband's permission to travel abroad and a
 child under 18 must have his father's permission can
 in effect also restrict freedom of travel. These
 latter restrictions have been eased over the past
 year.
 Iranian law does not provide for emigration. However,
 Iranians who acquire citizenship in another country
 without previously informing the Government of Iran
 may apply to the government for recognition of their
 new citizenship status. Approval of such applications
 is normally extended. Also, Iranian citizens over
 25 years old who have completed their military obliga-
 tions may submit a renunciation of citizenship,
 which requires the approval of the Council of Ministers.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Iran is a constitutional monarchy with a lower legisla-
 tive body and a senate. The lower house and half the
 senate are elected under full adult suffrage. The other
 half of the senate are chosen by the Shah. Power
 and decision making are concentrated around the Shah.
 Two years ago one political party (Resurgence), which by decree
 encompasses all citizens, was established. This is the
 
 
 359
 only political party permitted to operate in Iran.
 The Government's stated objective is to develop a broad
 political movement-to support its development and
 modernization programs. Within the new party, there is
 critical debate, particularly on local bread-and-butter
 issues. Royal commissions and inspectorates, which
 have been increasingly active in recent months, di-
 rectly criticize government performance -- often on TV
 -- and the press is attentive to problems of waste and
 corruption. Over the past 18 months, decentralization
 has begun to pass modest decision-making and resource-
 allocating power to provincial and local government
 units. Elected provincial councils comment frequently
 on local administrative shortcomings;
 Some Iranians overseas, including students, regularly
 criticize the Iranian political system, including
 the limitations on political expression. Private
 letters objecting to specific aspects of the Iranian
 governmental system have been freely circulated in Iran
 recently. Amnesty International has objected to the
 creation of a one-party system.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Ron-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Until 1975 Amnesty International was the principal
 outside organization monitoring Iran's human rights
 practices. The Government of Iran, which was very
 irritated by Amnesty's criticisms of human rights
 conditions in Iran,particularly its allegation that
 there were 100,000 political prisoners, would not
 cooperate with that organization. During 1977, however,
 the Shah met privately with the Secretary General of
 Amnesty International and contacts with Amnesty have
 been maintained at other levels.
 On the other hand, the Government of Iran has been
 more forthcoming in dealing with the International
 Commission of Jurists. In 1975 government officials
 cooperated extensively with ICJ officials who were
 
 
 360
 preparing a report on human rights in Iran which was
 published in 1976. The Chairman of the Executive
 Committee of the International Commission of Jurists
 had a long audience with the Shah in 1977, during which
 a number of amendments to the military penal code were
 discussed, many of which were enacted into legislation
 later in the year.
 The Iranian Government invited the International
 Committee of the Red Cross to carry out two inspections
 of Iranian prisons. We do not know of any Iranian
 reply so far to the International League of Human
 Rights 1976-77 report. Finally, prison visits and
 interviews with prisoners by foreign journalists were
 arranged during 1977.
