 MALAWI
 Malawi's political, economic, and social development has been
 dominated by Life President Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda ever since he
 led the country to independence in 1964. Dr. Banda is also
 life president of Malawi's sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party (MCP). In practice, the Cabinet and Parliament
 are subordinate to the MCP Central Committee. Only candidates
 selected by the party and approved by the President may contest
 parliamentary elections. Constitutional amendments and laws
 passed by the Parliament mirror decisions already taken by
 President Banda.
 Police and party security organs--notably the Security and
 Intelligence Service (SIS), the MCP Youth League, and the
 Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP)-closely monitor a wide range of
 the population's activities. The police continue to commit
 serious human rights abuses. In contrast, the army has
 eschewed internal politics.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi is a
 predominantly agricultural economy operating under a relatively
 free enterprise environment. Nearly 90 percent of the
 population engages in subsistence farming. The main cash
 crops, grown mostly on estates, are tobacco, tea, coffee, and
 sugar. -Since independence, and with good management, the
 economy has grown steadily, with a major portion of that growth
 in the agricultural sector.
 Malawi's poor human rights record stands in sharp contrast to
 its economic achievements and humanitarian handling of Africa's
 largest refugee population. In 1991 the Government and party
 kept strict control on all aspects of political life, with
 continued restrictions on speech, press, assembly, association,
 and the right of citizens to change their government through
 democratic means. Police abuse of prisoners and detainees,
 including women, persisted. The Government continued also to
 use arbitrary detention, especially under the Preservation of
 Public Safety Act, to counter alleged opponents. The
 Government released 88 political detainees in the first half of
 1991, including Professor Jack Mpanje and several other
 prominent persons long held without charge or trial. It did
 not, however, release Orton and Vera Chirwa, who have long been
 the focal point of international concerns about human rights
 abuses in Malawi, and a number of other political detainees and
 prisoners, estimated at year's end at between 15 and 20.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings in 1991. However, Fred
 Kazombo Mwale, a nephew of President Banda and a detainee since
 June 1991, is believed to have died in November while in
 custody. Kazombo suffered from high blood pressure,
 exacerbated by the deleterious conditions of Nsanje Prison. In
 the case of Mkwapatira Mhango, a leading Malawian dissident who
 was murdered in Zambia in October.1989 (along with eight
 members of his family), the five Malawians detained as suspects
 by Zambian authorities were handed over to Malawian officials
 in mid-1991. They were reportedly released 1 month later.
 
 
 MALAWI
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 reasons in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of institutionalized torture persist. Beatings
 during arrest and detention are illegal but common. Guilty
 officers are rarely disciplined. Human rights organizations
 have reported that some criminal prisoners have been subjected
 to "hard core" punishment in which the person is chained naked
 to thq floor of a cell and denied adequate food for 30 days.
 Prison terms and conditions are harsh and frequently degrading,
 particularly in Nyachikadza (Nsanje) prison on the Shire river
 marshes in southern Malawi, where malaria is also a constant
 danger. Women appear to be particularly ill-treated, including
 at the country's main prison in Zomba. Reports persist
 concerning sexual abuse of women prisoners by their warders.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the Minister of
 Justice (a position held by President Banda) may order the
 arrest, search, and detention of persons considered a threat to
 public order. Persons arrested under this law may be, and
 usually are, detained without charge or trial. The President
 is supposed to review such cases every 6 months, but this
 constitutional safeguard has had no noticeable effect on
 presidential decisions.-
 Police officers may also arrest persons on their own authority
 for up to 28 days before a formal detention order is issued.
 Historically, persons often have been held for months before
 being served-detention.1apers, if ever. In 1990 improved
 police performance helped to ensure that most new detainees
 were processed properly within the 28-day limit, but it did not
 prevent the Government from issuing detention orders in 1991 to
 stifle any sign of dissent.
 During the first half of 1991, the President, in an unexplained
 surprise move, released 88 political detainees. None of them
 was even given an official explanation as to why they had been
 detained. Those released comprise more than 80 percent of the
 number of known political detainees and included several
 prominent figures.
 Among those released were Professor'Jack Mapanje, former head
 of the University of Malawi's Department of Literature; Dr.
 George Mtafu, Malawi's only neurosurgeon; and Margaret Marango
 Banda, a prominent Anglican lay leader. Mapanje and Mtafu were
 reinstated professionally but immediately went abroad to teach
 and study. Others released without explanation included Brown
 Mpinganjira, Ishmael Mazunda, Blaise Machila, L.W. Masiku, and
 Ian Mbale.
 Among new detentions in 1991 were the two daughters of Gwanda
 Chakuamba Phiri, a former minister convicted and imprisoned in
 1980 for an alleged coup plot. -They were held for 2 months for
 allegedly helping their father smuggle out of prison
 correspondence that questioned the country's leadership and
 direction. In May President Banda detained his nephew, 65-year
 old Fred Kazombo Mwale, and imprisoned him at Nsanje prison
 
 
 222
 MALAWI
 without charge. He died in November. Two of Kazombo's wives
 were also detained, albeit in prisons with better conditions.
 Kazombo reportedly had abused his position as de facto
 patriarch of the President's family to seize lands from
 neighboring smallholders.
 George Chikuni, former Malawian Ambassador to South Africa, was
 arrested in January 1990 for fiscal irregularities while
 assigned to Pretoria. Chikuni was convicted of a misdemeanor
 in 1991, and, after he had spent a year in jail, a magistrate
 gave him a suspended sentence. The police refused to release
 him, possibly because President Banda is known to have
 personally expressed his displeasure over Chikuni's behavior.
 Government secrecy precludes an accurate estimate of the number
 of political detainees and prisoners in Malawi, but at the end
 of 1991 experienced observers put the number at between 15 and
 20, including Orton and Vera Chirwa (see Section l.e.). Martin
 Machipisa Munthali, who was first detained in 1965, remained in
 prison at year's end; he is now considered Africa's longest
 serving political detainee. Aleke Banda, once a confidant and
 likely successor to President Banda (no relation), was quietly
 released from Mikuyu prison in late 1988 but is still
 restricted to house arrest on the Mpyupyu prison farm near
 Zomba. He is allowed periodic visits from family members.
 Detained in 1980, Aleke Banda has never been charged. Dr. Dany
 (Goodluck) Mhango, detained in 1987 after his brother
 (Mkwapitira Mhango, murdered in Lusaka in 1989) published
 hostile articles outside Malawi, remained in Mikuyu prison.
 Mary Sikwese, sister of Fred Sikwese, remains in detention
 after she complained about her brother's death while in police
 custody in 1989. Frackson Zgambo, detained with Sikwese,
 allegedly for espionage, also remained in detention.
 Former teachers' association official Kalusa Chimombo has been
 detained since 1978. Others detained include Sylvester Gondwe,
 .he sales manager for a large petroleum distributor; he was
 detained in September for unknown reasons, subsequently
 dismissed from his job, and then released in December. Abdul
 Juneja Lemani, a merchant from the Mwanza district, was
 detained in November after allegedly expressing a lack of
 confidence in the ability of the police to protect area
 residents from border-crossing RENAMO forces.
 While forced exile has not been used as a means of political
 control, there is a small but constant exodus of persons who
 leave for- political reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malawi has both traditional and European court systems. Legal
 counsel is permitted only in the modern courts. The right of
 appeal exists in both systems. Both are empowered to try
 capital offenses, including treason, but in practice the modern
 courts hear mostly civil cases. Although constitutionally
 mandated, neither judiciary is truly independent. Executive
 interference in the modern court system is rare in civil cases
 but common in those of a political or security nature, which
 usually come before the traditional courts.
 The European court system consists of magistrate's courts, the
 High Court, and the Supreme Court of Appeal. The President
 appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court and, after
 consultation with the judicial service commission, other court
 justices. The courts are open to the public, and defendants
 
 
 223
 MALAWI
 are charged publicly. Crowded dockets, however, can delay
 serious cases from being heard for up to 4 years. In criminal
 cases, the defendant waits in prison during the interval.
 The traditional courts, which try over 90 percent of all
 criminal cases, are the most accessible to the average
 Malawian. Over 300 traditional courts, dispersed among
 Malawi's 24 districts and 3 regions, hear several hundred
 thousand civil and criminal cases each year. Traditional court
 justices are appointed directly by the President, including to
 the National Traditional Appeal Court. In practice, they are
 drawn from the ranks of MCP officers and exercise their party
 responsibilities concurrently. Police officials handle the
 prosecution, and defendants conduct their own defense.
 The executive branch seldom interferes in traditional court
 cases involving customary (tribal) law but does so routinely in
 political and security cases. The traditional courts were
 designed by Orton Chirwa (the first Minister of Justice) to
 handle small claims, family, and customary disputes in order to
 accelerate the delivery of justice to Malawi's largely rural
 and illiterate population.
 Traditional courts were not empowered to try treason cases
 until 1977 when President Banda sought to ensure the conviction
 and subsequent execution of a secretary general of the Malawi
 Congress Party-who had allegedly plotted his overthrow.
 Similarly, the President directed that Orton and Vera Chirwa be
 tried by the traditional court in 1983 in which few, if any,
 procedural safeguards are available. Banda subsequently
 commuted the Chirwas' death sentences to life imprisonment.
 Despite appeals from many human rights organizations, the
 Chirwas' remained in prison at year's end, reportedly in poor
 health. Orton Chirwa is now 73 years old.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those merely suspected of economic crimes,
 such as illegal currency transactions. These revocations
 sometimes have political overtones and have been heavily
 weighted against the Asian community. However, the Act has not
 been invoked in recent years, and in 1991 restitution of
 certain properties seized earlier was made.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police may enter houses of suspects at will under special entry
 authority to conduct searches for incriminating evidence or
 suspects. Telephones are routinely tapped, and an extensive
 network of informers reports private statements and actions to
 the Government. Authorities regularly open domestic and -
 international mail and sharply increased this practice in
 1991. Malawi's security services feared the effects of
 accelerating democratization trends in neighboring countries.
 Malawian law permits the Government to designate certain
 districts as "special areas" where citizens may be stopped,
 questioned, and searched on the street. Most special area
 districts are in the north. Although this has been an unused
 statute in recent years, its residual effect has contributed to
 the north's sense of disenfranchisement.
 9
 Membership in the ruling Malawi Congress Party is not legally
 mandatory, but it is frequently coerced, and membership is
 expected of those who seek access to government services or
 
 
 224
 MALAWI
 entrance to local markets, even babies carried on their
 mothers' backs.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and press are severely circumscribed i. Malawi. It
 is an offense, punishable by 5 years' imprisonment, to publish
 anything likely "to undermine the authority of, or public
 confidence in, the Government." It is punishable by life
 imprisonment to send out of the country "false information"
 which may be "harmful to the interests or good name of
 Malawi." At least one journalist was arrested and held in 1991
 under this provision. In practice, giving critical information
 to foreign journalists can result in detention without trial.
 Any discussion of Malawi's political future or speculation
 about the President's age is prohibited, although the elderly
 President's oft-predicted passing is now a common topic of
 conversation. A few years ago, speculation about the eventual
 succession would have guaranteed detention.
 Malawi's two newspapers and government-owned radio exist
 primarily to catalog the President's words and deeds.
 Nevertheless, local media do not submit material to the
 Government beforehand but exercise careful self-censorship.
 Even so, journalists, including senior editors, have been
 jailed for extended periods after overstepping undefined
 boundaries. In July two editors of the daily newspaper were
 detained by police for between 4 hours and 4 days when they
 published an editorial that implied minor police corruption in
 the traffic department. In the same month, the editor of a
 monthly magazine was detained overnight when he published a
 letter from the dean of the University of Malawi law school
 that gave a legal interpretation of the country's strict dress
 code that was contrary to the interpretation enforced by the
 Inspector General of Police. The law school dean was also
 briefly held.
 Criticism of various government departments' efficiency does
 appear in the newspapers and often in parliamentary debate.
 While reporting on democratic tendencies in Malawi is taboo,
 there was considerable print coVerage, but no radio coverage,
 of worldwide democratic developments during 1991, especially in
 other parts of Africa. The multiparty movement in neighboring
 Zambia received surprisingly impartial coverage.
 The newly formed Journalists' Association of Malawi was
 formally registered in 1991 and held a I-week media workshop to
 hLghlight the role of the press. The Association also
 remonstrated with the Inspector General of Police when its
 members were briefly incarcerated, a confrontation that would
 have been inconceivable in Malawi only a few years ago. In
 July the June issue of Africa South magazine was banned in
 Malawi because it contained discussion of a report criticizing
 widespread human rights violations.
 Foreign journalists must request permission to enter Malawi and
 must specify in advance the topics they intend to cover. They
 are also asked to specify who they intend to interview. The
 Government continues to permit some Western journalists to
 visit Malawi.
 Academic freedom is limited by the general restrictions on
 speech and press. The long detentions of Professors Mapanje
 
 
 MALAWI
 and Machila, who were finally released in 1991, remind
 university professors of the definite bounds to academic
 inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political meetings are not permitted outside the framework of
 the Malawi Congress Party. Persons may be imprisoned if they
 further the aims of an "unlawful society," defined as "any
 group considered to be dangerous to the good government of the
 republic." A gathering of three or more persons may be
 construed as an unlawful assembly under Malawian law.
 Individuals and organizations can and do associate freely
 concedrning nonpolitical matters.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or preferred religion, and religious groups
 generally may establish places of worship and train clergy.
 However, religious groups are required to register with the
 Government, and an informal presidential decree that no new
 religious groups should be registered .in Malawi has taken on
 the force..of law. The ban has served to prevent legitimate
 religious groups, such as the Mormons, from establishing a
 registered presence in Malawi.
 Jehovah's Witnesses, whose religious convictions, inter alia,
 prevent them from joining the MCP or .any other political party,
 have been banned since 1967. Relations between the Government
 and-the Witnesses remain tense and regularly elicit hostile
 outbursts from senior officials.- Several Jehovah's Witnesses
 are imprisoned for their religious beliefs. In October some
 local officials publicly criticized Mozambican refugees who
 were openly proselytizing for the Jehovah's Witnesses faith.
 Many of these refugees, it turned out, were originally
 Malawians who had fled Malawi's persecution of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses during the 1970's. However, credible reports
 indicate that several hundred were forcibly repatriated to
 Mozambique.
 Religious publications, like others, may not criticize the
 Government or the party. Most religious groups are free to
 establish and maintain links with coreligionists in other
 countries, and members are free to travel abroad.
 Malawi's sizable Muslim minority .(estimated at 20 percent of
 the population) conducts its religion and builds mosques
 freely. Foreign Islamic organizations have funded the latter
 with no governmental interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Legal provisions exist for testricting movement of those
 convicted of political or criminal offenses. Denial of
 passports on political grounds is common. Credible evidence
 suggested that SIS agents followed persons suspected of
 opposition to the Government out of Malawi in 1991. Civil
 servants and employees of state-owned'enterprises must obtain
 written permission to travel abroad, even on vacation, although
 such clearance now appears to be routine.
 Formal emigration is neither restricted nor encouraged.
 However, Asian residents and citizens, while free to travel
 within the country, must nominally reside and work in one of
 
 
 226
 MALAWI
 four urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe).
 In Lilongwe, a planned capital, they must also live within
 certain neighborhoods. During 1991 the Government did not
 strictly enforce those restrictions.
 Malawi hosts the largest refugee population in Africa. Over
 900,000 Mozambicans-more than 10 percent of Malawi's
 population-are now located in rural areas in nearly half of
 Malawi's 24 districts. Some refugees live in camps, but many
 live within or adjacent to existing villages. In both cases,
 their presence has increased deforestation and put pressure on
 scarce arable land. The strain on Malawi's economy, as well as
 its transportation and social services networks, has been
 severe. More recently, security from cross-border attacks has
 become a greater concern. Public discontent at the burden has
 been rising at an alarming rate, but in 1991 President Banda
 again reaffirmed Malawi's commitment to offer asylum to all who
 are forced to flee Mozambique's brutal civil war.
 There were credible reports that hundreds of refugees were
 forcibly repatriated because they were members of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, a banned religious group. Voluntary repatriation
 has been very limited. The Government has cooperated with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other
 international relief efforts.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Malawi cannot change their national government
 through democratic means. Major, and many minor, political
 decisions are made by the President or his closest associates.
 Opposition political parties are prohibited. In 1991 there
 appeared to be emerging support at the grassroots level for a
 multiparty movement, as some persons began to discuss more
 openly a post-Banda political system.
 The Malawi Congress Party structure provides for some choice
 among candidates for party (every 3 years), parliamentary
 (every 5 years), and other offices--all by secret ballot.
 Nominees for political seats, however, are carefully selected
 by the MCP and approved by the President. The National
 Assembly, consisting of both elected and a few appointed
 members, is mainly concerned with ratifying preordained
 policy. Its independence and powers are broadly based in law
 but highly circumscribed in practice.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental human rights organizations are not
 permitted. At best, human rights issues can be touched on
 tangentially by the Malawi Law Society which, in recent years,
 has been able to debate in public some aspects of existing law
 with increasing candor. In November Justin Malewezi, the
 nation's top civil servant and the government official most
 closely involved with human rights issues, was fired.
 Malewezi, an effective force for constructive change in Malawi,
 had contributed to human rights reform, though his dismissal
 seems not to be related to his work in that area. The
 Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International to visit prisons or conduct human rights
 investigations.
 
 
 227
 MALAWI
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Membership in the ruling party, the MCP, or its organs is not
 open to Malawians of Asian or European descent. In addition
 there are regional differences between the north and the rest
 of Malawi. Northerners have experienced considerable
 discrimination by the Government in the past, most recently in
 1989, when President Banda lent his weight to a campaign that
 resulted in many northerners losing jobs in the south and being
 forced to return to their region or go into exile abroad.
 Several of the most important political prisoners, including
 Orton and Vera Chirwa, are from the northern region. Since
 1990 the Government has made a concerted effort to downplay
 regiohalism as a domestic issue. Northerners continued to hold
 important positions within the Government and Parliament, but
 few are permitted to advance to high positions within the
 police, the Government's primary instrument to enforce internal
 security.
 Asian residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have been
 compelled to transfer'ownership of rural shops and trucking
 businesses to ethnic Africans. Strict rules govern where
 Asians may own property, although these were relaxed
 considerably during 1991. Malawi's official government
 hostess, C. Tamanda Kadzamira, has recently gone to
 considerable lengths to draw Asian women into her new National
 Women's Development Organization (CCAM). Despite these
 informal changes, many persons in the small but prosperous
 Asian community of about 5,000 question their long-term future
 in Malawi.
 In Malawi women are equal under the law, and tribal leadership
 structures remain primarily matrilineal in the central and
 southern regions of the country. However, in practice women do
 not have opportunities' equal to those of men. Historically,
 most women have been unable to complete even a primary
 education and are at a serious disadvantage in:the job market.
 The Government presently reserves for women 33 percent of the
 places in the secondary school system, although-the actual
 number of attendees is less. The Government has also
 cooperated closely with international donors seeking to enhance
 -educational opportunities for women at all levels, e.g., with a
 U.S.-assisted $20 million program designed to improve the basic
 education of girls.
 In practice, women are also disadvantaged under the law through
 ignorance.. In 1991 the National Commission of Women in
 Development, working with the CCAM and the Malawi Law Society,
 held a well-publicized workshop and began work on the
 publication and distribution of a bilingual handbook on women's
 legal rights.
 The Government is also slowly giving recognition to the
 importance of women as agricultural producers, as approximately
 70 perceht of all smallholder farms and over 50 percent of
 subsistence holdings are headed by women. When buying and
 selling "saleable" property, men and women have equal rights.
 However, with "customary" property (land in transition),
 succession in the northern region reverts to male family
 members, whereas succession in the southern region reverts to
 female family members. The Ministry of Agriculture now has a
 separate women's extension program specifically designed to
 accommodate their needs. Women enjoy access to maternal health
 
 
 228
 MALAWI
 services and to extension programs, but infant and child
 mortality remain extremely high.
 Malawi continues to maintain a strict dress code for women.
 Pants and shorts are not permitted in public, and dress length
 must be below the knees. In 1991 the police began a strict
 enforcement of these rules; several women were arrested and
 fined.
 Malawi has no tradition of violence against women; however, a
 few small ethnic groups continue to practice female
 circumcision.
 Section 6 Worker Rights:
 a. The Right of Association
 Only nongovernment workers have the legal right to form and
 join trade unions. Unions represent from 10 to 20 percent of
 Malawi's small labor force in the money economy; most organized
 wage workers are unskilled laborers on large agricultural
 estates. Unions are required by law to affiliate with the
 Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM). The TUCM, like both the
 Employers Consultative Group and the Associated Chambers of
 Commerce, is a private organization ostensibly independent of
 the Malawi Congress Party, but in practice its activities are
 highly circumscribed by the Government. Restrictive colonial
 labor legislation has been subsumed largely intact into
 Malawian law.
 While technically legal, strikes are not tolerated in Malawi.
 Ministry of Labor officers are quick to intervene at the first
 hint of labor unrest. There were no efforts to strike in 1991.
 The TUCM associates with international labor organizations and
 is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 and the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council which
 is headquartered in Lilongwe.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to organize, but the law does
 little to restrict antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Complaints are resolved by the Ministry of Labor. When
 employees and employers cannot reach agreement on a labor
 issue, a labor officer from the Ministry of Labor meets with
 the two sides in an attempt to reach a consensus. This is
 usually successful. The labor officer does not decide the
 outcome himself.
 Collective bargaining is protected by law, but in practice its
 use is limited by stark market realities. Skilled workers are
 in demand in Malawi and have enjoyed relative success when
 negotiating contracts. However, unskilled workers are in
 oversupply, and this holds down their wages. The Government
 does not intervene overtly in the collective bargaining process.
 Management-labor councils (called "work committees") mediate
 labor issues at the workplace. There are standing management-
 labor councils in large industries and businesses. The
 composition of these is generally half labor and half
 management. Grievances of all kinds can be handled by these
 committees (including wage issues) as long as they relate to
 work at that particular place of employment. When wage
 negotiations concern an entire industry nationwide, then the
 
 
 229
 MALAWI
 Government involves itself in the discussions, and again all
 parties work until a consensus is reached.
 There are no export processing of free trade zones in Malawi.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor, which was widely practiced during colonial times,
 has never been formally outlawed, but it is opposed by the
 Government and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 14, but this applies only to the
 small urban wage sector where it can be enforced by labor
 inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. The law concerns young
 workers throughout the country, but it is less easily enforced
 in rural areas. Overall, enforcement is not considered to be
 effective. Aso,'because there is no law providing compulsory
 education for children, many children are available for daily
 employment. In the large subsistence agriculture sector, where
 most Malawians work, children help on family farms at a much
 younger age. Many also work on plantations, where they are
 paid substantially less than the legal minimum wage.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Less than 15 percent of the work force is employed in the
 formal wage .sector. In May 1989, the Minimum Wage and
 Conditions of Employment Act nearly doubled the minimum daily
 wages in Malawis three cities, but perhaps a quarter of the
 work force receives less than the legal minimum wage because of
 poor enforcement and because many workers are unaware they are
 entitled to a minimum wage. The legal minimum wage is not
 adequate for a decent living and is often supplemented by
 additional'employment. Minimum wages vary from urban to rural
 areas. For those fortunate enough to hold paying jobs, wages
 and working conditions are generally adequate to maintain
 slightly better than a subsistence standard of living. Many
 subsistence farmers supplement their earnings by working as
 tenants on nearby estates. Labor laws address normal
 employment practices but do not cover tenancy agreements, and
 abuses'aye widespread.
 The maximum workweek in Malawi is 48 hours or less. Workers
 have Sundays and official holidays off from work or must be
 paid overtime. Paid holidays and safety standards in the
 workplace are required by law. However, enforcement of safety
 standards by Ministry of Labor inspectors is erratic.
