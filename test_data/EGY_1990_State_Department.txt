 EGYPT
 Egypt is'a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National DemocraticF Party (NDP), are the dominant-political
 forces. *The NDP, in power-slncO 1978, commands large
 majorities--n the two parliamentary bodies, the People's
 Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council; three of the
 eight legal opposition parties have some representation in the
 Parliament. "The'Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, is
 appointed by and responsible to the President. 'Mohammed Hosni
 Mub rak'was-elected President by the People's Assembly in 1981
 and-reelected;t6 a second 6-year term in July 1987. In
 accordance with the Constitution, his reelection wds affirmed
 by a popular referendum.
 Internal security is the responsibility of several different
 organizations. Of the three intelligence services, the
 General Directorate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI),
 which reports to the Interior Ministry, is the main agency
 responsible for domestic security, although there are several
 other police services, including the Central Security Force
 which protects public buildings, facilities, and foreign
 missions. Investigations pertaining to national security may
 be undertaken by any of the three intelligence agencies,
 depending on the nature of the case. The GDSSI conducts most
 undercover investigations of domestic opponents of the
 Government, and also carries out interrogations of suspects
 arrested under Egypt's state of emergency legislation. It has
 been linked to many of the reports of torture and abuse of
 prisoners and detainees.
 Egypt's economy has diversified over the past two decades.
 Petroleum and tourism have grown in importance; remittances
 from Egyptians working abroad are a major source of foreign
 exchange. An inefficient public sector dominates the economy,
 and the Government also maintains an extensive network of
 subsidies and regulations as part of a social contract
 perceived by major segments of the population as essential to
 their economic security. The Government continues to face
 severe economic problems, including sluggish growth, rising
 inflation, and shortages of foreign exchange. Efforts at
 reform aimed at reducing the large budget deficit and
 increasing the role of market forces in the economy have
 proceeded very slowly, owing to deep-seated social and
 political resistance.
 The pattern of human rights abuses evidenced in 1989 was
 essentially undiminished in 1990; many basic rights remained
 significantly restricted. The primary problems continued to
 be torture of detainees and the Government's failure generally
 to investigate, try, and punish perpetrators of such abuses;
 the Emergency Law that permits prolonged detention without due
 process; an increase in the use of lethal force against
 Islamic extremists; and various restrictions on political
 activities, which interfere with the citizens' ability to
 change their government by democratic means. In addition to
 resorting to detention procedures contained in the ordinary
 criminal procedure code, the Government continued its use of
 Emergency Law authority-currently in effect until 1991--to
 detain a wide variety of persons suspected of involvement in
 subversive activities, including the innocent relatives of
 such persons. The number of political detainees is at least
 1,000, including Islamic activists, their relatives, strikers,
 and minors. Most were released after a brief period of
 detention. Those most likely to suffer from human rights
 abuses are Muslim activists or extreme leftwing groups
 perceiied to be a threat to the Government. Fot example, in
 
 
 1409
 EGYPT
 October and November, hundreds of supporters of the al-Gama'a
 al-Islamiya were detained in connectio with the assassination
 of Parliament Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub. Women continue to
 suffer from discrimination and abuses sanctioned by tradition,
 and there are significant restrictions on women's rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While there were no confirmed reports of unlawful government-
 instigated killings for political reasons, there continued to
 be reports of deaths of persons in official custody, and there
 was a sharp increase in 1990 in the number of incidents where
 security forces used lethal force. In response to an upsurge
 in violence from extreme fundamentalist religious groups,
 principally in upper Egypt, security forces shot dead 36
 people during attempts to arrest demonstrators, the majority
 from Islamic activist groups, between February and August.
 Twenty-seven were killed in April alone. Among prominent
 political killings were those of Dr. Alaa' Mohiedden, a
 prominent figure in the Islamic extremist group, al-Gama'a
 al-Islamiya, in September and Speaker of the People's Assembly
 Rifaat Mahgoub in October. Both killings remain unsolved, but
 Mahgoub's death was widely assumed to be the work of
 terrorists. In the case of Mohiedden, some observers
 attributed it to security forces while others, speculated it
 may have been rivals within his own organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearances in 1990.
 The case of Zaharia Sayd Bahr, a soldier active in the Tagammu
 Party who has been'missihg since December 28., 1988, continued
 unresolved. The Government has not provided any new,
 information on this caqe.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other forms of mistreatment are forbidden by the
 Constitution and the law, but convincing reports indicate they
 continue to be practiced by police. and security officials.
 Punishment of such actions is rare. During the year the
 Government took no known effective action specifically aimed
 at curtailing such abuses. The Arab Organization for Human-
 Rights (AOHR}, in its 1990 annual report, states that torture
 and maltreatment were not restricted to detainees and
 political prisoners. Egyptian human rights activists cite
 cases where ordinary citizens or those arrested in
 nonpolitical cases were subjected to maltreatment inside
 police stations and 5ails. They believe the incidence of
 torture has risen throughout the year. In early August state
 security forces,.for example, detained a newspaper journalist
 for approximately 45 days on suspicion that he was a member of
 an Islamic fundamentalist group. Reports indicate that he was
 tortured repeatedly during his detention. In addition,
 although the State Prosecutor ordered that the journalist be
 examined by a doctor while in prison, no such examination took
 
 
 1410
 EGYPT
 place. To date the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights
 (EQHR) and the AOHR have yot received responses from the
 Government tO their inquiries into allegations of torture by
 security forces.
 Egyptian courts will not accept confessions or testimony
 considered to have been obtained under torture and have
 ordered the release of defendants in a number of politically
 significant state security trials where forensic evidence
 indicated'that torture had taken place. Detainees and
 prisoners who claim to have been tortured can and do appeal
 for redress to the courts and State Prosecutor, but the
 numbers who do so are small. Also, not all cases of alleged
 torture can be adequately documented because of the claimant's
 lack of access to forensic medical facilities during his
 detention., The law prqvides for jail sentences ranging from 3
 to 10 yeais for officials convicted-of torture, and first
 degree'murder charges may be brought against those who inflict
 torture resulting in the victim's-death. While defendants are
 acquitted with'some regularity because of credible allegations
 .of torture by polibe or security officials, there is no record
 of officials serving jail sentences for practicing torture,
 nor do prosecutors appear willing to use their offices to
 pursue vigorously-an end to the practice. In rare cases the
 courts award financial compensation to torture victims. There
 were several cases .in 1990 in which police officers were
 investigated and tried on charges of torture. In July police
 officers were given'a 1-yearouspended sentence for torturing
 a detainee to death. In April the Cairo Appeals Court ordered
 the Interior Ministry to pay about $60,000 to one victim's
 family in a case in 1988 in which police officers tortured to
 death a son who refused to testify against'his father.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Using proisionsof'the, almost permanent Emergency Law,
 arbitrary detentions of government critics have become
 commonplace. Two'systems-of criminal procedure are in
 effect: ordinary ctiminal procedures and the Emergency Law.
 Under ordinary procedures, arrests follow investigations, and
 arrested persons are charged with violations of specific
 laws. Arrested persons have the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention, and there is a
 system of bail. The ordinary law states that a detained
 suspect must be brought before a magistrate and formally
 charged withii 48 hours of his arrest or be released. By and
 large, there is careful observance of constitutional and legal
 safeguards 'in the arrest and pretrial custody stages in
 nonpolitical cases. Arrests occur openly and with warrants,
 and the adcused are-brought before an independent judiciary.
 However, under the state of emergency the magistrate in
 security cases is the State Prosecutor, who can use the
 Criminal Procedure Code and Law 105 of 1980 to hold suspects
 longer (up to 60 days) than under Article 6 of the Emergency
 Law before permitting a challenge to the legality of the
 detention bef6re a court of law. According to Amnesty
 International (AI), the State Prosecutor has used the Criminal
 Procedure Code more frequently than the Emergency Law to
 detain security-suspects.
 The Constitution and the Emergency Law empower the President,
 when he finds that national security or public order are in
 peril, to invoke emergency powers authorizing the arrest and
 detention of persons suspected of being dangerous to national
 
 
 1411
 
 EGYPT
 security, irrespective of provisions of the penal code.
 Egyptian law specifies a wide range of offenses deemed harmful
 to national security, which may be tried before a parallel
 system of State Security Courts under the emergency
 legislation. Despite a provision of the Constitution which
 provides that a state of emergency may only be imposed in case
 of war, foreign invasion, civil strife, or natural disaster, a
 state of emergency has been imposed almost without
 interruption for the last 41 years and continuously since the
 assassination of President Sadat in 1981. Under the Emergency
 Law a person may be held indefinitely without charge or due
 process while an investigation is conducted.
 The Minister of Interior acknowledged detaining 1,600 people
 during April and May after clashes between Islamic activists
 and police in upper Egypt. In most cases, detainees are
 released after interrogation and never brought to trial. In
 fact, Al noted--in a special report entitled, "Egypt:
 Arbitrary Detention and Torture Under Emergency Powers"-that
 "in recent years, only about 5 percent of those arrested for
 investigation in connection with security-related offenses
 have ever been brought to trial, suggesting that the great
 majority of such prisoners are held in the absence of any real
 evidence incriminating them in the offenses they are alleged
 to have committed." Detainees are sometimes held
 incommunicado. AI maintains that "in practice, political
 detainees' first access to legal counsel has been delayed for
 days or even weeks at a time. Many individuals are arrested
 without being allowed to inform their relatives of their
 detention."
 Exile is forbidden by law and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary includes f6ur types of regular courts: summary
 courts, primary courts, appeals courts, and the Court of
 Cassations (supreme court), and two kinds of special courts,
 the Court of Ethics and the- State Security Courts. The cour-ts
 are independent of the executive branch of government-
 The provisions in Egyptian law for public trial do not apply
 in state security cases. However, persons accused of certain
 security-related offenses, which may trigger Emergency Law
 provisions at the Interior Ministry's discretion, are usually
 tried in public sessions in the State Security Courts. These
 courts have less independence than other courts because their
 decisions may be challenged by the executive. However, the
 State Security Courts have, procedural safeguards (including
 the right of the defendant to be represented by an attorney-,
 the attorney's access to the prosecutor's investigation, and a
 prohibition against secret testimony), and their judges are
 drawn from the ranks of the senior judiciary. The- judgments
 of the State Security Courts may be appealed to the Higher
 State Security Court.
 Under the Emergency Law, only the President may amend,
 commute, or cancel a sentence or order a retrial. The law
 also grants the President the authority to approve or reject
 all rulings of the State Security Court system. In some
 cases, the President may order defendants in state security
 cases to be tried before military courts. Although the
 applicability of this provision to civilian defendants is
 repeatedly challenged on constitutional grounds, the State
 
 
 1412
 
 EGYPT
 Security Court in July 1989 rejected a challenge by the
 counsel for the defense to the original 1986 referral to a
 military court of a case involving defendants accused of
 burning video clubs. The case Was again assigned to a
 military court.' The Code of Criminal Procedure states that
 court hearings should be conducted'publicly, but permits the
 court to order part or all of the hearing to be conducted in
 secret session or to restrict access to the court "in order to
 preserve public order or morals." In the case against 20
 persons indicted for their role in the "Egypt's Revolution"
 organization, accused of killing 2 Israeli diplomats-and
 attempting to kill a number of other Israeli and American
 Embassy personnel in a series of attacks in 1984-1987, the
 court has not ordered the hearings to be held in secret
 session, but has restricted access to the courtroom to those
 who have obtained special permits from the court. The
 proceedings continue to be covered thoroughly in the press.
 No reliable statistics exist on the number of political
 prisoners. In September the Minister of Interior announced
 that 90G detainees were being held for political reasons.
 Opponents of the regime are not arrested for criticizing
 government leaders or policies. The Interior Ministry,
 though,-has drawn-a distinction between indoor opposition
 meetings, rallies, and discussions, which are tolerated, and
 public demonstrations, which are not. For the most part,
 those tried and convicted for their political activities have
 been members of groups advocating the violent overthrow of the
 regime. However, many people have been detained for
 questioning under the Emergency Law for varying periods
 without ever coming to trial.
 The High Judicial Council is empowered to override decisions
 by the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial appointments,
 promotions, and other personnel matters. The Council of
 State, a court system having jurisdiction over disputes
 between private citizens and government agencies, is
 independent of the Ministry of Justice, and its members are
 effectively safeguarded against arbitrary dismissal. In
 February the Higher State Security Court acquitted for the
 second time the 16 members of the so-called Armed Nasserite
 Group, accused in 1987 of conspiring with a foreign country to
 carry out hostile acts against Egypt, on the grounds that
 their confessions were obtained through torture and were
 therefore invalid. The first acquittal in 1988 was on the
 grounds that there was insufficient incriminating evidence.
 In March the same court acquitted 12 members of a so-called
 Communist group of attempting to overthrow the Government by
 advocating-communism, stating "advocacy without violence is
 not illegal in Egypt." In September the court acquitted all
 49 members of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiya--including Egypt's
 most prominent Islamic radical, Omar Abdurrahman, accused of
 inciting strife in 1989-ii% part because torture was used to
 extract their confessions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary
 interference in private life by the State or by political
 organizations, but this freedom is significantly abridged in
 cases under the Emergency Law. Ordinarily, police must obtain
 a warrant from the State Prosecutor before.undertaking
 arrests, searches, or seizures. On occasion the courts have
 
 
 1413
 
 EGYPT
 dismissed cases when they determined warrants were issued
 without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct
 searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal
 penalties, although this provision is seldom enforced. The
 Emergency Law empowers the President, or the Minister of the
 Interior acting as his deputy, to authorize searches of
 persons or premises without following normal procedures. In
 March state security officers detained the Secretary General
 of the EOHR at the airport and temporarily confiscated his
 books and papers.
 The internal security services have the capability to monitor
 telephone and other private conversations of the political
 opposition and a broad range of citizens suspected of illegal
 or subversive activity. There are persistent and credible
 reports of routine screening of, and in some cases
 interference with, correspondence, especially international
 mail. As with search warrants, telephone taps and mail
 screening normally require the prior authorization of the
 Public Prosecutor, but normal procedures do not prevail when
 the Emergency Law is invoked. The GDSSI and the other
 domestic intelligence agencies engage routinely in
 surveillance of opposition politicians,.political or social
 activists, foreign diplomats, and suspected subversives.
 Employees of most government facilities, public sector
 factories, and foreign embassies assume that their activities
 are monitored by government informants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press and the Government has to a large e;ctent refrained
 from curtailing political expression, restrictions do exist.
 Egyptians openly express their views without fear of
 retribution on a wide variety of political and social issues,
 sometimes airing-vigorous-criticism of the Government. Even
 in times of national emergency- as during the Pers;an- Gif
 crisis-when Egyptian forces were being deployed to Saudi
 Arabia, critics of the regime's policies engaged in extensive
 debates of the issues.
 There are both government-owned and privately owned
 newspapers. The major national dailies are government-owned.
 Their editors-in-chief are appointed by the presidency and can
 be dismissed by the NDP-dominated Shura Council. They
 generally reflect government thinking. The privately owned
 newspapers are free to publish material supporting the
 political inclinations of their sponsoring organizations.
 The Government influences the press in several ways. The
 State Security Prosecutor from time to time imposes bans on
 certain topics; in the past, such topics have included cases
 involving charges of corruption, the Egypt Revolution case,
 and political assassinations. The EOHR has claimed that the
 number of such bans has increased over recent years. Press
 content is also influenced by press guidance issued informally
 to the major dailies by senior officials such as the
 Information Minister about treatment of specific issues. This
 does not happen on a routine basis; usually the editors know
 the policy and are aware of the limits which they are expected
 to observe.
 
 
 1414
 EGYPT
 Press contft is' al so affected by the Shura Council, which
 supervises the press.to some extent through the Higher Press
 Council, a 457member body chaired by the Speaker of the Shura
 Council -nd composed of senior press figures. One of the
 Higher Press Council's functions is to'approve applications
 for new publications. The Government firmly controls the
 right to publish and no applications to publish independently
 owned joxrnals were approved in',1990. The Council's approval,
 however, is only required for publications appearing regularly.
 Allegations of torture and mistreatment by government
 officials were aired extensively in the opposition press in
 1990, ond opposition press coverige of the arrests of Islamic
 extremists and public demonstrations was not censored.
 Television and radio are wholly state-owned and hence follow
 government directives closely. In a major departure from its
 traditional policy of monopolistic control of television news,
 thePOE has recently announced plans to allow open
 broadcasting of'CNN.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in Arabic and other
 languages is available at newsstands and major hotels,
 although there are isolated reports of the seizure or
 censorship of foreign publications.
 Four different government institutions have the power to
 censor creative works, both of fiction and nonfiction. The
 army (military intelligence), the Ministry of Interior (state
 security), al-Azhar (morality and religion), and the Rikaba
 (the official state censor) all have the power to prevent
 produc.ioi or: publication of a work, censor a work, or
 confiscate a completed work. The range of influence of these
 organizations varies, however, according to the type of work
 and its subject matter.
 .Usually books are not sent either to the ministries or to
 al-Azhar for approval prior to publication. The work can be
 seized, however, after publication if the work is found to be
 offensive,'either politically or morally. If published and
 distributed in Egypt, controversial books are sometimes banned
 from overseas distribution. Plays and films, however, are
 subject to more intensive scrutiny.: Any play or movie
 generally must be approved both in .written form and in its
 final form as a play or film. For example, a censorship
 department in the Ministry of Culture banned a play entitled
 "The King is the King" in midseason after it became clear that
 it referred to President Mubarak's foreign travels to seek
 economic assiitance from Western donors.
 In the past, state security and military intelligence were
 primarily concerned with political works they felt could
 threaten public stability and security. Works that discussed
 society and religion were published quite freely. Al-Azhar's
 role, however, has expanded considerably in recent years, and
 works are being scrutinized much more heavily for moral and
 religious content. Traditionally, al-Azhar's Islamic Research
 Group (IRG) had been responsible for-reviewing only
 publications on the Koran itself and books on the Sunna (the
 sayings and acts of the prophet Mohammed). Recently the
 Government has allowed the IRG to expand its responsibilities
 considerably so that it gives opinions on the religious and
 moral nature of many other publications.
 
 
 1415
 EGYPT
 In May al-Azhar ordered "To Be or Not To Be" by Farag Foda, a
 well-known author and avowed secularist, confiscated and
 brought charges of blasphemy against him. An investigation
 was expected to be concluded in the near future. In some
 cases, at the request of al-Azhar, the Prosecutor General has
 initiated criminal court proceedings against the author. - In
 March, following several articles criticizing "The Distance in
 a Man's Mind" in one of the national dailies, author Ala'a
 Hamid, his- publisher, and the book printer were arrested and
 the book confiscated. Ramid was imprisoned on charges of
 blasphemy for 4 1/2 months before being released on bail in.
 early July. A verdict on the case is expected within the next
 few months. According to EOHR, Hamid is the first Egyptian to
 go to prison for his writings in the 20th century.
 The universities enjoy a considerable degree of academic
 freedom. In the past, faculty clubs at several universities,
 especially.the universities of Alexandria and Assiut, have
 held political discussions which led to friction..with the
 Minister of Interior and threats to dissolve the clubs.
 Faculty members are more likely to feel social pressure to
 conform than to experience any actual interference in their
 publications or research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the Emergency Law, the Government can and does place
 limitations on the constitutionally assured right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Ministry of Interior to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 In February the security forces stopped a symposium organized
 by the Cairo University Student Union on 'Problems Facing
 Females at Universities" and barred several of the invited
 speakers from entering the campus. In March the Ministry of
 Interior prohibited a ceremony in honor of the leader of the
 "Young Egypt" political party sponsored by the Socialist Labor
 Party. Generally, however, the Minister of Interior permits
 protest rallies on the campuses-and at the facilities of
 professional associations, particularly the Bar Association,
 and bans on such meetings were less frequent in 1990. Street
 demonstrations, however, were banned on the grounds that they
 are a likely source of violent disturbances. Islamic
 organizations are permitted to organize public religious
 ceremonies, often attended by tens of thousands of people, on
 major holidays, but persons regarded as Islamic radicals may
 still be denied permission to organize public assemblies.
 The Ministry of Social Affairs and local government
 administrative agencies have substantial control over
 associations and private institutions through government
 regulations which allow them to limit the actions of these
 organizations or intervene in their activities. Local
 government administrative agencies have direct or indirect
 control over the ability of associations and private
 institutions to own property or equipment, maintain and manage
 a budget, affiliate with organizations outside of the country,
 decide on their physical location, establish branch offices,
 appoint board members or managers when "negligence" occurs,
 arrange general assembly meetings, and implement any decisions
 taken at such meetings. The Ministry of Social Affairs or a
 local government administrative agency may also prevent the
 creation of an association or private institution, dissolve
 it, appoint half the board of directors for indefinite periods
 
 
 1416
 
 EGYPT
 of time, approve or reject other candidates for the board, and
 create"-and-ditectfederat-ions to oversee the activities of
 associations and private institutions.
 c.-- Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt iS an Islamic state which
 provides for freedom of religious expression and equality
 before the I-aw, regardless of religion. Egypt has a tradition
 of teligious"tolerance, and,:with some notable exceptions,. the
 authorities ,geuerally uphold the rghts of religious
 minorities and the rights -of- indiv'iduals to practice their
 religion. In accordaince with Islamic law, only Islam,
 Judaism, and-Christianity are fully recognized as religions
 with laws, traditions, and rites which must be respected. The
 overwhelming majority of Egyptians practice Sunni Islam or
 Coptic Christianity.-
 Coptic Orthodox Christians- the most significant religious
 minority, mty -constitute 10 iercent of the population,
 although their numbers are a subject -f dispute.-
 Coptic-Muslim "relations deteriorated in 1990 with a sharp
 increase in incidents of sectarian violence above the level of
 1989. During. March, April, and May Islamic extremists
 attacked Copts and destroyed their-property in several cities
 and villages in upper Egypt. Human rights activists as well
 as many Copts believe in some inttances security'forces were
 slow to protect Copts and their property and charge the
 Government with tr'eating the Copts more harshly'than Muslims.
 .In May'-security forces broke up a peaceful demonstration in
 Alexandria following the funeral of six slain Copts and
 -arrested and detained 23 Copts for 3 weeks.
 While most- Egyptian Jews emigrated in the 1950's and 1960's,
 those few who remain appear to practice-their faith without
 restriction or hArassnient.
 Various Protestant-denominations operate, some with
 significant Egypt-ian membership, .while others-have a small,
 largely expatriate following. Members of recognized religions
 may maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Other small
 religious groups continue to face difficulties.
 Christian missionaries who. engage in proselytizing Muslim
 Egyptians may be prosecuted under the penal code or  under the
 broad terms-of the Law of National Unity, even though '
 missionary work is not specifically banned. This represents a
 major departure from the traditional Islamic practice in which
 proselytizing Muslims -would be considered a capital offense.
 In May two- Swiss and one German were deported after being
 charged with spreading Christianity and sectarian strife among
 Muslims and Copts. In September an Egyptian Christian was
 arrested for "preaching and converting." Conversion from
 Islam, while officially not restricted or penalized, is
 discouraged by the Government, and even more so by social
 pressure. In a number -of cases involving converts from Islam,
 the security authorities have used the Emergency Law to arrest
 and detain converts, without bringing specific charges, on the
 grounds that converts threaten social peace and intercommunal
 relations. In September three converts were arrested by
 security forces; they are expected to be released in January
 1991. Those who convert cannot have the religion category
 changed on their national identity cards or other legal
 
 
 1417
 
 EGYPT
 documentation. All recognized faiths can, in principle,
 establish places of worship, run schools, and train enough
 clergy to serve believers. Synagogues and churches generally
 receive police protection. Under a law dating back to the
 Ottoman era, however, non-Muslims must obtain a series of
 permits culminating in a presidential decree to build or
 repair places of worship. While obtaining authorization is
 extremely difficult, the Government has permitted an average
 of 10 new churches to be built each year since 1982; in
 addition, it has issued an average of 5 permits for repairs or
 reconstruction during that same period.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction.
 Although the Government maintains that sermons by Islamic and
 Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim prayer
 leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for
 delivering allegedly inflammatory sermons in their mosques.
 The Ministry of Religious Endowments has also been known to
 substitute its prayer leaders at mosques for preachers it
 regards as troublesome, as well as to take over the
 administration of some privately run mosques considered to be
 centers of antigovernment activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are free to move within Egypt, except in
 well-defined military districts; there are additional
 restricted areas to which foreigners may not travel. There
 are exceptions to freedom of foreign travel and emigration in
 the case of males who have not completed compulsory military
 service; unmarried women under 21 or married women, who must
 obtain their father's or husband's permission to obtain a
 passport; and persons under investigation for criminal
 offenses or whose travel is banned by emergency law
 provisions. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return. There are no known cases of citizenship being revoked
 for political reasons. Under the state of emergency, the
 Prime Minister has authority, which he may delegate to the
 Interior Minister, to restrict foreign or domestic travel.
 Egypt's record on granting political asylum generally has been
 good, and the extradition of those granted political asylum is
 prohibited by the Constitution. Several thousand non-Egyptian
 Arabs residing in Egypt, including many Libyan dissidents and
 Kuwaitis, have been granted political asylum. Egypt also
 allows the children of some African refugees awaiting
 resettlement to study in Egyptian schools and grants residence
 to a number of elderly persons who have remained stateless
 since World War II.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Although the right exists theoretically, as a practical matter
 citizens do not have the ability to change the government by
 democratic means, and the political process remains
 significantly restricted. Since the 1952 Revolution, Egypt
 has had a political system characterized by a strong
 presidency. The dominant political party--for many years the
 only party--was an extension of the President's power and
 influence. Four former military officers, including Mubarak,
 have served as president in that period, but civilian
 
 
 1418
 
 EGYPT
 government has become increasingly separated from military
 influence. Nasser ruled a one-party state, Sadat created an
 embryonic .multiparty system, and President Mubarak has
 liberalized the political atmosphere by expanding somewhat the
 range of legal -opposition activities. while Mubarak's
 National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the political scene,
 there are now eight legal opposition parties which are allowed
 to organize, hold rallies, publish their views, and enter
 candidates for" election to the People's Assembly, the Shura
 Council, and local councils. The Government permitted three
 very mihor new parties to organize in 1990, but it refused to
 license a Nasserist Party on the grounds that it does not
 respect basic freedoms, and a Muslim Brotherhood Party on the'
 ground-that a party foried along religious lines would
 increase sectarian differences.
 The NDP i's a nonideological party which groups together a
 range of political camps, some of which support the statist
 and Arab nationalist policies promoted by former president
 Nasser, while others support the more liberal economic and
 pro-Western foreign policies promoted by Sadat. Still others
 are Mubarak supporters of little fixed ideological
 commitment. It has a dominant role in most party-based
 institutions in the country. It holds almost every seat in
 the Shura Council, as well as virtually all the seats in the
 1,300 local popular councils across the country.
 According to the Constitution, the President is elected by the
 People's Assembly; his election is then ratified by popular
 referendum. Both of President Mubarak's elections to 6-year
 terms of office, most recently in 1987, followed these
 constitutional provisions. These procedures, in principle,
 allow the Egyptian people to exercise their right to change
 their government, The opposition argues that the Constitution
 should be amended to-allow,, for direct popular election of the
 president. ,President Mubarak has countered that he is
 'administering democracy by doses" and that the public is not
 prepared for full democracy.
 The People's Assembly comprises 454 members, of whom 444 are
 elected. The remaining 10 are appointed by the President,
 The Constitution reserves half of the elected seats for worker
 and farmer deputies. The Assembly debates and passes laws and
 must approve the Government's general policies and civilian
 budget, but does not wield authority independent of the
 executive branch. The military budget is not subject to
 parliamentary review. Assembly members can and do, however,
 call for parliamentary investigations and interpellate
 ,ministers. This often vigorous questioning is broadcast on
 television and covered in the press.
 In May the Supreme Constitutional Court declared Article 5 of
 Law 188 of 1986 unconstitutional. The Court declared that
 this law, the basis for the 1987 People's Assembly elections,
 discriminated against the individual candidate in favor of
 those running on party lists. The result of the ruling
 necessitates that a new constitutional electoral law be
 drafted. Because of the court decision, new elections for the
 People's Assembly were held on November 29; they were
 boycotted by the major opposition parties; - Independent
 candidates won 55 seats, the National Progressive Unionist
 Grouping 6, and the NDP the remainder. Western diplomatic
 observers agreed that the elections were generally free and
 fair.

 The opposition parties continue to make credible complaints
 about electoral fraud by the Government and about the Interior
 Ministry's method of calculating election results. The
 opposition parties and some within the NDP and government
 leadership also object to the "party list system" used to
 calculate election results in the People's Assembly, arguing
 'that direct election of individual candidates is fairer to
 smaller parties than is proportional representation and would
 assure better qualified candidates and popular participation.
 Some regime critics argue that the political system is
 designed to ensure that the NDP and the Government retain
 control of all state institutions. Government supporters
 argue, however, that President Mubarak has firmly established
 at least an elementary multipartysystem in order to create
 checks and balances and give expression to a broad range of
 political views.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does'not respond to most of the queries from AI
 and other international groups about human rights concerns.
 In 199a it received an Al delegation but did not acced0 to
 Middle East Watch requests for meetings and permission to
 visit prisons.
 Human rights groups in Egypt continue actively to promote
 domestic and foreign human rights issues, even though they
 have not been accorded official recognition by the
 Government. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights
 (EOHR)--an- affiliate of the Arab Organization for Human Rights
 that has been active for several years-was denied permission
 by the Social Affairs Ministry to establish itself
 as a legally recognized organization on the grounds that its
 activities were political in nature. The Government has also
 denied recognition to the regional AOHR and continues to
 refuse permission for the establishment of a local chapter of
 AI. Nevertheless, the AOHR continues to maintain regional
 offices in Cairo and publishes its newsletters and an annual
 review of the human rights situation in the Arab world without
 interference. The AOHR has sought and been denied access to
 prison facilities to inspect conditions and meet with
 prisoners.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Egyptian law piovides for equality of the sexes, but aspects
 of the law and many traditional practices are discriminatory
 against women. Marriage and personal status are primarily
 based on the religious law of the individual concerned, which
 for most Egyptians is Islamic law. Under Egyptian law a
 married woman must have her husband's permission to obtain a
 passport, and he may stop her from travelin for any reason.
 A child must have the father's permission to obtain a
 passport, and even if the parents are divorced and the mother
 has custody, the child's mother need not be informed if the
 child obtains a passport or travels outside of Egypt.
 The revised Family Status Law, enacted in July 1985 to replace
 a 1�79 law declared unconstitutional by the Supreme
 Constitutional Court, amplified the legal basis for equality
 of the sexes beyond rights contained in Islamic law. It
 
 
 1420
 
 EGYPT
 largely ensres a woman's-right to divorce and preserves the
 wife's child custody and property rights. A second marriage
 by the husband (multiple marriage for men.is acceptable
 practice in Islam) is grounds for the first wife to divorce,
 if it is  hown that the marriage-had caused her material or
 psycholbgibal harm, or if the husband fails to-declare such
 subsequent marriages. A wife has the option of retaining the
 family residence or receiving financial compensation. These
 aspects of the family status law only apply to Muslims.
 Christians do not practice plural marriage, and the Coptic
 church permits divorce only in unusual circumstances.
 Under Islamic..law, which is applied in personal status
 matters, female heirs are entitled to one-half the amount of
 inheritance that male-heirs'_can receive. However, only male
 heirs have a duty to provide for all the members of the family
 who need assistance.
 Economic necessity as well as changing attitudes are drawing
 more and more women into the work' force. In urban areas they
 are increasingly well represented in medicine, law, and
 education. Within more traditional communities, prevailing
 cultural values make it more difficult for women to work
 outside the home. Some jobs are advertised for males only.
 Despite the legal stipulation of equality, women living in
 more traditional areas occupy a subordinate and dependent role
 in the household. Women's rights advocates also note that
 some traditional attitudes and practices--particularly female
 circumcision,.Islamic legal attitudes toward divorce and
 plural marriage, and the male relatives' responsibility to
 punish even to the point of death their female relatives who
 bring dishonor to the family by actual or presumed violation
 of the strict traditional code of sexual conduct--are highly
 discriminatory tbward wbmen. Some of these acts are illegal.
 Most of-these traditional practices.are disappearing from the
 cities.but are'still practiced to varying degrees in the
 countryside.
 Although violence against women is known to occur, little is
 known about its extent. There are no reliable statistics on
 the subject. -Abuse within the family, such as wife beating,
 is seldom discussed publicly owing to the value attached to
 privacy in family matters in this traditional society.
 Reliable statistics are not available for female circumcision
 in Egypt. While it is not against Egyptian law, the law
 prohibits doctors from performing it in government hospitals.
 One doctor who has done extensive research on this subject
 maintains 80 percent of women in Egypt's rural areas receive
 the less extreme form of excision/circumcision, although in
 parts of upper Egypt the more drastic infibulation is
 practiced. In the larger cities the rate decreases to 50
 percent in the less educated classes and almost zero in the
 middle and upper classes.
 Coptic Christians work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. Copts continue to enjoy access to public
 employment, although there appears to be some discrimination
 against young Copts seeking to obtain employment in the
 government or public sectors. Copts seldom advance to the
 senior ranks of the military (there are no active Coptic
 generals), security, or diplomatic services, nor are there any
 serving Coptic governors in any of the 26 states or security
 directors of governorates.
 
 
 1421
 EGYPT
 Some Copts allege that they are discriminated against in
 admission to some fields of medical study, particularly
 obstetrics and gynecology. Islamic activists have objected to
 the prevalence of Copts in the medical and pharmacological
 professions, arguing that Muslim wom6n should not be treated
 by Coptic doctors or-go to Coptic pharmacists. There are also
 reports that universities have effectively blocked Coptic
 professors from becoming full professors, administrators, and
 chairmen of certain departments. Copts note that
 Arabic-language classes use the Koran as the major text.
 Although religious minorities face social prejudice and
 individual acts of discrimination from some Muslims, there is
 no evidence that these acts are officially inspired or
 condoned. After security forces in Minya were accused of not
 protecting Copts to the best of their abilities, the governor
 and the head of the local security services were removed from
 office. President Mubarak has emphasized publicly the full
 equality of Copts and other religious minorities. The courts'
 application of Islamic law to personal status matters among
 Muslims-, and the Islamic influences elsewhere in the legal
 system, have not affected the constitutionally assured
 freedoms of Copts and other minorities. Coptic observers have
 alleged that it is Islamic fundamentalists who contribute most
 heavily to the discrimination'experienced by the Copts, but
 that government officials, reluctant to antagonize the
 fundamentalists, fail to rectify situations created by their
 anti-Coptic actions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The law provides for the workers' right to join local
 committees of workers- About 20 to 25 percent of the work
 force is unionized. Any establishment employing 50 or more
 workers must allow them the right to organize a local
 committee if the workers so desire. These locals are
 affiliated with national trade unions, organized aIong
 sectoral lines, all 23 of which are required to affiliate with
 the single labor federation, the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF). There have been complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that requiring all
 national trade unions to j-oin a single federation infringes
 upon workers' freedom of association. In its 1989 report, the
 ILO Committee of Experts (COEY asserted that the law
 institutionalizes a single trade union system, contrary to
 Convention &7 on freedom of association. The- Government has
 shown no sign that it intends to accept- the establishment of
 more than one federation. The leadership of the Federation
 asserts that it actively promotes workers' interests and that
 there is no need for another federation.
 ETUF is a member of the organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and was readmitted to the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions in March (from which it was expelled in
 1978). ETUF sends observer delegations to International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions' and World Federation of
 Trade Unions' conferences, but, to maintain its nonaligned
 status, has not joined either one.
 ETUF is dominated by the NDP and works in close concert with
 the Government. ETUF, which has a pyramidal structure, holds
 its elections periodically, with each level electing the
 leadership of the next level. Candidates for offices are
 
 
 1422
 EGYPT
 approved by the government's office of the Socialist
 Prosecutor. A council of'national union presidents elects the
 ETUF council, which in turn elects the President of the
 Federation from among' its ranks.- A large number of union
 presidents were not reelected in 1987. The 1989 report of the
 COE, while noting some 'positive developments, repeated its
 request that the Government not interfere in the internal
 affairs of tpe unions and allow their internal affairs to be
 determined by union-rules.
 The labor law provides for a system of arbitration to resolve
 disputes about wages and working conditions. While the labor
 law and labor unions are silent on the right to strike, the
 larger -body of Egyptian law, in fact, restricts workers' right
 to strike. The briminal code provides criminal penalties of
 up to 2 years in jail for civil servants or public sector
 employees who strike and more severe penalties for those who
 incite others to strike. The National Security and Unity Law
 of 1977 punish workers by hard labor if they participate in a
 strike.that."constitutes a threat to the national economy" or
 in a qathering or sit-in that "endangers the public peace."
 The strongest antistrike provision is contained in the Unity
 Law which prohibits strikes'that threaten the national
 economy. The full implications of this law are not yet
 clear. The Government has been known to use security forces
 and the Emergency Law to repress labor strikes and independent
 union activities in the public sector. In 1987 the State
 Security Court ruled that the Government is obligated as a
 signatory to the International Covenant on Economic, Social,
 and Cultural Rights to allow workers the right to strike
 peacefully. However, a presidential review panel refused to
 accept the court's decision. In May participants in the
 strike at the al-Nasr Tobacco company were arrested under the
 same law. The 1989 report of the COE called on the Government
 to bring its legislation into conformance with Convention 87
 by eliminating the existing broad restrictions on the right to
 strike. "
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law provides for the workers' right to organize.
 Establishments employing 50 or more workers must allow them to
 organize a local committee. Collective bargaining is
 permitted in the private sector (including in export
 processing zones) but not in the public sector, where most
 union members are employed. For the most-part, private sector
 wages and benefits are higher than those in the public sector.
 Trade union leaders note that there is a distinction between
 the unions' function in negotiating with the publia sector and
 the private sector. Public sector wages and benefits are set
 by law at the national level. Trade unionists point to the
 constitutional provision that half the members of the People's
 Assembly must be workers and farmers and claim that the
 struggle to protect workers' interests in the public sector
 takes place in the legislature. ETUF also says that it holds
 regular private discussions with senior government officials,
 in which the Federation promotes the interests of the
 workers. The 1989 report of the COE cited provisions of
 the labor code directing labor and management to conform to
 national economic interests as being at odds with the
 provisions of Convention 98 on collective bargaining. The
 Labor Law of 1981 outlines remedies for wor~ers penalized for
 union activity. While the Labor Law Is comprehensive in
 addressing complaints in the private sector about antiunion
 
 
 1423
 EGYPT
 discrimination, workers'in the public and government 'sectors
 must bring their complaints to the'administrative adjudication
 courts under the Council of State. The person and property of
 union leaders are not threatened by the Government or
 nongovernmental antiunion forces.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor. There are no reports
 of forced or compulsory labor. At its 1990 meeting with the
 COE, during a discussion of Egyptian legislation which does
 not conform with ILO Convention 105 on forced labor (ratified
 by Egypt in 1958), the Government informed the COE, as it had
 in previous years, that it is taking measures to modify penal
 legislation requiring compulsory labor for political offenders
 and public employees who strike.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children
 The minimum age for employment is 12 years (which is also the
 age at which a child has completed compulsory education). The
 law- permits children between the ages of 12 and 16 to work up
 to 6 hours a day with 1 hour of rest but prohibits them. from
 working after 10 p.m. or from engaging in certain forms of
 dangerous or heavy labor, such as mining. There is
 considerable evidence, however, that underage children
 continue to perform full-time jobs, particularly in rural
 areas. Growing numbers of urban children are also working as
 families are forced by economic necessity to increase their
 sources of income. Newspaper articles in both the
 progovernment and opposition press have charged that several
 million children may be working full-time in violation of the
 labor law. Informal private sector workshops and cottage
 industries appear to be the main urban users of child labor.
 Representatives of both government and labor argue that such
 unregulated industries cannot be supervised. However, larger
 private textile factories also employ large numbers of young
 girls, who may work up to 12-hour shifts. No consistent
 attempt is made to enforce the law regarding child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers. Working
 conditions are discussed between union representatives and
 management in public sector companies. The minimum wage of
 approximately $16 a month, while minimally adequate where
 there is more than one wage earner per family, is part of a
 social contract which includes generous government subsidies
 of foodstuffs and- other basic necessities. It is becoming
 increasingly difficult for workers' families to maintain a
 decent standard of living at the current minimum wage. The
 minimum wage law is enforced where government labor inspectors
 have access, but there are enclaves of labor activity,
 especially in the rural areas, where government inspectors
 have no access. The regular workweek is fixed at 48 hours for
 factory workers. Many workers increase their incomes by
 working overtime or at second jobs.
 Employers are legally required to meet worker safety and
 - health norms, which are modeled on the ILO's suggested
 standards. There are special provisions for women workers,
 including generous maternity leave. Employers who violate
 wage, hour, and safety and health provisions face civil and
 criminal penalties. Labor inspectors enforce these provisions
 
 
 1424
 EGYPT
 with vrying degrees of success. Employers are seldom
 prosecut.ed,-but ieliablesQurqes confiim that the courts
 occasidnally impbse fines on offending companies. The worst
 violat6rsof 'the -legal-provisioris on conditions of labor are
 small work1hop'dners in the infdrmal bector. whose operations
 are not subject to supervision or inspection.
