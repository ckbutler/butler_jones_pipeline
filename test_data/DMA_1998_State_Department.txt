 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. A Prime Minister, a Cabinet, and a unicameral Legislative
 Assembly compose the Government. A President, nominated by the Prime Minister
 in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, elected for a 5-year term by
 the Parliament, is head of state. The United Workers Party (UWP), led by Prime
 Minister Edison James, won 11 of 21 seats in Parliament in free and fair elections
 in 1995 and gained an additional seat in 1996. The Constitution calls for elections
 at least every 5 years. The judiciary is independent.
 The Dominica Police is the only security force. It is controlled by and responsive
 to the democratically elected Government.
 Dominica's primarily agrarian economy depends on earnings from banana exports.
 The Government is also developing the tourist industry, diversifying agricultural
 production, and promoting the export of fresh fruits, vegetables, and coconut prod-
 ucts, both within and outside the region. Per capita gross domestic product was
 about $3,340 in 1997.

 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 are occasional instances of use of excessive force by police, poor prison conditions,
 societal violence against women and children, instances of discrimination against in-
 digenous Carib Indians, and societal discrimination against female Caribs in mixed
 marriages.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. -
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, -Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices. There were again allegations of occasional
 use of excessive force by the police. In a 1997 case, a prisoner on remand claimed
 that prison officials had beaten him repeatedly over the course of 2 weeks, a charge
 supported by subsequent medical examination. The police and the Director of Public
 Prosecutions have been criticized for failing to investigate fully and prosecute cases
 of abuse.
 In November 1997, the authorities forced the Commissioner and Deputy Commis-
 sioner of police to retire, as a result of recommendations by a Commission of Inquiry
 that investigated allegations of mismanagement, corruption, and police brutality.
 Under new leadership, the police created an Internal Affairs Department in Decem-
 ber 1997 to investigate public complaints against the police and to provide counsel-
 ing to police. From January to October, 6 of the 12 complaints received were allega-
 tions of excessive use of force by the police. In July a consultant from the United
 Kingdom conducted a 3-month study to update antiquated police regulations and to
 establish new operational guidelines for the police. This report was submitted to the
 Government and was under discussion and review at year's end.
 Prison conditions are poor. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions continue to
 be problems in the sole prison facility. There are about 270 prisoners. The prison
 provides work therapy, sports programs, educational opportunities, and counseling
 for inmates.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires that the au-
 thorities charge persons with a crime within 24 hours after arrest. If charges are
 brought, the police must bring the detainee to court within 72 hours. This require-
 ment is generally honored in practice, although often those arrested on Fridays
 must remain in jail over the weekend and are not charged until the following Mon-
 day.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 The judicial system is composed of a high court judge, 5 magistrates, and 10 mag-
 istrate courts held at police stations around the country. Appeals can be made to
 the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and to the Privy Council in the United King-
 dom.
 The law provides for public trial before an independent, impartial court. Criminal
 defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, are allowed legal counsel,
 and have the right to appeal. Courts provide free legal counsel to the indigent only
 in capital cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression, and the Government respects this in practice. The political opposition
 openly criticizes the Government.
 The principal radio station is state-owned and has a government-appointed board.
 There is also an independent radio station owned by the Catholic Church. The print
 media consist of two private newspapers and political party journals; all publish
 without censorship or government interference. Citizens also enjoy access to inde-
 pendent news sources through cable television and radio reception from neighboring
 islands.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 
 
 595
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the authorities respect them in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion is suspected but has
 not done so in recent times.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however,
 government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 In the last national elections in June 1995, the United Workers Party defeated
 the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party, taking 11 of 21 seats in Parliament. In a
 by-election in August 1996, the UWP gained an additional seat when it won a seat
 vacated by a member of the Dominica Freedom Party, giving the UWP a total of
 12 seats. The Dominica Freedom Party currently holds four seats, and the Dominica
 Labour Party holds five seats. According to the Constitution, the next general elec-
 tion must take place by June 2000.
 There are no impediments in law or in fact to the participation of women in lead-
 ership roles in government or political parties. Voters elected two women to Par-
 liament in the 1995 elections. Indigenous Carib Indians participate in national polit-
 ical life.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local human rights orga-
 nizations, although no such groups exist. Several advocacy groups, such as the Asso-
 ciation of Disabled People and a women's and children's self-help organization, oper-
 ate freely and without government interference. There were no requests for inves-
 tigations of human rights abuses from international or regional human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution includes provisions against racial, sexual, and religious discrimi-
 nation, which the authorities respect in practice.
 Women.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, women do not benefit
 from any specific civil rights legislation. There is little open discrimination against
 women, yet sexual harassment and domestic violence cases are common, and there
 is no family court to deal specifically with domestic violence issues. Women can
 bring charges against husbands for battery, and both the police and the courts ros-
 ecute cases of rape and sexual assault, but there are no specific spousal abuse Paws.
 However, in April a new Sexual Offences Act went into effect to replace the previous
 act, which required medical evidence or witness corroboration for indictment. As a
 matter of policy, all rape cases are handled solely by female police officers. The De-
 partment of Labor recruited a permanent counselor and established a crisis re-
 sponse mechanism to assist women who are victims of domestic violence. The Wel-
 fare Department assists victims of abuse by finding temporary shelter, providing
 counseling to both parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare Department
 reports all cases of abuse to the police. The courts may issue protective orders, but
 the police do not enforce them consistently.
 Property ownership continues to be deeded to "heads of households," who are usu-
 ally males. When the male head of household dies without a will, the wife cannot
 inherit the property or sell it, although she can live in it and pass it to her children.
 In the civil service, the law establishes fixed pay rates for specific jobs, whatever
 the gender of the incumbent.
 The Dominica National Council of Women, a nongovernmental organization
 (NGO), has developed local adult education and small business training programs
 for women. According to the Labor Department, many women in rural areas find
 it difficult to meet basic needs, at least in part owing to the decline in the banana
 export industry.
 
 
 Children.-The law stipulates that the Government should protect the rights of
 children to education and health care. Education is compulsory through age 16, and
 primary health care is available throughout the island.
 Various laws enumerate children's rights, but their enforcement is hampered by
 lack of staffing in government agencies. According to the Welfare Department, re-
 ported cases of child abuse, including sexual abuse, have increased over the past few
 years. In 1996 there were 239 reported cases of child abuse, 93 of which were sexual
 abuse cases. In 1997 there were 267 reported cases of child abuse, 175 of which
 were sexual abuse cases. The Government responded to the inadequate number of
 social workers assigned to handle such cases by hiring two counselors on a tem-
 porary basis but with renewable contracts. At year's end, there were eight staff
 members in the social welfare office that handles all welfare problems, including
 complaints of child abuse.
 Although the maximum sentence for sexual molestation (rape, incest) is life im-
 prisonment, the normal sentence given is 15 years except in the case of murder. The
 age of consent to sexual relations is 16 years.
 People With Disabilities.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, there
 is no specific legislation dealing with the disabled. However, the labor laws permit
 authorization of employment of a disabled person for less than the minimum wage,
 in order to increase opportunities for employment of the disabled (see Section 6.e.).
 There is no requirement mandating access for those with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-There is a significant Carib Indian population, estimated at
 3,400, of a total population of 72,000. Most live on a 3,700-acre reservation created
 in 1903. School, water, and health facilities available on the Carib reservation are
 rudimentary but similar to those available to other rural Dominicans. Most Carib
 Indians engage in farming, fishing, and handicraft. Unemployment is believed to be
 higher than in rest of the country while the average income is below the national
 average. About 65 percent of the Carib population is between the ages of 18 and
 35.
 The reservation is governed by the 1978 Carib Constitution. Carib Indians over
 the age of 18 who reside there are eligible to vote for the Chief and eight members
 of the Council of Advisors. Elections are held every 5 years, and the next election
 is scheduled for 1999. According to the Carib Constitution, the Council must meet
 once a month, determine the chiefs itinerary, and publish council meeting agendas
 in the government Gazette.
 There are credible reports of discrimination against Carib women who are mar-
 ried to, or who live with, non-Carib men, making it difficult for such couples to ob-
 tain permits to build homes within the reservation. Building permits are obtained
 from the Carib Council. Until 1979 the Carib Constitution allowed Carib men mar-
 ried to non-Carib women to continue living on the Carib reserve but dictated that
 Carib women married to non-Carib men had to move off the reservation. Although
 the law has changed, practice is not yet in keeping with the law. In one case, a
 Carib woman in a common-law relationship with a non-Carib man who tried to
 build a house on land reserved for her family received threats that her house would
 be burned down. An estimated 25 percent of the Carib Indian population is believed
 to be in mixed marriages or relationships.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the legal right to organize, to
 choose their representatives, and to strike, but unions represent less than 10 per-
 cent of the work force. All unions are independent of the Government. While there
 are no direct ties, members of certain political parties dominate some unions. There
 is no restriction on forming labor federations, and unions are affiliated with various
 international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have legally defined
 rights to organize workers and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the government
 service, and there is also recourse to mediation and arbitration by the Government.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and judicial and police au-
 thorities enforce union rights. In addition employers must reinstate workers fired
 for union activities. The law requires that employers recognize unions as bargaining
 agents once both parties have followed appropriate procedures. Department of Labor
 inspectors under the supervision of the Labor Commissioner enforce labor legisla-
 tion, but the small Labor Inspection Office lacks qualified personnel to carry out its
 duties.
 Labor regulations and practices governing Dominica's industrial areas and export
 firms do not differ from those prevailing in the rest of the economy.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that by children, and such labor is not known to exist.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced or bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition,
 effectively (see Section 6.c.). The minimum legal age for employment is 15 years.
 Employers generally observe this law without government enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages for various cat-
 egories of workers. These were last revised in November 1989. The minimum wage
 rate for most categories of workers is $0.56 (EC$1.50) per hour, but for domestic
 servants it is $0.37 (EC$1.00) per hour if meals are included, and $0.46 (EC$1.25)
 per hour if meals are not included. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. However, most workers (includ-
 ing domestics) earn more than the legislated minimum wage.
 The labor standards laws state that no employer shall establish or maintain dif-
 ferences in wages between men and women performing the same or similar work
 with parallel responsibilities under similar conditions. The law further states that
 no employer may reduce the wages of an employee to comply with equal wage
 standards. The labor laws also provide that the Labor Commissioner may authorize
 the employment of a handicapped person at a wage lower than the minimum rate
 in order to enable a handicapped person to be employed gainfully.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides for a mini-
 mum of 2 weeks' paid vacation per year. The Employment Safety Act provides occu-
 pational health and safety regulation. Local NGO's and one major union consider
 it to be consistent with international standards. The Advisory Committee on Safety
 and Health is an established body but has never met. The rarely used enforcement
 mechanism consists of inspections by the Department of Labor, which can and does
 prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines, and prosecute offenders. Work-
 ers have the right to remove themselves from unsafe work environments without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
