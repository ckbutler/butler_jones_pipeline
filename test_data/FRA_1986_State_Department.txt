 FRANCE
 France is a democratic republic with constitutional guarantees
 of human rights, freely functioning political parties, and
 regular elections. Voter participation (with universal
 suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well as national
 level are occasions for ideological and topical debate.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy comprising a
 mixture of public and private enterprises. The present
 Government has begun a 5-year program to denationalize key
 industries, banks, and certain services. Some had been
 nationalized in 1946, while others became publicly owned
 during the first year and a half of the Mitterrand Presidency
 (circa 1982).
 The promotion of human rights is a principal tenet of French
 foreign policy. French leaders speak out frequently on
 worldwide abuses of human rights and often refer to the
 protection of these rights within France. On taking office in
 March 1986, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac created a new
 position of Secretary of State for Human Rights to oversee
 human rights issues relating to both domestic policies and
 foreign affairs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings by governmental forces did not occur in
 France in 1986. Terrorist groups--particularly those of
 Middle Eastern origin but also including some indigenous
 groups--took responsibility for a number of violent,
 politically motivated incidents on French soil in 1986. A
 group calling itself the Committee for Solidarity with Arab
 Political Prisoners, which is thought to be a cover name for
 the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction, carried out a series
 of bombings in Paris that killed 10 people and wounded almost
 200. Their motive was to force the French Government to
 release several Middle Eastern terrorists from prison.
 Basque separatist terrorists mounted several attacks in
 France, including the machine-gunning of a gendarmerie post in
 which one officer was killed. Both Action Directe (Direct
 Action) and the Corsican National Liberation Front continued
 their terrorist activities--mostly politically motivated
 bombings--although on a smaller scale than in previous years.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus

 FRANCE
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days--
 4 for drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The French judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 prescribed periods is severely restricted, and such detention
 must be ordered by the competent court. As part of continuing
 reforms in the legal system, the Minister of Justice proposed
 a series of measures aimed at facilitating the ability of the
 police to deal with terrorists.
 In an effort to contain violence and in response to requests
 from the Spanish Government, the French Government continued
 its policy of "assigned residence," moving Spanish emigre
 Basques suspected of terrorist connections to towns in
 northern France. Whereas in past years the French Government
 expelled certain suspected Basque terrorists to Latin America
 and Africa, in 1986 it initiated a policy of expelling such
 suspected terrorists, who were believed to be involved in
 terrorist attacks, to Spain. The Government has expelled more
 than 10 Basques under this more recent policy, which is
 allowed by a 1945 legal procedure called "absolute emergency,"
 under which the Government can expel without legal proceedings
 foreigners suspected of posing a threat to the security of the
 State.
 In general, the new Government still sets great store by
 France's tradition as a refuge for victims of political and
 religious persecution.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as their cases are transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement is
 limited normally to 4 months, with possible extensions in
 special circumstances not to exceed 8 months. For felonies,
 pretrial confinement is not limited. French law provides for
 the right of appeal, except in jury trials of felony cases.
 An appeal to the Cour de Cassation is possible in felony
 cases, but this court rules only on procedure. No appeal that
 involves review of the facts of the case is possible.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, though
 provisions exist for the defense to request a closed
 proceeding. The press has free access to records of court
 proceedings, although under French law the prosecutor may not
 disclose information about cases being tried or investigated.
 There is no evidence that the authorities detain any person
 for political reasons.
 Pending completion of legislative reforms, legal proceedings
 have been suspended against individuals whose requests for
 conscientious objector status were rejected. There are still
 some persons, however, serving prison terms imposed prior to
 1983 by the now defunct Permanent Tribunals of the Armed
 Forces because they did not present such requests and refused
 military service.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from invasion of privacy is guaranteed by French law,
 and this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special
 circumstances, such as drug cases, when the search can be
 undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored in conjunction with criminal proceedings with a
 court order and in national security cases with administrative
 approval from the agency conducting the investigation. The
 authorities have occasionally opened correspondence to enforce
 currency regulations, though this is not a widespread practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 control and carry views ranging across the political
 spectrum. Major radio and television stations are publicly
 owned, although the Government is not directly involved in
 their daily operation and does not seem to limit broadcast
 press freedom. Since 1983 private "free" radio stations have
 been in operation. In August 1986, the Government sponsored a
 major reform of audiovisual policy. One national television
 station will be privatized, and two new private channels
 relicensed. The law also creates a new independent body with
 broad authority to oversee the audiovisual field.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful .assembly and association is
 constitutionally guaranteed and usually respected. In
 December large numbers of students demonstrated against a
 proposed reform in the education law. The protests continued
 for several days with a small number of participants involved
 in unruliness and vandalism into the small hours of the
 morning. One student, Malik Oussekine, died after receiving
 blows from the police in an incident that has been submitted
 for judicial review.
 Labor unions have the right to organize free from government
 control. Although only one-fifth of labor is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They are present and active in numerous tripartite
 (government, employers, and labor) bodies dealing with social
 matters, including labor courts and the Economic and Social
 Council, a constitutionally mandated consultative body. All
 unions are technically independent of the political parties,
 but many of the leaders of France's largest union, the General
 Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist Party. (The
 General Secretary traditionally is a member of the Communist
 Party political bureau.) Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the Socialist Party,
 although members of other parties are also active in the labor
 movement. All unions and employers associations are very
 active in the International Labor Organization and other
 international organizations, including all three world trade
 union confederations. A Frenchman is President of the World
 Employers Association. French workers are free to strike,
 with a few minor exceptions in cases where strikes are
 determined to be a threat to public safety.

 FRANCE
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law.
 All religious groups function freely without persecution.
 Despite strong initial public opposition to proposed
 legislation regarding private (largely Catholic) schools, the
 Government in 1984-85 succeeded in passing compromise
 education reform measures which allow public authorities some
 say in private school personnel practices. Private and
 parochial schools receive substantial subsidies from the
 Ministry of Public Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France.
 Although new measures to control immigration proposed in 1986
 could sharply restrict the right of some aliens to settle
 their families in France and would narrow the eligibility
 rules for those seeking French nationality, France has an
 extensive record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 All French citizens of both sexes who have reached majority
 may vote. These provisions are fully respected in practice.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. For several years, the Government has been
 transferring selected powers from the executive branch to the
 locally elected assemblies. Many special interest groups--
 business,, labor, veterans, consumer advocates, ecologists, and
 others--organize freely and regularly support candidates for
 elective office. While isolated incidents of racial,
 religious, or political discrimination occur, particularly
 against the large immigrant community, authorities
 consistently condemn such incidents. The Government passed a
 law in 1985 guaranteeing a vote on self-determination in the
 French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia before the end of
 1987, and the current Prime Minister, during an August visit,
 promised a vote by the end of July 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International and the International Federation for Human
 Rights, operate freely in France.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The authorities do not condone discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 
 
 917
 FRANCE
 Women have equal status under the law, but they remain engaged
 in continuing efforts to maintain and strengthen their
 rights. A Women's Bureau in the Ministry of Social Affairs
 and Employment is charged with promoting women's rights. The
 Government has taken steps to close loopholes in French
 legislation on sex discrimination in the workplace and to
 eliminate sexist advertising. In 1985 it passed legislation
 to ensure more equality in marriage rights. Generally
 speaking, women in France received 25.2 percent less pay than
 men for equivalent work in the private sector in 1985. In
 professional categories, women's salaries for equivalent work
 were 26 percent behind men's salaries. In unskilled
 production categories, women received 16.6 percent less pay,
 with an average of 19 percent less for semiskilled work.
 The rights of linguistic and ethnic minorities are protected,
 whether in metropolitan France or in overseas territories
 subject to French authority. The right of immigrants legally
 admitted to France to coexist peacefully without assimilating
 completely into French culture is recognized. Legislation
 simplifying the expulsion of illegal immigrants and tightening
 immigration procedures has been passed. In New Caledonia,
 deep-rooted antagonisms between ethnic communities exist,
 leaving a potential for violence. Exceptional measures by the
 Government could be required to quell violence, if it were to
 erupt. Similarly, there is a potential for renewed violence
 in the overseas department of Guadeloupe.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 With a few minor exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered to be
 arduous and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may not be
 performed by persons under the age of 18 or by women in
 manufacturing, mining, the public sector, unions, and
 nonprofit organizations, with the exception of women with
 managerial responsibilities. This prohibition does not apply
 to women in commercial establishments, entertainment, or the
 health sector where no manual work is involved.
 France has a minimum wage of about $4 an hour. The standard
 workweek is 39 hours, and overtime is controlled. In general
 terms, French labor legislation and practice, including that
 pertaining to occupational safety and health, are fully
 compatible with those in other industrialized market economy
 countries. The minimum wage is somewhat less in the overseas
 departments, and not all social legislation applies in the
 overseas territories.
