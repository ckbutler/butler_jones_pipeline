 ALBANIA
 Albania is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected government.
 Pending a new constitution, the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions, which in-
 cludes a Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms, serves in its place. The
 Democratic Party won a comfortable majority in free and fair parliamentary elec-
 tions in 1992. President Sali Berisha, elected by Parliament in 1992, continued his
 5-year term. The law provides for separation ofpowers and an independent judici-
 ary. However, the judicial branch, lacking in resources and experience, was subject
 to strong executive and parliamentary pressure.
 Local police detachments reporting to the Ministry of the Interior are principally
 responsibe for internal security. Police effctiveness in ombating violent crime in-
 creased but instances of police abuse continued. The National Intelligence Service
 (SHIK) has both exteral and domestic intelligence gathering and counterintel-
 ligence functions. There are continuing allegations that SIK exceeded its mandate,
 largely through harassment of O~pl.3sit~on politicians and journalists. There are cred-
 ible reports that SHIK agents have taken part in the detention and investigation
 of some journalists and other arrestees, usually in conjunction with the criminal po-
 lice. Some members of the security services committed serious human rights abuses.
 Albania is a poor country with a largely agricultural economy. Some mining and
 light industry (clothes, shoes) also exist. Remittances from Albanians working
 abroad and, to a lesser extent, fuel smuggling in contravention of economic sanc-
 tions against Serbia-Montenegro, provided the principal source of foreign exchange.
 Foreign aid was also an important source of national income. The economy, in tran-
 sition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system, continued to improve
 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6 Dercent. Per capita GDP grew to $650.
 The Government made a major effort to pivatize medium and large enterprises
 through a mass privatization program using vouchers to involve the public as much
 as possible in the transfer of ownership. Inflation dropped to under 5 percent, and
 unemployment was officially estimated at 18.6 percent, although observers suspect
 it is considerably higher.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but serious
 problems remain. Principal abuses include security force beatings of citizens, pro-
 longed pretrial detention, poor prison conditions, occasional restrictions on freedom
 of speech and the press, limitations on freedom of assembly and association, and dis-
 crimination and violence against women. The judiciary is subject to political pres-
 sure. The September removal of the Chief Justice of the Cassation Court appeared
 to be unconstitutional and politically motivated. Also in September the Government
 adopted a comprehensive lustration law that bars a broad range of Communist-era
 officials from public office until 2002.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Erajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 The 1994 deaths in police custody of Enrik Islami and Irfan Nano were inves-
 tigated by the authorities. In the Islami case, charges have been brought against
 six prison guards. A criminal case continues against the two police officers accused
 in ano's death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits the use of physical or psychological force during criminal
 proceedings and provides for penalties for those found guilty of abuse. However,
 members of the security forces continued to beat detainees. The Albanian Helsinki
 (751)
 
 
 752
 Committee (AHC) and Amnesty International (AI) have received reports of police
 mistreatment of citizens. Some cases were reported by AI to be politically motivated
 and directed against Socialist Party activists. AI reported that Afrim Sula, a leader
 of the Youth Forum of Eurosocialists of Albania, was detained and beaten by police
 on January 15 on his way home from an authorized meeting of the Socialist Party
 in Tirana. Sula was reportedly beaten again on April 14, along with three other So-
 cialist Party members, after meeting in a private cafe.
 Other incidents appeared to be random mistreatment of ordinary citizens and are
 described in numerous press accounts. On two occasions foreign diplomats were
 chance witnesses to the mistreatment-by punching, slapping, and kicking-of per-
 sons by security forces. The Interior Ministry reported that it investigated cases of
 police abuse where complaints were lodged. However, it was unable to provide de-
 tailed or up-to-date information on several specific cases. Therefore it is difficult to
 assess the seriousness with which police officials pursue cases of mistreatment.
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally accepted minimum standards. Of
 particular concern are the incarceration of juvenile suspects and convicts under the
 age of 18 with older inmates and the resulting allegations of sexual abuse of minors
 by older prisoners. Those sentenced for minor crimes are often imprisoned together
 with violent offenders. There are no statutes which define the rights or obligations
 of prisoners, nor are there rules governing prisoners' behavior. The AHC, which
 monitors prison conditions and reports on them to its parent organization, also
 noted that hygienic conditions in the prisons are extremely poor, and prisoners often
 experience difficulties receiving visitors, mail, and newspapers. The AHC deemed
 health and sanitary conditions potentially life threatening at certain prisons, includ-
 ing a pretrial detention center, and asked that they be shut down if conditions were
 not improved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-New penal and penal procedures codes
 entered into force in 1995. The new Penal Procedures Code mandates improved
 rights for detained and arrested persons. According to the new code, a police officer
 or prosecutor may order a suspect into custody. Detained persons must be imme-
 diately informed of the charges against them and their rights, and, if detained by
 the police, a prosecutor must be notified immediately. Within 48 hours from the
 time of arrest or detention a court must decide, in the presence of the prosecutor
 the suspect, and the suspect's lawyer, the security measures to be taken. Legal
 counsel must be provided free of charge if the defendant is unable to afford a private
 attorney.
 Bail, in the form of money or property, may be required if it is believed the ac-
 cused may not a pear for the court hearing. House arrest may also be used. If the
 court fears that &e accused may leave Albania prior to trial or is a danger to soci-
 ety, i may order pretrial confinement.
 e new Penal Procedures Code requires that pretrial investigations be completed
 within 3 months. However, the prosecutor may extend the investigatory period by
 3-month intervals in especially difficult cases. The accused and the injured party
 have the right to appeal these extensions to the district court.
 Detainees in criminal cases are often denied contact with their families during the
 investigative phase. AHC protested the case of Ms. Teuta Ceken, the mother of two
 children, arrested for embezzlement and held in pretrial detention for 14 months.
 In this case, the General Prosecutor reportedly approved repeated extensions of the
 3-month investigative phase. According to the Minister of Justice, Ceken was finally
 transferred to house arrest in March while a protracted investigation, involving sev-
 eral other defendants, continued. Another individual was detained for 19 months be-
 fore charges were filed in August.
 The Government does not employ exile as a form of punishment or political con-
 trol.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions
 provides for an independent judiciary, but the judiciary is hampered by political
 pressures, insufficient resources, inexperience, patronage, and corruption. Albania
 introduced new civil, penal, penal procedures, and labor codes during the year.
 The judicial system comprises the courts of first instance (also known as district
 courts), the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Cassation. Each of these courts is
 divided into three jurisdictions: criminal, civil, and military. The Court of Cassation
 (also known as the high court or Supreme Court) hears appeals from the Court of
 Appeals, while the Constitutional Court reviews those cases requiring interpretation
 of constitutional legislation or acts.
 Parliament has the authority to appoint and dismiss judges of the Constitutional
 Court (9 members) and the Cassation Court (currently 10 members). These judges
 may be dismissed only for mental incompetence or conviction for a serious crime.
 Constitutional Court justices serve 12-year terms, while Cassation Court judges are
 
 
 elected for a renewable term of 7 years. The Supreme Judicial Council, which is
 headed by the President of the Republic, appoints and dismisses all other judges.
 According to its internal statute, the Supreme Judicial Council has broad powers
 to fire, -emote, transfer, and otherwise discipline district and appeals court *udges
 for incompetence, commission of a serious crime, or questionable morality. This 4s-
 sumption of bread authority by the Supreme Judicial Council subjects the courts to
 direct control by the executive branch. Judges were not always notified in advance
 of disciplinary proceedings against them and often not given the opportunity to
 present facts in their defense.
 Prosecutors are also appointed by the Parliament on the recommendation of the
 President of the Republic and serve at the pleasure of the Supreme Judicial Council.
 Many judges and prosecutors who held ranking positions during the previous regime
 have been removed, and their replacements often lacked legal training and experi-
 ence. A former member of the Council stated that judicial nominations were often
 motivated by purely olitical considerations with no regard to professional qualifica-
 tions. AHC expressed concern that, of 40 persons nominated for judge ships by the
 Supreme Judicial Council in 1995, 16 were still in the process of obtaining their
 legal degrees by correspondence. Status as former political prisoners or descendants
 o-politically persecuted families sometimes constituted an additional consideration
 in nominating judges. The majority of nominees had very little legal experience after
 obtaining their law degrees. As state employees, judges are poorly paid, and it is
 widely believed that corruption is prevalent in the courts.
 The judicial branch came under significant pressure in 1995 from executive and
 parliamentary attempts to limit its authority. Under the Law on Major Constitu-
 tional Provisions, the Justice Ministry has responsibility for the budget and admin-
 istration of the court system and sought to use this control to achieve its policy
 goals. In September the Justice Ministry fired three administrative employees of the
 Court of Cassation, reportedly for their roles in the previous Communist regime,
 and sent a contingent of police to surround the court and prevent the fired employ-
 ees from entering.
 Later that month, Parliament removed the Chief Justice of the Cassation Court,
 Zef Brozi, upon the President's request, even though he had not been convicted of
 a serious crime. In a February vote, also requested by the President, Parliament
 failed to remove Brozi. In the September vote, some members of Parliament who
 were recorded as having voted for Brozi's removal stated that they were not in the
 building at the time of the vote, raising the question of whether there was in fact
 a quorum when the vote was taken on the removal measure. Many Albanian and
 international observers charge that Brozi's actions did not provide legal grounds for
 removal and that the vote against Brozi was motivated by political reasons, includ-
 ing Brozi's attempt to reopen the Fates Nano case. In a December report, the Euro-
 pean Commission for Demoacy Through Law of the Council of Europe, referring
 to the judiciary in general, stated that "it has been unable to satisfy itself that
 judges in Albania feel themselves free to arrive at their decisions without fear of
 negaiveconsquecesfor their professional life."
 Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right to
 a fair and speedy trial. It also mandates public trials, except in cases where the in-
 terests of public order or morality, national security, the private life of the parties,
 or justice require restrictions. If convicted, the accused has the right to appeal the
 decision within 5 days to the Court of Appeals and again to the Court of Cassation,
 which renders the final verdict. The law does not specify any time period within
 which the Court of Appeals or the Court of Cassation must hear appeals.
 The shortcomings of the judicial sytem are illustrated by the case of Fates Nano,
 a former prime minister, current chairman of the Socialist Party, and a potential
 contender for the presidency. Nano's case was handled by inexperienced, poorly
 trained, and underfunded investigators, prosecutors, and judges in a highly charged
 political atmosphere.
 Nano was arrested on July 30, 1993, and charged with abuse of power and fal-
 sification of official documents in connection with emergency humanitarian aid de-
 livered by Italy in 1991. The case was based partially on the allegation that the Ital-
 ian company which delivered the aid had shortchanged the Italian Government and
 its intended beneficiaries by charging more than was justified. It was not alleged
 that Nano benefited financially in this malfeasance. Nano was sentenced on April
 3 to 12 years' imprisonment for embezzlement of state funds for a third party and
 for falsification of documents. On May 26, 1994, the Appeals Court confirmed this
 decision and on July 28 the Cassation Court upheld the decisions of the previous
 courts. Meanwhile, amnesties have reduced Nano's sentence to less than 5 years.
 In a review of Nano's arrest and trial in late 1994, the Inter-Parliamentary Coun-
 cil of the Inter-Parliamentary Union reported its serious doubts over the soundness
 
 
 754
 of the judgment against Nano, citing both procedural and evidentiary shortcomings.
 The report called on the Government to review the case. The Council of Europe
 noted its concerns about the case during its July admission of Albania.
 Both AI and AHC have called for Nano's release. Many observers believe that
 Nano was incarcerated because he was President Berisha's principal political oppo-
 nent.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the inviolability of
 dwellings and the individual person, as well as the privacy of correspondence. There
 have been credible, widespread allegations by individuals and opposition parties of
 government-sanctioned tampering with correspondence and wiretapping.
 The Government has considered plans to open the files of the Sigurimi (the former
 secret police of the Communist regime), and Parliament passed a law permitting the
 files to be made available to a governmental commission charged with investigating
 future candidates for elective and appointive office under the lustration law. Senior
 government officials have indicated that not all the files are intact, and some may
 have been tampered with in the final days of the Communist regime and during the
 chain of custody since then. The AHC is concerned that information from the files
 may have been used for political purposes and protested the lack of legislation on
 their disposition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and
 Freedoms provides for freedom of speech and the press. In practice, however, the
 Government sometimes restricted freedom of speech, including the freedom to criti-
 cize the Government and its officials. Laws against slander, insult, incitement to na-
 tional hatred, and distribution of anticonstitutional literature were used to pros-
 ecute persons, including journalists, for criticizing officials.
 A 1993 press law sets out large fines for publishing material that the Government
 considers secret or sensitive, permits confiscation of printed matter or property by
 judicial order, and allows for criminal punishment under certain circumstances. The
 media and AHC continue to denounce the press law as being too imprecise and too
 harsh for a country with poorly developed legal institutions.
 In an interview, Bir Hoxha, son of the former dictator, referred to demonstrators
 who toppled his father's statue in Tirana as "organized bands of vandals." He fur-
 ther characterized as "thieves and cowards" those who dug up the grave of his fa-
 ther in the heroes' cemetery. He refers by name to the "blind tools" who condemned
 his mother, Enver Hoxha's wife Nexhmije, including current democratic leaders. He
 added that ". . . the day will come when they will be asked to account for their con-
 duct because we demand this .... This is not for revenge, but to put justice in its
 place." For these statements, he was sentenced to 7 months' imprisonment.
 Opposition parties, independent trade unions, and various societies and groups
 publish their own newspapers. Some 250 newspapers and magazines appear on a
 regular basis. Three newspapers in the Greek language are published in southern
 Albania. Taxes on publications, in addition to increases in printing costs, make it
 difficult for independent media to be economically viable without subsidies from pa-
 trons, such as political parties, social organizations, or private businesses. Some
 journalists believe that the Government is using taxes as a deliberate means to crip-
 ple the independent and op  ition press.
 Government officials invokd libellaws and the Press Law against several editors
 and journalists. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki and the Committee for the Protec-
 tion of Journalists protested the cases of Blendi Fevjiu, editor of the Democratic Al-
 liance Party's daily "Aleanca," and Gjergj Zefi, a Democratic Alliance Part official
 and editor of "Lajmeteri," who were both convicted of libel for articles that they
 wrote about official corruption. Zefi has been prohibited from publishing articles or
 holding public office for one year. Fevziu was given a $2,000 fine, but was pardoned
 December 8 by President Berisha. Two other journalists were detained by police,
 questioned, and released in connection with stories they were covering. ARCpro-
 tested SHIK's detention in June of Filip Cakull, editor of the satirical weekly
 "Hosteni," and journalist Naim Naka, who were held for 12 hours until they agreed
 to change the cover of an upcoming issue. On November 1, a bomb exploded on the
 doorstep of "Koha Jone" publisher Nikolle Lesi. No one was hurt, and the perpetra-
 tors have not been found.
 Only state-run radio and television provide domestic programming, but many mu-
 nicipalities offer international programs received via satellite. Home satellite dishes
 abound and most Albanians, even in impoverished areas, have access to inter-
 national broadcasts.
 
 
 755
 Since November 1991, Parliament has exercised direct control over television, del-
 egting some oversight duties to an Executive Committee of Radio and Television,
 wh it appoints. The Executive Committee, comprised of 11 members from outside
 Parliament, meets occasionally to review programming and the content of news
 broadcasts. Opposition critics of the Government alleged that television serves the
 interest of the ruling Democratic Party. Television's progovernment bias, particu-
 larly acute during the November 1994 constitutional referendum campaign, eased
 somewhat in 1995 with the inclusion of more coverage of opposition activities and
 views. Debates between government and ouposition figures were more frequently
 aired. The director of state radio and television was replaced by an individual con-
 sidered by many observers to be more impartial than his predecessor. Local radio
 in southern Albania broadcasts some Greek-language prormiing, with its content
 translated directly from Albanian-language reporting. The AHC continued to ex-
 press concern over the lack of legislation covering electronic media ownership and
 broadcasting.
 AHC protested government infringement of academic freedom in the case of eight
 educators fired from the economics faculty of the state-controlled University of
 Tirana. The educators were fired under an amendment to the Labor Code which
 Permits the release of employees accused of obstructing democratic and economic re-
 orms. AHC argued that all of the educators were professionally capable and had
 received training abroad in Western institutions. AHC characterized their collective
 firing as colored by political, not professional, motivations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Fundamental
 Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of peaceful assembly. However,
 the Government places some limitations on the right of assembly and association.
 In order to hold a public rally, an organization must apply for a permit from local
 authorities and provide copies of all speeches to be delivered and slogans to be used.
 The authorities generally grant requests for meetings, although police sometimes re-
 quire a change of date or venue. 'Me Socialist Party and other opposition parties
 have complained that local authorities frequently discriminate against the by de-
 laying or denying permission for meetings in public places. Some opposition parties
 have claimed that meetings of their representatives with constituents in private
 dwellings were prevented by police who insisted on being notified of all such gather-
 ingsin advance, regardless of venue.
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms states that "no one may
 be denied the right to collective organization for any lawful purpose." Any organiza-
 tion, including a political party, must apply to the Ministry of Justice for official cer-
 tification. It must declare an aim or purpose that is not anticonstitutional or con-
 trary to law, and it must describe its organizational structure and account for all
 public and private funds it receives. The Ministry of Justice denied such certifi-
 cation to the Party of the Democratic Ideal, using the argument that the party's pro-
 gram "is no different from the programs of other parties ... it is not likely that
 the problems in these areas (economic and political) will be solved with other alter-
 natives outside of those of the parties already registered in any fundamental way."
 The Party of the Democratic Ideal availed itself of the right to appeal this decision
 to the Court of Cassation, where the case is pending.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms
 states that "the freedom of thought, conscience, and religion may not be violated.
 Everyone may freely change their religion or beliefs and may manifest them alone
 or in community with others, and in public or in private life, in worship, teaching,
 practice, and observance." The Government respects these provisions in practice.
 The majority of Albanians are secular in orientation after nearly 25 years of rig-
 idly enforced atheism. The largest traditional religious grou  are Muslims, who fol-
 low a moderate form of Sunni Islam. The Roman Catholic and Albanian
 Autocephalous Orthodox churches are the other large denominations. The Albanian
 Orthodox church split from the Greek Orthodox church earlier in the century, and
 there is a strong identification with the national church as distinct from the Greek
 church. Priests from Greece augment the indigenous clergy of the Albanian Ortho-
 dox church to serve Greek-speaking congregations primary in southern Albania. A
 seminary training priests for the Albanian orthodox church graduated 28 persons
 in 1995, 21 of whom were immediately ordained to the priesthood. Foreign clergy,
 includingMuslim clerics and Christian missionaries, freely carry out religious ac-
 tivities. U ntl yeai's end, the Govenment required that Greek citizens have a visa
 to enter Albania. The Orthodox church complained that the Government did not
 grant visas to a sufficient number of Greek priests to come and minister to the
 needs of the Orthodox community.
 A religious affairs section in the Council of Ministers oversees the activities of the
 religious communities. Some questions concerning property confiscated by the Coin-
 
 
 756
 munist regime from religious organizations have yet to be resolved. In December
 President Berisha announced that buildings belonging to the Orthodox Monastery
 of Ardenitsa would be returned to the Orthodox Church, and negotiations began to
 effect this transfer. President Berisha has pledged the return of property belonging
 to religious communities and has asked Parliament to pass a law specifically ad-
 dressing religious property. Meanwhile, the Government treats all religious commu-
 nities the same as other former owners of large properties, who, according to the
 1991 Law on Property, are not guaranteed full restitution of lands.
 In addition, a number of religious icons, objects, and archives have not been re-
 turned to religious communities, especially the Albanian Orthodox Church, and re-
 main in state hands. The Government indicated its willingness to return these ob-
 jects once the religious communities can ensure their security as cultural objects of
 value to the entire nation. The Albanian Orthodox Church claimed that it that it
 already has the means to protect the objects better than the Government and con-
 tinued to demand their return. The Government has stated that it has returned cop-
 ies of all seized religious archives to the religious groups and permitted unrestricted
 access to the originals pending their fmal disposition.
 A small but growing Protestant evangelical community desires official government
 recognition and representation in the religious affairs section in the Council of Min-
 isters. A Protestant umbrella organization, the Albanian Evangelical Alliance, has
 complained that Protestant groups have encountered administrative obstacles to
 build]ing churches and obtaining access to national media which it believes are the
 result of religious prejudice.
 d. Freedom of Mooeient Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 Albanian-born citizens of all foreign countries are eligible to apply for dual citizen-
 ship. Since the downfall of the Communist regime, hundreds of thousands of eco-
 nomic migrants have left Albania. Albanians who fled the country during the Com-
 munist dictatorship have been welcomed back, and their citizenship has been re-
 stored.
 There was no significant influx of refugees and the Government has no formal ref-
 ugee policy. There was, however, a significant transit of refugees, especially from
 the Middle East and Asia, headed for Europe. None were forcibly expelled who had
 a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that citizens have the right
 to change their government "by free, general, equal, direct, and secret ballot." Inter-
 national observers judged the national elections in March 1992 to have been free
 and fair. The next elections are not required before mid-1996. In September Par-
 liament passed a broad lustration law that bars former politburo or central commit-
 tee members, government ministers, and district party secretaries who served before
 March 1991 from holding elective or appointive office until 2002. The law also ex-
 cludes from political life members of the Sigurimi and persons who denounced oth-
 ers at "political" trials during the Commumst era. AHC criticized the law, arguin
 that it circumvents due process and infringes on the right to elect and to be elected
 by disqualifying an entire class of people from political life.
 An implementin lawpassed by Parliament in November mandated the creation
 of a commission, chaired by a deputy selected from the Parliament and consisting
 of representatives of various government ministries, responsible for vetting all those
 seeking elective and high appointive positions and excluding those who closely col-
 laboratd with the Communist regime. This commission is to have access to the ar-
 chives of the Signrimi. Some opposition politicians criticized this law for calling for
 a narrow, government appointed, rather than a broad, Parliamentary appointed,
 commission. They also criticized an article in the law, whereby government mmn-
 isters may ask for exceptions to some articles of the law for "special cases," as favor-
 ing ruling party politicians.
 Although there are no legal impediments to their participation, women are
 underrepresented in politics and government. To date few women have competed for
 elective office, and only eight women serve in Parliament, reflecting the traditional
 male-dominated society. In the Government, 1 minister and 1 deputy minister are
 women, and 3 women serve on the 10-person Court of Cassation.
 The 1992 Law on Political Parties bars the formation of parties on an ethnic or
 religious basis. The Unity for Human Rights p arty, founded by ethnic Greeks, won
 a majority of eleted positions in p arts of three southern Albanian districts
 (Saranda, Gjirokaster, and Delvina). There are six ethnic Greek members of Par-
 liament, two of whom represent the Unity for Human Rights party. The governors
 
 
 of three southern districts, as well as the mayor of one large southern town, are eth-
 nic Greeks.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permitted various human rights and related organiza-
 tions to function freely. Some groups complained of government failure to respond
 to written requests for information or data that would normally be considered of a
 public nature AHC the major human rights watchdog organization took a more
 active role in defending human rights in certain areas. In 1995 it addressed the is-
 sues of prison conditions, the disposition of Sigurimi files, the Greek minority, police
 abuses, and judicial independence. The AHC's work was impeded by a lack of basic
 equipment, including computers, copiers, and vehicles. AHC officials reported no se-
 rious governmental obstacles to their work, but complained of occasional personal
 attacks in the ruling Democratic Party newspaper, Rilindja Demokratike. A second
 human rights organization, the Albanian Human Rights Documentation Center, was
 established in 1995 and was active in several areas, including the preparation of
 human rights educational materials that were being used by elementary and sec-
 ondry schools starting with the 1995 school year. An independent Albanian group,
 the Society for Democratic Culture, continued its efforts on civic education and
 women's issues.
 Delegations from the International Helsinki Federation, National Helsinki Com-
 missions, the Council of Europe, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Na-
 tional Mdinorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (OSCE) made several visits, during which they conferred with political officials and
 representatives of the ethnic Greek minority.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions prohibits discrimination based on
 sex, race, ethnicity, language, or religion, but women and some minority groups
 complained of discimination in practice.
 Women.-The situation of women improved somewhat thanks to the efforts of sev-
 eral women's groups to educate women about their rights. Spousal abuse continued
 to be common, but several abused women filed and won court cases in 1995. Police
 are seldom called to intervene, and women rarely bring charges against their
 spouses. The major political parties have women's organizations. Several independ-
 ent women's rights organizations operate freely and are dedicated to educating
 women about their rights, providing counseling services, and monitoring draft legis-
 lation.
 Women are not restricted, either by law or practice, from any occupations but do
 not typically rise to the top of their fields. The Labor Code mandates equal pay for
 equal work. While no data are available on whether women receive equal pay for
 equal work, public sector wage scales are based on rank and duties, not gender.
 Women's groups did not complain of wage discrimination in the large public sector
 nor in the growing private sector. According to government statistics, 21 percent of
 judges and 22 percent of medical personnel are women. Although women enjoy
 equal access to higher education, they are not accorded full, equal opportunity and
 treatment with men in their careers, due to the persistence of traditional, male-
 dominated values.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is
 based on domestic law and international ageements. Attendance at school is man-
 datory through the eighth grade, and the Government has adopted measures to dis-
 courage truancy. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations have not identi-
 fied child abuse as a problem. However, there were numerous reports of children
 being sent to Italy and elsewhere to work as beggars and prostitutes. This traffic
 is reportedly conducted by organized criminal elements. The Government has coordi-
 nated with other governments in the region to address this problem.
 People With Disabilities.-Wides read  verty and the poor quality of medical
 care account for a large number ofdisabled persons. Disabled persons are eligible
 for various forms of public assistance, but budgetary constraints limit the amount
 received. The public care section of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, estab-
 lished in 1993, has set up a network of social service administrators throughout the
 country whose goal is to improve the quality of services to disabled persons and pro-
 mote social integration rather than institutionalization. There is no law mandating
 accessibility to public buildings for people with disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorites.-While no recent official statistics exist re-
 garding the size of the various ethnic communities, ethnic Greeks are the most orga-
 
 
 nized and receive the most attention and assistance from abroad. The ethnic Greek
 population is concentrated in the south and numbers perhaps 80,000, although some
 estimates go much higher. Vlach (Romanian-speaking and  omani communities are
 also present. Small ethnic Macedonian and Serbian villages exist in the northern
 and eastern parts of the country.
 The OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities visited Albania once in
 1995. A Special Advisor for Minority Affairs in the Office of the Prime Minister co-
 ordinated legislation affecting minorities, including a new preuniversity education
 law passed in June which permits establishment of private schools using minority
 Ian a es.
 -eek-lan   age education remained the single most important concern of the eth-
 nic Greek minority. Mother-tongue education has been integrated in bilingual
 schools in areas where a significant percentage of the population belongs to a minor-
 ity. The Government has offered supplementary classes for learning the Greek Ian-
 guage anywhere in the country, provided that the requisite number of students ex-
 ists. The Government has made buses available to take children from towns where
 there are reportedly not sufficient ethnic Greek students to nearby villages where
 Greek-language schools function.
 Bilingual education is provided to approximately 3,400 ethnic Greek students at
 46 primary schools and a similar number of 8-year schools in the districts of
 Gjirokaster, Delvina, and Saranda. According to government information, 400 quali-
 fied ethnic Greek teachers are employed at these schools, some of which have class-
 es of fewer than 5 students. Starting in 1995, Greek-language classes were also
 made available in several high schools in the minority area. Tn addition, bilingual
 education is provided to approximately 600 students in ethnic Macedonian villages.
 A Greek-language high school operates in Gjirokaster, and the Eqerem Cabej Un-
 versity of Gjirokaster has a department of Greek studies with 40 students. The cur-
 riculum in Greek-language classes is the Albanian state program translated into
 Greek and taught by ethnic Greek instructors.
 Greek minority leaders have called for the reopening of first grade classes in the
 towns of Gjirokaster, Saranda, and Delvina where classes had started in 1991 only
 to he closed by government order in 1993. Minority leaders argue that sufficient
 numbers of ethnic Greek students live in those towns to justify openin classes; the
 Government disagrees. There is no independent confirmation of the facts. In Sep-
 tember Albania and Greece agreed to discuss these issues in a bilateral commission.
 This had not yet occurred at year's end.
 Roma were subject to particularly harsh official persecution during the Com-
 munist dictatorship. Their leaders state that the situation of the community greatly
 improved with the advent of democratic government. They had no complaints of ei-
 ther official or societal discrimination. The community publishes a monthly news-
 paper in both the Albanian and Romani languages. There were no reports of vio-
 lence specifically directed against Roma, although they are often treated with dis-
 dain by ethnic Albanians.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers obtained the right to create independent
 trade unions in 1991. The Independent Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania
 (BSPSH) acts as the umbrella organization for a number of smaller unions. A sepa-
 rate, rival federation continued to operate in close cooperation with the Socialist
 Party. There are also some independent unions not affiliated with either federation.
 The private sector employs more than 650,000 workers, mostly in agriculture, small
 shops, enterprises, and restaurants, but very few have formed unions to represent
 themselves.
 According to the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions and other legislation, all
 workers, with the exception of uniformed military, police, and some court authori-
 ties, have the right to strike. The law forbids strikes that are openly declared to
 be political, or so judged by the courts. Several local strikes took place in 1995.
 Some involved employees of state-owned enterprises that were in the process of
 being privatized. All were deemed legal, and none resulted in violence or police ac-
 tion.
 Labor federations are free to maintain ties with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment, except uniformed members of the armed forces, police officers, and some
 court employees, have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice,
 unions negotiate directly with the Government, since only limited privatization has
 occurred outside of the retail and agricultural sectors.
 Wages for all state employees are defined by the wage pyramid, legislated in
 1992, which comprises 22 wage levels organized by trade.

 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions and the Labor Code prohibit forced labor, and there were no cases re-
 ported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age of employment at 14 years and limits the amount and type of labor that can
 be performed by persons between ages 14 and 18. Working conditions for those over
 age 16 are covered in the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor enforces the minimum
 age requirement through the courts. In rural areas, children continue to be called
 on to assist families in farm work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for all workers over age
 16 is approximately $35 (3,300 lek) per month, which is not sufficient to sustain a
 family with one or more children. Most workers must find second or part-time jobs
 to supplement their incomes or rely on remittances from family mem bers residing
 abroad. Current lawguarantees social assistance (income support) and unemploy-
 ment compensation. The average monthly wage for workers in the public sector is
 about $60 (5,817 lek). No data are available for private sector wages but the average
 wage is thought to be higher in the private sector than in the public sector.
 Workers are limited by law to a 48-hour workweek; the Council of Ministers must
 approve exceptions. The Mfinistry of Labor enforces this law.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards but has no funds
 to make improvements in state-owned industries, most of which the Government is
 in the process of privatizing. In those industries which are functioning, health and
 safety conditions are generaly very poor. The new Labor Code, adopted in 1995,
 spells out the obligations of employers and their employees with regard to workplace
 safety. However, the law does not provide specific protection to workers who choose
 to leave the workplace for fear of hazardous conditions.
