 CAPE VERDE
 In 1991 Cape Verde became the first African country to change
 governments peacefully following'a popular election won by an
 opposition party. Dr. Antonio Mascarenhas Monteiro, an
 independent, won over 70 percent of the popular vote in the
 February elections and was inaugurated as President in March
 1991. The Movement for Democracy (MPD), headed by Dr. Carlos
 Wahnon de Carvalho Veiga, also won over 70 percent of the
 popular vote in the January legislative elections. The new
 Government, with Carlos Veiga as Prime Minister and concurrent
 Defense Minister, was invested in April. Both the President
 and the Prime Minister came to office with strong human rights
 credentials.
 The new Government began in 1991 to reorganize and democratize
 the security forces, including disbanding the secret police.
 It accelerated preparations to create a coast guard as a
 nucleus of a reorganized military force, dedicated to the
 protection of.Cape Verde's exclusive economic zone and to drug
 interdiction. Control of the police and local administration
 are being decentralized and will be in the hands of locally
 elected mayors and municipal councils. The police force is
 being demilitarized and patterned after police forces in
 Western democracies.
 Cape Verde has few exploitable natural resources, aside front an
 attractive climate, a hardworking population (350,000), and a
 strategically placed geographic position. Cape Verdeans have a
 long history of economically driven emigration, primarily to
 Western Europe and the United States. In 1991 Cape Verde,
 which is unable to produce enouqh food to feed its population
 in years of optimum rainfall, experienced its worst drought
 since 1985, requiring substantial international food aid. The
 Government set in motion plans to privatize many of Cape
 Verde's state-owned firms and to base future development on the
 private sector.
 In 1991 the human rights climate in Cape Verde improved
 significantly with the change from an authoritarian, Marxist
 centralized government. The first decision taken by the Veiga
 Government prohibits private or official investigations of
 citizens to determine their political affiliation. The
 Government's 5-year plan, adopted at the first multiparty
 National Assembly session in June, enshrined a commitment to
 pluralistic democracy and-a basic liberal economic framework.
 The new Government disbanded the popular militas and the
 popular courts, which had been instruments of party and
 government control, and established a human rights commission
 to serve as a watchdog against human rights abuses.
 RESPECT fOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Pblitical and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported instances of political or other
 extrajudicial killings in 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of disappearances.
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police brutality has not been a problem in 1990 and 1991. In
 1991 one of the first acts of the new Government was to disband
 the secret police, which had been accused in the past of
 abusing prisoners. There was no evidence of torture or other
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment during the
 year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cape Verdean law requires that an accused person, unless caught
 in the act of committing a crime, be brought before a judge to
 be charged within 48 hours of arrest. Additionally, a person
 may not be arrested without court order unless caught in the
 act of committing a felony. In exceptional cases. with the
 concurrence of a court official, the formal charge process may
 be delayed up to 5 days after the arrest. These provisions are
 observed in practice.
 However, for crimes against state security, persons may be
 detained for up to 5 months without trial upon a judge's
 ruling. Prior to 1991, this loophole was occasionally abused,
 especially in cases of arbitrary arrest by members of the
 "popular militia," a paramilitary organization associated with
 the former ruling party but disbanded by the new Government.
 There were no known security detentions in 199r. There is a
 functioning system of bail, and everyone is entitled to
 representation by an attorney in civil or criminal cases.
 There were no known instances of forced exile for political or
 other reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes a Supreme Court, whose members are
 appointed by the Government, and regional courts. The
 autonomous Institute for Judicial Support, to which most
 private lawyers belong, provides counsel for indigent
 defendants. Trials are conducted by one judge, without a jury,
 and appear to be handled expeditiously. Trials are public, and
 evidence suggests that the courts protect individual rights in
 criminal cases. Verdicts may be appealed. Regional courts
 adjudicate minor disputes on a local level in rural areas. The
 judges, appointees of the Ministry of Justice, are usually
 prominent local citizens without legal training.
 Regional court decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court.
 In 1991 it was widely perceived that there had been increased
 judicial independence under the new Government. There were no
 known political prisoners at the end of 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes the citizen's rights to the
 inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other means of
 communication, and these rights are respected in practice. The
 law requires warrants issued by a judge before searches of
 homes may be conducted.

 CAPE VERDE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship. However, it
 also stipulates that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exercised "contrary to national unity." While freedom of the
 press is not a specific constitutional guarantee, a law adopted
 in December 1985 assures citizens the right to express their.
 thoughts in the press in a responsible manner. Although the
 term "responsible manner" is not defined in law, no journalist
 or newspaper has been punished for actions considered to be
 irresponsible. There is no evidence to indicate that
 self-censorship is a significant factor in Cape Verde.
 Throughout 1991, the most widely read newspaper, the radio, and
 the television, all government owned, gave balanced coverage to
 government and opposition viewpoints. The first multiparty
 National Assembly session was broadcast live in its entirety.
 After the new Government was invested, the official newspaper
 Vozdipovo dedicated the fixst page to letters to the editor.
 generally half supportive and half critical of the Government.
 The Prime Minister announced at midyear that the Government
 would no l6nger subsidize advertisements by state-owned firms
 in the major opposition newspaper. The Government said it had
 no obligation to subsidize a partisan journal through its
 advertising. The move was seen as giving unfair advantage to
 the ruling party. Local radio broadcasts.carry items from a
 variety of international press sources, generally balancing
 coverage and identifying sources on controversial international
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1980 Constitution provided for the freedom to assemble,
 associate, and demonstrate; however, in practice these freedoms
 were limited to the party meetings and groups in power until
 1990. In 1990 the National Assembly adopted a law permitting
 political associations to form and assemble publicly, and
 subsequently it legalized political opposition parties. By
 early 1991, two political parties contested the democratic
 elections, the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde
 (PAICV, the Government) and the MPD. Later in,1991, the
 Independent and Democratic Cape Verde Union CUCID} was also
 legalized as a political party by the Supreme Court.
 c.- Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship- is respected by the Government; members of
 all faiths practice their religion without harassment. Some 80
 to 90 percent of the population, including much of the
 government leadership, is nominally Catholic.
 There are no restrictions on religious practices, teaching, or
 contacts with coreligionists outside Cape Verde. Foreign
 missionaries operate freely in Cape Verde; more than half of
 the Catholic clergy are foreigners. Cape Verdean immigration
 law requires that missionaries applying for residence belong to
 a denomination with a recognized membership in Cape Verde. In
 this context, two American Mormon missionaries were asked to
 leave Cape Verde in 1989 after their visitor's visas expired;
 however -   rican Mormon missionaries were readmitted to Cape
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 Verde in 1990, and in 1991 the American Nazarenne Evangelists
 opened three new churches. There is also a small community of
 Muslims who are free to practice in Praia.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions
 on travel or residence in Cape Verde. Indeed, the Government
 maintains an office to serve intending emigrants.- A law
 requiring citizens wishing to leave, either temporarily or
 permanently, to obtain an exit permit was abolished in late
 1991. Permission has not been denied for political reasons.
 Historically, emigration has been an important and recognized
 means to escape from harsh economic conditions. The Government
 maintains close contact with emigre communities and encourages
 Cape Verdeans living abroad, including dual nationals, to
 maintain ties with their homeland. Nationality laws were
 passed in 1990 to permit Cape Verdeans who had accepted a
 second nationality to reapply for Cape Verdean citizenship.
 Repatriation is a constitutional right that is not discouraged
 by the Government. On the other hand, the law allows for
 revocation of citizenship on several grounds, including
 activities contrary to the interest of the country. However,
 there were no known cases of the Government having instituted
 proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship or residence in
 Cape Verde for political reasons. This includes the period of
 the hotly contested legislative and presidential elections in
 early 1991, when Cape Verdeans resident abroad challenged the
 incumbent Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 After 15 years of one-party, postcolonial rule by the PAICV,
 Democracy came to Cape Verde in January 1991. For the first
 time Cape Verdean citizens had a clear choice between
 candidates, and they flocked to the polls to elect new
 legislative leadership. The opposition party, the MPD, won
 with over 7a percent of the popular vote. Cape Verdeans
 repeated this performance 1 month later, by erecting President
 Antonio Mascarenhas, over the long-time PAICV incumbent
 Aristides Pereira. During the campaign, the victors promised
 democracy, scrupulous observance of human rights, and economic
 liberalization. Throughout 1991 Cape Verde's new leadership
 has made efforts to carry out its campaign promises. Members
 of the former government indicated acceptance of their role as
 the opposition, and the PAICV began reorganizing itself with
 the aim of contesting future elections.
 The local elections held in mid-December were the final phase
 in freely electing political institutions at all levels of
 government. The predominant campaign themes centered on social
 justice and a fair distribution of scarce resources. The
 elections were orderly, and there was no evidence of electoral
 fraud.
 Under the former PAICV-dominated government, the Presidency
 gained greatly enhanced powers. Specifically, the President is
 authorized to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister subject
 only to parliamentary confirmation, to dissolve the National
 Assembly, within certain restrictions, and to veto
 legislation. An absolute majority .is required for the
 legislature to override a veto. During the 1991 legislative
 
 
 59'
 CAPE VERDE
 campaign, the MPD vowed to rewrite the Constitution with one of
 the announced aims to diminish presidential powers.
 Subsequently, to allow time for public consultations, the new
 Government postponed introducing a-new Constitution to the
 National Assembly until 1992.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no private human
 rights groups have formed to date. In-late 1991, the
 Government established a human rights commission with the
 objective of raising popular consciousness of the need for
 respect'for human rights at the individual and institutional
 levels. Cape Verde has traditionally cooperated fully with
 representatives of private human rights organizations who visit
 Cape Verde periodically to investigate alleged-violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde where the
 vast majority of the population shares Portuguese and African
 ancestry. Sex discrimination is banned by the Constitution,
 and the family code, enacted in October 1981, prescribes the
 full equality of men and women in law, including equal pay for
 equal work. However, traditional male-oriented Portuguese and
 African values predominate, and women are, in fact, excluded
 from certain types of employment and are often paid less than
 men.   Educational statistics show 53 percent male/47 percent
 female enrollments through secondary school, 30/70 percent in
 the technical school. and 5514a percent in the teachers'
 training school.
 In 199-1 the Government made efforts to involve more women in
 political, economic, and social activities. -In addition to
 naming two women as secretaries of state, women also were
 appointed head of the hospital in Cape Verde's second largest
 city, head of the largest state-owned enterprise, head of the
 national health program, and head of the health program for
 Praia, the largest municipality. A conscious effort ismade to
 employ women in labor-intensive economic development projects
 financed by foreign grants. 'The Organization of Cape Verdean
 Women was'foundbd in 198U, with government encouragement, to
 sensitize the citizenry to issues'affecting women. It
 continues to operate, even though it no longer is subsidized by
 the new Government.
 Domestic violence against women, including wife beating,
 remains common, particularly in the rural areas. Crimes such
 as rape and spouse abuse are rarely brought to the attention of
 the police or tried in-the courts. Neither the Government nor
 the womens' organizations has addressed directly the issue of
 violence against women. The Ministry of Health and Social
 Affairs has'undertaken, with U.S. financial assistance, to
 publicize the civil and human rights of women and children.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 - a. The Right of Association
 All workers are legally free to form and join unions of their
 choosing, and no longer must belong to the National Union of
 Cape Verde Workers--Trade Union Confederation (UNTC-CS). In
 
 
 60
 CAPE VERDE
 1991 the new Government broke all ties, including subsidies, to
 the UNTC-CS which had been controlled by the previous
 government and party in power. The UNTC-CS has attempted to
 adapt to the new situation and in 1991, for the first time,
 took positions independent of those of the Government. In
 addition to suffering serious financial problems, UNTC-CS
 membership declined as Cape Verde began to privatize the
 economy with a subsequent loss of patronage jobs in the heavily
 staffed public sector of the economy.
 Legislation passed in September 1990 guarantees workers the
 legal right to strike. There were periodic strikes throughout
 1991, most frequently in the state-owned organizations. Unions
 are now free to affiliate internationally, and the UNTC-CS
 joined the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in
 1991.
 b. The Right to, Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Legislation provides the right to organize and function without
 hindrance. Workers and management reach agreement through
 collective bargaining in the small private sector. However,
 despite the new Government's plans to denationalize, it
 remains the largest employer and continues to play a dominant
 role in setting wages and other benefits for most of the
 economy. Cape Verde does not have an export processing zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is forbidden by law and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, and children under 16 are
 prohibited from working at night, for more than 7 hours per
 day, or in establishments where toxic products are used. There
 is no enforcement mechanism for minimum age laws, but
 observance is not a problem in the small informal sector of an
 economy in which unemployment and underemployment approached 70
 percent of the work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates are established by the Government for both
 the public and private sectors. These minimum wages are not
 sufficient to provide a worker and his family a decent standard
 of living, and most workers must rely on a combination of
 second jobs, extended family help, or subsistence agriculture.
 All enterprises must submit a yearly report to the Director
 General of Labor with information on salaries and wages of all
 employees. This provides the Government with a vehicle for
 controlling employment practices.
 The normal workweek for adults is 44 hours over 5 1/2 days,
 with at least 1 free day per week. While large employers
 generally respect these regulations and minimum wage standards,
 many employed in domestic service or by small employers in
 rural areas do not enjoy legally mandated work conditions.
 There does not appear to be an overall safety and health code,
 although some regulations exist in this area. The Director
 General of Labor, under the Ministry of Justice, Public
 Administration and Labor, is responsible for enforcing labor
 regulations. However, Cape Verde has few industries that
 employ heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents
 are uncommon. Consequently, there is no systematic government
 enforcement of labor laws.
