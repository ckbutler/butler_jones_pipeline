 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Since the November 14, 1980 coup d'etat that overthrew the
 post-independence government of Luis Cabral, power in.
 Guinea-Bissau has been in the hands of a revolutionary
 council composed of nine military officers and four civilian
 advisors. Under the leadership of Brigadier Joao Bernardo
 Vieira, a military leader in the long war with Portugal
 (1963-74) and former prime minister, the revolutionary
 council in January 1981 declared a provisional ministerial
 government subject to the council's final authority. A
 national congress of the single political party, the African
 Party for the Independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape
 Verde (PAIGC), took place in November, 1981. The congress
 was the first step in the process intended to lead to
 the country's political normalization.
 While almost all political prisoners held by the previous
 government appear to have been released, ex-President
 Cabral and up to 38 other persons were held in detention
 throughout the year following their arrest at the time of
 the coup d'etat. In late April 1981 Amnesty International
 had appealed to the authorities to try the detainees without
 delay or to release them. After the November 1981 PAIGC
 Congress 12 persons held since the 1980 coup were released,
 and the government announced that the remaining detainees,
 including former President Cabral, would be released "by the
 end of the year." On December 30 Luis Cabral was released
 from detention and departed into exile in Cuba.
 Although the 1973 constitution is said to be partially in
 effect, its application apparently is selective. In the
 absence of any written legal codes or well-understood
 civil and criminal procedures, arbitrary police and govern-
 ment actions cannot effectively be challenged by recourse to
 legal means.
 Guinea-Bissau is a poor country with few developed resources.
 The country's economic situation is bad, and worsening.
 Economic development efforts have not been encouraging. The
 government emphasizes state direction of economic life. In
 principle, private property ownership is recognized and the
 economy is mixed, though under present circumstances the
 private sector is virtually stagnant.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution has no provision relating to torture. There
 have been no reports of torture during the year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Allegations of mistreatment of political prisoners surfaced
 in 1981. Capital punishment is authorized, but there have
 been no executions this year. Prison conditions are primi-
 tive. Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions inadequate,
 and nutrition substandard. Most prisoners are permitted
 visitors, and family members frequently supply food and
 other necessities.

 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of people being abducted,
 secretly detained or held in clandestine detention by
 members of official entities in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution guarantees the right not to be detained,
 arrested or condemned other than according to law, but
 denies political rights and fundamental liberties to those
 who *encourage colonialism, imperialism, racism or tribalism."
 Ex-President Luis Cabral and some 38 of his supporters
 remained in detention throughout the year pending investiga-
 tion of their actions while in power. However, in November
 1981 the government announced it would free the detainees,
 including former President Cabral, by the end of the year. On
 December 30 Luis Cabral was released from detention and
 departed into exile in Cuba. Arbitrary actions by police
 and security forces, including forceful interrogation of
 relatives of detainees, have been reported. The indefinite
 status of constitutional protections and the absence of
 printed, accessible civil and criminal legal codes hinders
 public understanding of legal rights and duties.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution recognizes the right of a defendant to a
 defense. There are no private attorneys and the state
 provides lawyers for those who require legal representation.
 Separate civilian and military courts exist. The civilian
 courts are essentially a continuation of those under Portu-
 guese colonial rule. The supreme court is the highest
 civilian court court of appeal. Regional military courts
 have jurisdiction over military, militia and security
 personnel on military missions. The supreme court (also
 known as the war court) has jurisdiction over more serious
 crimes such as acts against state security, attempts
 against the lives of PAIGC members, treason and piracy. It
 is also an appeals court for the regional military courts.
 The death penalty may be appealed only to the council of
 state. There have been no known cases this year in which
 defendants were denied public trials.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile.
 This right is believed to have been respected generally.
 2.       Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution-guarantees these rights as provided by law.
 Freedom of speech, press and assembly is limited. Direct
 criticism of the government and official leaders is not
 permitted. Differences with government policies, especially
 in the economic realm, have been voiced on occasion. At the
 village level, debates are frequently sharp and there is
 considerable freedom of expression. The press and radio are
 government-controlled.

 Criticism of certain government programs has appeared from
 time to time. There is no religious discrimination. The
 majority of the population is animist, but other religions
 exist and their worship is unimpeded. Religious missions
 also operate secular activities throughout the country.
 Although the coup which toppled Luis Cabral has been inter-
 preted as being directed against ethnic Cape Verdeans (who
 held leadership positions in Guinea-Bissauls government) by
 native Bissauans, the new administration of President Vieira
 has not engaged in racial or ethnic discrimination.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are few restrictions on the freedom of movement within
 the country or on travel abroad. The principal constraints
 on foreign travel appear to be administrative, and are
 caused primarily by the lack of foreign exchange. There are
 no known bars to emigration. Since the country's borders
 are not rigidly controlled, there is believed to be a
 certain degree of continuous unrecorded cross-border movement.
 There are no significant refugee groups in Guinea-Bissau.
 The government, sensitive to its peoples' own past history
 of receiving haven in neighboring countries, is generally
 sympathetic to the principle of asylum. There is no sexual
 or other discrimination with regard to travel.
 c. FreedQm to Participate in the Political Process
 Guinea-Bissau is a one-party state, the single political
 organization being the Party for the Independence of Guinea
 Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). After the November 14 coup,
 the new rulers dissolved the national popular assembly, the
 council of state and the council of ministers. Power is
 concentrated in the hands of the coup leader Vieira and the
 revolutionary council. A provisional government of sixteen
 ministers was established in January 1981, to administer
 government departments and serve as a council of ministers
 under the chairmanship of Brigadier Vieira in his capacity
 as chief of state. A PAIGC party congress in November
 1981 set in motion steps to reconstitute a permanent national
 government.
 There are eight regional political subdivisions, each
 governed by officials of a regional council who provide
 public order, local administration and promotion of economic
 and social development. All citizens over the age of 15
 years are eligible to vote. While many citizens are not
 active in the electoral process, many do debate important
 issues at the tabanca (village) level. Most office holders
 are PAIGC adherents, but some important offices are filled
 by individuals who do not belong to the government party.
 Although women do not occupy many prominent positions at the
 national and regional level, in the villages they constitute
 almost half of the PAIGC membership by party regulation.
 One minister and one regional committee president (governor)
 are women.

 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-government Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests by outside groups to
 investigate human rights conditions in Guinea-Bissau.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries in the
 world. The gross national product (GNP) per capita is
 estimated to be $170. The infant mortality rate is 250 per
 1000 live births, and life expectancy at birth is 42 years.
 It is estimated that only 11 percent of the population have
 access to safe water. The adult literacy rate is nine
 percent.
 The government has placed economic and social development
 among its highest priorities. The constitution specifically
 mentions that employment and education are the basic rights
 of a citizen. Rapid forward movement towards these objec-
 tives has been hindered by the ravages of the long war
 against the Portuguese, especially by dikes destroyed in the
 rice-growing areas along the south coast, by a deficient
 infrastructure and by a lack of natural resources. Before
 the war the country was self-sufficient in rice, the basic
 foodstuff, but today it imports tens of thousands of tons.
 The present government has dropped a number of essentially
 prestige development projects initiated by the previoue
 regime and has renewed the traditional official commitment
 to give agriculture and food production primary emphasis in
 development strategies. However, prospects for rapid
 development remain poor, with exports dropping, fuel costs
 high, fuel shortages chronic and coordination of government
 development efforts lacking. As is typical of least-developed
 countries, shortages of trained manpower and inadequacies in
 administration hamper proper management of some foreign
 assistance received by Guinea-Bissau; and the rates of
 absorption of both international and local development
 investment are low. Over 85 percent of the population of
 nearly a million live in rural areas at marginal levels,
 mainly practicing subsistence agriculture or traditional
 fishing. Most private property is in the urban areas, where
 Portuguese influence imposed some aspects of European
 economic organization. Some forms of private ownership are
 also recognized in rural areas, but in general land is
 considered to be owned by the state where tradition has not
 established 'village ownership.
 While disclaiming any intention to create a wholly socialist
 economy, since independence the government has emphasized
 the role of state enterprises and cooperative forms of
 small-scale ventures. Foreign exchange shortages and controls
 have created difficulties for all enterprises in Guinea-Bissau,
 but have had a particularly stifling effect on the small
 private sector, which has virtually ceased to function. Bad
 weather conditions in the last two years have hampered
 efforts to restore the food self-sufficiency (rice is the
 primary staple) the country once had, and the government
 acknowledges that Guinea-Bissau faces an economic crisis.
