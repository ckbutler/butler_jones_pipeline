 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is and has been for decades a functioning
 constitutional democracy. The Government is divided into three
 independent branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.
 Elections were last held in February 1982. Eighty percent of
 eligible voters participated in those elections. The tradition
 of alternating political parties in every election since 1948
 except one was maintained, and President Luis Alberto Monge of
 the National Liberation Party (PLN) defeated the candidate of
 the incumbent UNIDAD coalition. The President is
 constitutionally prohibited from succeeding himself as are
 members of the Legislative Assembly. Assembly Deputies were
 elected at the same time as the President and the PLN holds 33
 of the 57 seats; 18 are held by the principal opposition
 coalition, UNIDAD. A leftist coalition, with three percent of
 the votes, won four seats in the Legislative Assembly.
 Included in that coalition is the Communist Party which freely
 participates in the political process.
 Serious threats to human rights in Costa Rica in 1983
 mostly originated from groups based outside of Costa Rica.
 Although there were fewer terrorist incidents in 1983 than in
 1982, the presence of members of such international terrorist
 organizations as the ETA (a Basque separatist group) has caused
 great concern. Also, the increased activity within Costa Rica
 of Nicaraguan insurgent groups which oppose the Nicaraguan
 Government has led to conflicts in communities near the
 Nicaraguan border. Lives and property have been lost. Some
 Costa Rican Communist labor organizations have tried to provoke
 violent confrontations with the Government, by such tactics as
 encouraging people to squat on private property. In one such
 case in the summer of 1983, a clear intent to provoke the
 Government to respond brutally was frustrated when the
 Government reacted with restraint, and the incident was settled
 peacefully.
 In Costa Rica, which has a mixed economic system, the right
 to hold private property is legally protected, and 75-80
 percent of the Gross National Product is produced by private
 enterprise. There are a number of government owned autonomous
 agencies which provide both goods and services. The public
 sector is the nation's largest employer (about 22 percent of
 the work force). While inflation has been largely brought
 under control, both unemployment and underemployment continue
 to be problems, especially among the young.
 Despite external threats, Costa Rica continues to adhere
 strictly to the provisions of its Constitution guaranteeing
 human rights. Members pf two terrorist groups, who were
 charged with conspiracy to commit terrorist acts, were given
 fair public trails. All of those charged were represented by
 counsel; thousands of pages of briefs were reviewed by the
 court, and the decision in each case had a firm foundation in
 existing law. Of a group of seven foreign terrorists, four
 were found guilty and three acquitted. The court recommended
 that the executive branch expel them from Costa Rica rather
 than imprison them since the acts of which they were convicted
 were not directed against Costa Rica. Another group of Costa
 Ricans, "La Familia", was charged with international
 terrorism. Several were convicted and sentenced to prison
 terms specified by the law; others were acquitted. The
 judicial system has dispensed justice in fair, public trials,
 even in complicated cases of terrorism.

 Both police and national defense functions are performed by
 the Ministry of Public Security's Civil Guard and the Ministry
 of Government's Rural Guard. Costa Rica abolished its standing
 army in 1949. The country's security forces, which are subject
 to civilian control, are few in number and inadequately trained
 and equipped. With the possible threat of internal subversion
 and continued troubled relations with Nicaragua, there is a
 national consensus for upgrading and professionalizing the
 Civil and Rural Guards rather than for creating professional
 armed forces.
 Although there is some concern that Costa Ricans, already
 afflicted with soaring unemployment, will eventually react
 against the increasing numbers of displaced persons and
 refugees entering the country, they have over the past year
 preserved their traditional policy of welcoming such persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Neither the government nor any other political organization
 has used killing as a political weapon. The presence of
 Spanish ETA terrorists whose alleged goal was the assassination
 of Nicaraguan insurgent leaders Eden Pastora and Alfonso
 Robelo, and the accidental self-destruction of a Nicaraguan
 would-be-assassin of the same leaders when a bomb went off
 prematurely, were the only serious threats to use killing for
 political purposes in Costa Rica this year.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 persons held clandestinely by any agency of the Costa Rican
 government. Salvadoran terrorists attempted to kidnap a
 Japanese businessman in November 1982, but that effort was
 frustrated by private citizens and the authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Costa Rican Constitution forbids torture. The
 Constitution states that "no one shall be submitted to cruel or
 degrading treatment nor to life imprisonment. A statement
 obtained through violence shall have no value." These
 injunctions are respected in practice. In spite of leftist
 accusations of mistreatment of foreign terrorists being held
 for trial, there was never any proof presented that this had
 been the case. Prisoners are treated both equally and humanely
 in Costa Rican prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Warrants are required for both searches and arrests; the
 Constitution requires that an arraignment take place within 24
 hours of arrest. These requirements are strictly enforced.
 While convicted foreign terrorists and other undesirables have
 been expelled, it is unconstitutional to exile a citizen, and
 none have been.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary maintains its independence through a
 constitutional mechanism that provides funding at a fixed
 percentage of the national budget. Accused persons may select
 their own attorneys; access to counsel is guaranteed. Free
 public counsel is provided for defendants without means. There
 is also a court which accepts appeals from administrative
 decisions of the executive branch. Courts are sometimes slow
 in processing criminal cases, but according to a U.N. study,
 Costa Rica has the lowest percentage of detainees awaiting
 trial of 18 Latin American countries surveyed. About 40
 persons were awaiting trial in 1982, some for as long as two
 years, on the charge of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.
 This delay was caused by the complexity of the cases and the
 voluminous written submissions made by the defense attorneys.
 In its 1983 report Amnesty International expressed concern over
 the status of these individuals.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no known instances of extra-legal invasions
 of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of, agencies of
 the Costa Rican Government over the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees freedom of speech
 and press and these freedoms are fully respected in practice.
 There are three major daily newspapers, and each presents its
 own independent views. The Communist Party publishes a weekly
 newspaper, and the media reports the views of all ideological
 groups. There are three privately-owned television stations and
 numerous radio stations which pursue independent editorial
 policies.
 The media freely air differences with the Government.
 There is no evidence of either collusion or repression.
 Terrorist activities are fully covered. Scholars are also free
 to teach and publish divergent views. Costa Rica has a
 tradition of rule by consensus, and free and open public debate
 is actively encouraged as a means of arriving at such consensus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of the freedom of assembly or
 association are respected in practice. About 14 percent of the
 work force is organized into unions. The vast majority of
 organized workers are in the public sector and on banana
 plantations. Private sector unionizaton remains limited.
 Communist influence is very strong in organized labor.
 Procedures for collective bargaining and arbitration of labor
 disputes are prescribed in the law and followed in practice.
 Unions can and do strike. Unions are active in the political
 arena. Numerous prominent political leaders, including the
 President, have labor backgrounds. Professional groups also
 have the right to unionize and bargain collectively. Costa
 Rica is a member of the International Labor Organization.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the recognized religion of the state,
 but freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and
 
 
 521
 exists in practice. Other religious groups have significant
 numbers of adherents, who fully participate in the social and
 political life of the nation. Foreign missionaries and clergy
 freely enter Costa Rica, and there are no restrictions on
 religious proselytization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no impediments to travel within and outside of
 the country. People are free to live anywhere within the
 national boundaries. Costa Rica has accepted many thousands of
 displaced persons and refugees from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and
 other Central American countries as well as many Cubans and
 South Americans. Costa Rica has supported multinational
 refugee programs and has provided a sanctuary for many
 displaced persons and refugees. The current large influx of
 Nicaraguan refugees has seriously strained national resources.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits the Government from
 repatriating any person who may be subject to political
 persecution in his own country. Citizenship through birth or
 naturalization cannot be lost except by abandonment. The
 Government accepts responsibility for repatriating its own
 citizens.
 Costa Rica has traditionally afforded political asylum to
 dissident groups of various political orientations. Many
 dissidents who sought asylum in Costa Rica have subsequently
 gone on to become the rulers of Nicaragua, the Dominican
 Republic, and Venezuela.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for a free, open, and competitive
 electoral system whose integrity is overseen by the Independent
 Supreme Electoral Tribunal. No political party is outlawed or
 excluded from the electoral process; no party has dominated the
 affairs of the nation, nor is any eligible voter deterred from
 participating in elections. Virtually all segments of the
 population view with hostility any effort by any group,
 internal or external, to interfere with the free electoral
 process. Individual citizens can and do regularly petition
 their elected representatives for legislative redress and
 assistance with government bureaucracies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A strong supporter of international and private human
 rights organizations, Costa Rica has extended a permanent
 invitation to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to
 visit whenever it wishes. Costa Rica was one of the earliest
 ratifiers of the American Convention on Human Rights and has
 accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Court, which is based in San Jose. It hosts the Inter-American
 Institute of Human Rights and enthusiastically supports its
 activities.   In 1983, several major international human rights
 conferences sponsored by the Institute were held in San Jose.
 In 1983, Freedom House rated Costa Rica "free".
 
 
 522
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government has entered into a Standby Agreement with
 the International Monetary Fund and imposed an austerity
 program which has succeeded in bringing inflation under control.
 But economic problems have already produced an unusually
 high level of both unemployment and underemployment.
 Unemployment is officially calculated at 9.5 percent and may be
 as high as 14 or 15 percent. Under-employment may be as much
 as 20 percent. Most affected are the young. For example, many
 of the University of Costa Rica's 1983 Medical School
 graduating class were unable to find employment. Other young
 professionals have similarly been unable to find useful
 employment in their fields of study. The employment situation
 has been further aggravated by the growing number of persons
 fleeing Nicaragua. While approximately 1,100 are housed in
 refugee camps, it is probable that many more than that number
 have blended into the economy without having been identified by
 the Government. The Government reports that there are about
 200,000 illegal immigrants in Costa Rica at this time.
 The recent economic slump and increased population
 pressures have greatly increased peasant demands for
 agricultural land, and as a result squatters are invading both
 private sector and public lands. Communist labor organizations
 have organized such illegal invasions. In some instances these
 labor organizations have hired persons who are not landless
 peasants to engage in squatting. The squatters problem is
 aggravated by the fact that, while the number of landowners is
 large in Costa Rica, plots are generally very small. The
 Government has coped with this situation with both care and
 tact and no violence has, as yet, erupted. Squatters do not
 have the sympathy of most Costa Ricans, and the Government
 continues to seek ways to provide land to the landless.
 The population of 2.6 million is now growing at a rate of
 2.6 percent. A Costa Rican's life expectancy at birth is 70
 years. The infant mortality rate is 17.7 per 1,000 live
 births. Costa Rica leads Central America in literacy with over
 95 percent of the urban population and 83 percent of the rural
 population literate in 1973. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio was over 100 percent in 1980. The ratio of
 calorie supply as a percent of requirements stood at 112.84
 percent in 1977. The role of women in Costa Rica, while still
 primarily domestic, is not limited to the home and family.
 Women serve in all the professions, in the highest ranks of the
 labor movement, in the Government, and in the private sector.
 Women and minority groups--principally black descandents of
 Jamaican settlers--have equal rights with other members of the
 electorate both in law and fact. Four women, including one
 black, are currently serving as Deputies in the Legislative
 Assembly, and women occupy prominent positions in both the
 executive branch and the judiciary.
