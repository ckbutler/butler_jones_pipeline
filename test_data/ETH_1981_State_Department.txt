 ETHIOPIA
 After the 1974 revolution, the level of human rights abuses
 in Ethiopia, high under the previous regime, increased
 sharply. The human rights situation was at its worst in
 1977 and 1978, when the military leadership and its civilian
 opponents fought for control of the government. Perhaps
 10,000 men, women and children were killed, while tens
 of thousands of others were imprisoned or exiled during this
 *red terror" campaign. Because the government has since
 consolidated its control over most of the country, the level
 of human rights abuses is now significantly lower. However,
 there is no legal protection against abuses.
 The legitimacy of the Provisional Military Government
 of Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) is not accepted by many of the
 country's constituent ethnic groups. Most notably, the
 Eritreans, Tigreans, Oromos and ethnic Somalis are in
 varying degrees of revolt. The government's 1976 promise
 of greater regional autonomy to these groups has not been
 fulfilled. Its efforts to suppress the insurgencies have
 given rise to many human rights violations. In Eritrea,
 there is a continuing pattern of arbitrary arrests,
 reported torture and summary execution of those suspected
 of independence sympathies. About one-third of a million
 Eritreans have become refugees in the Sudan and elsewhere.
 The Ogaden war and drought in eastern Ethiopia produced an
 initially-reported million refugees in Somalia; the
 number living in camps is now estimated to be substantially
 less than a million.
 On the other hand, the PMGSB is committed to improved
 living conditions and economic progress of the majority. It
 is currently conducting the fifth of a seven-phase literacy
 program, as well as an ongoing health education campaign.
 Financial constraints and dislocations caused by the insur-
 gencies, however, have seriously hampered government efforts.
 Ethiopia's rural population (which constitutes about 85
 percent of the country) has benefited directly from the
 1975 land reform and subsequent land development programs.
 The 1979 farm collectivization program has not been imple-
 mented widely because of popular objection.
 There are no enforceable legal protections for the
 civil and political rights of the individual. Although
 the PMOSE claims that religious freedom is respected, 1981
 saw increased repression and harassment directed against
 churches associated with foreign missionaries.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Use of torture is not prohibited by law, although it has
 declined since the worst excesses of the 1977-78 red terror.
 Reports indicate that torture is still used occasionally on
 military and political prisoners, including those accused
 of secessionist tendencies. In its 1981 report, Amnesty
 International reports that torture is still widespread.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions in many Ethiopian prisons are poor, in particular
 ,in the PMGSE'Beadquarters basement cells (the GIBI) and in
 the prison at the 3rd Police.Precinct in Addis Ababa. At
 the latter, prisoners are kept in semi-darkness in vastly
 overcrowded conditions. They sleep on the floor in crowded
 cells and corridors. Sanitary conditions are inadequate.
 Families, who are expected to provide for the prisoners'
 daily food and personal needs, are allowed to bring changes
 of clothing and linen only twice a month.
 Conditions in military detention centers also appear poor.
 In late June and early July, Eritrean military prisoners in
 the Fourth Division camp-reportedly went on a hunger strike
 to demand trial. The Eritrean prisoners were particularly
 concerned about the welfare of their families, who were
 obliged to move to Addis Ababa to provide the prisoners their
 .daily food. The strike reportedly ended when the head of the
 Ethiopian Orthodox Church agreed to intervene on their behalf.
 Conditions in Ethiopia's main detention center, Carchelli
 Prison, are good by contrast. Occupational and academic
 training, usually with other prisoners as teachers, is
 available. Inmates are given considerable freedom in deter-
 mining their .activities and can engage in sports or other
 social activities.
 The anited Kingdom based Anti-Slavery Society submitted a
 report to the.United Nations Human Rights Subcommission's
 Working Group on Slavery asserting that in 1980 thousands of
 people, many inexperienced-in agriculture, were forcibly
 transported to the State sesame farm in Humera in northeastern
 Ethiopia.- Conditions in the workers' camps were described as
 extremely crowded and unsanitary. According to the report,
 a total.of 1,626 people died at the farm that year. Some
 were reportedly shot while trying to escape. In addition,
 the-report states that women workers were raped by-the army
 personnel in charge of guarding them.
 In 1981, workers were again transported to the Humera
 farm. While some-may have gone voluntarily, many were
 forced to go. Workers who have escaped back to Addis
 Ababa report that conditions this year are still poor.
 c. Disappearances
 Disappearances do occasionally occur in Ethiopia. Ethi-
 opians may be arrested and held without legal process or
 notice to the public or to their families. Since records
 are not always maintained, prisoners may get lost it the
 system. There is.little official accountability for the
 whereabouts or welfare of prisoners. Some prisoners .
 deliberately are held clandestinely, while others disappear
 for prolonged periods because the authorities do not notify
 families as to their whereabouts. Families may be kept
 waiting for years for the return of inmates long since
 executed, .especially in prisons where food brought by
 families is shared rather than given directly to individual
 prisoners.

 of churches would in the future be restricted to purely
 religious affairs. As the state is responsible for social
 matters, it said, the government will eventually take control
 of all church schools, hospitals, training programs and the
 like. It will also take over all church property not
 directly used for religious purposes.
 There have been numerous reports of official harassment,
 whether directed from Addis Ababa or initiated by zealous
 local officials, against certain fundamentalist Protestant
 churches which the Ethiopians regard as foreign implants and
 which are charged with "anti-revolutionary activities under
 the cover of religion.' Many members of the Ethiopia
 Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church (an affiliate of the Lutheran
 World Federation) have been arrested on these grounds. The
 most recent arrests took place in mid - 1981. In mid-November
 1981 the PMGSE took over the headquarters building of the
 Mekane Yesus church in Addis Ababa, on the grounds that the
 office space was needed by the government. The Mekane Jesus
 General Secretary, Gudina Tumsa, has not been released since
 his abduction in July 1979 by plain-clothes gunmen believed to
 be government security agents. His detention may be due to
 his suspected Oromo resistance sympathies or connections.
 There have also been reports of mistreatment of Falasha
 Jews. Although their general situation has improved as a
 result of the 1974 revolution, there have been reports that
 their treatment by the regional administration of Gondar
 (where most Palasha live) was unusually harsh during the
 latter part of 1981. The administration closed a private
 aid program operating in this region which had benefited
 Falasha communities. The non-Falasha population of Gondar
 also seems to be suffering from the administration's
 increased severity.
 Government control over speech, the media, non-religious
 assemblies, trade unions and other forms of expression is
 absolute and firmly enforced. Political cadres are assigned
 to all major organizations, military units, schools and
 government offices to insure political conformity. Educa-
 tional curricula strongly reflect Marxist-Leninist doctrine.
 Political control is apparent in all forms of the media.
 Many journalists have been arrested for political reasons
 over the past several years. Some issues of foreign news
 magazines are banned. Books, both domestic and foreign,
 are censored. Leadership of trade unions has changed
 frequently on political grounds. In sum, no criticism of
 the government is allowed in any form, in any forum.
 In 1976 the government promised a degree of local autonomy
 to the various nationalities within its population. Nothing
 has been done to redeem this promise.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within Ethiopia generally is not impeded by the
 government, although identification cards are required.
 Travel to Eritrea (a war zone) requires permission.
 
 
 89
 Private travel abroad is very difficult for Ethiopians.
 An elaborate clearance procedure Is required. Husbands
 and wives are not permitted to visit abroad at the same
 time. A financial guarantor or hostage against one's
 return must be foundy a heavy penalty will be paid by the
 guarantor if the traveler does not return. Permission to
 travel abroad may be denied to those not considered politi-
 cally reliable. The right to emigrate is not generally
 recognizedl however, many Ethiopians conttnue to take
 advantage of any opportunity to leave the country.
 The right of voluntary repatriation is readily recognized,
 although not widely exercised. Scores of thousands of
 Ethiopians live in exile, self-imposed or otherwise,
 overseas. The government has proclaimed mass amnesty
 decrees for Ethiopians living abroad. In addition, it has
 issued individual invitations to return. The decrees and
 invitations lack guarantees and are not unconditional.
 While some returnees reportedly have been detained on
 arrival, others have been well treated.
 Except for around 1,000 Sudanese refugees said to be living
 in southwest.Ethiopia, there are no significant concentra-
 tions of refugees in the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ethiopia's military government exercises tight control over
 all aspects of society. No avenues exist for popular
 .participation in decisionmakingy all significant matters are
 decided in camera by the senior levels of the dictatorship.
 .A limited form of political involvement is available
 to the citizenry-in the various organizations created by the
 PMGSE to.implement its social and political goals. These
 include the Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's and Youth
 associations, urban dweller and.peasant's associations,
 -office discussion fora and the.Commission for Organizing
 the Party of the Workers of Ethiopia (COPWE). COPME is the
 primary.political arm of the PNGSE, and appears intended to
 form the.basis for a Soviet-style political party.
 Nationwide elections of Ikebele" (city ward organizations)
 officials took place in June. Candidates were nominated
 under the direction of COPWE cadres with some being added by
 public nomination. This carefully controlled election was
 .an attempt to revitalize local government and to provide a
 future political base for COPHE.
 While.national policy is decided exclusively by top PMGSB
 officials, the various mass organizations appear to play
 significant roles on the local level. The *kebeles" and
 'peasant associations are the most Important such institu-
 tions. The women's association, now organized from the
 national to the local level, is part of the PKGSE's effort
 to improvethe inferior status of women and to gain a
 broader base-of support for the regime. Although women are
 being encouraged to participate fully in authorized economic
 and political activities, they are not represented at the
 top of the power hierarchy. The youth and labor associa-
 tions also present an opportunity to expand the regime's
 base of support among the masses.
 
 
 90
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Ethiopia has strenuously objected to consideration of its
 human rights record by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission. The Ethiopian government believes that the
 rights of the individual are secondary to the welfare of
 the "broad masses" and the requirements of class struggle.
 Recent Amnesty International petitions concerning Oromo
 prisoners, particularly Pastor Gudina Tumsa and his wife,
 have gone unanswered.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 with a per capita income estimated not to exceed US $130,
 Ethiopia is among the poorest countries in the world. The
 economic policy goals of the Ethiopian Government since the
 1974 revolution have been to reduce inequalities and to
 raise the standard of living for the bulk of its population
 according to general socialist standards. In addition to
 widespread nationalizations and land reform, the implementa-
 tion of these objectives has involved central planning,
 government control of production and distribution, and the
 use of mass organizations to mobilize peasants and urban
 dwellers to achieve economic goals. While these programs
 have resulted in betterment of the poorest elements of the
 population, they have placed enormous strains on the govern-
 ment's managerial capabilities.
 In 1977, 60 percent of the urban population and 65 percent of
 the rural population fell below the poverty income levels.
 Similar percentages for urban and rural populations for a
 reference group of low income countries south of the Sahara
 were 39.7 and 68.8 percent respectively. Income growth has
 suffered from dislocations of the revolution, the diversion of
 resources from development to military needs, managerial
 problems, the inability of the system to provide adequate
 incentives to farmers, workers and businessmen, as well as
 some covert resistance to economic policies. On the basis of
 government figures, which may overstate progress, growth of
 GNP averaged 2.2 percent since 1974. on the other hand,
 population growth appears to have accelerated (Ethiopia has
 had no census). World Bank statistics indicate a population
 growth rate of 2.1 percent for the 1970-1979 period, but
 a growth rate of 2.5 percent for 1978. The fertility rate was
 estimated at 6.7 percent for 1979. As the 1977 poverty level
 statistics indicate, low living standards are particularly
 striking in the urban areas. Salaries for most workers have
 been frozen since 1976, although the government has allowed
 increases for the very lowest paid. Endemic inflation
 has eroded real income and consumption for all. Efforts at
 price control do more to create shortages than to hold down
 costs of necessities.
 A number of measures have been taken to achieve a more
 equitable distribution of economic goods. In 1975, all
 rural property was nationalized, with user rights up to
 10 hectares being allowed to farmers and those willing
 to till the land themselves. Land reform has substantially
 improved conditions for peasant farmers. However, the old
 
 
 tenant.farmer system of mobilizing food for central markets
 was destroyed and has not been successfully replaced.
 Government efforts to collect crops from farms and to
 provide transportation and seasonal farm labor--when and
 where needed through centralized institutions--have yielded
 poor results. In addition, the government's policy of
 subsidizing urban consumption by holding down prices paid to
 farmers acts as a major impediment to raising output. Thus
 Ethiopia, once a net exporter of food grains, is now a net
 importer.
 Rights relating to ownership of private property have been
 significantly curtailed. Ethiopians whose properties were
 nationalized were neither paid nor promised compensation. The
 remains of the private sector play only a limited and fragile
 role in Ethiopia. The government rigorously controls access
 to credit, foreign exchange, and licenses as well as most
 other aspects of business conduct. More than the fact of this
 control, the uncertainty and capriciousness surrounding such
 control depresses private investment and business.
 Overall, the lot of the rural population is thought to have
 improved since the revolution. Since land reform eliminated
 tenant labor on farms, peasants may now keep as much of their
 produce as they wish. The government tries to buy surplus
 grain from the peasantry for sale in the cities, but
 farmers are given little incentive to produce more than
 they need for their own use. As a result, the peasantry
 is well-fed, but there are extensive grain shortages in
 the cities, and the standard of living of the urban
 poor is probably lower than it was prior to the revolution.
 Health conditions are poor. Countrywide there is only
 one physician for every 80,000 people. Almost all health
 facilities are in cities or near the city. Only about two
 percent of the rural population and 32 percent of the urban
 population have reasonable access to safe water. Food
 grain production has fluctuated from year to year without a
 steady trend. However, increasing population and urbaniza-
 tion have resulted in significant net grain deficits
 each year.
 The government is devoting much attention to its basic
 education program, although higher education facilities
 have.suffered since the revolution. In both urban and
 rural areas, hundreds of thousands of adults are learning to
 read, write and do simple arithmetic as part of the govern-
 .ment's literacy campaign which was launched in 1979. High
 school youth and teachers have been recruited into teaching
 corps for this purpose. Considerable pressure is exerted to
 ensure participation in-the programl absence from literacy
 classes may be punished. Prom 1970 through 1976 the adult
 literacy rate increased significantly from 6 percent to 15
 percent. The government currently claims that the literacy
 rate has been raised to 35 percent. The percentage of
 children of primary school age enrolled in schools has
 similarly risen from 16 percent to 35 percent between 1970
 and 1978. The increase in enrollment has placed a consider-
 able burden on the school system. Children attend classes in
 three shifts per day, with an average of 60 students per
 class. The right of women to equal education is being
 stressed by the government.
 Women in the central Ethiopian cultures (Oromo, Amhara, and
 Tigre) have traditionally enjoyed economic rights equally
 with men. They may inherit, buy or sell property, and engage
 in business. Women, however, are traditionally limited to
 .more circumscribed roles in political, modern economic and
 religious spheres of life. Village leadership is male, and
 all clergy are male. Women have a subjugated status within
 the home, and child marriages are common. The government is
 beginning to challenge these traditional limitations on
 women's roles, except in the religious sphere.
