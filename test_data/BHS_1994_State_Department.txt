 THE BAHAMAS
 The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II, the nominal
 Head of State, is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister
 Hubert A. Ingraham s Free National Movement (FNM) has controlled the Govern-
 ment and Parliament since 1992.
 The police and the small Bahamas Defence Force answer to civilian authority and
 generally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there continued to be
 credible reports that police occasionally abuse detainees.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for over two-thirds of
 the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also a major source of revenue. While some Bahamians enjoy
 relatively high average income levels, overall unemployment is estimated to exceed
 20 percent; there is considerable underemployment and some poverty.
 Bahamians enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. As in
 pst years, the principal human rights problems were police abuse of detainees,
 harsh and overcrowded conditions at the only prison, the slow pace of justice, intol-
 erance toward non-Bahamians, and violence against women and children. The Gov-
 ernment investigates char es of abuse and brought some perpetrators to trial, win-
 ning manslaughter convictions against two police officers. Citizens also brought two
 successful civil suits against the police on grounds of misconduct.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by the Government or domestic political groups. However, police
 officers occasionally committed extrajudicial killings.
 In May a detainee died while in police custody. A Coroner's Court jury later deter-
 mined that the police were negligent because they failed to provide necessary medi-
 cal care. A civil suit in the matter is pending. In October the authorities charged
 an off-duty police officer with murder after he allegedly shot at five men during an
 altercation, killing one. The courts convicted and imprisoned two of three police offi-
 cers charged with manslaughter in the 1989 beating death of a suspect.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-

 ishment, but human rights monitors and members of the general public expressed
 concern over a pattern of police abuse against crimnnal suspects. Many of the
 charges of abuse involved beatings in order to extract confessions. Some alleged vic-
 tims claimed that police officers threatened them after they had filed a complaint.
 The police Complaints and Discipline Unit, which reports directly to senior police
 officials, is responsible for investigating allegations of police brutality. Police offi-
 cials reportedly disciplined or dismissed some police officers as a result of these com-
 plaints- however, the authorities did not publish any results of investigations of
 abuse. he courts convicted an immigration officer charged with beating a Jamaican
 attorney at Nassau international airport and sentenced him to prison for assault;
 the case is currently under appeal.
 Despite some recent improvements, conditions at Fox Hill, the Bahamas' only
 prison, remain harsh and overcrowded. The men's prison, originally built in 1953
 to house about 500 inmates, holds over 1,100 prisoners. Male prisoners are crowded
 into porly ventilated cells which generally lack running water and adequate sanita-
 tion acilities. Facilities for women are less severe and do have running water. Most
 prisoners lack beds, many sleep on concrete floors, and most are locked-in their cells
 23 hours per day.
 Prisoners reported that guards beat them and arbitrarily revoked privileges. The
 prison has no formal mechanism for reporting, investigating, and acting on prisoner
 complaints. Local and international human rights groups visited the prison during
 the year. Organizations providing aid, counseling services, and religious instruction
 have regular access to inmates. Despite fiscal constraints, prison officials continued
 modest but measurable steps to improve prison conditions and begin prisoner reha-
 bilitation programs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The authorities conduct arrests openly and, when required, ob-
 tain judicially issued warrants. Serious cases, including those of suspected narcotics
 or firearms offenses, do not require warrants where probable cause exists. Arrested
 persons appear before a magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next business day
 for cases arising on weekends and holidays) to hear the charges against them. They
 may hire an attorney of their choice. The law requires the Government to provide
 legal representation only to destitute suspects charged with capital crimes.
 Police sometimes deviate from p rescribedprocedures, however, and act arbitrarily.
 The Government respects the right to a judicial determination of the legality of ar-
 rests. In two cases, persons successfully sued the police for incidents that occurred
 several years earlier involving false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution,
 and a breach of constitutional rights. The amount of damages awarded, over
 $200,000 in each case, was unprecedented in Bahamian legal history.
 Judges generally grant bail only to Bahamian suspects, since the authorities con-
 sider foreign offenders likely to flee if released on bail. Judges sometimes authorize
 cash bail for foreigners arrested on minor charges but generally prefer to levy fines
 in exchange for guilty pleas. The Government tightened bail provisions to prevent
 suspects with prior convictions for serious offenses from gaining release on bail.
 The authorities detain illegal migrants, primarily Haitians and Cubans, at the
 Carmichael Road Detention Center until arrangements can be made for them to
 leave the country. Illegal migrants convicted of crimes other than immigration viola-
 tions are held at Fox Hill and remain there for weeks or months, pending deporta-
 tion after serving their sentences, unless they can arrange private means for their
 repatriation. A few illegal Haitian migrants have been detained in Fox Hill but
 never charged with a crime.
 Exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The justice system derives from English common
 law. The judiciary, appointed by the executive branch on the advice of the Judicial
 and Legal Services Commission, has always been independent. However, a con-
 troversy arose when the Ministry of Justice refused to pay the travel expenses of
 an expatriate judge of The Bahamas Court of Appeal to return to Nassau in order
 to conduct a hearing. The judge resigned, and members of the legal profession, the
 opposition party, and the public accused the Ministry of tampering with the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary.
 Trials are fair and public; defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the
 right to appeal. However, an overburdened judicial system must handle a steadily
 increasing caseload, which results in excessive pretrial detention and delayed justice
 for victims. In some criminal cases, it can take several years from time of arrest
 to eventual trial. There were even further delays in mid-1994 when higher court rul-
 ings sent several hundred preliminary inquiries back to lower courts because of pro-
 cedural errors. The Supreme Court, where many serious criminal cases are heard,
 began its term with no criminal cases before it because lower courts were correcting
 
 
 errors and rehearing preliminary invuiries. The Government continued to open new
 courts and appoint new magistrates m an effort to reduce the case backlog.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure. The law usually requires
 a court order for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector
 or more senior police official may authorize a search without a court order where
 probable cause of a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize the
 search of a person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling)
 without a court order should probable cause exist for drug possession. The Govern-
 ment neither censors mail nor restricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publica-
 tions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects the constitutional pro-
 vision for the right of free expression, and the political opposition criticizes the Gov-
 ernment freely and frequently. Two daily and several weekly newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, inmcuding vary-
 ing degrees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers and
 magzines are readily available.
 Two new radio stations, both privately owned, compete with a government-run
 network and include lively political debates in their programming. The country's
 sole television station, the state-owned Broadcasting Corporation of The Bahamas,
 presents a variety of views, although opposition politicians claim with some Jus-
 tification that their views do not receive as extensive coverage as those of the Gov-
 ernment. Coverage was more fair in 1994, however, than in past years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association, and the authorities respect these rights
 in practice. The law permits private associations, but groups must obtain permits
 to hold public demonstrations. The authorities grant such permits almost without
 exception.
 c. Freedom of Religon.-The Government respects in practice the constitutional
 provisions for freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government respects the rights of citizens and legal residents to
 both domestic and foreign travel.
 Increasing numbers of Cuban rafters arrived on remote, uninhabited islands in
 the southwestern Bahamas near Cuba. Bahamian authorities regularly declared
 their inability, due to a shortage of operational craft, to assist these stranded
 rafters. In the first part of the year, the authorities did not interview Cuban mi-
 grants who reached populated islands to determine any claim to refugee status; they
 allowed them to leave with the tacit understanding that the Cubans would make
 their own arrangements to migate to the United States. When the U.S. Govern-
 ment changed its policy tow  Cuban migrants in August, the Bahamian Govern-
 ment began to detain Cuban migrants, under austere but livable conditions, at the
 Carmichael Road Detention Center. The Government allows representatives of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to interview Cubans to
 determine whether any have claim to refugee status.
 The presence of an estimated 40,000 Haitian migrants in The Bahamas remained
 a sensitive social, economic, and political issue. Several international human rights
 organizations visited during the year to observe the conditions and treatment of
 Haitians in the Bahamas. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report
 praised The Bahamas for accepting many Haitians and for providing them a wide
 range of social services. However, it expressed concern over procedures for determin-
 ing the refugee status of the Haitians and the extent of due process afforded them
 during repatriations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with two major politi-
 cal parties and general elections atleast every 5 years. An elected Prime Minister
 and Parliament govern. The political process is open to all elements of society, and
 citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to register and vote; voting is by secret
 ballot. In the 1992 elections, slightly more than 92 percent of registered voters cast
 valid ballots. The two principal political parties are the ruling Free National Move-
 ment and the opposition Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country
 for 6 years of internal self-government from 1967 to 1973, and held power under
 Prime Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling from independence in 1973 to 1992.

 The FNM holds 32 of 49 seats in the House of Assembly, and the PLP holds 17.
 Both the ruling party and the opposition name members to the upper house, the
 Senate, in compliance with constitutional guidelines. Although it does pass legisla-
 tion, the Senate is primarily a deliberative body that serves as a public forum to
 discuss national problems and policies to address them. The Parliament has four
 elected female members, including the deputy speaker of the House, and three ap-
 pointed female Senators, including the government leader in the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Individual human rights monitors, several local human rights groups, as well as
 representatives of international human rights organizations operate freely, express-
 ing their opinions and reporting their findings on alleged human rights violations
 without government restriction. The Government allows them broad access to insti-
 tutions and individuals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government generally respects in practice the constitutional provisions for in-
 dividual rights and freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion,
 creed, or sex. However, both the Constitution and the law discriminate against
 women in several respects.
 Women.-The Constitution discriminates against women by not providing them
 with the same right as men to transmit citizenship to their foreign-born spouses.
 Additionally, the law makes it easier for Bahamian men with foreign spouses to con-
 fer citizenship on their children than for Bahamian women with foreign spouses.
 Some inheritance laws also favor men over women. For example, when a person dies
 without a will, the estate passes to the oldest legitimate son, or in cases where there
 is no son, the closest legitimate male relative.
 Women participate fully in Bahamian society and are well represented in the
 business and professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and the Government.
 The Ministry of Justice and Immigration includes a Women's Affairs Unit.
 Domestic violence against women continued to be a serious problem, with inde-
 pendent women's support groups reporting that many women sought shelter at the
 private, but government-
 supported, crisis center in Nassau. A new domestic court opened in the fall and
 deals exclusively with family issues such as spousal abuse, maintenance payments
 and legal separation. The Government opened this court to reduce the usual several
 months' delay in these often time-sensitive cases. At the plaintiff's request, the court
 will hear cases in closed session. The courts can impose various legal constraints
 to protect women from abusive spouses or companions.
 Children.-The Government places priority on maintaining adequate expenditures
 for child welfare and education. However, child abuse and neglect remain serious
 problems. The law requires that anyone having contact with a child they believe to
 be sexually abused must report their suspicion to the police. The same reporting re-
 quirement does not apply to cases of physical abuse, which nonetheless are increas-
 ing. The police refer reported cases of sexual and physical abuse to the Department
 of Social Services, which investigates them and can bring criminal charges against
 perpetrators. The Department may remove children from abusive situations if the
 court deems it necessary.
 Although all children, regardless of legal status, are eligible for free public edu-
 cation, there were reports that some public schools on islands other than New Provi-
 dence denied entry to children of illegal Haitian immigrants, because of limited
 school facilities.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the 1973 National Building Code mandates
 certain accommodations for the physically disabled in new public buildings, the au-
 thorities rarely enforce this part of the code. Private buildings are also not routinely
 accessible. The Disability Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Social Development and
 National Insurance works with the Bahamas Council for the Disabled, an umbrella
 organization for groups offering services for the disabled, to provide a coordinated
 public and private sector approach to the needs of the disabled. A mix of govern-
 ment and private residential and nonresidential institutions provides a range of
 educational, training, and counseling services for both physically and mentally
 handicapped adults and children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that labor unions have the
 right of free assembly and association. Private sector and most public sector workers
 may form or join unions without prior approval. Members of the police force, defense
 
 
 force, fire brigade and prison guards may not organize or join unions. Bahamian
 workers exercise the right of association extensively, with almost one-quarter of the
 work force (and one-ha  the workers in the important hotel industry) belonging to
 unions.
 The country's two major umbrella labor organizations, the National Workers
 Council of Trade Unions and Associations and the Trade Union Congress (TUC),
 and individual labor unions all function independent of government or political
 party control. All labor unions have the right to maintain affiliations with inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 The Industrial Relations Act requires that, before a strike begins, a simple major-
 ity of a union's membership must vote in favor of a motion to strike. The Depart-
 ment of Labor must supervise the vote. The Minister of Labor, Human Resources,
 and Training may also refer a dispute involving employees of an "essential service"
 to the Industrial Relations Board for settlement, if the Minister determines that the
 public interest requires such action.
 The country's largest labor union, the Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Work-
 ers Union, conducted a number of work stoppages and strikes at resort hotels dur-
 ing the year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Workers freely exercise their
 right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, which the law protects.
 Unions and employers negotiate wage rates without government interference. The
 Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion discrimination by
 employers. The Act requires employers to recognize trade unions. The Industrial Re-
 lations Board mediates disputes between employees or unions and their employers.
 Mechanisms exist to resolve complaints, including filing a trade union dispute with
 the Ministry of Labor or bringing a civil suit against the employer in court. The Act
 requires the reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. Employers may dis-
 miss workers in accordance with applicable contracts, which generally require some
 severance pay. The Government enforces labor laws and regulations uniformly
 throughout the country.
 The Bahamas has two small free trade zones. Labor law and practice in these
 zones do not differ from those in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of children under the age of 14 for industrial work, work during school hours, or
 work at night. There is no legal minimum age for employment in other sectors, and
 some children work part-time in light industry and service jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for one 24-hour rest period. The Act requires
 overtime payment (time and a hal) for hours beyond the standard. The Act permits
 the creation of a Wages Council to recommend the setting of a minimum wage. To
 date, however, The Bahamas has not established such a council or a minimum
 The Ministry of Labor, responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team of inspec-
 tors who conduct on-site visits to enforce occupational health and safety standards
 and investigate employee concerns and complaints, but inspections occur only infre-
 quently. The Ministry normally announces inspection visits in advance, and employ-
 ers generally cooperate with inspectors to implement safety standards. As such in-
 spections appear inadequate, the Ministry of Labor, Human Resources, and Train-
 in formally requested help from the US. Department of Labor in December to de-
 velop a technical training proposal to improve occupational safety, health, and wel-
 fare.
 The national insurance program compensates workers for work-related injuries.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to find suitable alternative em-
 ployment for employees injured on the job but still able to work. The law does not
 provide a right for workers to absent themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
