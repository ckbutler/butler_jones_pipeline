 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a multi-ethnic society in which Malays dominate
 political affairs while ethnic Chinese and, to a lesser
 extent, ethnic Indians continue to play leading roles in the
 economy. The government places among its highest priorities
 avoiding a repetition of severe violence such as followed
 the May 1969 elections when several hundred persons were
 reported to have died in communal riots in Kuala Lumpur.
 The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) has been engaged in an
 armed struggle with the government since 1948. CPM guerrillas
 are to a large degree contained in sanctuaries in southern
 Thailand through coordinated Malaysian-Thai operations,
 although some armed insurgents operate in isolated units
 on Malaysian territory. The latter's efforts against the
 Malaysian government include ambush and attacks on military
 units, as well as assassinations and acts of terrorism.
 The last serious upsurge was in 1975, but the government
 counter-insurgency effort continues to suffer numbers of
 Malaysian police and military personnel killed or maimed
 annually.
 An independent judiciary and a functioning parliamentary
 system safeguard most fundamental human rights. The per-
 sistent insurgent threat and the ever-present possibility
 of renewed communal conflict are cited by the Malaysian
 gove Inment as justification for legislation which makes
 lega the arrest and detention without trial of persons
 suspcted of subversive activity or of other activities
 that threaten general civic order. Amnesty International
 in its 1980 report claims that some 1,000 Malaysians are
 detained under the Internal Security Act of 1969 (ISA).
 The government announced to parliament in November 1981
 that since the inception of the ISA, a total of 3,101
 persons have been detained and 2,613 released, leaving
 a total of 489 still under detention.
 Malaysia has made major progress in economic and social
 development in the 23 years since gaining independence.
 It is one of the most prosperous developing countries in
 Asia with an average estimated per capita gross national
 product (GNP) of $1,586 in 1980.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 7 of the federal constitution of Malaysia prohibits
 torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment. There have been no known, or reported, instances of
 torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman 9r Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As noted above, such behavior is constitutionally prohibited
 even in times of "public emergency which threatens the life
 of the nation". Article 4, Part III, of the constitution
 stipulates against any derogation of the relevant protective
 provisions. Summary executions are not carried out and
 convictions which carry the death penalty are automatically
 subject to appeal to the federal court or the pardons board.

 Poor living conditions and inadequate medical attention
 during incarceration have been reported by former detainees
 or relatives of detainees. According to Amnesty Inter-
 national, some persons detained under the ISA are held in
 solitary confinement. The deputy prime minister announced
 in parliament in November 1981 that prisons and other
 places of detention will undergo an overhaul to improve
 their conditions as well as their administration to ensure
 that they are fit for human dwellings.
 c. Disappearances
 The government reserves the right to refuse requests for
 information on specific individuals detained under security
 legislation. There is no evidence of abduction, secret
 arrests or clandestine detention although some detainees
 have reported not knowing where they were being held during
 certain periods of confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrests and Imprisonment
 The Malaysian constitution provides for the proclamation of
 a state of emergency during which individual rights can be
 limited by law. A state of emergency has existed since it
 was proclaimed in May 1969 during communal rioting.
 Legislation granting extraordinary powers to the government
 enables arrest and imprisonment without benefit of trial or
 the right of habeas corpus.
 The Malaysian government considers the CPM threat and
 continuing communal tensions to be adequate justification
 for the use of emergency powers, first embodied in regu-
 lations by the British, and later extended and made more
 comprehensive by Malaysian legislation. These regulations
 permit arrest and detention without open trial of persons
 suspected of subversive activity and other actions contri-
 buting to domestic instability. Known as the Internal
 Security Act (ISA) and the Emergency (Public Order and
 Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 (E.O.), they provide
 for initial preventive detention for up to two years.
 A person detained under the emergency laws has no recourse
 to the courts but as soon as possible after arrest must be
 *told the reason and given an opportunity to challenge the
 detention order.
 The Emergency Ordinance, while enacted in the wake of the
 May 1969 racial disturbances, has been most often used
 against narcotics traffickers and other serious criminals in
 the absence of effective laws against conspiracy. The E.O.,
 which has no provision for renewal, provides that after two
 years imprisonment a period of two years of "restricted
 residence" in a remote area of the country may be ordered.
 In 1979, the parliament amended the constitution to give the
 government authority to assume emergency powers when a
 crisis seems imminent. The government uses the Emergency
 (Essential Powers) Ordinance 1969, which is designed to deal
 with terrorism and political violence, as the basis for
 regulations that substantially diminish the rights of the
 accused by allowing an in camera trial, anonymous witnesses
 and a presumption of guilt. These regulations are used in
 a limited number of security cases when the accused is
 brought to trial rather than simply detained under the ISA.
 Shortly after taking office in July 1981, the new prime
 minister authorized the release of 21 ISA detainees.
 At least some cases represented a reversal of the previous
 government's decisions to override advisory board recommen-
 
 
 644
 dations for release. The new administration has also pledged
 more scrupulous adherence to the review process. During 1981,
 the government of Malaysia released, among many other
 detainees, the former deputy minister of labor and manpower
 Abdullah Majid, former deputy minister of science, technology
 and environment Abdullah Ahmad, and former managing editor
 of the "New Straits Times," Samad Ismail, all of whom had been
 detained under the ISA since 1966 for alleged involvement
 with pro-communist activities. Two members of a leading
 opposition party were also released, but in October, two
 journalists for a Malaysian language newspaper were detained
 in connection with "possible involvement in allowing the
 paper to be used to spread communist propaganda."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Modeled on the British judiciary, the Malaysian courts are
 generally regarded by the public and the legal community as
 committed to the rule of law and not susceptible to pressure
 from the executive. Defendants have the right to counsel
 and lawyers are able to represent dissidents without penalty
 to themselves. Most civil and criminal cases are tried
 under this judicial system and thus public trial and a fair
 hearing occur in all but a small minority of cases. In non-
 security related cases, the courts apply criminal law and
 procedures including strict rules of evidence. Defendants
 are fully aware of charges against them prior to trial.
 Persons detained for security reasons and certain classes
 of crimes, however, are held and given hearing under special
 procedures outside the ordinary court system which do not
 afford these basic legal safeguards.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is generally limited to cases involving
 security legislation. In its counter-insurgency effort
 against the CPM, the government makes extensive use of its
 powers under the Internal Security Act to enter and search
 the homes of suspects.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Tension between Malays and Chinese led to race riots in 1969
 and the suspension of parliamentary democracy for two years.
 Since then (under the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971),
 certain "sensitive" topics touching on ethnic origins
 (generally Malay) or privileges may not be discussed,
 specifically in public or in the parliament. The state
 of emergency legally proclaimed during the 1969 communal
 rioting continues in effect. The emergency laws are
 designed to reduce the risk of communal violence by for-
 bidding any public exacerbation of racial tensions.
 Radio and television are government controlled. The media
 are constrained by the constitutional prohibitions against
 discussions of certain ethnically sensitive topics and,
 mindful of the need for annual renewal of publishing
 licenses and generally owned by the government-coalition
 parties, the press is circumspect in its treatment of
 government policies. Issues of foreign publications have
 on rare occasions been removed from circulation. There are
 no other restrictions on what may be printed, however, and
 the activities and statements of opposition political
 figures and domestic political developments are covered.
 
 
 645
 Moreover, the press reports on violations of legal standards
 and acts as an informal ombudsman, as do the parliamentary
 opposition and the active bar association.
 The new administration, while warning against possible abuse
 of media influence over popular opinion, has encouraged
 increased constructive criticism and responsible expression
 of dissent. It has also initiated reforms designed to make
 the bureaucracy more responsive to individual grievance.
 Since the July 1981 change of leadership, the Malaysian
 Bar Council has informally expressed optimism regarding the
 government's reaffirmation of its commitment to uphold the
 rule of law and there has been evidence of the government's
 ability to maintain a continuing dialogue with the Bar
 Council and other non-establishment groups.
 The government practices "affirmative action" on an
 extensive scale in favor of the politically dominant but
 economically weaker ethnic Malays. Many non-Malays consider
 this policy discriminatory. As a result of these extensive
 affirmative action programs and policies, non-Malay oppor-
 tunities for education, government employment, and parti-
 cipation in selected economic activities are carefully
 apportioned. This practice is based both on constitutional
 provisions and government policies. On the other hand, most
 Malays, as a result of the social, cultural and economic
 system prevailing in the country, have historically not
 participated in most areas of modern economic activity*
 The new administration has recommitted itself in its
 development strategy to raising the economic and educational
 level of the Malays to that of the other ethnic communities..
 It is also committed to the eradication of poverty among all
 Malaysians regardless of race.
 In 1981, the parliament amended the constitution to allow
 the minister of home affairs to regulate more strictly all
 organizations attempting to influence government policy and
 to preclude judicial review of these actions. At the same
 time the government stressed that this amendment will not
 be applied to stifle free expression, but only against
 organizations such as communist front organizations or
 religious extremists who would threaten Malaysia's political
 stability.
 While the state religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malaysian
 Muslims are legally bound by Muslim religious laws, the
 federal government itself does not discriminate against
 practitioners of other religious faiths, which in Malaysia
 include Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese religions and Christianity.
 Concern and controversy has been engendered by the attempts
 of Malaysian Muslim fundamentalists to extend the enforce-
 ment of Islamic laws against non-Muslim Malaysians and even
 other nationalities. The government has regularly declared
 in parliament in response to the fundamentalist challenge
 that it would not accede to demands for wider enforcement of
 Muslim law, pointing out that Malaysia is a multi-religious
 country. The judiciary has also spoken out against replacing
 common law with Islamic law.
 In his first major address, the.new Prime Minister declared
 in July that "Muslims who harbored intolerance of other
 religions could not consider themselves faithful practi-
 tioners of their own religion."
 The Malaysian constitution guarantees the right of freedom
 of peaceable assembly and association, although the consti-
 tution also grants the government extensive powers to limit
 
 
 646
 those rights by legislation in the interests of security
 and public order. In practice, the Societies Act and trade
 union legislation requires that most organizations be
 registered with the government and thus subject to close
 control. In the wake of the communal disturbances of 1969,
 the government passed laws greatly limiting the right to
 public assembly by large groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The government permits free domestic and foreign travel,
 including emigration. Persons wishing to travel abroad
 must obtain passports, which have been denied in a few
 cases on security grounds. The government also restricts
 travel to China by ethnic Chinese citizens. Travel between
 peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo states of Sabah and
 Sarawak is constitutionally subject to control by those
 state governments as the result of conditions imposed by the
 Sabah and Sarawak governments at the time of their accession
 to the federation. The Sabah and Sarawak governments have
 on several occasions arbitrarily denied entry to opposition
 politicians and journalists from peninsular Malaysia and
 abroad. Malaysian citizens are not barred from returning
 to the country after residence abroad, although certain
 acts performed may lead to loss of citizenship.
 Malaysia continues to play a key role in providing temporary
 asylum, having accepted over 163,000 Indochinese refugees.
 It has been doing so in spite of domestic fears of a
 residual refugee population which could upset the ethnic
 balance of the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system based on the British
 model, with a prime minister and cabinet responsible to
 parliament. The head of state is a constitutional monarch
 elected for a five-year term by the sultans of those
 Malaysian states which are sultanates (nine of thirteen)
 from among their own members. The bicameral parliament
 consists of a senate (with both appointed and elected
 members) and an elected house of representatives, where a
 small but vocal opposition criticizes the government
 regularly. Legislative power is further divided between
 federal and state legislatures. State executive admini-
 strations attend to matters of local concern. Elections on
 the basis of universal suffrage are held at no more than
 five-year intervals as specified by the constitution.
 The last national parliamentary elections were held in July
 1978, when the ruling National Front coalition won 131 of
 154 seats. In parliamentary and state assembly elections,
 the National Front takes full advantage of its incumbency,
 and in recent elections, it has prohibited public rallies,
 a factor which inhibits the opposition. Even the opposition
 concedes, however, that votes are cast freely and secretly
 and are recorded accurately. In the national elections, the
 success of one major opposition party (the Democratic Action
 Party), which doubled its representation from 8 to 16 seats,
 tends to support this belief. Other opposition parties are
 the Islamic Party and the People's Socialist Party.
 The position of women in Malaysian society is relatively
 unrestricted within the constraints of Islam and other
 eastern cultures in the country. Women have full voting
 rights. Malaysia now has two women as full cabinet
 ministers: Welfare Services, appointed in 1978, and
 Public Enterprises, appointed in 1980.
 
 
 647
 The Malaysian trade union movement consists of 368 separate
 unions representing about 565,000 workers. The unions
 exercise considerable freedom in pushing "bread-and-butter"
 issues, but have largely stayed out of the political arena.
 Still, the government is quite sensitive to possible
 politicization of the labor movement, and generally considers
 itself to be guardian of the public interest vis-a-vis labor
 relations. This attitude, combined with a disruptive
 strike against the Malaysia national airline, led to
 amendments in mid-1980 to the Industrial Relations Act which
 somewhat limited the scope of union activities. (The govern-
 ment's dispute arbitration system has reduced the role of
 strikes in Malaysia's industrial relations; strikes, however,
 are permitted.) Amendments to the Societies Act in April
 1981, although not specifically intended against or limited
 to the labor movement, force the Malaysian Trade Union
 Congress (MTUC)(the umbrella organization covering about
 two-thirds of union members) to decide whether it is to
 become a "friendly" society and lose the right to criticize
 the government on labor matters and to support candidates
 for public office, or become a "political" society, which
 would force it to end relations with foreign organizations.
 The MTUC has become increasingly vocal, including in inter-
 national fora, in opposition to these actions, which they
 perceive as being anti-union.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigations or
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known outside investigations of the general
 human rights situation in Malaysia during 1981. As noted
 in Section 1(d), the government has pledged to address
 criticisms of the ISA process.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Malaysian government has demonstrated consistently its
 high level of commitment to meet the economic needs of its
 people and the country has made significant economic
 advances in the more than two decades since independence.
 The multi-ethnic but Malay-dominated coalition government
 has demonstrated its concern for raising the standard of
 living of all its citizens and has made the alleviation
 of rural poverty -- mostly ethnic Malay -- the primary
 goal of its domestic policy.
 The health and nutrition situation in Malaysia is relatively
 good. Life expectancy at birth is 68.2 years and the popu-
 lation growth rate is 2.2 percent. Infant mortality runs
 at about 31 child deaths per 1000 live births. Sixty-two
 percent of the population has access to safe water and the
 caloric supply is more than sufficient to meet nutritional
 requirements for the overall population.
 Elementary education *is available to all Malaysians, with
 the government providing scholarships for the children of
 the poor, particularly Malays. Primary school enrollment
 is at 94 percent (1979). The adult literacy rate is over
 55 percent, with the rate of the entire population probably
 around 70 percent.
 As noted in the introduction, the per capital income in
 Malaysia is estimated at $1,586 for 1980. About 46 per-
 cent of the rural population and 16 percent of the urban
 is considered to be below the poverty level. In 1980 there
 was an average of 1.1 household per occupied private living
 quarters.
