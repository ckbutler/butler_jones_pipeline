 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish military
 intervention followed a coup d'etat directed from Greece which
 brought down the elected Government of President Makarios.
 Since that time, the Government of Cyprus has been able to
 exercise full control over only about two-thirds of the
 country's territory. About one-third of Cyprus is governed by
 an autonomous administration supported by the presence of
 Turkish military units. On November 15, 1983, this
 administration declared itself the "Turkish Republic of
 Northern Cyprus,* which is recognized by no country except
 Turkey. The Turkish intervention of 1974 caused an uprooting
 of many members of the larger Greek Cypriot population from
 areas now under Turkish Cypriot control, as well as the
 smaller Turkish Cypriot population in the Greek Cypriot-
 controlled south. Both involved loss of lives, homes, and
 means of livelihood. The Greek Cypriots point to these
 displacements, as well as to the unwillingness of the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities to allow resettlement of Greek Cypriots in
 the north, as the fundamental human rights question in Cyprus
 today. The Turkish Cypriots assert that the 1974 intervention
 was legal and point to violations of their human rights under
 the political system existing before 1974. The subsequent
 regrouping of the two communities in separate parts of the
 island, according to Turkish Cypriots, was necessary for their
 security and for the eventual establishment of a federal
 structure of government for both communities.
 The major human rights problem remaining from previous years
 is the issue of persons missing during the intercommunal
 strife of the 1960's and 1970's. Other unresolved problems
 are property ownership questions, the difficulty of travel
 between the sectors of the island, and the absence of freedom
 of settlement. Future human rights improvements in Cyprus
 will depend upon the ability of both parties to negotiate
 their differences and to agree on a basis for coexistence.
 Despite unresolved issues, both the Government of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot Administration are democratic systems
 based on free elections, which guarantee basic human rights in
 theory and in practice. Both Cypriot economies are founded on
 the free enterprise system with stress on private initiative
 and the rights of property, although the Turkish Cypriot
 economy provides a far greater role for state enterprises.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings instigated by government or opposition
 groups have not occurred in Cyprus since 1974. Two terrorist
 murders took place in Cyprus in 1984, both apparently related
 to internal conflicts within the Palestine Liberation
 Organization. On May 3, a Palestinian journalist, Hanna
 Muqbil, was murdered in Nicosia. On May 28-29, Ahmed Suleyman
 El-Saydy, allegedly a Palestinian fedayeen captain, was
 killed. No suspects were arrested in the first case, but
 several Syrian nationals were arrested in the second case and
 later deported as undesirables although no charges were
 brought.

 CYPRUS
 b. Disappearance
 Since 1974, there have been no reports of persons abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention. However,
 the issue of persons missing as a result of the intercommunal
 troubles of 1974 remains a source of dispute between the Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. A Committee on
 Missing Persons was established under the auspices of the U.N.
 Secretary General in 1981 to deal with the problem and, after
 3 years of procedural disagreements, commenced regular
 substantive sessions in the spring of 1984. To date, the
 Committee has made no visible progress in putting the cases of
 the missing to rest.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice in
 both communities. Adequate health care is provided in prison
 and detention facilities, and diet is considered normal.
 Family members may visit those in detention. After
 sentencing, prisoners may be visited once a month, or more
 frequently where humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may
 visit prisoners freely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by both the Government of Cyprus
 and Turkish Cypriot authorities. The right of habeas corpus
 is observed. Preventive detention does not exist in law, nor
 has it been reported in practice. No individual may be held
 for more than 3 days for investigation of a crime without
 referral of the case to the court for extension of the period
 of detention. Most periods of investigative detention do not
 exceed 8 or 10 days before formal charges are filed. No
 instance of exile was reported. There are no political
 prisoners on Cyprus.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair public trial is guaranteed by law.
 The judiciary is independent of executive or military
 control. Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of
 judges, although a request for a jury trial is usually
 granted. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. Civilians are not tried by military
 courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community provide guarantees protecting
 the individual against arbitrary interference. A judicial
 warrant is required, for example, for an official to enter a
 private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to the
 democratic traditions of both communities. However, Turkish
 
 
 944
 CYPRUS
 Cypriots complain that mail coming through the Government of
 Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened, or not
 delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by law and are widely and freely
 practiced. The press is free throughout the island, and it
 represents the entire political spectrum. Opposition papers
 frequently criticize both the governing authorities and their
 own leadership. There is no press censorship.
 Radio and television in south and north Cyprus are controlled
 by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities
 respectively. Although opposition and minority parties
 complain--not without cause--that they do not receive
 sufficient attention in the local media, the proliferation of
 party and independent newspapers in both communities enables
 their ideas and arguments to circulate easily.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right, based on law, to associate, organize, and hold
 meetings is respected in practice. Trade unions and
 confederations, both non-Communist and Communist, are free to
 organize on both sides of the Green Line, which divides the
 island between the two communities. Labor authorities are
 required by law to mediate disputes in cases which cannot be
 solved through normal collective bargaining. All Cypriot
 workers are permitted to strike, although the Turkish Cypriot
 community "legislature' has the power to invalidate a strike
 for a specific period of time. Two strikes in the Turkish
 Cypriot area, one in citrus packing houses and one in the
 .state" tourism industry, were declared illegal in 1984. In
 both cases, the strikes were quickly settled through the
 intervention of the 'Ministry of Labor and Social Security.'
 The unions charged that the invalidation of their strikes,
 which occurred at the height of demand in seasonal
 enterprises, hurt their bargaining ability.
 Unions on both sides freely take part in international
 meetings. The Government of Cyprus has taken a particularly
 active role in the International Labor Organization. Labor
 unions, more than most other organizations on Cyprus, attempt
 to maintain contact and cooperation across the Green Line.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in Cyprus. However, the Greek
 Orthodox Church in the south has the character of a state
 institution due to the historical role of the leader of the
 church, the ethnarch, as the spiritual leader of his people.
 The non-Greek Orthodox in the south enjoy certain advantages,
 chiefly exclusion from compulsory military service. As a
 result of the population exchange following the events of
 1974, there are approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots still
 living in the south, who are allowed to practice their religion
 freely. In the north, non-Muslims include members of the
 Christian Maronite minority, a small number of remaining Greek
 Cypriots, and foreign residents, all of whom are free to
 
 
 945
 CYPRUS
 practice their religion. Apart from the fact that members of
 the minority cannot serve in the Greek Cypriot armed forces,
 there is no discrimination based on membership or lack of
 membership in a particular faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of
 movement within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities restrict travel into or out of the Turkish Cypriot
 area. They bar Greeks and Greek Cypriots from entering the
 north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south, except
 when traveling for humanitarian, medical, or other special
 reasons. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents to visit
 the south are usually granted but they are generally not
 allowed to return. Foreigners coming from the south must
 obtain advance permission to enter the north. Greek Cypriot
 authorities also restrict the travel of foreigners. They may
 bar the entry into the Greek Cypriot area of foreigners who
 arrive at Turkish Cypriot ports or who stay overnight in the
 north. Special regulations apply to journalists.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although in both communities individuals facing military
 service or legal action may not be allowed to travel. Turkish
 Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some countries
 because their travel documents, issued by the Turkish Cypriot
 authorities, are not recognized by most countries, including
 the United States. Citizens may repatriate freely, although
 both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots returning from long
 stays abroad may be liable for military service if this
 obligation previously has not been met.
 Some refugees from Turkey and Eastern Europe come to Cyprus
 and are usually sent on to third countries as soon as
 arrangements for their resettlement can be made.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected by their
 people. They have lively multiparty political systems in
 which parties, actively and without restriction, compete for
 popular support. Greek Cypriots and Maronites livingqin the
 north--the latter having chosen before 1960 to be regarded as
 members of the Greek Cypriot community--do not participate in
 Turkish Cypriot elections, but elect their own village
 officials. They are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot
 elections but must make their way to the south in order to
 exercise their right.
 Women are less active in politics than men in both north and
 south, although this is due to custom rather than any legal
 impediment. No women in the north and only one in the south
 are members of Parliament, nor are there currently any women
 of ministerial rank in the north. A woman serves as Attorney
 General in the Republic of Cyprus Government. Two women
 currently serve as under secretaries in the Turkish Cypriot
 administration.

 CYPRUS
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights. For several years the question of
 human rights in Cyprus, as it relates to the events of 1974,
 has been on the Commission's agenda but, by agreement of the
 parties directly concerned, has been regularly postponed.
 However, the Greek Cypriot Government raised the still
 unresolved question of missing persons, alleging that some
 2,000 Greek Cypriots have remained unaccounted for since the
 events of 1974. The Committee on Missing Persons, established
 under U.N. auspices in 1981, began regular substantive
 sessions in the spring of 1984 to determine the fate or
 whereabouts of the missing. Representatives of international
 human rights organizations have open access to both the south
 and the north.
 Amnesty International did not mention Cyprus in its 1984
 report. Freedom House rates the Greek Cypriot portion 'free,*
 while it rates the Turkish portion "partly free" because of
 the Turkish military occupation.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Greek Cypriot economy is free enterprise oriented, with
 minimal government participation or regulation. The economy
 is based on manufacturing, trade, tourism and services,
 construction, and agriculture, with per capita gross national
 product at about $3,800. The Turkish Cypriot economy, closely
 linked to that of Turkey, is a mixture of state-owned and
 private enterprises. It suffers from problems similar to
 those in Turkey, including high inflation, low investment, and
 significant underemployment.
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to
 members of both communities regardless of race, religion,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Both societies are
 essentially middle class, with a small but prominent wealthy
 segment. Housing is adequate and is available for displaced
 persons. Most Cypriots are covered by a national health
 service scheme organized by their respective authorities.
 Illiteracy is virtually unknown among persons below the age of
 55. In both communities, the legal status of women is
 identical to that of men. However, custom has retarded the
 full participation of women in all aspects of public life.
 Politics, for example, has traditionally been a male preserve
 in both communities. Through changing attitudes and
 increasing contact with the outside world, however, women are
 experiencing increasing mobility.
