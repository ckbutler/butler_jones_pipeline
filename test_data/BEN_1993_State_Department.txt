 BENIN
 The Republic of Benin has a constitutional government headed by President
 Nicephore Soglo, who was elected in free and fair elections in 1991. There are a
 large number of political parties represented in the National Assembly. A working
 ition of approximately 34 parties referred to as the Presidential majority dis-
 solved in late 1993, and no party or grouping commands a majority of seats. There
 were tensions between the executive and the legislature over the installation of the
 new Constitutional Court which took place in June.
 The security forces are under civilan control: the 4,000 personnel of the armed
 forces are under the direction of the Minister of Defense, while the 1,500-person po-
 lie force comes under the Minister of the Interior. The 2,500-strong gendarmerie
 reports to both the Minister of Defense and the Minister of the Interior, it fills police
 functions in rural areas. The questionable commitment of the military establish-
 ment to democratic change remains a cause of concern, especially as voluntary de-
 partures have left the officer ranks ethnically unbalanced in favor of the otherwise
 underprivileged north. The Government has implemented a voluntary departure
 program to reduce the size of the armed forces and seeks to keep the armed forces
 professional and depoliticized.

 The underdeveloped economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, cotton
 production, regional trade, and small-scale offshore oil production. In accordance
 with World Bank and International Monetary Fund agreements, the Government is
 pursuing an austerity program for the purpose, among others, of privatizing state-
 owned enterprises, reducing fiscal expenditures, and deregulating trade. Benin suf-
 fers from a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt-servicing costs, and wide-
 spread unemployment.
 The human rights situation continued to improve. Positive developments included
 the establishment of the Constitutional Court as a potentially important judicial
 counterweight to the executive and legislative branches. The Government continued
 to respect the fundamental rights provided for in the 1990 Constitution, and, in a
 conciliatory move, President Soglo commuted the sentences of those persons, all
 northerners, convicted and still imprisoned for involvement in electoral violence in
 1991. There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees. However, the Gov-
 ernment continued to detain without trial a number of persons charged with torture
 under the old regime and did not address the serious administrative delays in proc-
 essing criminal cases, resulting in the denial of timely fair trial.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 See.ion 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.
 There were no reports of torture.
 A rising crime rate and a lack of police responsiveness to reports of crime some-
 times led mobs to take justice into their own hands, resulting in severe injuries to
 suspected criminals, particularly thieves caught in the act. While a number of such
 incidents took place in urban areas, there were no reported cases of such vigilantism
 being prosecuted.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and characterized by extensive overcrowding as
 well as lack of proper sanitation and medical facilities. The prison diet is grossly
 inadequate, and malnutrition and disease are common among prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Since 1990 arbitrary arrest and detention
 has ceased to be routinely practiced by the Government. Procedural safeguards
 against arbitrary arrest include a constitutional provision forbidding detention of
 more than 48 hours without a hearing by a magistrate, whose order is required for
 continued detention.
 However, there were credible reports that this 48-hour limit was exceeded in
 many cases, mainly due to the accepted practice of holding aperson without speci-
 fied time limit "at the disposition of" the public prosecutors office before presenting
 the case to a magistrate. According to a local human rights group, when such cases
 come to its attention and it lodges a protest, such detained individuals are promptly
 released, but there are cases in which persons have been held in this manner for
 periods of up to a year or more. There were no reports of incommunicado detention.
 There were no reports of political detainees held by the Government at year's end.
 However, the Government continued to hold the former head of Benin intelligence,
 who allegedly carried out acts of torture under the old regime, and a deputy in de-
 tention pending trial at year's end. The pair are being held on charges of torture,
 one since late 1991, the other since late 1992. The delay has been due to the com-
 plexity of the case, the large number of victims involved, and the reluctance of many
 victims to give evidence out of fear of retaliation.
 The Government has also held a group of military officers involved in a May 1992
 coup attempt in detention for over a year. International human rights groups ex-
 pressed concern to the Government about the officers' extended detention without
 charge or trial. A number of the accused officers escaped from prison in March, but
 the remaining officers are expected to be brought to trial in early 1994.
 The Constitution contains a provision prohibiting the Government from exiling
 any citizen, and many exiles have returned to Benin since the change in government
 and a 1990 Presidential amnesty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system is based on French civil law and
 on local customary law. A civilian court system operates on the national and provin-
 cial levels. Military disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by military mem-
 bers but have no jurisdiction over civilians. Judges in civil courts are career mag-
 istrates, appointed by the President, and administratively they come under the Min-
 
 
 istry of Justice. However, under the Constitution, officials are answerable only to
 the law in carrying out their duties and may not be transferred.
 Serious crimes are first presented to an investigating magistrate who decides
 whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant tria. A efendant has the right to
 be present at his or her trial and to be represented by an attorney, at public ex-
 pense, if necessary. In practice, indigent clients are provided with court-appointed
 counsel upon request.
 Under the Constitution, the highest courts are the Supreme Court, which is the
 court of last resort in all administrative and judicial matters, and the new Constitu-
 tional Court, charged with passing on the constitutionality of Beninese laws, includ-
 ing those that may violate fundamental human rights. The Constitutional Court
 was first seated in June. Whether it will develop as the main judicial counterweight
 to the legislative and executive branches of government remained to be seen, but
 it was the subject of much political debate between the Presidency and the National
 Assembly (see Section 3). The Constitution also provides for a High Court of Justice
 to be convened when necessary to preside over crimes against the nation committed
 by the President or by ministers in the Government.
 There were no political or security trials, and there were no reports of political
 prisoners being held at year's end. In a conciliatory gesture, President Soglo com-
 muted the sentences of the last persons, all of them northerners, in prison for acts
 of violence in connection with the 1991 elections.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of private property and the home and for
 the privacy of personal correspondence and communications. Police are required to
 obtain a judicial warrant before entering a private home, a requirement observed
 in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press and other media, and these rights were generally respected.
 Beninese freely discussed politics, both in public and private forums, including in
 the National Assembly. A large and active private press was represented through
 more than 15 private newspapers, mostly weeklies and monthlies.
 The Government continued to own and operate the media most influential in
 reaching the public, the local radio and television stations, and the one daily news-
 paper. However, official journalists continued to cover sensitive matters and to criti-
 cize the Government, including perceived indiscretions on the part of the President's
 spouse, as well as strong criticism of the President's delay in the seating of the Con-
 stitutional Court.
 Benin experienced a large number of libel cases brought against journalists in
 1993. In one notable case, brought by President Soglo, a journalist who had been
 convicted in open court in a criminal libel case, which observers described as fair,
 failed to appear at his sentencing hearing or appeal his conviction. His failure to
 appear led to his receiving the maximum sentence, 1 year's imprisonment. Several
 months later, he was apprehended and sent to prison to serve his sentence. There
 were complaints that the journalist went to prison subsequent to (and because of)
 the publication of another article critical of the President, a claim the President de-
 nied. Most journalists deny the incident had any chilling effect on their reporting,
 other than to make them careful to check the accuracy of their reports.
 There was no censorship of foreign books or artistic works. Foreign periodicals
 were widely available on newsstands, and much of the population has ready access
 to foreign broadcasts on short wave radio.
 In general, academic freedom is enjoyed in schools and in the sole university. Uni-
 versity professors are permitted to lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct re-
 search, and draw independent conclusions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution recognizes
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. These rights were generally re-
 spected. Permits are required for use of public places for demonstrations, and asso-
 ciations are required to register. Both permits and registrations are routinely grant-
 ed, as in the case of the long-clandestine Communist Party of Benin, which reg-
 istered as a political party for the first time.
 Multiple plitical parties as well as numerous religious and cultural associations
 exist. The Government did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations
 for failure or refusal to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions coexist in
 Benin with occasional friction. Adherence to a particular faith does not confer spe-
 cial status or benefit. Religious ceremonies and shrines of all faiths are protected
 
 
 10
 by law. There are no restrictions on religious ceremonies, teachings, foreign clergy,
 or conversion to any religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Domestic movement is impeded somewhat by the presence of police,
 gendarmerie, and customs roadblocks. Ostensibly present for the purpose of enforc-
 ing automotive safety and customs regulations, many of these checkpoints serve as
 a means for officials to exact bribes from travelers. Travel outside of Benin is not
 restricted for political reasons; those who travel abroad may return without hin-
 drance.
 Benin respects the right of first asylum and welcomes refugees, notably 150,000
 refugees from Togo in 1993. The majority of these refugees were accommodated by
 family and friends in Benin. Refugees who marry Beninese may apply for citizen-
 ship; other refugees are permitted to remain indefinitely but do not have the option
 of naturalization, though the Government helps integrate them into Beninese soci-
 et if they chose to remain. There were no reports of involuntary repatriation during
 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, and the Government continued the process of creating
 and consolidating its democratic institutions, notably in the installation of the Con-
 stitutional Court, an event which finally took place in June.
 The conflict between President Soglo and the National Assembly over the seating
 of the Constitutional Court centered on the qualifications of the designated mem-
 bers, the infrastructure of the Court, and the timing of the installation ceremony.
 The President and an informal coalition of parties commanded a majority in the
 National Assembly for much of 1993 and used it effectively to gain passage of the
 controversial 1993 budget. The Constitution provides for a 5-year term of office for
 the President (who is limited to 2 terms) and a 4-year term  or National Assembly
 members (who may serve an unlimited number of terms).
 Women are poorly represented in the political process. There are 2 women in the
 19-member Cabinet and only 4 female deputies in the 64-member National Assem-
 bly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental organizations monitor human rights; they include the
 Human Rights Commission, the Study and Research Group on Democracy and Eco-
 nomic and Social Development, the Association of Christians Against Torture, and
 the League for the Defense of Human Rights in Benin. The gups' activities in
 1993 included drawing attention to poor prison conditions, calling upon the Presi-
 dent to stop delaying installation of the Constitutional Court, drawing attention to
 corruption, and emphasizing the unacceptability of procedural delays in the court
 system.
 In contrast to the attitude of the former authoritarian regime, which considered
 outside investigation into human rights unwarranted interference in internal af-
 fairs, the current Government has welcomed nongovernmental and international
 scrutiny of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on the these factors is prohibited in the Constitution and
 by law, and in practice the Government generally respected these prohibitions.
 Women.-The Constitution specifically states that women are the equal of men in
 the political, economic, and social spheres, but they face extensive societal discrimi-
 nation, especially in rural areas, where they occupy a subordinate role and are re-
 s ponsible for much of the hard labor on subsistence farms. Women in all parts of
 the country are the equals of men in inheritance and property rights in the courts,
 though local custom in some areas does not permit women to inherit real property.
 As a consequence, women increasingly approached the courts to resolve inheritance
 and property issues. Women do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as
 men, and in some parts of the country, families are reluctant to have their daugh-
 ters educated at all. Overall, the literacy rate for women is only 16 percent com-
 pared to 32 percent for men.
 While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife beating,
 occurs, although it is prohibited by law. Incidents are sometimes reported in the pri-
 vate press and, when they are brought to the attention of judicial or police authori-
 ties, they are treated as criminal cases. However, some judges and police are reluc-
 tant to intervene seriously, considering such affairs to be family matters. Among
 
 
 women's groups, the Association of Women Jurists has taken an active role in edu-
 cating women about their legal rights.
 Children.-The Government recognizes its responsibilities for the protection and
 welfare of children as outlined in both the Constitution and the African Charter of
 Human Rights and People's Rights, to which Benin subscribes. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs is charged generally with the protection of children's rights.
 The Government's commitment to children has been particularly focused on the edu-
 cation and health sectors, and especially its constitutional obligation to provide uni-
 versal education for children. Education and public health remain priority sectors
 even in the face of a difficult economic austerity program. Most notable are the ad-
 vances in primary education and the highly successful vaccination program con-
 ducted throughout the country.
 Some infants born with deformities are deemed to be sorcerers and reportedly
 killed at birth in some rural areas. The Government deals with such matters as
 criminal offenses and regularly prosecutes offenders. There were also credible re-
 ports that a number of children were sent, often by their families and for a fee,
 through unscrupulous traders to work as domestic servants and farm laborers in
 other countries in the region, often in deplorable conditions (see also Section 6).
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision), which is condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to physical and mental health, is practiced on females
 at a young age. Conventional wisdom had been that the practice existed primarily
 in the north, but it has become evident that the practice is more widespread in the
 south than formerly believed, although statistical evidence is not available.
 Infibulation does not appear to be widely practiced, if at all, in Benin. Recent re-
 search by a small Beninese nongovernmental organization found that those who per-
 form such circumcisions, themselves often elderly women, have a strong profit mo-
 tive in the continued practice. The Government has cooperated with an inter-African
 committee working against the practice of female genital mutilation by allowing lo-
 cally produced posters and pamphlets about the practice to be made available at
 government health clinics.
 NationallEthniclRacial Minorities.-Benin has a long history of regional rivalry.
 This led to violence during the 1991 elections, when northerners supporting ex-
 President Kerekou's candidacy clashed with southerners and at least one death en-
 sued. In a move to reduce regional tensions, President Soglo commuted the sen-
 tences of the last persons serving prison sentences for acts of violence at that time,
 all of them northerners. However, relatively few northerners have been appointed
 to senior governmental positions and this, as well as the general lack of economic
 development in the north, leads to regional dissatisfaction with the Government.
 The southern third of the country, which was favored during the colonial period, has
 about two-thirds of the population and is itself divided among various ethnic and
 religious groups.
 Religious Minorities.-No one religion can accurately claim a majority of the popu-
 lation as its followers. Christians and followers of the Vodun traditional religion are
 concentrated in the south, and Muslims and followers of other traditional religions
 are concentrated in the .north.
 Government action in the face of interfaith conflicts was the subject of criticism
 from nearly all religious groups in 1993. Action to quell tensions between Muslims
 and followers of traditional religion in Porto-Novo in April was tardy, and two peo-
 ple died in rioting before the Government intervened. In the same month, in re-
 sponse to protests from followers of traditional religions about disrespect to their
 practices, government officials in Atlantique province told Christians not to work
 their fields on   traditional market days, causing the Christians to      make
 countercharges of religious discrimination. In a case in which two opposing groups
 from a small Christian sect repeatedly brawled in the streets, the Minister of the
 Interior suspended the registration, and thus the legal existence, of the church for
 several months, only restoring registration upon receiving assurances the violence
 would cease.
 People with Disabilities.-The Constitution contains a clause mandating that the
 State "look after the handicapped.* However, there are no legislatively or otherwise
 mandated provisions of accessibility for disabled persons. The Government runs a
 number of social centers for disabled persons and conducts seminars, including one
 in 1993 attended by government officials and members of associations of persons
 with disabilities, to encourage the handicapped to become better organized and to
 recommend methods for improved social integration. Nonetheless, disabled persons
 are subject to societal discrimination. For example, they are sometimes popularly
 believed to be cursed and are treated as outcasts and forced into beggary.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The December 1990 Constitution gives workers the
 freedom to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and those rights are respected
 in practice. Benin's labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in subsistence
 agriculture (80 percent), with less than 2 percent of the population engaged in the
 modern (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent of the wage earners belong to labor
 unions. There were efforts to organize certain workers in the informal sector, nota-
 bly motorcycle taxi drivers and automotive mechanics.
 In 1974 all preexisting unions were absorbed into a single trade union confed-
 eration, the National Workers' Union of Benin (UNSTB), which for 17 years was the
 designated mass organization of a single-party Marxist regime. The UNSTB de-
 clared its independence from the former ruling party in 1990 and now claims 26 na-
 tionwide affiliated unions. It represents workers at the International Labor Organi-
 zation (ILO). The Confederation of Autonomous Unions (CSA), a separate and larger
 confederation formed in 1991, represents an fidditional 26 unions, mostly in the pub-
 lic sector. In February the National Association of Public Administration Trade
 Unions (FENSAP), organized in 1992, changed its name to the General Confed-
 eration of Workers of Benin (CGTB). A fourth confederation, the Union Center of
 Workers of Benin (CSTB), formed in late 1993.
 There were a number of labor actions, including strikes of railway workers, airline
 workers, and civil servants. The Government took no action to impede any of these
 strikes or other labor union demonstrations. The right to strike was respected, even
 when it proved highly disruptive as in airport workers' and railroad workers'
 strikes. There were no known efforts to retaliate against strikers.
 Confederations and individual unions have the right to affiliate with international
 labor movements. The Government designated the head of the CSA to represent the
 workers at the International Labor Organization conference in Geneva, with the
 head of UNSTB serving as adviser. In 1990 the UNSTB disaffiliated from the for-
 merly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions, and in 1992 it affiliated
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, which took place on such issues as assistance to laid-off work-
 ers. The Code is basically copied from the French colonial Labor Code. Revisions to
 the Labor Code were under consideration by the National Assembly in late 1993.
 Individual labor unions are authorized to negotiate with employers on labor matters
 and represent workers' grievances to both employers and the Government, with the
 latter often acting voluntarily as arbitrator. Wages in the public sector are set by
 law and regulation via a schedule that is periodically reviewed. The schedule has
 not been changed since 1984 due to the economic collapse of the previous govern-
 ment and the subsequent austerity program required by international financial in-
 stitutions. Private sector wages in one of the larger industrial enterprises i.e., a
 brewery, were set by the employer in 1992 after informal consultations with labor
 unions and the Government.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account when making decisions on hiring, work distribution, professional or vo-
 cational training, or dismissal. The Labor Code sets out extensive procedural mecha-
 nisms to enforce all of its provisions including the use of inspectors from the Min-
 istry of Labor and labor tribunals with rights of appeal into the regular court sys-
 tem.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits the em-
 ployment or apprenticeship of children under the age of 18 in any enterprise. How-
 ever, enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is limited, and child
 labor does occur, particularly in rural areas, where children under the age of 14
 often work on family farms. Some child labor occurs in urban areas, primarily in
 the informal sector. For example, street vendors of newspapers and foodstuffs are
 frequently under the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. Most of those actually employed in
 the wage sector earn much more than the lowest minimum wage, which was last
 set in 1984 and is sufficient only to provide rudimentary food and housing for a fam-
 ily. It must be supplemented by subsistence farming or small trade in the informal
 sector if a worker and his family are to enjoy a decent living. The lowest minimum
 wage rate was approximately $49 per month (CFA Francs 13,500).
 
 
 13
 For the wage sector, the Labor Code establishes a workweek varying between 40
 hours (nonagricultural employees) and 56 hours (security guards), depending on the
 type of work. The law provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week.
 The Government sup ports policies designed to improve the condi ions of workers
 in both the agricultural and industrial sectors. The Labor Code establishes health
 and safety standards, but enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is
 weak. The Labor Code is silent on whether workers have the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 However, there are extensive provisions concerning the right of the Ministry of
 Labor to take note of dangerous work conditions and require employers to remedy
 them.
