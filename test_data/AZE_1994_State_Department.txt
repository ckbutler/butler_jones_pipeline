 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev,
 a former Communist Party First Secretary of Azerbaijan and Soviet Politburo mem-
 ber, assumed presidential powers after the 1993 overthrow of his democratically
 elected predecessor, Abulfez Elcibey, and was elected President in October 1993. He
 and his supporters dominate the Government and the 52-member Mill Maclis (Na-
 tional Council), which exercises parliamentary powers.
 Police and the Ministry of National Security are entrusted with internal security.
 They were responsible for widespread human rights abuses, including beating and
 detaining persons arbitrarily, conducting searches and seizures without warrants,
 and suppressing peaceful demonstrations.
 Azerbaijan has a state-controlled economy rich in oil, gas, and cotton. The econ-
 omy continued to deteriorate in 1994 because of the conflict with the Armenians
 over Nagorno-Karabakh. The Government has not effectively replaced or restored
 the trade links with the rest of the former Soviet Union.
 There were widespread human rights abuses in 1994, some of which arose out of
 the continuing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Both sides used artillery and rocket fire
 indiscriminately against civilian targets, and Azerbaijanis also mounted air attacks
 against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Both sides have thus far respectea the
 cease-fire negotiated in May. The Government waged a harsh campaign to suppress
 the political opposition and to censor the press. Security authorities beat detainees
 and demonstrators and arrested persons arbitrarily. While the Government toler-
 ates the existence of independent media and political parties, it has demonstrated
 a disregard for the right to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association
 when it has deemed it in its interest to do so. Although harassment of ethnic Arme-
 nians outside Nagorno-Karabakh---by individual Azerbajais rather than as delib-
 erate government policy-has subsided considerably, that community continues to
 live in fear and uncertainty.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-On the night of September 29, gunmen
 killed two high-ranking Azerbaijani officials: Aflyaddin Jalilov, Vice Speaker of the
 Parliament, and Shamsi Rahimov, a member of the President's staff. These killings
 marked a significant increase in the level of political violence. By year's end,  e
 authorities had been unsuccessful in discovering the perpetrators of these assassina-
 tions, as well as of the terrorist bombings that claimed several dozen lives in Baku
 subway and railway stations in 1994. The Azerbaijanis have accused Armenians
 based in Russia of responsibility for the bombing incdents. According to the Na-
 tional Security Ministry bombing attacks in 1994 on rail lines and the Baku sub-
 way resulted in 37 deaths and over 100 wounded. No group claimed responsibility.
 b. Disappearance.-The practice of taking and exchanging hostages was relatively
 less common than in the early phases of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Both sides
 have reportedly taken both military prisoners and civilian captives. Private parties
 have in some instances held prisoners of war and civilians and arranged ransoms
 for profit. A separate practice has been the government-to-government exchange of
 civilian prisoners; such official exchanges in 1994, including an exchange in October
 under the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) auspices, in-
 volved under 40 persons from each side. Azerbaijani gangs have ceased their kid-
 naping of ethnic Armenian residents in Baku. The overwhelming majority of ethnic
 Armenians outside Nagorno-Karabakh have already been driven out of the country,
 and those who do remain by necessity maintain a very low profile.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture, but supporters of the opposition Azerbaijan Popu-
 lar Front (APF) assert credibly that police beat opposition leaders in the course of
 breaking up political demonstrations (see Section 2.b.).
 Prisons conditions are grim, and provisions for medical care are inadequate. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) monitors the treatment and condi-
 tions of Armenian prisoners in Azerbaijani detention centers. In Nagorno-Karabakh,
 the ICRC has visited Azerbaijani prisoners held in connection with the conflict in
 order to monitor their treatment and conditions of detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police and security forces regularly de-
 tained and arrestedporsons in conjunction with government efforts to restrict free-
 dom of the press and opposition poitical activities (see Section 2.a. and 2.b.). In ad-
 dition in another instance of arbitrary use of police powers, police on August 13 de-
 tained 10 intellectuals at a Balm teahouse on vague charges of disobeying police au-
 thority but released them after a few days in detention. Arbitrary detentions oc-
 curred in several waves during periods of political unrest and demonstrations. Esti-
 mates of the number detained differ widely, but a total of about 200 people may
 have been detained without charges. They were released after brief periods of deten-
 tion (under a week in most cases).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Azerbaijan's criminal justice system, including its
 courts, laws, and procedures, follow the former Soviet model. The courts of general
 jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District and municipal
 courts try the overwhelming majority of cases, but a Supreme Court tries some.
 Both may act as the court of first instance, depending on the nature and seriousness
 of the crime.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district, municipal,
 and republic levels and are ultimately responsible to the Prosecutor General, ap-
 pointed by Parliament. Prosecutors and defense attorneys by law have equal status
 before the courts. In practice, prosecutors still are very influential because court
 proceedings are not conducted in an adversarial manner. Prosecutors direct all
 criminal investigations, which are usually conducted by the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs. Moreover, the presumption of innocence with respect to defendants has not
 been incorporated into the Criminal Code.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions
 back to the prosecutor for "additional investigation." Such cases may then be
 dropped or closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 By law, trials are to be publicly conducted except when government secrets are
 considered at issue. Defendants may confront witnesses and present evidence. The
 court appoints an attorney for indigent defendants. Defendants have the right of ap-
 peal, as do prosecutors.
 Judges do not function independently from the other branches of government. The
 current Gevernmeut has removed judges considered close to the previous Elcibey
 government. The statutory commitment to public trial also has not always been
 
 
 741
 upheld, e.g., in the case of Azerbaijani militar officer Arn Pashayev. Pashayev was
 a prominent APF figure charged with the willful loss of military positions in the
 KEirabakh conflict. InJuy po ce diserd ad beat relatives protesing court ve
 ceedings. Several related  a  have-en pen"ding in the courts. There were alout
 25 persons in prison on political grounds at year's end.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The So-
 viet surveillance apparatus, reorganized as the Ministry of National Security, be-
 came more active than under the previous Elcibey government. It is widely and
 credibly believed that the Ministry taps telephones, especially those of foreigners
 and prominent political and business figures. The police have periodically raided. the
 offices of opposition press and political parties on the grounds of a search for illicit
 weapons. The post-October emergency legislation, extended in December by the leg-
 islature until early February 1995, made explicit the right to conduct such searches.
 The police also make periodic sweeps in search of young men evading the draft.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humardtarian Law in Internal Con-
 flitcs.-The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict began in 1988. The ethnic Armenian popu-
 lation of Nagorno-Karabakh sought union with Armenia until the collapse of the So-
 viet Union and the creation of independent Armenian and Azerbaijani republics
 with internationally recognized borders. The demand of the Nagorno-Karabah Ar-
 menians later became one for independence from Azerbaijan.
 By June 1992 ethnic Armenians had expelled all ethnic Azerbaijanis from the
 Nagorno-Karabai region and had opened a corridor to Armenia through the Azer-
 baijani region of Lachin, which had a substantial Kurdish population. In 1993 they
 captured he province of Kelbacar, which lies between Nagorno-Karabakh and Ar-
 menia, as well as large areas surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh. They drove out the
 inhabitants and looted and burned the provincial capitals and most of the villages
 of these regions. The U.N. Security Council condemned these offensive actions, in-
 cluding the looting and burning.
 Until the May 1994 cease-fire, all parties to the conflict engaged in indiscriminate
 shelling and rocket fire against civilian targets, including in both directions along
 the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. Before the cease-fire, the Azerbaijanis also mounted
 fixed-wing air attacks against civilian targets in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Arme-
 nia. All parties to the conflict have cut normal trade and transportation links to the
 other sides, causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia,
 and the Azerbaijani exclave of Naxcivan.
 After agreeing to a cease-fire in May, the parties maintained it throughout the
 rest of the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government severely restricts freedom of
 speech and press. It officially censors the press and subjects newspaper premises to
 searches and raids. It may close newspapers for 1 month if they violate military cen-
 sorship by publishing informaton contrary to what it believes are the interests of
 the country. Despite warnings to several papers, the Government has not exercised
 this authority.
 Official censorship decreased after the state of emergency was lifted in September
 1993, but its existence remained influential in convincing editors to self-censor their
 copy. Police searches and raids were an~other way of intrferingwith the operations
 of the press, much of which is affiliated with political parties. For example, in Feb-
 ruary police temporarily seized part of the Azadiq newspaper's premises after
 weeks of repeated unauthorized serches of Azadliq and other newspaper premises.
 Police conducted similar searches at Azadliq's premises on at least one other occa-
 sion during 1994. Both incidents involved a searh for arms and unspecified subver-
 sive literature. The searches were carried out on the authority of the district police
 commander, without judicial involvement. Both newspaper offices and their dis-
 tributors remained subject to surprise raids. For example, authorities raided the dis-
 tributor Gaya in March after a caricature of the Interior Minister was published.
 After imposing a new state of emergency in early October on Gance and Baku,
 following the political crisis, the Government added a third a third level of censor-
 ship to the existing military and political censors, with immediate and noticeable
 effect on newspaer editorial content.
 The number of newspapers available, both in Azerbaijani and Russian, remained
 large, although many suffered economic hardship, and some folded or reduced their
 frequency. owever, new papers were also started. Many opposition newspapers
 continued to publish, including at least five major newspapers sympathetic to or of-
 ficially published by the APF, the Musavat Party, and the Azerbaijan National Inde-
 pendence Party, the main political opposition. Small sesationalist newspapers con-
 tinued to publish investigative interviews and news items.
 
 
 742
 The Government controls most radio and television, and the opposition has little
 access to the official electronic media. In June the Government closed an independ-
 ent television station, B-M-TI, allegedly for violating government regulations but
 apparently because its owners spoke out against the Government's foreign policy.
 In an incident in November, the director of an independent television-radio com-
 pany, ANS, was beaten at the direction of the head of the state radio-television en-
 tity, and the Baku commandant briefly closed ANS' FM radio and television sta-
 tions. President Aliyev ordered the resumption of ANS broadcasting.
 Correct political connections are a prime requisite for those seeking new posts in
 government-controlled institutions, including universities. However, there are sev-
 eral professors with tenure who are active in opposition parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation.-While the Government toler-
 ates the existence of political parties, it has demonstrated a disregard for the right
 to freedom of peaceful assembly and association when it has deemed it in its inter-
 est to do so. The authorities have invoked imminent daner to law and order in car-
 rying out such actions as the search of APF offices in February, when they allegedly
 discovered arms caches. The authorities frequently denied opposition requests for
 permits to hold demonstrations. When unauthorized demonstrations were held, po-
 lice frequently suppressed them, using force and causing injuries,as in the May 21
 demonstrations against the Government's policy toward Nagorno-Karabakh and the
 September 10 protests against both foreign and domestic policies. In the May dem-
 onstrations, police detained over 200 persons, including 3 Milli Macis deputies,
 holding some detainees for up to 1 month without bringing formal charges and with-
 out allowing relatives access.
 Associations other than political parties can generally function freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. Members of all faiths practice
 their religions without restrictions, with one important exception: Armenian church-
 es, many vandalized in past years, remain closed, and few of the Armenians left in
 Azerbaijan would have felt secure enough to attend them had they been open.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Ministry of National Security enforces a longstanding restriction
 zone in the southeast on the Iranian border from which all nonresidents are ex-
 cluded. The October state of emergency restricts access to the Baku region by non-
 residents.
 The Government officially recognizes freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel continued, although less than 1,000 emigrated during the first 9 months of
 1994. Some 18,000 Armenians and part-Armenians, mostly in mixed marriages, re-
 main in the country. The Government stripped many of the remaining ethnic Arme-
 nians of their official documents for both internal and external travel, making it dif-
 ficult for them to change residence or to travel outside Azerbaijan.
 In general, low-level officials seeking bribes harass members of minorities wishing
 to emigrate; this is especially the case of draft-age men, who are required to obtain
 documentation from several levels of military authorities before they may leave for
 any international travel All citizens of Azerbaijan wishing to travel abroad must
 first obtain exit visas or official passports from the Government.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations
 Children's Fund (UNICEF) offices in Baku estimate that, as of November 1994,
 there were 900,000 refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan. These
 fi  es do not include the 50,000 internally displaced persons caused by the hos-
 tities in the spring of 1994. Close to 500,000 fled the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenian
 offensives into Azeri-inhabited areas outside the bounds of Nagorno-Karabakh be-
 tween March and September 1993, joining the 150,000 who fled in 1992 and the
 over 200,000 who were expelled from Armenia in 1988-89.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government by peaceful means.
 Heydar Aliyev assumed presidential powers in June 1993 after the overthrow of the
 democratically elected president, Abulfez Elcibey, and won the presidential election
 in October 1993.
 In theory, the President shares power with the 52-member Milli Macis (National
 Council) which took over parliamentary powers after the 1992 dissolution of the Su-
 preme Soviet. In fact, President Aliyev and his close supporters dominate govern-
 ment policy and tolerate little opposition to their views. Parliamentary elections are
 due in 1995.
 There were no restrictions on women or minorities participating in politics. Cur-
 rently, the Education Minister is the only woman of ministerial rank. In the Milli
 Macis, there are 3 women out of 52 representatives, or 6 percent. Minorities such
 
 
 743
 as Lezghis and Talysh formed regional groupings in Parliament and published
 newspapers in their own languages. There are no minority parties, and a separatist
 Talysh leader faces charges of sedition. There are two Islamic religious parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The local human rights community is composed largely of individuals rather than
 well-developed organizations. Police have occasionally harassed such individuals.
 The Government has expressed willingness to receive delegations from human
 rights organizations and has met with such delegations. On the other hand, police
 disrupted a July meeting between opposition parties and a visiting delegation from
 Human Rights Watch/Helainki.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1991 constitutional act of independence prohibits discrimination based on eth-
 nicity, religion, or gender.
 Women.- Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the
 right to participate in all aspects of political, economic, and social life. President
 Aliyev has appointed women to senior government positions. The most active sup-
 porters of the APF after Elcibey's overthrow were the women's groups attached to
 it. In general, women are given extensive opportunities for education, work, and po-
 litical activity. However, traditional social norms continue to restrict women's role
 in politics and the economy. In general, representation of women is sharply lower
 in higher levels of the work force. Female representation in executive positions in
 leading businesses is even lower-1.5 percent, according to a recent UNICEF study.
 Violence against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaian's patriarchal society. In
 rural areas, wives have no real recourse against violence by their husbands, regard-
 less of the law. Rape is severely punishable but, especially in rural areas, only a
 small fraction of offenses are prosecuted. Police sources indicate that there are
 about 200 cases annually of crimes of violence against women. These figures prob-
 ably reflect underreporting, especially from conservative rural areas. Crime levels
 in this field, as in others, have risen considerably due to the flood of refugees to
 the cities and the economic crisis of the p ast few years.
 Children .-The 1991 constitutional law on independence guarantees children
 rights on the same footing as adults. The Criminal Code prescribes severe penalties
 for crimes against children. The Government has attempted to shield families
 against economic hardship in the wake of price liberalization by authorizing child
 subsidies. The subsidies are far from overing the shortfall of family budgets, and
 the Government does not have the financial means to meet its new commitments.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Both governmental and societal repression
 and discrimination against ethnic Armenians continued. Recently, members of the
 Russian community have lodged complaints with the Government as well as with
 the Russian Embassy, alleging official inaction concerning some 108 seizures during
 the past year of apartments of Russian speakers by ethnic Azerbaijani displaced
 persons.
 The 18,000 ethnic Armenian and part-Armenians, most of them members of
 mixed families, continued to live in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.
 Kidnapings of ethnic Armenians from Baku virtually ceased after early 1994, al-
 though scattered incidents of harassment have been reported in the press. There are
 credible reports of denial of medical treatment to ethnic Armenians and confiscation
 of their travel and residence documents and most of those Armenians who lost jobs
 infprevious years are still unemployed. Many are too frightened to appear in public.
 People With Disabilitles.-The law on support for invalids, enacted in late 1993,
 prescribes priority for invalids and the handicapped in obtaining housing, as well
 as discounts for public transport and pension supplements. The Government does
 not have the means in its current fmancial crisis to make good on its commitments.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Azerb'jani labor unions still operate as they did
 under the Soviet system and remain highly dependent on the Government. Such
 progovernent umbrella organizations as the Azerbaijani Union of Professional
 Workers are free to participate in international bodies. There is a legal right to
 strike. Widespread strikes in the crucial oil sector during the summer over unpaid
 back wages led to a backdown of the Government and an agreement to raise wages.
 In general there are no established mechanisms to avoid such wildcat strikes.
 Unions and workers per se were not the subject of human rights abuses.
 The 1991 constitutional law grants freedom of association, including the right to
 form labor unions. However, most industrial and white-collar workers are organized
 
 
 744
 into one or another subbranch of the Azerbaijani Labor Federation (Profsoyuz), run
 by the Government (which also still owns the major industries). There are no formal
 restrictions on strikes nor provisions for retribution against strikers (under normal
 conditions before the imposition of a state of emergency in October). Unions are free
 to form federations and to affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining re-
 mained at a rudimentary level. Government-appointed boards and directors run the
 major enterprises and set wages. Unions do not participate in determining wage lev-
 els. In a carryover from the Soviet system, both management and workers are con-
 sidered to be members of the Profsoyuz.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and is not known to be practiced. Two departments in the prosecu-
 tor's office (the Department of Implementation of the Labor Code and theDepart-
 ment for Oversight Over Minors) enforce the prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16 years. Children of 14 are allowed to work during vacations with the consent of
 their parents and certification of a physiciai Children of 15 may work if the work-
 place's labor union does not object. There is no explicit restriction on the kinds of
 work that children aged 15 may perform with union consent. The Government
 (Labor Ministry) has primary enforcement responsibility for child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government set the nationwide adminis-
 trative minimum wage by decree, raising it numerous times because of inflation. As
 of December, it was less than $1.00 (4,000 manats) per month. The recommended
 wage level to meet basic subsistence needs was estimated to be 67,000-75,000
 manats, as of November. It is not known how effectively the payment of the mini-
 mum wage was enforced.
 The disruption of trade links with the rest of the former Soviet Union has affected
 employment in many industries. Idle factory workers typically receive a third of
 their former wage. Under these conditions, even recourse to the extended family's
 "safety net" and outside sources of income make it difficult for broad sectors of the
 population to reach the subsistence level.
 The legal workweek is 41 hours. There is a 1-hour lunch break per day, plus
 shorter breaks in the morning and afternoon.
 Health and safety standards exist but are by and large ignored in the workplace.
