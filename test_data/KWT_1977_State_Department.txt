 KUWAIT
 Kuwait is a small country in the northeastern corner
 of the Arabian Peninsula. Long a British pro-
 tectorate, it became fully independent in 1961. For
 more than 200 years, Kuwait has'been governed by the
 al-Sabah family and is led by a constitutional
 monarch  (the Amir), who traditionAlly makes major
 government decisions in consultation with other members
 of the ruling family and tribal, business, and
 religious leaders. Kuwait is one of the most pro-
 gressive countries in the Middle East in providing
 civil rights and social welfare to its citizens.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State has no evidence that torture,
 which is prohibited by the constitution, is, in
 fact, practiced in Kuwait. The Department does not
 have any information concerning the allegations of
 torture as reported by Amnesty International in
 paragraph four of this report.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Department of State has no evidence that these
 practices, which are prohibited by the constitution,
 exist in Kuwait.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are prohibited by
 the constitution; with a few exceptions they are
 not sanctioned by the Kuwaiti Government. At times
 of tension with neighboring states, Kuwaiti
 authorities sometimes institute nighttime road-
 blocks. Also on occasion persons without proper
 identification are detained by the police. Several
 labor unionists who objected publicly to the
 1976 suspension of those parts of the constitution
 dealing with the National Assembly were detained
 briefly, although charges were not pressed. Amnesty
 International knows of no political prisoners in
 Kuwait.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait has a well-developed legal system which oro-
 vides for public trial, right of anneal, and
 representation. The Department of State has no
 evidence that Kuwait conducts secret or unfair
 trials. On rare occasions, aliens with radical
 political views have been deported without judicial
 process.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 To the knowledge of U.S. officials, the constitut-
 ional prohibition against invasion of the home is
 respected.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Kuwait has spent its large oil revenues (on the
 order of 10 billion dollars per year) on a wide
 range of programs to provide its citizens with jobs,
 housing, medical care, and education. The Govern-
 ment has instituted food subsidies and a modest
 public housing program for non-Kuwaiti residents.
 Medical care at nominal cost is available to aliens
 at government facilities.
 Income is widely distributed among Kuwait's citizens,
 largely through commercial laws which hold that a
 Kuwaiti individual or corporate entity must be
 involved in virtually every type of business trans-
 action.
 Any examination of political, social or economic life
 in Kuwait must take into consideration the differences
 between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti citizens. Kuwaiti
 citizenship carries with it extensive economic and
 social benefits, but is rarely given to persons of
 other nationalities. Many of the resident Pales-
 tinians, for example, have lived and worked in
 Kuwait for twenty or more years, but do not have any
 immediate prospect of enjoying the extra benefits
 of Kuwaiti citizenship such as higher government

 salaries, land ownership, oensions, the right-to'
 vote, and rightsto majority interest in business
 ventures.
 In Kuwait, women have equal educational opportunities,
 hold important positions in government (but not at
 the ministerial or deputy ministerial level) and
 have managerial and/or ownership roles in several
 private companies and financial institutions.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Kuwaitis and other residents are generally free to
 speak as they wish. Newspapers are not subject to
 censorship prior to publication, but they are
 subject to suspension for violation of laws re-
 garding political content. These laws use phrases
 such as "spread dissension," "involved in nolitical
 matters" and "contradict the national interest,"
 to describe the grounds for such suspensions. In
 January, 1978 a daily newspaper was suspended
 for one week for commenting on the need for and
 possibility of changes in the Kuwaiti Council o
 Ministers. The government had apparently in-
 structed newspapers not to speculate on cabinet
 changes following the death of the late Amir and
 the accession of the Crown Prince as the new Amir
 on December 31, 1977. Editors are criminally
 liable for violating these laws, but to date there
 have been no prosecutions.
 Kuwait recognizes freedom of assembly, but the per-
 mission of local authorities is required for rallies
 or demonstrations. The Department of State does
 not know the number of such requests for permission
 submitted to the authorities or the frequency with
 which they are granted or denied. The impression
 of USG officials is that there are few requests
 and most of these are honored. If the government
 were to deny a request for a rally or public
 
 
 379
 demonstration, it would be for reasons of public
 order.
 There is freedom of worship. Islam is the pre-
 dominant religion, but non-Islamic religions are
 permitted.
 Labor unions exist but are monitored by the Govern-
 ment. There have been strikes in recent years,
 but none in the past year.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Kuwaitis and other residents are free to travel about
 the country and to travel outside as well. There
 is freedom of emigration. Since September 1977,
 the Government has prohibited participation of
 national societies, associations and trade unions
 (gioups subsidized or authorized by the Government)
 in international meetings without prior approval of
 the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. The
 Government also makes selection of the delegates to
 such meetings subject to review by the same Ministry.
 Non-Kuwaitis working in the country must have the
 sponsorship of Kuwaiti citizens.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 ByAugust of 1976, the ruling family of Kuwait had
 grown increasingly apprehensive as Arab political
 divisions, particularly those afflicting Lebanon,
 threatened to surface in this small but very wealthy
 city-state. The National Assembly and the-local
 press became fora for quarreling Arab factions.
 Several moderate Arab regimes were under criticism
 in National Assembly speeches and newspaper columns.
 There was evidence that some Arab governments were
 paying for media attacks on other Arab governments--
 all to the growing embarrassment of the Kuwaiti
 leadership. Kuwait's rulers apparently were con-
 cerned that the security of their country, in which
 
 
 380
 the resident foreign population outnumbers native
 Kuwaitis, might be undermined.
 In late August 1976, the Amir suspended those poarts
 of the Constitution dealing with the National Assembly,
 dissolved the Assembly, and tightened controls on the
 press. Some newspapers and magazines were suspended
 for periods of one to three months.
 The Government also replaced the leaders of certain
 professional societies. The Istiqlal Club, a
 political discussion group, was disbanded in July
 1977.
 There is now no popular elective process for govern-
 ment officials. The Government has publicly pro-
 claimed its intent to restore representative
 government within four years. When the National
 Assembly was in existence, only adult male Kuwaiti
 citizens were enfranchised.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In 1976 Amnesty International reported detailed
 charges that criminal prisoners in Kuwait's Central
 Prison were "invariably ill-treated and often sub-
 jected to torture". The Government of Kuwait denied
 these allegations in a letter to Amnesty. In March
 1977 Amnesty requested that the government undertake
 an investigation of the allegations. To our
 knowledge the government has not replied to that
 request. As noted in la and lb above, we do not
 have enough information to comment on the allegations
 of torture.
