 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic whose main political
 institutions, the Presidency and the National Congress, are
 determined by free elections. An independent judiciary is
 presided over by the Supreme Court, which is selected by the
 Congress. Since 1979, when elections ended seven years of
 military rule, two democratically elected administrations have
 demonstrated strong support for the principles of
 representative government and civil liberties stipulated in
 the Constitution. Over a dozen political parties and a free
 and partisan press create a lively and contentious democratic
 environment.
 The President exercises control over the police through the
 Ministry of Government. In 1985 local human rights
 organizations alleged various instances of police brutality,
 especially in the interrogation of suspected terrorists.
 Terrorist activities of the Alfaro Vive Group (allied with the
 Colombian-based 19th of April Movement, or M-19) increased in
 number and intensity during the year. A widely publicized
 kidnaping of a Guayaquil businessman in August resulted in the
 deaths of a number of terrorists, some while in police
 custody, as well as the innocent victim.
 In an essentially free enterprise economic system, Ecuador has
 had for many years a broad-based and varied labor movement.
 But Ecuadorean society is also marked by extensive rural
 poverty, especially among the indigenous Indian populations.
 Despite a worsening security situation resulting from an
 increasingly active domestic terrorist movement, very poor
 prison conditions, and a criminal justice system characterized
 by long delays in bringing individuals to trial, Ecuador was
 able to maintain generally high human rights standards in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no substantiated charges during 1985 of government
 forces killing political opponents.
 A prominent Guayaquil businessman, Nahim Isaias, kidnaped
 August 7 by Alfaro Vive and M-19 terrorists, died along with
 four of his captors during an unsuccessful rescue attempt on
 September 2. Official accounts indicate Isaias was shot by
 the kidnapers at the onset of the rescue attempt. Later, two
 leading M-19 terrorists involved in the kidnaping died in
 police custody during a routine prison transfer. The police
 reported the prisoners were shot in an abortive escape attempt.
 In another incident, police arrested a Guayaquil political
 organizer and one-time supporter of President Leon
 Febres-Cordero following a lengthy manhunt. The prisoner then
 confessed to charges that he had tortured and murdered a
 political opponent (an alternate member of Congress). The
 President denounced the murder publicly and promised
 impartiality in the prosecution of the case.
 As in past years, human rights groups periodically charged
 local government indifference to or complicity in the deaths
 of rural inhabitants allegedly killed in land disputes.

 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of government-instigated
 abduction or disappearance in 1985. There have been reports
 of brief abductions of newspaper and television reporters by
 the Alfaro Vive group, presumably in order to relay messages
 from the terrorists to the general public. A businessman
 frustrated an Alfaro Vive attempt to kidnap him on December
 19. Five persons tried to force him into a car and shot him
 in the mouth and shoulder when he put up a struggle. He
 wounded one of the abductors before getting help from others
 in driving off the attackers.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or'Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. Harsh handling by police in the
 capture and interrogation of criminal suspects does occur but
 is not condoned by the Government. In a much publicized case,
 a former high-ranking.government official accused the police
 of beating his son, a suspect in the Isaias kidnapping, during
 interrogation. The son later died from injuries received
 during his capture.
 Ecuadorean prisons are generally acknowledged to be
 overcrowded, unhealthy, and harsh. While contrary to prison
 regulations, solitary confinement and beatings are used for
 disciplinary reasons. Prisoners with money can pay prison
 officals to avoid punishment and improve their living
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Preventive detention is illegal, and the criminal code forbids
 isolated confinement for more than 24 hours and detention
 without charge for more than 48 hours. In some instances,
 however, people have been held beyond these time limits.
 Mayors and municipal council presidents are constitutionally
 empowered to grant habeas corpus. In practice, habeas corpus
 and bail are granted liberally, irrespective of the severity
 of the charges. There is no forced or compulsory labor and
 forced exile is not practiced.
 As the terrorist activities of the Alfaro Vive group increased
 during 1985, human rights activists accused the Government of
 illegal arrests and detention of suspected terrorists. There
 were a number of reports of arrests made without proper
 warrants. Opposition politicians also accused the Government
 of using the judicial system to harass members of the previous
 Government.
 The judicial system suffers from a chronic case backlog,
 frequently resulting in prison stays of up to two years for
 detainees awaiting trial. Much of the overcrowding of the
 prisons is a result of the large number of these suspects.
 However, time spent in prison awaiting trial counts toward
 completion of the final sentence for those convicted. On the
 other hand, some other long-term detainees, when eventually
 tried, are found innocent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have the right to counsel, to face their accusers,
 to refrain from testifying against themselves, and to appeal
 
 
 508
 ECUADOR
 their sentences to intermediate or higher courts. Although a
 public defender system is mandated in the Constitution, this
 provision has not yet been implemented.
 The Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the power to
 impeach judges, fix the judicial branch budget, and ratify the
 Supreme Court's judicial review decisions. Since the
 Government of President Febres-Cordero took office in August
 1984, there has been a continuing conflict between the
 Executive and the Judiciary over the use of presidential
 power. Political opponents of the President claim that he has
 undermined the Constitution through his running dispute with
 the president of the Supreme Court (who is a member of -an
 opposition party) and by his efforts to change the court's
 composition to reflect his own political philosophy.
 As in most civil law systems, there is no trial by jury, and
 judges play a central role in investigations as well as in
 deciding guilt or innocence. Legal investigations as well as
 prosecutions are carried out by the Attorney General,
 Solicitor General, and the provincial prosecutors. These
 judicial branch officials defend state interests in criminal
 and civil cases, receive complaints against judges, conduct
 fiscal inspections of lower courts, and provide often
 influential legal opinions to all court cases.
 Most judges and law enforcement officials are seriously
 underpaid and thus susceptible to corruption. In addition,
 they are hampered by an unmanageable backlog of cases, and
 lack sufficient technical expertise and budgetary resources to
 conduct thorough investigations. Another problem, according
 to some judicial branch spokesmen, is that utilization of the
 multiple levels of appeal often results in excessive reversals
 of lower court convictions.
 The autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, consisting
 of representatives of the presidency, congress, judiciary,
 municipalities, and business and labor sectors, may
 investigate charges of constitutional or human rights
 violations. However, in the midst of a fractious debate with
 the Congress over a new minimum wage bill in March the
 President, ignored a ruling from the Tribunal, which had sided
 with the opposition-controlled Congress. (The Tribunal is
 chaired by a member of the Central Committee of Ecuador's
 Communist Party, which forms part of the opposition.)
 Military courts are empowered to try only those cases
 involving acts against military installations and the
 infractions of military regulations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the sanctity of the home and privacy
 of correspondence. The law requires police to have a warrant
 before entering a home except in the case of hot pursuit, and
 generally, this legal requirement is observed in practice.
 However, in 1985 human rights activists claimed that security
 forces were involved in a number of surreptitious entries.
 These claims have not been substantiated in legal proceedings.
 
 
 509
 ECUADOR
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression.
 This right is vigorously exercised in the Ecuadorean mass
 media, which are essentially privately owned and free from
 direct government control. Twelve principal dailies, dozens
 of weeklies and magazines, ten television stations, and more
 than 450 radio stations operate in Ecuador and present to the
 general public a wide variety of political opinions.
 The political opposition, however, claims that the Government
 of.President Febres-Cordero has used indirect methods to
 pressure the media to conform politically.. One specific
 -charge is that officials directed government-paid advertising
 away from the Quito daily "Hoy,"' because this newspaper has
 beenmore openly critical of governmentpolicies than others.
 The Inter-American Press Association issued a report in March
 criticizing the Government for taking reprisals against media
 representatives opposed to it and for denying government
 advertising to them.
 In a controversial move, the Government prevented the opening
 of a new television station owned and managed in part by
 political adversaries. Authorization to operate this station
 had been issued by the outgoing-administration of former
 president Osvaldo Hurtado three days before it left office.
 The Government cited technical violations of the
 communications law. The Government's action is being
 contested through the judicial system. The Inter-American
 Broadcasting Association sent a team to Ecuador to investigate
 the matter but has not yet issued a report of its findings.
 The Ecuadorean criminal code prohibits written or oral
 statements which defame or demean public officials, government
 institutions, or national symbols. In September,
 controversial Guayaquil Mayor Abdala Bucaram fled the country
 rather than face possible imprisonment on charges of defaming
 the President, spreading false rumors about the Government's
 handling of the Isaias kidnapping, and slandering the Armed
 Forces (the latter in a newspaper interview published in New
 York).
 There is no political censorship of foreign or domestic books,
 films., or works of art.- There is no government interference
 with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to free assembly and association is established in
 theConstitution and observed in practice. Public rallies
 require prior approval from local governments, but this is
 generally granted. In March, however, the Government denied a
 parade permit to workers participating in a nationwide
 strike.
 All private sector employees and government blue collar
 workers enjoy the right to organize-unions, bargain
 collectively, and strike. Government white collar workers may
 not legally strike, and their labor organizations are not
 recognized by the Government as full-fledged unions with
 bargaining rights. Labor organizations represent perhaps 15
 percent of the country's economically active population.
 Organized into four major confederations and many independent
 unions, the labor movement reflects widely different political
 orientations.
 
 
 510
 ECUADOR
 The labor code provides for a considerable government role in
 the resolution of disputes between labor and management,
 especially through the Ministry of Labor's conciliation
 tribunals. Trade union leaders are elected by their
 membership. The Constitution provides for formal labor
 participation in government through representation on the
 executive boards of several national institutions. The labor
 leadership meets regularly with the Minister of Labor and
 other senior government officials to discuss ongoing sectoral
 problems.
 In January, workers striking to protest increases in the price
 of gasoline and public transport were arrested by police
 during a public demonstration. The International Labor
 Organization Committee on Freedom of Association, after
 receiving formal complaints from labor confederations
 representing the workers, concluded in its report on the
 January incident that workers have the right to strike in
 defense of their social and economic interests, and that
 police intervention in strike action should be limited to the
 maintenance of law and order. The Government argued that the
 nation-wide strike was illegal under Ecuador's labor code
 because it was not called in connection with a collective
 bargaining dispute.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion and all are free to practice the religion of their
 choice. Clergymen, by local law, may not become high-level
 elected or appointed government officials.
 Foreign missionaries of many faiths have operated freely in
 Ecuador for many years. Radio HCJB, the Voice of the Andes, a
 U.S.-based evangelical broadcasting company in Ecuador, is a
 world-wide, multilingual shortwave radio service which also
 broadcasts domestically on FM and AM.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Ecuadoreans may travel freely at home or abroad. There is no
 discriminatory treatment of women or other groups with regard
 to travel, emigration, or repatriation. Individuals from
 other Latin American countries have readily found asylum in
 Ecuador. No cases of involuntary repatriation of persons
 fleeing political persecution were reported in 1985.
 In March the Government issued a decree simplifying the
 bureaucratic procedures for, among other things, certifying
 citizenship of Ecuadoreans born or living abroad. The result
 has been to ease difficulties encountered by Ecuadorean
 citizens traveling to and from Ecuador.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ecuador is a multiparty democracy with 17 registered parties
 representing the full political spectrum. Thirteen of these
 parties, including two Marxist parties, have representatives
 in the unicameral national congress. Ecuadoreans 18 years of
 age and over have the right to vote. Voting is mandatory for
 literates and voluntary for illiterates. Political
 participation and suffrage are open to all citizens without
 
 
 511
 ECUADOR
 discrimination as to sex, ethnic group, or socioeconomic
 status. All citizens have the right to form and join
 political parties. Groups not fulfilling party certification
 requirements, which include obtaining a minimum number of
 signatures of previously unaffiliated voters, are not entitled
 to field candidates.
 Since the return to democracy in 1979 after seven years of
 military dictatorship, Ecuadorean politics is characterized by
 strident partisanship and shifting alliances among diverse
 political groups. Strong political rivalries among
 individuals and ideological and regional differences account
 for much of the rough and tumble nature of the political
 arena. In public and in private, the current President has
 reiterated his support of democratic principles. His
 inauguration in August 1984, was the first peaceful transfer
 of power in Ecuador from one democratically elected government
 to another in 24 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an open and constructive approach' to
 international human rights issues. An Ecuadorean is a member
 of the Human Rights Committee of the U.N. Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights and the U.N. Committee on the Elimination
 of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. In February Ecuador
 became a signatory to the U.N. Convention Against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment and
 Punishments. On this occasion, Ecuador publicly reaffirmed
 its "firm defense of the observance of human rights" and its
 support for previous U.N. resolutions on this subject.
 No well-founded allegations of human rights abuses were lodged
 against the Ecuadorean Government by international or domestic
 human rights groups in 1985. Domestic human rights bodies are
 free to investigate human rights practices within the
 country. Representatives of the International Labor
 Organization's regional office in Lima travel regularly to
 Ecuador in order to consult with government officials on labor
 policies and programs.
 The regional Latin American Human Rights Association (ALDHU)
 is headquartered in Quito. There is also a local office of
 Amnesty International. Locally active human rights
 organizations include the Catholic Church-sponsored Ecumenical
 Commission on Human Rights (CEDHU) and the National Human
 Rights Commission. During 1985 individual human rights
 activists occasionally met with Ministry of Government
 officials to discuss human rights concerns. A human rights
 office has been established in the Foreign Ministry. In
 consultation with the Ministry of Government is responsible
 for providing detailed, responsive replies, to queries from
 outside Ecuador concerning human rights matters. Amnesty
 International Report 1985 does not comment on Ecuador.
 Freedom House rates Ecuador "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ecuador's population of 9.3 million is divided nearly equally
 between urban and rural residents. After a 3.4 percent yearly
 growth rate during the 1962-74 period, the country's
 population is now increasing annually by about 2.8 percent.
 
 
 512
 ECUADOR
 The World Bank calculated Ecuador's per capita gross national
 product in 1983 at $1430. The economy is mixed, with the
 private sector contributing 60 percent of the nation's
 production. Key activities, such as petroleum,
 telecommunications, and much of the aviation and energy
 industries, are under Government control.
 The economy has been recovering slowly from a regressive
 period that existed from 1978-1983. In 1983 world recession
 and the destructive effects of the "El Nino" weather
 phenomenon contributed to a 3.1 percent negative growth rate
 and to an inflation rate of 52 percent in 1983. The year 1984
 saw economic growth rebounding to about 4.1 percent, and
 inflation reduced to 25.1 percent. Although Ecuador lacks
 precise unemployment statistics, official and semi-official
 sources have calculated that open urban unemployment was 12 to
 15 percent in 1983, and was probably reduced to the 8 to 11
 percent range in 1984. Unemployment and underemployment
 remain persistent problems, with an estimated 50 percent of
 the work force employed only part-time or temporarily.
 Considerable strides have been made during the past decade in
 the areas of health and education, especially under the
 1979-84 national development plan. The World Bank calculates
 that in 1985 the average life expectancy at birth was 63.7
 years and infant mortality rate was 63.1 per 1000. The
 caloric supply in 1977 was reported to be 90.61 percent of
 nutritional requirements. Nonetheless, the Ecuadorean Center
 for Population Studies and Responsible Parenthood estimates
 that 40 percent of preschool children and about 90 percent of
 the rural population suffer from malnutrition. Health care is
 improving owing to expanded delivery systems and an increased
 number of doctors. However, many facilities continue to lack
 adequate numbers of trained personnel and modern equipment.
 According to the World Bank, 45 percent of the population in
 1980 (82 percent in the cities and 16 percent in the
 countryside) had access to potable water. The Febres-Cordero
 administration has focused particular attention on fulfillment
 of the President's electoral campaign promise to provide more
 "bread, housing and employment." Housing represents an area
 of immediate concern. Although the average household size has
 dropped from 5.0 to 4.1 from 1974 to the present, the overall
 housing deficit is estimated at approximately one million
 units.
 World Bank statistics for 1974 indicated an adult literacy
 rate of 74.2 percent, of which the urban rate was 90.3 percent
 and the rural rate was 61.8 percent. Male literacy was 78.2
 percent while female literacy was 70.4 percent. According to
 statistics provided by the National Statistics and Census
 Institute (INEC), the literacy rate was raised in 1983 to 85.5
 percent (92.2 percent in urban areas and 78.5 percent in rural
 areas). An estimated 30 percent of school-age children in
 rural areas do not attend school. The low quality of public
 education at all levels has caused serious concern on the part
 of government officials and private industry.
 According to Ecuador's labor code, employment of minors under
 the age of 18 requires parental permission. This regulation
 is generally observed in larger enterprises. However, a large
 percentage of rural children are part of the active work
 force. The standard work week is 40 hours with generous paid
 annual vacations prescribed by law. Ecuador enforces a
 minimum wage law.
 
 
 513
 ECUADOR
 Safe and healthy working conditions are mandated by law and
 employers are responsible for maintaining such conditions.
 The autonomous Social Security Institute monitors complaints
 in this area and has legal power to enforce compliance.
 The Ecuadorean Constitution establishes complete legal
 equality for men and women. However, owing to the female's
 traditional role in Latin American societies, there are few
 highly placed women in the political structure. Fewer than 15
 percent of the candidates for elective office in 1984 were
 female. Three of the 71 congressional deputies elected in
 1984 were women; no woman served in the previous congress
 except as an-alternate. Several deputies are also of Indian
 or mixed ethnic origin. Several women, including a provincial
 governor and two vice ministers, serve in prominent positions
 in the present Government. By'contrast, women still suffer
 some discrimination under civil law, despite considerable
 progress in recent years. In divorce matters and in the right
 of inheritance, the male continues to enjoy preferential
 status as head of the household.
 The indigenous Indian population is primarily rural and poor,
 although there is no overt or legally sanctioned
 discrimination practiced against them.
