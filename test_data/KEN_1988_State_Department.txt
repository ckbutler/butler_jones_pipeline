 KENYA
 Although Kenya has had an elected civilian government since
 independence in 1963, it has been a de facto one-party state
 almost since independence and a de jure one-party state since
 1982. President Daniel T. arap Moi maintains firm control
 over both the Government and the party, the Kenyan African
 National Union (KANU). KANU membership is a prerequisite for
 participation in national political affairs. The popularly
 elected National Assembly of 202 members (including-12
 appointed by the President and 2 ex officio members) has
 little genuine power in national political affairs. Its role
 is generally limited to local and regional issues and in
 affirming the President's initiatives. President Moi was
 reelected unopposed to a third 5-year term in 1988.
 The Kenyan armed forces constitute a small professional
 establishment with a total strength of 22,500 members. Kenya
 has an internal security apparatus that includes the police
 Criminal Investigation Division (CID), the paramilitary
 General Services Unit (GSU), and the Directorate of Security
 and Intelligence (DSI or Special Branch). The CID and Special
 Branch are used to monitor and control people whom the State
 considers subversive. The Preservation of Public Security Act
 sanctions indefinite detention without charge or trial in
 security cases, and the courts have upheld the
 constitutionality of properly executed actions taken under the
 authority of that Act.
 Kenya's modern, market-oriented economy includes a
 well-developed private sector for trade and light
 manufacturing as well as an agricultural sector that provides
 food for local consumption and substantial exports of coffee,
 tea, and other commodities. In 1988 a continued decline in
 world coffee prices exacerbated a balance of payments
 problem. Economic growth continued, but a persistently high
 population growth rate contributed to a serious and growing
 problem of unemployment. Kenyans are free to engage in
 private economic activity and own property without government
 interference.
 In 1988 there were several important developments adversely
 affecting the human rights situation. In the spring,
 two-stage parliamentary elections took place amid much
 controversy over the public queuing system (voters must
 publicly line up behind photographs of their candidate) used
 in the key primary (party) election and charges of fraud in
 some races. The electoral outcome further strengthened
 executive branch and central party control over the
 legislature. In August the new National Assembly unanimously
 and speedily passed two presidentially supported
 constitutional amendments which further increased the
 President's power by giving him authority to fire senior
 judges and members of the Public Service Commission and
 expanded police authority to detain without charge suspects in
 capital crimes up to 14 days (previously 24 hours). The
 President and his advisers staunchly defended these changes as
 necessary to maintain a "rule of law." Critics charged that
 they seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary
 and invited increased police mistreatment of detainees.  In a
 more positive vein, by contrast with 1986-1987 when more than
 70 persons suspected of belonging to the illegal dissident
 group, Mwakenya, were convicted and sentenced amid reports of
 police abuse, there were 9 publicly confirmed security
 convictions in 1988. As of December 1988, 7 Kenyans were
 
 
 156
 KENYA
 being detained without charge under the Preservation of Public
 Security Act, as compared with 12 Kenyans in detention in
 December 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Violence among supporters of rival candidates in several areas
 of Kenya during the 1988 election campaigns resulted in
 approximately 5 deaths nationwide.
 By the end of 1988, no officials had been held responsible for
 the 1986-1987 deaths in custody of two Mwakenya suspects. In
 a January ruling, a magistrate stated he believed Peter
 Karanja had been tortured and referred the matter to the
 Attorney General's office for further investigation. A
 similar case involving the death of Stephen Wanjema in 1986
 had not been heard by the end of 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 Kenyan authorities frequently detain people, in some cases for
 prolonged periods, without allowing notification of families,
 friends, or lawyers as to their whereabouts and have even
 failed to acknowledge the detention when inquiries were made.
 For example, when Raila Odinga, a former detainee, was
 rearrested on August 30, his family inquired at Nairobi police
 stations as to his whereabouts but were given no information.
 On September 8, in response to a habeas corpus petition filed
 by Odinga's wife, authorities announced that he had been
 detained under the Preservation of Public Security Act, but
 they did not bring him to the habeas corpus hearing or inform
 his family where he was being held. As of the end of the
 year, neither his family nor his lawyer had been allowed to
 see him.
 The 1987 habeas corpus case brought by the wife of a missing
 Kiambu farmer was dismissed in 1988. Police claimed thay had
 shot the man, a robbery suspect, while he was trying to
 escape, but they never produced the body for examination.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is proscribed under the Constitution, reports
 of torture and police brutality continued in 1988.
 Mistreatment of suspects is common and occasionally results in
 death. A number of Kenyans told the press they had been
 physically abused by the police, and in several 1988 cases,
 citizens presented evidence in court to that effect. Maina wa
 Kinyatti, a historian and university lecturer who completed a
 6-year term for possession of seditious documents in October,
 held a press conference upon his release. Speaking with
 difficulty, a condition he attributed to more than I year in
 solitary confinement, he denied that he had ever been
 associated with Mwakenya, and described his mistreatment,
 including beatings, inadequate diet and medical care,
 confinement with prisoners who were insane, and being forced
 to perform exhausting and degrading exercises. In November
 Harris 0. Arara testified in court that during his
 interrogation at CID headquarters he was starved for 5 days
 
 
 157
 KENYA
 and threatened with harsher treatment if he did not plead
 guilty to possession of seditious documents.
 Although some police officers have been charged in connection
 with abuse of prisoners, no policeman has been convicted of
 such abuse in political/security cases. Apparently, no
 policemen were convicted of abuse in other types of cases
 during 1988. In Mombasa, two robbery suspects--a Kenyan and a
 Zairian-- died while in police custody. Five policp officers
 were arrested in connection with the case, and two of these
 officers mysteriously died in the custody of their
 colleagues. A Mombasa magistrate ruled that "no particular
 police officer" was responsible for the death of the Kenyan
 suspect, but police officers were charged with the death of
 the Zairian suspect, and their trial was under way at the end
 of the year. In July two policemen in Kisumu were charged
 with murder, and in August two policemen in Eldoret were
 ordered to stand trial for allegedly murdering a farmer during
 interrogation. A closed hearing was held in January into
 allegations of torture of Wanyiri Kihoro, one of three
 detainees who remained in detention throughout 1988. Family
 members and the press were denied entry into the hearing. The
 court ruled that Kihoro had not been ill-treated. Two other
 cases involving similar allegations had not been heard by the
 end of the year. President Moi appointed a new police
 commissioner early in 1988 and charged him with cleaning up
 the police force, stating that police officers who committed
 illegal acts would be punished.
 Prison conditions in Kenya are poor. Detainees and prisoners
 have complained of beatings, poor food, and inadequate
 facilities and medical care. Prisoners often must sleep on
 cold cement floors. The Preservation of Public Security Act
 allows for solitary confinement, with no contact with family
 or legal counsel, although in some cases lawyers and families
 have been permitted to visit detainees. Other prisoners (not
 detainees under the Preservation of Public Security Act) are
 allowed one brief visit per month by family members. Prison
 or security officers are usually present during visits by
 family members or lawyers. Correspondence with prisoners is
 monitored and occasionally not delivered.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that most arrested or detained
 persons shall be brought before a court *as soon as is
 reasonably practicable," and that if such person is not
 brought within 24 hours of his arrest or from the commencement
 of his detention the burden of explanation is on the
 authorities. The Constitution was amended in August to allow
 the police to hold people suspected of capital offenses for 14
 days before being brought before a court. The Attorney
 General argued that this additional detention time was
 required to complete investigations, but many legal experts in
 Kenya and abroad denounced this change as an invitation to
 police mistreatment. Capital offenses include such crimes as
 murder and treason. In practice, suspects of all types are
 often held incommunicado for long periods before being brought
 before a court. In all nine of the security case convictions
 in 1988, the suspects were held incommunicado, some for up to
 28 days before being brought to court.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act allows the State to
 detain an individual indefi-nitely without charges or trial. A
 formal detention order must be signed and published in the
 
 
 158
 KENYA
 gazette. There is no judicial review of the legality of
 detention. Detention cases are reviewed by a board appointed
 by the President which meets in camera. The Government is not
 bound by this board's recommendations.
 In February the President released 9 of 12 detainees held
 under the Preservation of Public Security Act, including Raila
 Odinga, who had been jailed in 1982 and was the longest-
 serving of the 9, and Israel Otiena Agina. The three who
 remained in detention--lawyers Mirugi Kariuki and Wanyiri
 Kihoro and university lecturer Mukaru Ng'ang'a, held since
 December, October, and July 1986 respectively--had earlier
 challenged the legality of their detention, hired legal
 counsel, and complained of torture and abuse. Subsequently,
 in August. and September, the Government again detained Raila
 Odinga and Israel Otieno Agina on security grounds. In
 September Samuel Okumu Okwany and Richard Obuon Guya, two
 alleged members of the Kenya Patriotic Front (KPF), were
 detained under the Preservation of Public Security Act. As of
 December 1988, these 7 Kenyans remained in detention under the
 Act.
 Neither exile nor threat of exile is used by the Government as
 a means of intimidation or punishment. Self-exile is a course
 of action sometimes chosen by Kenyan dissidents. In some
 cases, the Government states that these exiles are wanted for
 questioning for possible criminal charges in Kenya, although
 in most cases the exiles have not been formally charged with
 crimes. The Government has invited some of the exiles to
 return and publicly announced they would be safe in Kenya.
 One such exile returned in December 1987.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kenya's legal system, as defined in the Judicature Act of
 1967, is based on the Kenyan Constitution, laws passed by
 Parliament, and common law or-court precedent. Customary law
 is used as a guide in civil matters affecting people of the
 same ethnic groups so long as it does not conflict with
 statutory law. Kenya does not have the jury system. The
 court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and
 two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal and
 civil cases originate. Civilians are tried in civilian
 courts, and verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan High Court
 and ultimately to the Court of Appeals. Military personnel
 are tried by military courts, and verdicts may be appealed
 within the military system. Attorneys for military personnel
 are appointed on a case by case basis by the Chief Justice.
 The President appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court,
 and he appoints other High Court judges with the advice of the
 Judicial Service Commission. The President also appoints the
 Attorney General. His power over the judicial system has
 steadily increased through constitutional amendments adopted
 in 1986 and 1988. Inter alia, these changes give the
 President a free hand in firing the Attorney General, the
 Auditor General, and High Court judges. Critics charged that
 these amendments further undermined the independence of the
 judiciary and the "rule of law." One High Court judge has
 already been removed since enactment of the new provision.
 In cases involving the Preservation of Public Security Act,
 judicial authority is limited to ensuring compliance with
 
 
 159
 KENYA
 procedural provisions. In cases without political
 implications the right to a fair public trial is normally
 observed, although long delays and postponements are common.
 The constitutional right to a fair public trial has been
 circumscribed in some instances, notably in political/security
 cases such as those involving alleged Mwakenya or KPF
 members. In 1987 at least 39 persons allegedly belonging to
 Mwakenya were brought to court and convicted. In 1988 there
 were nine convictions involving charges of membership in
 subversive organizations. In the first public prosecution in
 1988 involving charges of membership in a subversive
 organization, Andrew K. Muigai was convicted in 20 minutes
 based on his confession and sentenced to 6 years'
 imprisonment. He was held for 21 days before being charged,
 was allowed no visitors before being brought to court, and had
 no legal counsel.
 In September four persons were sentenced to 7 years'
 imprisonment for sedition in connection with membership in the
 KPF, an organization allegedly founded by self-exile Koigi wa
 Wamwere. All pleaded guilty to KPF membership and all were
 held over 2 weeks before being brought to trial, apparently
 without legal representation. In October one person was
 jailed for 5 years for possession of seditious documents and
 membership in Mwakenya. In the same month, former Member of
 Parliament Kimani wa Nyoike was sentenced to 20 months on a
 misdemeanor charge of failing to report an alleged coup plot
 to the Kenyan authorities. Harris 0. Arara (see Section l.c.
 above) was convicted in early November and sentenced to 2
 concurrent 5-year sentences for possession of seditious
 documents. Jackson Maina was also sentenced in November to 2
 years' imprisonment for taking an unlawful oath and being a
 member of Mwakenya. All but one of these cases followed a
 pattern that has raised serious questions about the fairness
 of most security trials: a long period of incommunicado
 detention, followed by a short unannounced trial in which the
 defendant, without legal representation, pleads guilty (thus
 precluding any appeal of the conviction, even if the guilty
 plea were coerced). Only the sentence may be appealed. Human
 rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human
 Rights Watch Committees, have criticized these trials as
 unfair. They have pointed to the fact that the defendants did
 not have advance notice of the trials and did not have legal
 representation. The large number of "confessions" in these
 trials is also cited as suspicious.
 Members of the press usually attended and reported on
 courtroom proceedings. Some trials involving-allegations of
 torture, however, were not public. In one instance, two
 American human right's observers were forced to leave a public
 inquest into the death in custody of Peter Karanja (see
 Section l.a.). The men were held and-questioned for 8 hours
 before release.
 Kenyans do not have a right to legal counsel except in certain
 capital cases. In those cases, most persons tried for capital
 offenses are provided counsel free of charge if they cannot
 afford it. Recent instances in which the Government detained
 lawyers involved in sensitive cases and attacked the Law
 Society of Kenya, which criticized the constitutional
 amendments, could discourage vigorous legal representation in
 security cases. When the Chairman of the Law Society of Kenya
 asked the Attorney General to clarify press reports that a
 Kenyan had been convicted for failure to give a ride to a
 
 
 160
 KENYA
 local official (which is not a crime under Kenya's Penal
 Code), the President suggested publicly that the Attorney
 General should seek the arrest of the Chairman for "contempt
 of court." The conviction for failure to give a ride was
 later dismissed on appeal. An announcement by the Government
 in 1988 of its intention to require lawyers and other
 professionals to have licenses has raised fears that the
 system could be used to intimidate the legal community, as has
 the announcement that the Government would establish a
 commission to probe into the conduct of lawyers. Human rights
 groups have charged that Government intimidiation may also
 have discouraged family members of detainees from pursuing
 habeas corpus actions.
 The harassment of Kenyan attorney Gibson Kamau Kuria, who
 served as legal counsel for several Mwakenya suspects,
 continued to attract wide international attention in 1988. He
 had been detained without charge in 1987, shortly after filing
 notices to sue the Government for illegal detention and
 torture on behalf of several clients, and was held for 9
 months under the Preservation of Public Security Act.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches without warrants are allowed under the Constitution
 in certain instances "to promote the public benefit,"
 including security cases. Security officials also conduct
 searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or
 to seize property suspected to be stolen. Homes of suspected
 dissidents have been searched without warrants, as have the
 residences of foreign missionaries. Security forces
 reportedly employ a variety of surveillance techniques,
 including electronic surveillance and a network of informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, the exercise of these rights is restricted. No
 criticism of the President is tolerated in any form. Human
 rights groups have criticized Kenya's sedition laws for
 failing to distinguish between violent and nonviolent
 opposition to the Government. They have charged that security
 detentions and prosecutions have sometimes been used to
 restrict the expression of peaceful dissenting views.
 Parliament rarely debates national issues such as foreign
 policy. Even when the Government introduced important
 constitutional amendments in Parliament in mid-1988, there was
 no parliamentary debate, and the amendments were adopted
 without any opposing votes after less than 2 hours of
 discussion.
 Government and KANU action against outspoken politicians,
 clergymen, and lawyers, as well as the detention provisions of
 the Preservation of Public Security Act, discourage public
 exchange of views on some political topics. Some churchmen
 who opposed government policies, including queuing and the
 recent constitutional amendments, were sharply criticized and
 subjected to investigations. In this connection, the magazine
 Beyond, published by the National Council of Churches of Kenya
 (NCCK), was banned in 1988 after publishing an issue that was
 critical of queue voting and the overall conduct of the KANU
 
 
 161
 KENYA
 nomination elections. The editor of the magazine, Bedan
 Mbugua, was convicted of improper financial management of the
 publication and given an unusual 9 month custodial sentence in
 August. As of December 1988 Mbugua was free on bail pending
 his appeal. The authorities also arrested several persons for
 possessing copies of Beyond, and two were given 2-year
 sentences. Other persons were convicted of possession of
 literature defined as seditious, including possession of a
 Mwakenya publication.
 Privately owned newspapers and journals contribute importantly
 to the lively tradition of the press in Kenya. There is no
 systematic official censorship of the press, but officials of
 the newly created Ministry of National Guidance and Political
 Affairs (whose duties include censorship) have attacked
 publications they find objectionable. In March the Ministry
 condemned the Financial Review for an article criticizing the
 replacement of the Vice President and suggested the magazine
 might be banned. In December the editor of the Financial
 Review was held at CID headquarters for several hours of
 questioning regarding articles which had appeared in his
 magazine. Journalists practice self-censorship and keep
 commentary within usually understood but legally undefined
 limits. The press criticizes government policies and
 occasionally government officials, but it never criticizes the
 President. The Kenyan media gave good coverage of the 1988
 elections, including the controversial queue voting issue.
 At times the Government intervenes to tell editors how to
 handle sensitive stories. In separate instances during 1988,
 a cabinet minister ordered reporters to read back their notes
 for his approval, and a district officer in Kakamega warned
 journalists they would be arrested and beaten for publishing
 any stories about his district without his permission. (The
 latter was rebuked by higher officials.)
 Newspapers, magazines, and books from abroad are readily
 available, although in 1988 several issues of international
 publications which contained articles critical of Kenya were
 not allowed normal distribution Within Kenya. More than 100
 foreign journalists representing western news organizations
 are based in Kenya. In 1988 the Government continued its
 attacks on this group for its coverage of Kenyan issues, e.g.,
 the queue voting. It warned the public about speaking to
 foreign reporters. In one incident foreign journalists were
 briefly detained in Kisumu for attempting to film a burial
 service. In August a Kenya-based stringer for the British
 Broadcasting Corporation had her work permit canceled on
 leaving Kenya, but was later permitted to return to Kenya.
 The Kenyan authorities also require certification of union
 membership for foreign press accreditation in Kenya. In at
 least one instance in 1988, the lack of such union membership
 led to the denial of press credentials for an Associated Press
 reporter.
 The single television and all radio stations are owned and
 controlled by the Government and reflect government policies
 in coverage of national and international events and issues.
 A 10-member television censorship board has established
 guidelines for what can be shown. A 10- to 12-member film
 censorship board under the Ministry of National Guidance and
 Political Affairs must approve all films shown in Kenya. A
 variety of foreign films is available, though in August the
 Government banned nearly 200 foreign films (most, if not all,
 
 
 162
 KENYA
 X-rated) on "protection of public morals" grounds. The films
 were not political.
 There are no formal limits to academic freedom. While
 numerous books critical of the Government, such as the works
 by dissident self-exile Ngugi wa Thiongo, are available in
 Kenya, some writings on recent Kenyan history and politics
 have been considered sensitive, and the academic climate does
 not encourage writing on these topics. Eighteen publications
 that were prohibited in 1986 remain blacklisted. University
 professors were among those detained on security grounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly, but it is
 limited by the Public Order and Police Act, which gives
 authorities power to control public gatherings, defined as
 meetings of three or more persons. It is illegal to convene
 an unlicensed meeting, and politicians have been arrested for
 violations of this Act. Although licenses to hold public
 meetings are rarely denied, in the preliminaries to the 1988
 elections some politicians complained that they were not able
 to obtain a license, while government-favored candidates held
 rallies without licenses.
 Freedom of association is generally allowed. With the
 important exception of civil servants, who are required to
 join KANU, Kenyans are not legally bound to join any political
 organization. Party membership, however, has become a form of
 loyalty test, even though the party and the Government
 emphasize that it is voluntary.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship is
 acknowledged in the Constitution and allowed in most cases.
 Foreign missionaries of many denominations are permitted to
 work in Kenya, although on occasion the President and other
 officials have publicly questioned the motives of certain
 missionaries and periodically warned foreign missionaries not
 to engage in politics.  Several American missionaries,
 including the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
 day Saints, were questioned about their activities and
 cautioned that they could be jailed or expelled for holding
 illegal meetings. Although no foreign missionary was known to
 have been deported in 1988, some who had been targets of
 government criticism had to leave when their work permits were
 not renewed.
 Churches new to Kenya must obtain government approval to be
 registered. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
 is one group which has tried without success for 7 years to
 obtain registration. In 1987 another group, the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, were deregistered but continued in 1988 to hold
 services under a stay order from the high court. In March 73
 Jehovah's Witnesses were picked up for holding an "unlawful
 assembly," detained briefly, and released. In 1988 the
 Associated Christian Churches of Kenya, an American-based
 missionary organization, was also deregistered.
 There is no religious requirement for'voting or holding office.
 
 
 163
 KENYA
 Clergymen in Kenya have spoken out on political as well as
 religious issues from their pulpits. In 1988 senior officials
 sharply criticized certain clergymen, including Anglican
 bishops Alexander Muge and Henry Okullu, for making political
 statements. Twice in July, after charging that the
 administration had shown political favoritism in distributing
 relief supplies in West Pokot, worshipers were reportedly
 prevented from attending services where Muge was to preach.
 As noted, government officials also criticized the National
 Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), which comprises most of
 the Protestant denominations, and banned the monthly NCCK
 magazine Beyond after it ran an edition on election
 irregularities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, Kenyans can travel freely within the country,
 restricted only by provisions of the Preservation of Public
 Security Act, which limit the movement of persons considered
 dangerous to the public security. These provisions are rarely
 invoked. In one instance in July, Bishop Muge was reportedly
 prevented by local police from traveling to preach at a church.
 Kenya does not prohibit emigration of its citizens, but on
 occasion does prevent citizens from traveling abroad. The
 Government sometimes refuses to return passports or issue new
 passports to people previously detained under the Preservation
 of Public Security Act. The Government does not regard the
 issuance of passports to citizens as a constitutional right
 and reserves the right to issue or deny passports at its
 discretion. In 1988 lawyer and former detainee Gibson Kamau
 Kuria was unable to get his passport back to visit the United
 States to receive a humanitarian award. The American Bar
 Association, the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Human
 Rights Watch, and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial had invited
 him to the United States to honor him for his legal
 representation of victims of human rights abuse. Kuria's wife
 and children also were unable to obtain passports to travel to
 the United States. One of Kuria's colleagues had his passport
 taken when he returned to Kenya after accepting the Robert F.
 Kennedy Memorial award on Kuria's behalf. Also in 1988,
 Nairobi businessman John Harun Mwau:lost his court battle to
 regain his passport which was withdrawn in 1983. Charles
 Njonjo, a former-Minister for Constitutional Affairs who lost
 his position and his passport in 1983, had his passport
 restored in 1988, and he traveled to the United Kingdom.
 During 1988 there was no known instance in which citizenship
 was revoked for political reasons.
 Kenya continues to accept refugees, despite its own high
 population growth rate and severe unemployment problems. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that
 in 1988 Kenya provided refuge to approximately 12,000
 refugees, with more than 5,500 coming from Uganda. There are
 perhaps another 5,000 displaced persons not officially
 registered as refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Kenyan Constitution prohibits formation of any political
 party other than KANU, and President Moi and a small group of
 advisers control all major policy decisions within the
 
 
 164
 KENYA
 Government and the party. Citizens cannot, therefore, change
 the system of government or replace the party in power through
 the electoral process. Since 1964, when Kenya adopted a
 presidential system, the party's candidate for president has
 been unopposed. Moi was reelected in 1988 to a third 5-year
 term. Numerous candidates compete for party and parliamentary
 elections--also held every 5 years--but all candidates must be
 KANU members, and the national party headquarters must clear
 all candidates for political office.
 In the 1988 national elections, 17 candidates failed to win
 KANU approval to stand for elections. Several others were
 informed that they could not run because they participated in
 a commission to redraw electoral boundaries. Some candidates
 claimed that they were physically prevented from filing their
 papers. Few of the parliamentarians who had questioned
 executive policy were returned to the Assembly. Ministers and
 other deputies who are expelled from KANU automatically
 relinquish their seats in Parliament. In July two members of
 Parliament from the West Pokot district who expressed support
 for Bishop Muge's criticisms of local administrators were
 expelled from KANU for engaging in activities which "disturbed
 peace and security." A government official who resigned his
 portfolio in December (to protest a KANU sub-branch election
 which he claimed was rigged) subsequently was expelled from
 the party and thus from his seat in Parliament.
 For the 1988 elections, the party adopted a queuing system for
 electing KANU nominees, requiring voters to line up in public
 behind photographs of the candidates. Only those who had KANU
 membership cards were allowed to participate in the nomination
 process. Candidates who received 70 percent of the KANU vote
 were automatically elected without having to contest the
 general election. Over 60 candidates (out of a total of 188)
 were elected this way. KcANU party members compriqe at most
 two-thirds of the registered voter population. There was a
 low turnout in some areas.
 The public nature of the queuing process caused some concern
 about voter intimidation, but others argued that secret
 ballots were also subject to abuse. Numerous claims of
 irregularities were made during the party primary. These
 included charges that vote counts were altered by the
 administrative authorities carrying out the elections and that
 supporters of some candidates were intimidated by beatings,
 kidnapings, and police detentions. In response to an appeal
 against the queuing process, a High Court judge ruled that the
 Court could not hear cases involving alleged fraud in the KANU
 elections as this would amount to interference with the
 internal affairs of KANU. Other appeals were directed to KANU
 President Moi, who allowed one queuing vote to be repeated.
 Allegations of irregularities in the general election (by
 secret ballot) included unannounced early poll closings,
 misplaced ballot boxes, and failure to allow observation of
 ballot box closings. General election results may be appealed
 to the courts, and 25 losers formally did so. Such appeals
 are expensive, a fact which may have deterred some other
 losers. As of December 1988, none of the election appeals had
 been heard.
 Members of all ethnic groups may run for office, and ethnic
 representation at the minister and assistant minister level is
 broad. Twelve of Kenya's ethnic groups are represented in the
 Cabinet. Seventeen ethnic groups, including one Caucasian,

 are represented at the assistant minister level. There is one
 female assistant minister, and two women hold seats in the
 National Assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government rejects criticism of its human rights record
 and discourages Kenyans from providing outside human rights
 groups with information. In 1988 President Moi repeatedly
 attacked Amnesty International and other groups for meddling
 in Kenya's internal affairs. The President has accused
 certain groups, including lawyers, of being "agents of enemies
 of the country, such as Amnesty International."
 In January 1988 the authorities took action against two
 American citizens who had come to Kenya to observe an inquest
 into the death of a Mwakenya suspect (see section l.e.
 above). The two were ordered to leave the courtroom and were
 taken into police custody where they were held and questioned
 for 8 hours. One of these was a representative of the
 Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights. Neither was allowed to
 call the U.S. Embassy. The were told by security officers
 that Kenya did not recognize the right of foreigners arrested
 in Kenya to contact their embassies. (Kenya is a signatory to
 the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.)
 Several Kenyan organizations, such as the Law Society of
 Kenya, address issues related to human rights, but none
 focuses exclusively on human rights concerns. Kenya has not
 ratified the Organization of African Unity's Human and
 Peoples' Rights Charter, adopted in 1981 in Nairobi.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is a diverse country that does not practice legal
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language
 or social status.   Several intertribal clashes occurred in
 northern Kenya as in previous years. Women may own property
 and businesses but remain underrepresented in educational
 institutions, government, and business, despite the emergence
 of influential women in all these areas. Statistics on
 enrollment in Kenyan universities for the 1987/88 school year
 showed that female students represented 28 percent of the
 total enrollment. Traditional culture, rather than government
 policy, has long prescribed limited roles for women.
 Women are a crucial element in the Kenyan labor force,
 especially in agriculture where they account for 75 percent of
 the total. Women are likely to retain this dominant role in
 agriculture for the near future, as there is a continuing
 migration of men to the cities in search of higher paying
 jobs. Women make up approximately 21 percent of the wage
 labor work force. They hold some 10 percent of the jobs in
 the traditionally male-dominated manufacturing sector, and 22
 percent of the jobs in the finance and insurance sectors.
 Thirty percent of Kenya's education workers are women. In the
 modern sector, women frequently earn less than men for
 comparable work. There are women's groups in Kenya which
 attempt to educate and help women attain their full rights.
 Polygamy is not legal for people married under the Christian
 Marriage Act, but it is permitted for those who marry under
 
 
 166
 KENYA
 African customary law. Kenya's Law of Succession, which
 governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of
 male and female children (in contrast to much customary law
 which favors the eldest male child). Some Kenyan ethnic
 groups still practice female circumcision, although the
 Government has mounted a campaign against the practice and
 prohibits such operations in government hospitals.
 The Asian community, numbering about 65,000, accounts for a
 disproportionate share of the nation's economic wealth and
 output. The Government's policy of Africanization of the
 economy has resulted in some Asian emigration. Kenya amended
 its citizenship law in 1984, depriving some Asians and
 Europeans of citizenship.' Under present law, persons born in
 Kenya of .non-Kenyan parents can no longer claim citizenship.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Kenya, with one significant exception, enjoy the
 right of association as defined by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). The Government, however, has a decisive
 role on some important labor issues. The one group which
 cannot organize is civil servants, whose union was disbanded
 by the authorities in the early 1980's. Since 1985 all
 civilservants have moreover been required to be members of the
 ruling KANU party. Other workers, according to law, can
 establish and join organizations of their choosing, make their
 own rules, elect their own leaders, join with other unions,
 and affiliate with international organizations. Union
 registration is controlled by a registrar in the Attorney
 General's office. In 1987, at the suggestion of a committee
 made up of representatives of the Ministry of Labor, the
 Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU), and the
 Federation of Kenyan Employers (FKE), several unions were
 proposed for deregistration. In June 1988, the Government
 deregistered the Kenya Timber and Furniture Workers' Union.
 The stated purpose of these amalgamations was to eliminate
 unions which were too small to be financially viable and to
 avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.
 COTU, which is Kenya's legally mandated trade union
 federation, is affiliated with the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and maintains relations, though not
 affiliation, with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU). It sends observers to ICFTU and World
 Federation of Trade Unions meetings. Both COTU and the FKE
 participate in the ILO.
 There are approximately 1.3 million wage earners in Kenya, out
 of an estimated 8-million-person work force. COTU has about
 360,000 members and another 100,000 workers belong to the
 Kenya National Union of Teachers which is not'part of COTU.
 COTU is strong in such areas as the docks, railroads, banking,
 and telecommunications, but weak in agriculture, by far
 Kenya's largest employment sector.
 Though unions enjoy relative autonomy from the Government and
 the ruling party, there are limits. In July-August, when the
 head of the dockworkers, union was involved in an apparent
 conflict of interest between his union job and his private
 business interests, the Government and party called for his
 resignation. He resigned and was replaced in new union

 elections. In September President Moi suggested that KANU
 study ways of affiliating COTU with the party.
 Kenyan unions have the right to strike, but the nation's
 industrial relations machinery makes it almost impossible to
 do so legally. Unions are required to give notice of intent,
 register their grievances with the industrial court, and
 exhaust all possible avenues of resolution before striking.
 Consequently, most strikes are illegal, short-lived, and
 local. In 1987 there were 109 strikes with 93,749 workdays
 lost. Kenya's industrial court has a reputation for
 objectivity and is strongly supported by unions as well as
 employers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor laws apply uniformly throughout the country. Except for
 civil servants, Kenyan workers are free to organize and
 bargain collectively. The Government promotes voluntary
 negotiations between employers and workers' organizations, and
 the FKE actively cooperates. Both in law and in practice,
 union officials are protected against antiunion
 discrimination. There are no export processing zones in Kenya.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Under the Chief's Act, a local authority can require the
 performance of limited communal activities for the benefit of
 the local community. While this provision is rarely invoked,
 the ILO Committee of Experts has called on the Government to
 bring this Act into conformity with the ILO Conventions on
 forced labor and has noted that discussions are at an advanced
 stage for the introduction of the necessary amendments. There
 are, however, a number of provisions in other legislation
 (e.g., Penal Code, Public Order Act, Prohibited Publications
 Order, Merchant Shipping Act, and the Trade Disputes Act)
 which the Committee has found to be inconsistent with the
 Conventions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment in mines, factories,
 transportation, and construction is 18. Kenyan labor law
 permits children under 18 to be employed in these occupations
 if they are family-run businesses and are not dangerous.
 There are no legal restrictions on child labor in agriculture
 where many younger people help out on family farms. Some
 children also are employed as servants. The Ministry of Labor
 has difficulty enforcing minimum age laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Kenya's population, with an average growth rate around 4
 percent, is expected to reach 24 million by the end of 1988
 and to double by the end of the century. Urbanization has
 accelerated rapidly, although approximately 75 percent of
 Kenyans continue to live in rural areas, many as subsistence
 farmers. There is adequate legislation in the Factories Act
 to provide acceptable and safe working conditions for
 factories, the construction industry, and the docks, but its
 understaffed inspectorate is often unable to enforce
 compliance. The law contains inadequate safeguards for
 agricultural workers, especially in the use of potentially
 carcinogenic pesticides.

 KENYA
 The maximum legal workweek is 52 hours, but many workers put
 in longer hours. As an example, security guards, an important
 and growing sector, often work as many as 84 hours a week.
 Kenyan law provides for at least I rest day a week, paid sick
 leave, paid annual leave, and holidays. Abuses occur,
 especially among temporary workers (known as *casuals"), who
 make up at least 13.4 percent of Kenya's wage-earning work
 force.
 The legal minimum wage varies according to occupation, age,
 and location. It ranges from about $15 per month for a rural,
 unskilled laborer under age 18 to about $85 per month for a
 cashier in Nairobi or Mombasa. The Government has had
 difficulty enforcing minimum wage requirements and many
 workers receive less than their due. Since most Kenyans do
 not receive wages for their work, they are not covered by
 minimum wage legislation. Many families eke out a decent
 living with one or more family members earning a wage while
 other members work as subsistence farmers.
 There is a National Social Security Fund, administered jointly
 by the Government, COTU, and the FKE, which pays lump-sum
 benefits to those covered when they retire.
