 BANGLADESH
 Throughout 1984, Bangladesh was governed by the Martial Law
 Administration headed by Lieutenant General H. M. Ershad,
 which took power through a bloodless coup d'etat in March
 1982. General Ershad declared himself President in December
 1983, a move which made him head of state in addition to head
 of government.
 In 1982, the military suspended the Constitution, dissolved
 the Parliament, and dismissed the popularly elected
 President. Martial law regulations give broad powers to the
 Chief Martial Law Administrator and to a three-level structure
 of martial law courts; these powers are essentially unlimited
 and are not justiciable. The principal reasons advanced for
 the imposition of martial law included the need to eradicate
 corruption, reinvigorate the economy, and lay a stable
 foundation for a promised return to democratic institutions.
 Since its inception, the Martial Law Aaministration has
 generally been more restrained than its initial verbal
 assertion of unchecked powers would imply. As the Government
 has become less preoccupied with eradicating corruption and
 more concerned with economic development, administrative
 decentralization and reform, and attracting civilian political
 support, the use of the draconian martial law regulations has,
 for the most part, ended. The regulations, however, remain on
 the books, ready to be reimposed if necessary. Although
 martial law was toughened briefly in November 1983, as a
 result of political unrest, the trend toward liberalization
 gained momentum in 1984. Summary martial law courts ceased to
 function on August 1, leaving only seven special martial law
 courts. A reformed and substantially decentralized civilian
 courts system has effectively resumed civil and criminal
 judicial responsibilities. Bar associations in the capital
 and provincial towns flourish.
 During most of 1984, the Government evidenced continued
 interest in restoring participatory politics. Local
 nonpartisan elections took place in December 1983-January
 1984, but the scheduled March 1984 Upazilla (sub-district)
 elections were cancelled in the face of threatened violence by
 opposition parties. In May, Presidential elections were
 postponed because opposition political party alliances refused
 to participate. National parliamentary elections were
 rescheduled for December 8, with Presidential elections
 expected to be held soon afterward. Opposition political
 parties announced their intention to boycott those elections,
 and President Ershad announced the postponement of elections
 on October 27. On December 15, the President announced that
 parliamentary elections would be held in April 1985. He also
 announced various measures regarding the Martial Law
 Administration, including the abolishment of various local
 components of the Martial Law Administration by January 31,
 1985; the cessation of the functioning of the remaining
 martial law courts by January 15, 1985; and the reinstatement
 of the Constitution and the lifting of martial law after the
 newly elected Parliament is summoned. Another measure,
 announced on December 20, prohibited all political activity,
 including processions, picketing, public meetings, and the use
 of loudspeakers on December 22-23, the dates set by the
 opposition parties for a 48-hour general strike.
 Bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated
 agricultural countries in the world. Deeply entrenched
 
 
 1187
 BANGLADESH
 Islamic traditions, reinforced by illiteracy and the physical
 isolation of the villages, decree a pronounced subordination
 of women and effectively separate the majority of the
 population from access to a knowledge of their civil rights,
 either under Islam or under Bangladesh's legal system which is
 derived from English common law. Poverty and violence--the
 latter mostly over land and women--are common in rural areas
 where the vast majority lives at or below subsistence levels.
 Bangladesh has spent 8 of its 13 years since independence
 under martial law. This both reflects and contributes to the
 weakness of its political institutions and feeds a belief
 among the military that it bears ultimate responsibility for
 national affairs. Political activity is an avocation for many
 in the capital, but national politics barely touch the
 everyday existence of 85 percent of the population.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for directly political motives is not common, although
 violence, including killing, between factions, gangs, and
 economic adversaries sometimes assumes political coloration.
 Several persons were killed during the confrontations between
 students and opposition political elements, on one hand, and
 government security forces in 1984. On June l, tribals from
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts attacked Bengali settlers, killing
 approximately 100 people and injuring scores more.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no confirmed reports of disappearances resulting
 from official action. There are occasional allegations of
 disappearances in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In January,
 three expatriates working in the Chittagong Hill Tracts were
 kidnapped by the Shanti Bahini, a tribal guerrilla force, and
 held six weeks before being released unharmed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Widespread or systematic torture is not characteristic in
 Bangladesh, but the press has reported sporadic police
 brutality, particularly in provincial areas. In 1984, there
 were allegations of the use of torture by government security
 elements, and Amnesty International has expressed concern
 about the reports of torture that it has received. Several
 such allegations have been made about treatment of tribes
 which inhabit the Chittagong Hills. Police and soldiers do
 not appear to be well supervised when they handle prisoners.
 Evidence exists that threats of physical abuse and actual
 beatings are occasionally employed to intimidate suspects
 detained in connection with such crimes as theft.
 Interrogation methods are, reportedly, sometimes abusive.
 According to one human rights activist, punishment of police
 and jail officials involved in mistreating prisoners takes
 place in cases where a victim or his family can attract
 publicity, but most mistreatment of obscure victims goes
 unpunished. Prominent individuals who have been jailed say
 they were not mistreated.
 
 
 1188
 BANGLADESH
 The overcrowded jails reflect the extremely poor living
 conditions prevalent in the country. In at least the larger
 prisons, the conditions under which prominent persons and
 political prisoners ('Class A' prisoners) are held are
 markedly better than those afforded ordinary criminals. In
 April 1983, a commission was constituted to study penal
 reform, with an eventual goal of improving facilities and
 evolving a new correctional system. Due primarily to severe
 resource constraints, prospects for rapid implementation of
 prison reforms are slight.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In 1984, the Government sought to notify families
 expeditiously of arrests and of detainees' whereabouts.
 Following the unrest in November 1983, it reported that it had
 detained or placed under house arrest 160 persons, including
 leaders of the major opposition parties. At least 75 were
 released within 2 weeks and all were released by early 1984.
 In September 1984, as many as 1,500 persons were detained
 during a general strike; most were released within 24 hours.
 Martial law regulations authorize arrest for reasonable
 suspicion of having committed an offense, and do not provide
 for habeas corpus. Offenses under these regulations include
 criticism of martial law, creation of panic, political
 activity, interference with the defense service, corruption,
 and smuggling. In practice, the Martial Law Administration
 has not fully exercised its broad authority. The suspended
 rights of habeas corpus and of bringing writs of any kind
 against the Government have, in practice, been reinstated.
 Under the Special Powers Act of 1974, persons may be detained
 without charge for 24 hours, held with the consent of a
 magistrate for 30 days, and held indefinitely with government
 approval. This act predates martial law.
 Several cases of persons arrested on minor charges, who have
 remained in jail without trial and been forgotten for 5 to 10
 years, have been brought to light by Bangladeshi human rights
 activists. In the past, over half of the prison population
 was reportedly undergoing or awaiting trial. Under new
 regulations which apply to civilian courts, if investigation
 has not been completed and charges filed in an ordinary case
 within 90 days, the case must be dismissed. The regulations
 reflect an effort by the Martial Law Administration to remedy
 one of the great abuses of the legal system. To accomplish
 the goal of speedy justice, these changes also broaden the
 power of the police and lower courts and limit appeal rights
 in minor cases. There are no indications that these enlarged
 powers and more summary procedures have been misused.
 Incommunicado detention is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most civil and criminal cases are heard by civilian courts in
 public trials in which the right to counsel is respected.
 During 1984, cases were almost exclusively brought to civilian
 courts. Processing cases in Bangladesh can be both
 time-consuming and expensive, facts which work a hardship on
 the vast majority of individuals enmeshed in litigation and
 discourage many from seeking redress through the courts.
 However, the civilian court system does operate, and fair
 public trials do not appear to be intentionally denied.
 
 
 1189
 BANGLADESH
 Official punishment for offenses against martial law
 regulations range from fines to death, but no known executions
 have resulted from convictions under these regulations. In
 cases of corruption, sentences have included imprisonment up
 to 14 years, fines, and confiscation of property. Observers
 estimate that the number of persons in custody for offenses
 other than common law ones is around 100.
 Among the steps which the Martial Law Administration has taken
 to make the justice system more accessible has been the
 dispersal of magistrate courts to the newly established
 Upazilla (subdistrict) level of government, and administrative
 decentralization of the appellate judiciary, of which benches
 currently sit in six cities outside Dhaka. Decentralization
 of both criminal and civil judicial functions has resulted in
 an increase in the number of cases. It is not clear that the
 backlog of cases, estimated as high as 100,000, will increase,
 however, since the new regulations emphasize expeditious
 processing. On December 15 it was announced that the
 remaining martial law courts would cease to function by
 January 15, 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh authorities do not normally engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home. For the civil court system, a judicial
 warrant is required before authorities enter a home, and
 courts require evidence of a reasonable basis of suspicion of
 involvement in a crime before issuing such a warrant. Martial
 law regulations provide for entry and search of the home under
 the same set of conditions, but extend these powers to both
 military and police authorities.
 Wiretaps are not thought to be widely employed in Bangladesh.
 Correspondence is not routinely monitored. The civilian and
 military intelligence services concern themselves, in part,
 with domestic events, but their influence and capability are
 not pervasive.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities, and owns and controls one of the four
 English-language dailies, two vernacular dailies, and one
 weekly.
 In 1984, the Government returned one major English-language
 paper, The Bangladesh Observer, to its private owners. Many
 Bengali-language periodicals circulate; most are privately
 owned. Before martial law, many newspapers were supported by
 political parties and reflected various political views. This
 practice continued under martial law, initially in muted
 fashion, but in 1984 with increasing openness. Major papers
 carry a balance of news from the Government and the opposition.
 The Bangladesh news media avoid explicit criticism of the
 Government on topics perceived as particularly sensitive. The
 Government has detained and tried journalists for writing
 articles critical of martial law (an offense under martial law
 regulations), but all were released in 1984.
 
 
 1190
 BANGLADESH
 The Government exercises its authority to ban foreign and
 domestic publications. The publication of three Bengali-
 language newspapers was banned in 1984. The daily Dainik Desh
 was closed in 1983 for publishing reports of politicians'
 remarks threatening the martial law authorities, and again in
 1984 for publishing a purportedly unsubstantiated story
 alleging that Burmese insurgents were receiving training in
 Bangladesh. Demands by journalists that the Government lift
 the ban on Dainik Desh have appeared regularly in other
 papers. Journalists took the unusual step of halting
 publication of all papers for one day in protest over the
 ban. However, the paper has not yet resumed publication.
 The February 1983 clashes between politicized student groups
 and the authorities resulted in the closure of universities
 for several months. In November 1983, confrontation between
 political parties and the Government led to the closure of
 universities and colleges. The Government announced a two
 week holiday just before the September 27, 1984 general
 strike, which forced students off the campus. The Martial Law
 Administration has promulgated no decrees which specifically
 reduce academic freedom.
 The Government does not routinely monitor the activities of
 private citizens in Bangladesh. Bangladeshis freely criticize
 the Government in private conversations, even with foreigners.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The original martial law regulations prohibited any activity
 of a political party, any meetings of a political nature, and
 any gathering of over 100 people with the exception of
 cultural, literary, or religious events. The Government
 relaxed this ban in April 1983 by authorizing indoor political
 gatherings. It later lifted the remaining restrictions and
 allowed free political activity in preparation for local and
 national elections. Opposition political parties held a
 regular calendar of demonstrations, rallies, and strikes in
 1984.
 Given low wages and massive unemployment, labor unions in
 Bangladesh represent no more than three percent of the work
 force. These urban-based unions are closely allied with
 various political parties and are involved in the strikes and
 rallies mounted by them. The Martial Law Administration's
 1982 industrial relations ordinance prohibited strikes,
 lockouts, and union meetings, and provided for peaceful
 settlement of industrial disputes by negotiations, followed by
 binding arbitration, with referral of appeals to a labor
 court. As a result, labor union activity in 1983 was
 nonconfrontational. In 1984, however, labor unions challenged
 the industrial relations ordinance, and, in the atmosphere of
 relaxed restrictions on political activity, launched a series
 of strikes and protests, the culmination of which was a call
 for a 48-hour work stoppage by a coalition of 15 leftist
 unions to dramatize their demands. On the eve of the May
 strike, the Martial Law Administration capitulated, and the
 strike was averted. In addition, a strike by journalists in
 July closed the nation's newspapers for 26 days, doctors and
 nurses struck, civil servants made repeated *pen-down"
 protests, and Supreme Court lawyers boycotted the court.
 Primary school teachers won concessions in June, and a strike
 by pilots and engineers grounded the national airline in
 September. Issues included working conditions, fringe
 benefits, salary levels, and demands for an end to martial law.
 
 
 1191
 BANGLADESH
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) received complaints
 by trade union organizations that certain of the Government's
 martial law ordinances violate two ILO conventions, the
 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize
 Convention, 1948 (No. 87), and the Right to Organize and
 Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). The
 Government of Bangladesh has ratified these Conventions. The
 Government has informed the ILO that the restrictions
 complained about are temporary and under constant review
 toward their relaxation and ultimate withdrawal when
 constitutional government is restored. The ILO has reminded
 the Government of the need for it to comply with the
 provisions of these conventions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, conversion from one
 religion to another is permitted. Proselytizing by citizens
 is allowed under Article 41 of the Constitution, subject to
 law, public order, and morality. Proselytism is largely
 directed toward minority groups such as Hindus and tribals.
 There is strong social resistance against efforts to convert
 persons from the majority Muslim community. Certain Islamic
 organizations have voiced concern over Christian missionary
 activities and the conversion of Muslims to Christianity.
 Present and preceding governments have all pledged to Hindu,
 Buddhist, and Christian minorities, who combined constitute
 approximately 17 percent of the population, equality of
 treatment and freedom of worship. Although this policy is
 substantially respected, the numerical predominance of Muslims
 and South Asia's history of communal antagonism contribute to
 minority unease. Members of minority religious groups are
 disadvantaged in practice, although not by law, in their
 access to government positions and political office. Members
 of some minorities, principally Hindus, have lost or had
 serious difficulty retaining their properties as a result of
 prejudicial administration of vested property laws. These
 laws provide that property belonging to persons who left
 Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971 shall be managed by the
 Government. The Government is authorized to use and to sell
 this property, which it has sometimes done to the disadvantage
 of former owners. In October 1983, the Government announced
 the establishment of three religious welfare trusts for Hindu,
 Buddhist, and Christian religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladesh citizens are free to move within the country, but
 there are designated "protected areas' near the borders and
 certain other locations from which all non-residents may be
 banned. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit or emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls. In some
 instances, persons deemed by the Government to be security
 risks have not been allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants
 must obtain 'no-objection certificates* from the ministry in
 which they are employed before traveling abroad, and citizens
 going overseas to work must register with the ministry
 responsible for manpower exports. The right of repatriation
 is observed. Although Bangladesh has no stated policy on
 refugee and asylum matters, in 1979 it provided temporary
 asylum to sizable groups of Arakanese Muslim refugees from
 Burma.

 1192
 BANGLADESH
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslim Biharis remain in
 Bangladesh, in principle pending resettlement in India or
 Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these Biharis opted for
 Pakistani citizenship. As neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh
 recognizes them as citizens, the people are effectively
 stateless. Camp dwellers may seek employment and conduct
 other activities, but face disadvantages as non-citizens.
 Some Biharis have lost property as a result of laws
 confiscating Pakistani holdings. On the other hand, those
 Biharis who chose to become Bangladeshi citizens in 1971 are
 entitled to full rights as such.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Martial Law Declaration of March 25, 1982, suspended the
 Constitution and its electoral provisions, banned political
 activities (but not political parties), dissolved the
 Parliament, dismissed the elected President, and prohibited
 criticism of martial law or the spreading of *prejudicial
 reports." From the outset, however, the martial law
 authorities stated their intention to return the country to
 representative government.
 During 1983, a timetable for local, parliamentary, and
 Presidential elections was announced. Despite political
 unrest, the Government continues to assert that it intends to
 reinstate the Constitution in largely unaltered form.
 Parliamentary elections were scheduled for December 8, 1984,
 with Presidential elections to follow soon after. With the
 opposition continuing to boycott, however, President Ershad
 postponed the elections. On December 15, he announced that
 parliamentary elections would be held in April 1985. As a key
 element of its overall reform efforts, the Martial Law
 Administration has announced and partially implemented plans
 to devolve power and responsibility to elected township and
 subdistrict councils (Upazillas), particularly in development
 matters.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several international non-governmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, the
 International League for Human Rights, and the International
 Commission of Jurists, are represented in Bangladesh. No
 external missions made inquiries in Bangladesh in 1984.
 Bangladesh is currently serving its first term in the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission.
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the detention of opposition party leaders, workers, and
 students; the trial of political prisoners by military courts
 applying summary procedures; allegations of torture; prison
 conditions; the death penalty; and treatment of tribal groups
 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Freedom House rates Bangladesh
 "partly free.' Several Bangladeshi organizations and lawyers
 are active in defending human rights through publicity
 designed to inform people of their rights, the provision of
 legal aid to the poor, and challenges in the courts. The
 majority of cases handled by these o-ganizations involve the
 rights of pretrial prisoners and the treatment of women.
 
 
 1193
 BANGLADESH
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Since an estimated 86 percent of Bangladeshis Subsist below an
 absolute poverty level (according to World Bank figures), the
 Martial Law Administration's avowed priority is economic
 development. Its programs aim at increased agricultural
 yields, reduced population growth, administrative
 decentralization, and private sector development. The Martial
 Law Administration considers the eradication of corruption and
 inefficiency necessary for the success of these efforts.
 However, accusations of widespread corruption within the
 administration persist.
 Efforts to induce economic growth confront serious obstacles.
 The 99 million people live in 55,000 square miles with a
 population growth rate of 3.1 percent, making Bangladesh the
 most densely populated agricultural country in the world.
 Half the population is under 14 years of age. With the
 exception of natural gas and fertile alluvial soil, the
 country lacks natural resources. Annual per capita income was
 only about $139 in 1982. Funds for investment, as well as the
 transportation and communications infrastructure, are
 extremely limited. Approximately 85 per cent of the
 development budget comes from foreign aid. Literacy appears
 to be declining overall, and exhibits a marked disparity
 between males and females and between urban and rural
 dwellers. About 76 per cent of Bangladeshis 5 years old and
 above are illiterate. Despite the Government's commitment to
 expand primary, secondary, and technical schooling,
 broad-based modern education is far from a reality and rapid
 population growth is overwhelming those facilities which do
 exist. The technological level of capital and human assets is
 rudimentary, and the outward flow of educated and trained
 persons, given the meager base, is substantial.
 The economy is highly susceptible to fluctuations in the world
 market, commodity prices, and especially the vagaries of
 nature. The low-lying land and dependence on monsoon rains,
 combined with extremely simple farming methods, mean that a
 tropical storm or a few weeks variation in rainfall patterns
 can change subsistence into famine in a particular locality.
 The year 1984 was a particularly difficult year, with near
 record floods.
 These difficulties are compounded by social factors.
 Approximately one-half of the rural households are effectively
 landless. Gains in food production have been offset in large
 part by population growth, and Bangladesh still has an annual
 food deficit.
 Bangladesh's industrial and service sectors are small,
 employing approximately 10 percent of the labor force and
 contributing only about 9 percent to the gross domestic
 product. While no accurate measurements of unemployment and
 underemployment exist, both are estimated as high as 40
 percent. Women are virtually absent from the cash work force,
 except in the new and mushrooming export-oriented garment
 industry. Their wages lag behind those of men, even for the
 same work.
 In addition to its large development program, which includes
 agricultural modernization, road building, and rural
 electrification, the Government has instituted industrial and
 tax policies to strengthen the private sector in an effort to
 
 
 1194
 BANGLADESH
 encourage the growth of productive industry. Despite
 government inducements, few industries have located in rural
 areas, and it is unlikely that many will do so in the near
 future because the basic infrastructure of transportation,
 communication, and electrification is inadequate.
 The poverty of Bangladesh is evident in the poor health and
 nutritional standards of the country. Life expectancy at
 birth is 49 years. The infant mortality rate is approximately
 142 deaths per 1,000 live births. Only 53 percent of the
 population has access to safe water (according to 1976
 estimates). On a per capita basis, nutritional intake
 indicates a downward trend over the last 15 years.
 Present beliefs and underlying social barriers circumscribing
 the participation of women in activities beyond the home are
 strongly entrenched and show few signs of weakening. For the
 approximately 86 percent of women who live in rural areas,
 early marriage, high childbearing rates, and long hours of
 household labor leave little opportunity for non-family
 interests or outside employment. No culturally acceptable
 alternative to marriage exists for women (or men), and
 childlessness is viewed as a personal catastrophe. Even in
 urban areas and among the affluent, the traditional social
 system makes women economically dependent on their husbands or
 other male relatives.
 By custom and Muslim-influenced tradition, women occupy a
 subordinate, dependent place and receive unequal treatment
 before the law on a widespread basis. The ability of a family
 to seclude its women is a key symbol of social status. The
 daily press testifies to a pattern of domestic violence
 (murder, rape, torture), breach of matrimonial contract,
 denial of inheritance rights, and desertion, which victimizes
 women, particularly among the poor. The rate of suicide among
 women is reportedly almost three times higher than among men.
 In October 1983, the Government promulgated a stringent
 ordinance aimed at deterring cruelty to women. To check
 murder, kidnapping, abduction, and trafficking (including
 international trafficking) in women, the ordinance brings
 together the various statutes applicable to women and stiffens
 the penalties for abuse. It provides the death penalty for
 those directly responsible for a "dowry killing" or for
 killing of a woman in the course of rape, although it does not
 address the abuse of a woman stopping short of murder or rape
 or taking place within the family or home. "Dowry killings,*
 as reported in the press, usually share a common theme: the
 bride's family has not made full payment of a supposedly
 promised dowry, so the husband or his family attacks and often
 murders the bride.
 A simmering insurgent movement bred of social disruption,
 economic decline, and spiritual demoralization continued
 through 1984 among the approximately 404,000 tribal people who
 inhabit the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a geographically and
 socially atypical part of an otherwise generally homogeneous
 country. The predominantly Buddhist tribal population has
 been alienated by the Government's claim to land which the
 indigenous people regard as tribal property. Over the past
 decade, successive governments have settled close to 260,000
 ethnic Bengalis in that territory, radically altering the
 ethnic balance in the area from 90 per cent tribal in 1947 to
 54 percent in 1981. Sporadic clashes pitting police, army,
 and border patrol units against tribal insurgents continue.
 
 
 1195
 BANGLADESH
 Although the number of deaths is believed to be low, no
 reliable statistics are available. Reported conditions in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts lend credence to charges of human
 rights abuses by the army and Bengali settlers.
 In an attempt to end the insurgency, the Government announced
 in October 1983 an amnesty for all insurgents effective
 through February 1984. Although the Government considers its
 new policy generous, the anti-government tribal leadership
 continues to demand the preservation of the autonomous culture
 of the Chakmas and other tribes rather than integration into
 Bengali Muslim culture. In particular, insurgents continue to
 call for an end to Bengali settlement in the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts.
