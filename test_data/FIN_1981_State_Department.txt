 FINLAND
 Finland's respect for human rights is reflected in its
 constitution, its laws and in the customs and practices of its
 institutions. Concern for the integrity of the person is
 protected both in theory and in practice by two coequal public
 investigatory institutions: the chancellor of justice (i.e., a
 public prosecutor) and the parliamentary ombudsman.
 Finland has been in the forefront in providing protection to
 women and minorities. The Swedish-speaking minority enjoys
 protection of language and cultural heritage and participates
 fully in the economic life of the country. Finland was the
 second country in the world to give women the vote (1906).
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed constitutionally and
 respected in practice. Finland shares with its Nordic
 neighbors a comprehensive social welfare system. It has
 developed a modern industrial economy with a strong and
 democratic labor movement, and privately-owned, cooperative and
 state-owned enterprises operate side-by-side within a market
 economy system.
 Finland is a supporter of international human rights
 objectives. It is a party to most of the treaties on the
 subject and has made special efforts to implement and
 incorporate these covenants and conventions into its laws.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The most relevant laws protecting the individual.
 from torture are contained in the Police Acts (act no. 84 of
 February 18, 1966; act no. 53 of January 25, 19751 decree no.
 119 of February 14, 1969 and decree no. 163 of February 15,
 1973).
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Capital punishment has been abolished totally, in time of war
 as well as peace, by act no. 343 of May 5, 1972. The death
 penalty has not been administered in Finland in peacetime since
 1826.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reported cases of disappearances occurring in
 Finland as a result of official action. There are no cases of
 abduction or clandestine detention by official or
 quasi-official security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. The circumstances of an arrest
 are examined initially when an accused is brought to trial, and
 should the arrest be shown to have been false or should the
 accused be acquitted, the accused is entitled to collect civil
 damages from the same court.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Finnish citizens and aliens have the right to
 effective counsel. Charges must be clearly stated and the state
 will pay for counsel of one's choice in cases of indigence.
 Finnish law, act no. 26 of February 25, 1926, provides that
 court trials and.judgments are public and open to the casual
 observer.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home, including prohibition of
 eavesdropping and mail tampering, is guaranteed by articles 11
 and 12 of the Finnish constitution and is respected in
 practice. Under act no. 260 of June 12, 1959, search warrants
 may be issued only by judicial authorities empowered to issue
 warrants of arrest for crimes punishable by imprisonment of
 more than six months. The ministry of interior or the
 chancellor of justice may also authorize a search, subject to
 subsequent judicial scrutiny and possible civil and criminal
 penalties for abuse of this power (including compensation to
 the victims).
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press,.Religion and Assembly
 Civilian and political liberties are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Discrimination on the basis of race,
 national or ethnic origin is a criminal offense under articles
 5 and 6, chapter 13 of the penal code.
 There is no censorship, and prior restraint is expressly
 prohibited in Finland. The right of a citizen to own and
 operate a printing press is constitutionally protected under
 article 10 end supplemented by act no. 1 on the freedom of the
 press of January 4, 1919. The Finnish government owns all
 broadcast media and leases some TV time to a commercial TV
 service, which produces its own news and features programming.
 All religions may be practiced freely in Finland. The right of
 assembly is guaranteed (any group may hold a meeting without a
 permit upon six hours' notice to local authorities). If the
 purpose of the association is to influence political issues,
 only Finnish citizens may belong. Trade union organization and
 activity are protected constitutionally.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in practice
 under article 7 of the Finnish constitution and decree no. 9 of
 February 4, 1960. Finns have the right to voluntary
 repatriation, which is protected by constitutional article no.
 7. There are about 200 persons in refugee status in Finland.
 Refugees are provided with housing, training and education and
 have the same rights as citizens in access to social services.
 Around 500,000 Finns have emigrated from Finland since 1949,
 mostly to Sweden. Of these about 1 percent have returned to
 Finland.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Finland is a multi-party democracy. An association may
 register as a political party if it includes more than 5,000
 citizens, practices internally democratic procedures and
 publishes a party program. Opposition parties function
 freely. Any person born in Finland of Finnish parentage is a
 Finnish citizen. Foreigners born in Finland are entitled to
 Finnish nationality if they do not receive another nationality
 at birth. Statistics provided by the government to the United
 Nations report that ethnic minority populations of more than
 5,000 Gypsies, about 4,000 Lapps, 1,200 Jews and 1,000 Tartars
 living in Finland are Finnish citizens.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests for investigations of human rights
 in Finland. There is an Amnesty International office and an
 equality council, charged with investigating discrimination
 charges against women, which have been able to conduct their
 investigations freely and without interference. Finland
 participates actively in international and regional human
 rights bodies.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Finland has a modern industrial economy with privately-owned,
 cooperative and state-owned enterprises operating within a
 market economy system. The government follows an economic
 policy aimed at maximizing economic stability and equalizing
 distribution of income along broad lines among individuals
 residing in urban and rural sectors.
 The Finns enjoy a per capita GNP of US$ 8,160 (1979). Life
 expectancy is 68.5 years for a man and 77.1 years for a woman,
 and the infant mortality rate is 7.7 per 1,000 live births
 (1979). Population increases at an average annual rate of 0.28
 percent. Virtually 100 percent of the adult population is
 literate, and the adjusted primary school enrollment ration is
 15 percent. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 114 percent.
 In 1980, private households received 67.4 percent of the
 national disposable income, corporations 5.8 percent and the
 public sector 26.2 percent. General transfers to the private
 sector equalled 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product and
 the government spent 21.0 percent of GDP on social
 expenditures. Social benefits are available equally to all
 Finnish citizens regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background or political opinion.
