 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of government. The Queen is head of
 state and is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Owen
 Arthur is the head of government and governs with an appointed cabinet. The judi-
 ciary is independent.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order. The
 -small volunteer Barbados Defence Force (BDF), responsible for national security,
 can-be. employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other spe-
 cific need. In response to increased crime in tourist areas, the BDF has assisted the
 police since 1993 by patrolling beaches. On the whole, the police respected constitu-
 tional and legal provisions protecting human rights, but there continued to be infre-
 quent reports of abuses by police.
 The economy is based on tourism, services, light manufacturing, and agriculture,
 which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product exceeds $7,000. Barbados has experienced a continued strong recov-
 - ery after a recession in the early 1990's. In 1997 the economy was expected to grow
 approximately 3.5 percent, based primarily on increases in tourism.
 - Citizens enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms, and the Government respects
 constitutional provisions regarding human rights. Principal human rights problems
 continued to be societal violence against women and children and occasional in-
 stances of excessive use of force by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the Caribbean Human Rights Network and the
 local press reported numerous allegations of coerced confessions. There continued to
 be credible reports that law enforcement officials sometimes used force during de-
 tention to extract confessions from detainees. There also was an allegation that po-
 lice abducted a homeless carwasher, took him to a field, and. shot him in the back.
 The authorities suspended four officers in connection with this incident and brought
 charges against two of them. The criminal case was pending before the courts at
 yearrs end.
 Police procedures provide that the police may question suspects and other persons
 they hold only at a police station, except when expressly permitted by a senior divi-
 sional officer. An officer must visit detainees at least once every 3 hours to inquire
 about the detainees' condition. After 24 hours, the detaining authority must submit
 a written report to the deputy commissioner. The authorities must approve and
 record all movements of detainees between stations. The Caribbean Human Rights
 Network is satisfied that the authorities generally adhere to these basic principles,
 although officials occasionally used excessive force.
 Barbados is in the forefront of an initiative to standardize police procedures
 throughout the English-speaking Caribbean region. The authorities issued firearms
 to special units and some foot patrols in high-crime areas in response to the 1993
 shooting death of a policeman and a rise in gun- and drug-
 related crime. Aside from this development, the police force is still mainly un-
 armed, in keeping with its British traditions.

 The onlyprison is antiquated and overcrowded, with over 800 inmates in a struc-
 ture built or 350 inmates. The Caribbean Human Rights Network has publicly
 urged the establishment of a detention and rehabilitation center for youths and first
 offenders. To reduce overcrowding, magistrates have begun to make use of alter-
 natives to incarceration, such as community service work.
 The Government allows private groups to visit prisons to ascertain conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients.
 The authorities do not use exile as a punishment or means of political control
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is free of intervention by other branches of government.
 The judiciary includes the Supreme Court, which consists of the high court and
 court of appeal. The Governor General, after consultation with the Prime Minister
 and the Leader of the Opposition, appoints the Chief Justice. Other judges who
 make up the court are appointed on the advice of the Judicial and Legal Service
 Commission. Judges serve until the age of 65.
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal offenses be given
 a fair public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court, and the Government respects this right in practice. The judicial system pro-
 vides for the right of due process at each level. The law presumes defendants inno-
 cent until proven guilty. The Government provides free legal aid to the indigent
 with the exception of a 1,300 pounds sterling cap on expenses incurred for appeals
 by death row prisoners to the Privy Council in London. Two inmates have chal-
 lenged this limit and are suing the Government on the grounds that it effectively
 deprives them of their right to due process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires war-
 rants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.
 The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased
 drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighbor-
 hoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government does not censor mail. How-
 ever, the Government restricts the receipt of foreign publications deemed to be por-
 nographic. Other foreign publications of a nonprurient nature are allowed without
 restriction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities respect these rights in practice. There are two
 independent daily newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The
 Government regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in
 radio programs. There are five radio stations, two of which are owned by the Gov-
 ernment. The Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television service (the only
 television source, excluding direct satellite reception) is government owned. Al-
 though CBC is a state enterprise, it regularly reported views opposing government
 policies. Critics allege that the Government sometimes uses its influence to discour-
 age media reporting on sensitive issues, but the press remained vigorously critical
 of the Government on a broad span of issues. The Government prohibits the produc-
 tion of pornographic materials.
 The Government does not restrict aademic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government observes the
 constitutional provisions for peaceful assembly and private association in practice.
 Political parties, trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings
 and rallies without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status. However,
 government practice remains undefined.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. In the most recent
 election in September 1994, the Barbados Labour Party- won a decisive victory, gain-
 ing a 19-to-8 majority over the Democratic Labour Party. The National Democratic
 Party won one seat, its first ever in Parliament. There are no impediments to par-
 ticipation in the political process, and all citizens over age 18 may vote. The Prime
 Minister exercises executive power along with the Cabinet of Ministers he appoints,
 balanced by the bicameral Parliament and the judicial system.
 Women are well represented at all levels of government and politics. The Deputy
 Prime Minister is a woman (she also serves concurrently as Foreign Minister), and
 the Ministries of Health and Education are also headed by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights operate freely and without government
 hindrance. The Caribbean Human Rights Network, a Caribbean-wide human rights
 organization which has its headquarters and a small staff in Barbados, investigates
 and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Women.-Violence against women and children continued to be a significant social
 problem. Women's rights groups reported that the known incidence of sexual as-
 saults, domestic violence, incest, and rape increased, despite the fact that there is
 still some reluctance on the part of victims to report such incidents. There are public
 and private counseling services for domestic violence, rape, suicide, and child abuse.
 The 1992 Domestic Violence Law specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and
 children. It applies equally to marriages and to common law relationships. Criminal
 penalties for violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender or
 the victim. The courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women
 involving assault or wounding. Victims may request restraining orders, which the
 courts often issue. The courts can sentence an offender to jail for breaching such
 an order. Human rights monitors continued to criticize the inconsistency in sentenc-
 ing for rape, incest, and statutory rape, which is often left to the discretion of the
 judge. They noted that the lack of sentencing guidelines resulted in longer sentences
 for persons convicted of potty theft than for incest; and lesser sentences for incest
 than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-represented
 at all levels of both the public and private sectors. They form a large percentage
 -of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public housing or other
 social welfare programs.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare,
 although violence against children remains a serious problem. The Child Care Board
 is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding to the critical welfare
 needs, interests, and rights of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not prohibit discrimination against the
 physically disabled in employment, education, or the provision of other state serv-
 ices. The Labor Department, which is responsible for finding jobs for-the disabled,
 unsuccessfully advocated the introduction of such legislation in the 1980's. Simi-
 larly, there is no legislation mandating provision of accessibility to public thorough-
 fares or public or private buildings. Interest groups have lobbied for this type of leg-
 islation from time to time, but without success.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers freely exercise their right to form and be-
 long to trade unions and to strike. There are two major unions and several smaller
 ones, representing various sectors. The public service union, the National Union of
 Public Workers, is independent of any political party or the Government. The larg-
 est union, the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU), was historically closely associated
 with the Barbados Labour Party prior to 1954. After 1954, officers of the BWU be-
 came personally associated-with the Democratic Labour Party. A new Congress of
 Trade  nions and Staff Associations was inaugurated in August 1995. Most unions
 belong to this organization.
 
 
 415
 The law accords full protection to trade unionists' personal and property rights.
 Another law prohibits strikes against public utilities. All private and public sector
 employees are permitted to strike, but essential workers may strike only under cer-
 tain circumstances and after following prescribed procedures. There were no major
 strikes or long-term work stoppages during the year.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are affiliated with a variety of re-
 gional and international labor organizations. The Caribbean Congress of Labor has
 its headquarters in Barbados.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and authorities respected it in practice. Despite
 recent modest increases in union membership, job losses in traditional sectors of the
 economy have reduced overall union membership to approximately 30 percent of the
 working population. Normally, wages and working conditions are negotiated
 through the collective bargaining process, but a tripartite prices and incomes policy
 accord signed in the summer of 1993 established a 2-year wage freeze. The revised
 (second) protocol contained provisions for negotiated increases in basic wages and
 increases based on productivity. The new accord covered 1995-97.
 Employers have no legal obligation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a significant percentage of their employees signify a
 desire to be represented by a registered union. While there is no specific law prohib-
 iting antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redress for employees
 alleging unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but
 rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced,
 compulsory, or bonded labor, including that by children, and there were no reports
 of its use.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum working age of 16 is broadly observed. Compulsory primary and secondary
 education policies, which require school attendance until age 16, reinforce minimum
 age requirements. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and the au-
 thorities effectively enforce it (see Section 6.c.). The Labor Department has a small
 cadre of labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check
 records to verify compliance with the law. These inspectors may take legal action
 against an employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets and the authorities establish min-
 imum wages for specified categories of workers. Only two categories of workers have
 a formalys regulated minimum wage-household domestics and shop assistants
 (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a minimum wage of
 about $0.75 (bds $1.50) per hour, although in actual labor market conditions, the
 prevailing wage is almost double that amount. There are two age-related minimum
 wage categories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop assistants
 was raised by 13 percent in June, to $2.13 (bds $4.25) per hour; the juvenile mini-
 mum wage for shop assistants is $1.62 (bds $3.25) per hour.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited. Barbados for not adhering to the
 ILO convention on equal remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admonished the Government to ensure application of the principle of
 equal remuneration for work of equal value to male and female workers in the sugar
 industry or to provide further information on job descriptions which might justify
 such wage distinction. This case was not resolved by year's end.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess. Barbados accepts ILO conventions, standards,
 and other sectoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. However, there
 is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Employers must provide work-
 ers a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. Unemployment benefits and national in-
 surance (social security) cover all workers. A comprehensive, government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 The Factories Act of 1983 sets out the officially recognized occupational safety and
 health standards. The Labor Department enforces health and safety standards and
 follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. The Fac-
 tories Act also requires that in certain sectors firms employing more than 50 work-
 ers set up a safety committee. This committee can challenge the decisions of man-
 agement concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Trade unions
 have called on the Government to increase the number of factory inspectors in order
 to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more effectively, and
 
 
 to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. Govern-
 ment-operated corporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor job" in
 health and safety. The Government has promised to -undertake inspections of gov-
 ernment-operated corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority. Workers
 have a limited right-to-remove themselves from dangerous or hazardous job situa-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
