 DJIBOUTI
 In the four years since independence, the government of
 Djibouti has actively pursued pro7rams to increase the
 economic and social well being of its approximately 330,000
 people, and to establish a stable government. In 1981 the
 Djibouti national assembly approved the first constitution
 for the republic; only the first sections have been published.
 On any topic not yet covered by Djibouti legislation, the
 Napoleonic Code generally applies and, to an extent, the
 Koran-based Sharia. During 1981 presidential elections were
 held for the first time since independence, although only
 one candidate was presented. Shortly after the elections,
 13 well-known officials sought to establish an opposition
 political party, the Popular Party of Djibouti. The govern-
 ment denied the party legal status on the grounds that it
 would encourage internal instability. On September 7 the
 party leaders were detained when they were found illegally
 distributing dissident literature, and as of late December
 they were still being held.
 In spite of its weak economy, Djibouti has received nearly
 40,000 Ethiopian refugees into the country, and has allowed
 international relief agencies to operate in the two major
 refugee camps. Ethiopian refugees are not allowed to
 work in Djibouti, but all refugees have the right to live in
 the refugee camps and to receive basic food and medical
 care. Refugees who choose not to live in the designated
 refugee camps do not receive assistance from either the
 Djibouti government or from any international organization.
 Politically the country is divided among the majority
 ethnic Somalis, who in turn are subdivided into clans and
 fractions thereof; a substantial minority of Afars who
 have lost their previous position of dominance and now fear
 permanent exclusion from power; and Arabs, who are mainly
 Yemenis.
 Nominally, political power is shared by an arrangement
 in which the president is Somali and the premier an
 Afar, with cabinet positions roughly divided. 'Afar leaders,
 and some others, feel that real power is in the hands of
 the Somalis of the Issa clan, who increasingly control the
 government, the civil service, the armed forces, and the new
 single party, leaving no way for others to be assured of
 a fair share of power.
 Djibouti is a country with virtually no resources other than
 its well-located harbor. As a result, economic advancement
 has been intrinsically tied to assistance from other coun-
 tries. Unemployment and underemployment remain a major
 problem.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In July 1981, former Prime Minister Ahmed Dini Ahmed
 repeated his earlier unsubstantiated charges that politi-
 cal prisoners were being tortured. The government denied
 the charge. There have been no other reports of torture
 this year, but similar charges were.made by Dini and other
 
 
 internal critics of the government on at least three previous
 occasions, most recently in the summer of 1979. In 1980
 a delegate of Amnesty International visited Djibouti on
 government invitation and investigated charges of torture
 and death from torture. The delegate reported a pattern of
 torture in security and politically-motivated cases, met with
 President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and received assurances the
 President would undertake to eliminate the use of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no allegations of cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment in 1981, apart from the charges
 made by Dini. Prison conditions are said to be adequate.
 Family members and counsel are permitted access and public
 health and medical services supervise health conditions.
 c. Disappearances
 No allegations of disappearance are known to have been
 made.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The current system of justice has been carried over from
 the French colonial period and is a mixture of French
 and Muslim practice. There is no habeas corpus and pre-
 ventive detention is permitted, but prosecutors are
 required to, and generally do, file charges in expedient
 fashion. No allegations of arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment during 1981 are known to have been made.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the state security court, which was established to deal
 with crimes against the security of the state, and ordinary
 civil and criminal courts, permit family members and counsel,
 though not the general public, to be present during trials.
 The judiciary is independent of military and/or executive
 pressures.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Warrants are issued by the judiciary to the police. The only
 charge of warrantless search during 1981 stemmed from the
 detention of the Partie Populaire de Djibouti (PPD) members
 cited earlier. The gendarmerie was ordered by the Ministry
 of Interior to enter and search the homes of the thirteen
 dissident party members. Reportedly, some of these thirteen
 homes subsequently were sealed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Local media are government-owned and support the govern-
 ment in its politics, but do criticize the shortcomings of
 local institutions. Public meetings require a permit that
 may be denied for security reasons. The government has
 organized a national labor union under its control, but
 the right of labor to organize and strike is respected.
 Freedom of religion is observed.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Djlboutians have and exercise the right to travel freely
 within, and leave and return to Djibouti. Passports are
 available, but unsubstantiated charges are made that bribes
 sometimes are requested to expedite issuance.
 An estimated 40,000 Ethiopians have sought refuge in Djibouti.
 These refugees impose a heavy burden on Djibouti's meager
 resources. On at least one occasion in 1981. the government
 granted an Ethiopian refuge despite forceful protests from
 Ethiopia. A September 4, 1981 Amnesty International letter
 alleged that 16 Ethiopians were turned away at the Djibouti
 border in July 1981 and the UNHCR is presently investigating
 this allegation.
 it is estimated that from 3,000 to 5,000 of the Ethiopians
 originally offered refuge in Djibouti have migrated to other
 countries. Another 5,000 living in the city of Djibouti have
 been granted official refugee status by the government although,
 because of Djibouti's limited resources, they are not allowed
 to work or settle permanently in Djibouti. An unknown number of
 Ethiopians who have not applied for government recognition as
 refugees, and another significant number whose applications for
 refugee status have not yet been processed, live in the city
 with apparently very little official interference or assistance.
 Prom 20,000-25,000 Ethiopians live at the two UNHCR sponsored
 camps and receive regular food and medical care.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Djibouti became independent in 1977. The previously elected
 single list territorial assembly became the national assembly
 at independence and, in turn, elected Hassan Gouled Aptidon
 as president. On June 12, 1981 President Gouled, running as
 the candidate of the Peoples Progress Assembly, was reelected
 by universal sufferage with almost 85 percent of the vote
 cast in his favor. Although the only candidate for president,
 Gouled maintained in the days prior to the election that he
 did not prevent or exclude other candidates from presenting
 themselves, as long as they satisfied the constitutional
 requirements for running for office.
 In August 1981 an opposition party applied for legal recog-
 nition with the intention of participating in national
 assembly elections scheduled for the spring of 1982. Despite
 extensive publicity in the international press, the govern-
 ment refused to grant the proposed opposition party legal
 status. Several civil servants and military associated with
 the proposed new party were removed from their government
 positions and on September 7, thirteen leaders of the organ-
 ization were detained. Shortly after the end of the year,
 all had been released. The government maintains the leaders
 of the dissident party were attempting to encourage internal
 ethnic strife. The government'a actions have led to charges
 by some that there is no democratic or non-violent means of
 opposition for those who oppose the present government.
 The Afars, among other critics, complain that the country is
 run by and for the Somali Issas, who dominate the government,
 the armed forces, and the single party. These critics say
 there is no democratic or non-violent way to assure non-Issas
 a fair share of power and the benefits of government.
 
 
 Women have the same civil and political rights as men,
 but none are in the cabinet or national assembly and only
 a few hold high administrative positions.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On four occasions since independence, most recently from
 July-September 1981, there have been foreign press reports
 alleging human rights violations by the government.
 The only known request by an international organization
 to conduct a human rights investigation during 1981 is
 the verbal request by the Office of the United Nations High
 Commission for Refugees during July 1981, cited above.
 The government has agreed to cooperate with the UN in this
 investigation.
 In January 1980 a delegate from Amnesty International
 visited Djibouti at the government's invitation to investi-
 gate previousallegations. The delegate met with President
 Hassan Gouled Aptidon and other government officials and
 interviewed several individuals awaiting trial. The govern-
 ment cooperated with the Amnesty International investigation,
 and the president agreed to take the actions recommended by
 the delegate.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Djibouti remains dependent on outside resources for its
 economic development. France, in particular, plays a large
 role in Djibouti's economy and development. It encourages
 bilateral and international donors to assist in developing
 education-and health facilities, and in other projects
 designed to ameliorate the poverty level in the country.
 The most reliable estimate concerning the gross national
 product for Djibouti is a 1978 World Bank figure of $410 per
 capita. Other figures, not as accurate, have estimated
 higher per capita income. However, even the $410 figure is
 not descriptive of the poverty levels in the Republic. The
 majority of the Djiboutian population lives in abject
 poverty. A United Nations Development Program report written
 in 1980 states that the.Djibouti rural population is "probably
 one of the poorest groups in eastern Africa." This same
 report also stated that "extreme poverty exists in urban
 environments* of Djibouti. Two main factors contribute to
 the poverty level: first, practically all commodities are
 imported for consumption and prices of even basic staples are
 extraordinarily high for the entire population. Second, the
 high level of unemployment necessitates that working members
 of a family be economically responsible for all non-working
 family members. A United States Agency for International
 Development (USAID) report dated November 1979 estimates
 60 percent of the population lives below the $200.00 per
 capita poverty level.
 An International Monetary Fund (IMF) report prepared in
 December 1980, accepts a Djibouti ministry of labor estimate
 that slightly more than 50 percent of those seeking employment
 in 1979 could not find work. USAID estimates unemployment at
 33 percent and underemployment at close to 50 percent.

 An accurate data base from which meaningful statistics can be
 derived and interpreted has not as yet been established for
 Djibouti.
 During 1981 the Government of Djibouti evidenced an increased
 interest in preventive health measures, including pare-nurse
 training. Several new mother and child care clinics have
 been established in urban and rural Djibouti. The local
 newspaper has published nutrition inforration for the mothers
 of new-born children.
 The harsh environment in the Republic of Djibouti is
 reflected in the life expectancy and infant mortality rates.
 A World Bank study prepared in November 1980 estimates male
 and female life expectancy at 50 years of age. The infant
 mortality rate was estimated by the World Health Organiza-
 tion in June 1979 as 114 per 1,000 births. Water is the
 life blood of Djibouti, and the government has made efforts
 to truck water to the more remote areas of the country. An
 African Development Fund study in September 1979 estimated
 51 percent of the population was being served with safe
 water (53 percent in urban areas and 20 percent in rural
 areas). Twelve aquifers have been identified in the Republic
 with water being obtained from five of these. Active
 assistance programs to identify further water storage
 areas and to drill from existing storage areas are underway.
 The problem of water availability in Djibouti is demon-
 strated by the fact there is not a single permanent fresh
 water source above ground. All water comes from subterranean
 sources.
 No figures are available on the amount of calorie supply
 relative to nutritional requirements. The government has
 encouraged the population to supplement its diet with
 fish, one of the few locally produced food products.
 The adult literacy rate in the French language is about
 17 percent, according to a November 1980 World Bank report.
 The primary school enrollment rate was about 30 percent
 in 1976 according to this same report. An adequate census
 of the population of Djibouti has not been conducted since
 1960, and these statistics should be accepted with some
 reservation.
