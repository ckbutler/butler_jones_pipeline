 CHILE
 Chile has been ruled by a military government headed by
 President Augusto Pinochet since 1973. The September 1980
 Constitution provides for the military government to remain in
 office until a plebiscite is held in 1989 on a presidential
 candidate selected by the military junta. If approved, the
 junta candidate would serve until 1997. If rejected, a direct,
 contested election would be held within one year. The
 Constitution also provides that congressional elections are to
 be held in 1990. In the meantime, the military junta exercises
 legislative power. Individual rights and civil liberties are
 restricted by an emergency decree and by a transitory provision
 of the Constitution.
 Some opposition groups question the legitimacy of the 1980
 Constitution and the plebiscite which approved it by a
 two-thirds majority. Other groups object only to the
 provisions delaying the transition to democracy, and still
 other groups accept the Constitution in its entirety as a
 necessary foundation for the reestablishment of democracy in
 Chile. In 1983 a series of monthly "national days of protest"
 was organized by political and trade union groups calling for
 the removal of President Pinochet and an accelerated return to
 an elected civilian Government. In response, the military
 government in August indicated that it would discuss advancing
 Congressional elections and legalizing non-Marxist political
 parties. Political parties have been allowed to function in an
 increasingly open manner since the relaxation of political
 restrictions in mid-August, although democratic parties remain
 formally recessed by the Government and Marxist parties remain
 illegal.
 Conflicting human rights trends developed in Chile in 1983 in
 comparison with 1982t an increased number of reported cases of
 violations of the integrity of the individual were noted,
 including torture, while at the same time an incipient
 political opening began to restore political rights. The
 demonstrations which began in May became increasingly
 widespread and violent through September. More than any other
 factor, the Government's response to the monthly demonstrations
 accounted for the increase in arrests and internal exiles
 (banishment to remote interior locations) during 1983. After
 significant improvements between 1977-1981, followed by more
 modest advances in 1982, certain indices of human rights
 violations in 1983 were higher than in recent years.
 Antigovernment violence by known radical groups also increased
 in 1983, including in late August the assassination of the
 military Intendant of Santiago. In addition, terrorist
 bombings accounted for several dead and numerous injured.
 Groups associated with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left
 (MIR)--members of which have received Cuban training--claimed
 responsibility for many of these incidents.
 The "State of Emergency," which had been in continuous effect
 since 1973, was lifted in August, as were the late-night curfew
 and certain restrictions on freedom of information and the
 expression of opinion. Later, most restrictions on freedom of
 assembly were also lifted. Nevertheless, the separate "State
 of Danger of the Disturbance of Internal Peace" was extended
 for another six months in September, as it had been every six
 months since the promulgation of the Constitution in March
 1981. It gives the Government special authority to deal with
 
 
 495
 an extremist threat, although the same powers have been used
 against nonviolent dissenters as well.
 No one was expelled from the the country in 1983, and two of
 the four persons expelled in 1982 were allowed to return. In
 addition, 3,591 exiles have been allowed to return since
 December 1982, and the Government has declared that most of
 those still in exile will eventually be allowed back. Labor
 union activity continued subject to the 1979 labor plan, which
 reformulated and restored many labor rights, including
 collective bargaining. However, other rights were restricted
 and the right to strike in non-strategic industries was limited
 to 60 days.
 While the market remains the principal mechanism for allocating
 economic resources, government intervention in the economy
 increased in 1983, particularly in the financial sector. A
 severe recession which began in the fourth quarter of 1981
 continued through the first half of 1983. Aided by government
 work programs, unemployment in Chile declined to 15.9 percent
 for the three month period ending November 1983. Despite the
 budgetary restraints of the recession, social expenditures as a
 percentage of total government spending reached the record
 level of 59.4 percent by 1982 with emphasis directed at the
 poor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Monthly demonstrations against the Government in which there
 were incidents of rock throwing, burning barricades and
 sometimes shooting and violence in the poorer areas of Santiago
 led to a substantial increase in the number of politically-
 associated killings in 1983. Five members of the outlawed
 Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) were killed while
 resisting arrest in two separate shootouts with the security
 forces in February and April. Two demonstrators or by-standers
 were killed in May in the first of the monthly "national days
 of protest*; four in the June protest; two in the July protest;
 24 in August (the only protest in which regular military units
 were used to maintain public order); four in the September
 protest;  one in October;  and none in November. A number of
 protestors and national police (Carabineros) were wounded in
 the various demonstrations. In addition, three persons were
 killed and more than 25 injured in over 170 separate terrorist
 bombing attacks in 1983, most of which the MIR or Communists
 claimed to have carried out. In late August, MIR members
 reportedly killed the Santiago military Intendant and his two
 army bodyguards. A few days later, other MIR members
 reportedly shot and killed a Carabinero guarding the home of a
 court of appeals judge. In two shootouts in September, five
 MIR members who were also supposedly linked to the
 assassination of the military Intendant were killed by security
 forces and seven others were arrested and indicted. Subsequent
 selective assassinations brought the total of Carabineros
 killed by terrorists in 1983 to seven. There is considerable
 evidence of Cuban and East European training and other support
 for terrorist groups, whose announced objective is the violent
 overthrow of the military regime and its replacement with a
 Marxist-Leninist regime.
 
 
 496
 The Government asserts that security and military forces are
 under strict control. Nevertheless, there were a number of
 incidents during the year involving allegedly excessive use of
 violence by the police and military, leading to arrests in
 several cases. Some of the alleged police and military
 excesses took place during the "national days of protest,"
 particularly in August 1983. In May, two plainclothes
 detectives were arrested but later released for lack of
 evidence in connection with shooting incidents during the May
 11 demonstration. In Valparaiso a Carabinero was arrested and
 charged in the shooting death of a woman during the September
 demonstration. Three municipal security guards, as well as the
 ex-mayor of a Santiago borough, were jailed and indicted for
 shooting to death one individual and wounding a second on
 September 11. Also, after a long investigation nine policemen
 were charged in a 1980 case in which a rightist commando squad
 allegedly kidnapped and beat eight or nine persons, one of whom
 later died. In October, the military judge for Santiago
 sentenced a Carabinero to 41 days in prison for mistreatment of
 two prisoners in 1981.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no substantiated reports of disappearances
 mince 1977. The Chilean Supreme Court appointed special judges
 in 1979 to investigate the disappearances which took place from
 1973 to 1977, but none of the 635 cases documented by the
 Vicariate of Solidarity, the Catholic Church human rights
 organization, has been resolved. While investigations continue
 in some cases, in others action has been suspended or referred
 to military justice officials when military or Carabinero
 involvement was suspected. Some families of the disappeared
 have appealed against the suspension or referral to the
 military courts, but the appeals have not resolved the
 whereabouts of those who disappeared.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Credible reports of torture at secret detention centers of the
 government security agency, the National Center for Information
 (CNI - the successor to the National Intelligence Directorate -
 DINA) were made public by human rights sources in 1983. In
 1983, 77 persons filed complaints in court of torture or cruel
 and unusual punishment compared with a 1982 total of 57. Most
 of these individuals allege that they were subjected to
 beatings, electric shocks, or threats, particularly during the
 first days of their detention prior to arraignment. The
 Constitution prohibits "use of all illegal pressure" and
 "guarantees to all persons the right to life and to the
 physical and psychic integrity of the individual." High-level
 government officials deny that the use of torture is
 authorized. However, Transitory Article 24 of the Constitution
 permits incarceration in places other than jails, and it is in
 these other detention facilities where most torture is alleged
 to occur. In late 1983 a lower court ruled that while such
 detention in places other than jails was permitted by the
 Constitution, there was no provision to permit these places of
 incarceration to be kept secret. The Minister of Justice
 indicated that publication of the address of the detention
 centers would be considered. In specific instances, the courts
 have required investigations of some complaints of torture but,
 to date, only a few have been substantiated in the courts and
 
 
 497
 individual guilt has never been assigned to any specific
 individual or institution.
 An increase in incidents of deliberate and random police
 brutality were reported by human rights sources, including
 Amnesty International, during 1983. While most detainees do
 not file formal claims of mistreatment, some persons detained
 during the "national days of protest" or on suspicion of
 proscribed political activities have complained of being beaten
 and forced to remain unclothed for extended periods of time.
 Since January 1981, all persons officially charged with or
 convicted of violation of internal security laws have been
 lodgedin the same penal facilities with other offenders. They
 have the rights of visitation and communication with family,
 .friends, legal counsel, and representatives of the
 International/Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The National Center for Information (CNI) continued in 1983 to
 obtain broadly-worded warrants which give it considerable
 latitude in making searches or arrests. However, a decision by
 the Santiago Court of Appeals may limit CNI arrest powers in
 the future. At the same time, the courts have become firmer in
 demanding a prompt accounting from the Government of those
 arrested by the CNI. As a result, Government security forces
 have given more prompt notification tO courts and families
 concerning detained persons. While writs of habeas corpus can
 be and are accepted during the initial arrest period, the judge
 is required only to verify the legal authority under which the
 person was detained. When individuals are detained for
 activities related to politics, friends or relatives normally
 report the detentions, the press publicizes them, and the
 Government subsequently acknowledges them.
 At the end of 1983, 409 persons charged with seditious activity
 or with illegal weapons possession were in judicial process.
 Of these, 101 were in jail awaiting trial, 281 were out on
 bail, and 27 others had been convicted and were serving
 sentences. The Catholic Church human rights organization, the
 Vicariate of Solidarity, using a combination of official
 figures and press reports, listed 9,648 arrests for security
 reasons in 1983, of which 735 were individual and 8,913 were
 mass arrests. (Counting only the cases directly handled by the
 Vicariate, the statistical method used in previous years, the
 comparative figures for 1982 were 312 individual arrests and
 901 mass arrests.) Almost all of those arrested were released
 within a matter of hours once their identities were verified,
 although some were charged and tried or internally exiled.
 Others were held for investigation for the full five days
 permitted under Transitory Article 24 of the Constitution,
 which provides that security officials may detain individuals
 for investigation for a period of up to five days and up to 20
 days in cases of terrorist acts which involve death, injury, or
 kidnapping before bringing them to a court. In those cases
 reaching the courts, the investigating judges may take up to
 five more days to deliberate. Some of those arrested were
 charged with civil crimes such as illegal possession of
 weapons. However, in some instances, the arrests appeared
 clearly related to the individual's political views although
 the Government denies that anyone is arrested or detained
 because of his or her political views.
 
 
 498
 In 1983, 127 persons included in the above totals were
 internally exiled for up to three months by administrative
 orders not subject to judicial review. Most were sent to
 distant villages as punishment for illegal political
 activities. External exile was not used in 1983, although the
 Government considers such action legal under Transitory Article
 24 of the 1980 Constitution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criticisms of the courts focusing on the general unwillingness
 of judges since 1973 to assert their independence from the
 Government lessened in 1983. The courts appear to be
 reasserting themselves and demanding a prompt accounting of
 detainees. Chile's civilian judges are career officials and
 most served in the judiciary before the present Government took
 power in 1973. First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution
 of proscribed political activities lies with regular civilian
 courts. As is common in Latin America, there is no trial by
 jury, and reliance is on the written record rather than oral
 testimony. A judge serves multiple functions:  as prosecutor,
 sometimes as defense attorney, and ultimately as the one who
 decides innocence or guilt. Decisions may be appealed up to
 the Supreme Court. Defendants have the rights of any Chilean
 citizen, including the right to legal counsel of their choice.
 Weapons violations, which often are the basis of charges
 against alleged subversives, are tried before a military
 court. Appeals may be made to a military court of two civilian
 judges and three professional military judges and, in the last
 result, to the Supreme Court. The 1981 decree granting
 jurisdiction over attacks on government personnel to a military
 tribunal--in which defendants' rights are limited--was invoked
 once in 1981, not at all in 1982, and in 1983 only for the
 accused assassins of the Santiago military Intendant and his
 two army bodyguards. This case has not yet come to trial as
 the constitutional legality of the decree is currently under
 appeal to the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private verbal or
 written communications are permitted by law provided that
 search warrants are issued by either a civilian or military
 court for specific locations. In connection with the lifting
 of the State of Emergency, regulations permitting Executive-
 ordered interference with private correspondence were
 repealed. Wiretapping is permitted subject to issuance of a
 judicial order. There are unsubstantiated allegations that
 security forces do not always comply with this requirement. At
 the same time, however, searches of homes continue to be
 carried out under general warrants issued by a civilian or
 military court. Human rights organizations report that in a
 number of searches, legal requirements, such as display of a
 warrant, were not observed. The Government does not jam
 foreign radio broadcasts. The distribution of foreign
 publications has rarely been delayed.
 
 
 499
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech in private discussions is the norm in Chile.
 Nevertheless, while the Constitution guarantees freedom of
 expression and of the press, the Government has exercised
 control of the media under the authority of Transitory Article
 24 of the Constitution and, prior to its lifting, under the
 "State of Emergency" decree. The Government, usually through
 informal channels, has on occasion practiced administrative
 censorship by advising print, radio, and television editors
 when it considered their coverage was too critical or promoted
 opposition objectives. To forestall such notification, self
 censorship is usually practiced by the media with most editors
 adopting a cautious approach to the formulation of commentary.
 The Government owns one newspaper, one radio network and the
 only truly nationwide television network. All other media are
 owned privately. All films must obtain approval from a film
 censorship board. Some films which are considered politically
 or morally objectionable are not permited to enter Chile or are
 censored.
 With the lifting of the "State of Emergency" on August 26, the
 Government removed a major obstacle to freedom of information
 in Chile by relinquishing most of its legal authority to
 restrict the publication or dissemination of information.
 Earlier, on June 26, the Government lifted the requirement for
 prior censorship of all new book manuscripts along with
 restrictions on the importation of books. As a result of this
 decision, several works previously denied publication or import
 rights appeared in Chilean bookstores. The Government under
 Transitory Article 24 retains power to require prior government
 authorization for the foundation and circulation of new
 periodical publications.
 During 1983 there was a marked increase in public criticism of
 high government officials and their conduct of policy,
 particularly in the economic area. Generally criticism of the
 Government was far more widespread in the radio and print media
 than on television. Media reporting on political activities
 also rose in 1983. Declarations by key opposition figures and
 official statements of their organizations now receive
 significant coverage.
 In May the Government temporarily closed a prominent opposition
 radio station for its coverage of the first of Chile's "national
 days of protest" and, for a period of time, prohibited the
 station from reporting on national events. Following the second
 "national day of protest" in June, the Government attempted to
 limit media reporting on the protests to descriptions of acts
 of vandalism which occurred in conjunction with the
 demonstrations. The Government also tried to curtail media
 coverage of statements by former politicians and political
 parties which have no legal status. The only official
 statement regarding this pressure on the media was a Ministry
 of Interior comment which advised the media to "respect the
 political recess." Since August, when the "State of Emergency"
 was lifted, both formal and informal pressures have eased.
 On August 24, two days before the end of the "State of
 Emergency", the Secretary General of the Government declared
 that there is "full press freedom in Chile," that the
 
 
 50
 Government "has no intention of applying administrative
 measures to the media" and that it would "only resort to
 existing legislation" in cases regarding the media. However,
 on September 16, 1983, a Chilean judge, acting on a complaint
 by the Ministry of Interior, ordered the arrest of a magazine
 editor and of a person interviewed by the magazine for
 "offenses against the authorities" and "inciting to riot" under
 provisions of the State Security Law of 1958. A subsequent
 complaint of "slandering the armed forces" was filed by the
 Ministry of Defense against the editor. Consistent with the
 Secretary General's statement, the Government did not apply
 administrative measures in the case. On December 13, a
 civilian court judge dismissed the Ministry of Interior charges*
 against the magazine editor. The charge filed by the Ministry
 of Defense against the editor is still pending before the
 military court. The interviewee was convicted by the civilian
 court of violating the 1958 State Security Law and was
 sentenced to 541 periods of night confinement. However, the
 sentence was overturned on appeal. Ministry of Defense charges
 against the interviewee were dismissed by the military court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In September, after five months of public protests, the right
 of freedom of assembly was restored. Although the Government
 retained the power to refuse parade permits, it did authorize
 some large opposition demonstrations. The Government has also
 introduced two more restrictive draft laws, one holding
 organizers of demonstrations responsible for violence and the
 second charging a clean-up fee based on the amount of space
 used.
 Many trade union rights, suspended after the military takeover
 in 1973, were reinstated in July 1979, by a series of decree
 laws known as the "labor plan". The trade union movement had
 little effective participation in the formulation of the labor
 plan and little influence in government decisions regarding
 implementation of the new labor code. Beginning in August
 1983, opposition labor organizations were given the opportunity
 to participate in a study of possible revisions of the labor
 plan but chose not to join mainly because they objected to the
 original labor plan which would remain the basis for any
 revisions.
 Under the labor plan, workers at units employing 25 or more
 individuals can form a union by majority vote and elect their
 officers from among their co-workers. Officers of trade union
 organizations (including federations and confederations) must
 be and continue to be employed in their jobs in a plant
 represented by their union but are legally entitled to
 specified paid time off for their union work. Collective
 bargaining is permitted at the plant level only. National
 confederations embracing more than one industry as well as
 unions at the local level embracing more than one employer have
 no legal standing although de facto nationwide confederations
 exist and their leaders sometimes meet with government
 officials. Federations and confederations are limited
 generally by law to providing technical assistance, education
 programs, and welfare and benefits activities for their
 affiliates. In fact, many are active politically, often in
 opposition to the Government.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 The right to strike, legal only during collective bargaining
 negotiations, is limited to 60 days, after which workers may be
 considered by their employers to have voluntarily resigned
 their jobs. The right to strike does not apply to designated
 strategic industries. In 1983, 48 firms, mostly public
 utilities, government copper mines, and the petroleum industry,
 were so listed. For these companies, failure to reach
 agreement during negotiations leads to binding arbitration.
 Management is legally permitted to hire strike breakers in all
 instances. Following the abolition of the labor courts in 1981,
 no special grievance procedure exists and all labor cases are
 handled by the regular courts.
 The civil service is allowed to form associations but not
 unions. It does not have the right to bargain collectively or
 to strike. The dockworkers' national unions, as previously
 constituted, and the union card, which severely restricted
 access to port jobs, were eliminated in 1982. National
 dockworkers' unions were replaced by small independent unions
 established in individual private companies which contract ship
 handling services. Professional.groups and association have
 not been limited by recent decree laws which were aimed at
 eliminating closed shop-type compulsory licensing privileges.
 Labor unions are permitted to maintain relations with
 non-Marxist international bodies in their fields. In 1983, the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) conference rejected a
 challenge to the credentials of the Chilean worker delegates,
 filed by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) in support of opposition labor groups in Chile. The
 challenge reflected, in part, the fact that Chile was among
 several countries cited by the ILO Committee on the Application
 of Labor Conventions and Recommendations for having failed to
 fully implement ILO labor conventions. One of the ad hoc
 umbrella labor organizations also alleged government violation
 of several conventions concerning employment, forced labor, and
 unemployment policies. The ILO governing body has established
 a committee to investigate the charges.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez, who had tried
 to establish a national union. In late 1983 lawyers for the
 Jimenez family reported that they had completed their
 investigation of the case and had submitted evidence obtained
 from a former CNI employee to the courts where it is currently
 under consideration. The evidence reportedly implicates the CNI
 in the murder.
 Individual labor leaders have sometimes been dismissed under
 circumstances suggesting that they lost their jobs because of
 criticism of management or of the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Chile, predominantly a Roman Catholic country, respects freedom
 of religion. A number of Protestant denominations and other
 groups are active and report full freedom and tolerance, as
 does the Jewish community.
 
 
 502
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 In 1983 the Government did not use external exile as a means of
 limiting political activity. An estimated 10,000 Chilean
 citizens who were accompanied by perhaps 20,000 dependents were
 exiled for political reasons since the 1973 military coup.
 Following the appointment by President Pinochet of a high-level
 commission for exiles in October 1982, the Government in 1983
 published lists of names of 3,591 exiles who would be allowed
 to return and added that dependents of all exiles could return
 at any time. Of those permitted to return, it is not known how
 many persons actually did so, how many may already have been in
 the country, are deceased, or were dependents rather than
 exiles. The Government simultaneously announced its intention
 to permit all exiles to return except those classified by the
 Government as "terrorists." By late 1983, however, the
 publication of repatriation lists had ceased and the Government
 reverted to the previous system of requiring individual exiles
 to apply at Chilean missions abroad for approval to return.
 However, in December the Government announced that
 approximately 500 additional exiles had been authorized to
 return under the new policy.
 Chileans are free to leave their country. As many as one
 million Chileans live abroad, principally for economic
 reasons. Most of them have resided for many years in
 Argentina. In the judgement of international organizations
 dealing with migrants, the volume of skilled and unskilled
 workers returning to Chile now roughly equals the number
 leaving. Most of the current emigrants seem to be motivated by
 economic rather than political factors.
 Chile has accepted a few refugees in recent years and makes
 regular, modest financial contributions to international
 organizations aiding refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Chile is ruled by a military junta headed by President
 Pinochet. In 1983 there were labor strikes leading to monthly
 "national days of protest" over the military government's
 intention pursuant to the 1980 Constitution to remain in power
 at least until the plebiscite in 1989. Democratic opposition
 groups established a coalition known as the Democratic Alliance
 and called for the resignation df President Pinochet, the
 formation of a constituent assembly to draft a new
 Constitution, and an early return to democracy. In August the
 new Minister of Interior agreed to discuss the opposition's
 demands with the exception of the call for the President's
 resignation. However, after three rounds the discussions
 between the Democratic Alliance and the Government broke down.
 At issue is the legitimacy of the 1980 Constitution and the
 transition schedule established in that document. In the
 September 1980 plebiscite, which approved the new Constitution
 by a two-thirds majority, there was universal suffrage and
 voting was required by law. While most observers believed that
 the results of the plebiscite reflected the will of the
 majority, opposition elements criticized the absence of
 electoral registers or other safeguards as well as restraints
 on the ability to publicize fully objections to the proposed
 Constitution.
 
 
 503
 According to the Constitution, a plebiscite will be held in
 1989 to accept or reject a junta-approved candidate for
 president. If approved, he will serve until 1997. If
 rejected, there will be open presidential elections in 1990.
 Congressional elections are also scheduled for 1990.
 Government spokesmen have indicated some willingness to
 consider a plebiscite to change the Constitution to advance the
 date for Congressional elections. However, according to the
 Constitution, which was approved in voting based on identity
 cards, any plebiscite to change the Constitution can only be
 held after publication of a new electoral law. If the
 plebiscite approves changing the Constitution to advance
 congressional elections, elections would then be set for a
 subsequent date. Government spokesmen have unofficially
 indicated that it would also require reestablishment of
 electoral registers which were destroyed in 1974. Meanwhile,
 the junta exercises legislative authority, subject to
 presidential approval. A Government-appointed body, the
 Council of State, is currently studying proposals for a new
 electoral law.
 The Council of State is also considering a new law on political
 parties. Partisan political activity remains legally banned in
 Chile, although in practice it has been tolerated and has
 notably increased since August 1983. In 1973, the 'Government
 declared illegal the parties forming the Popular Unity (Unidad
 Popular) political front and all other Marxist parties. A 1977
 decree law indefinitely recessed all remaining parties. Not-
 withstanding the formal ban on political activity, non-Marxist
 parties have long been able to operate openly on a limited
 basis. Prior to August 1983, Marxists found engaging in
 political activities were generally detained, expelled, or
 internally banished for violating the internal security law or
 the 1973 law prohibiting Marxist activity. Since August,
 however, they have been able to operate on a limited and open
 basis, including press conferences and interviews, as long as
 they do not advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.
 Student political activity also revived in 1983, with student
 ,leaders critical of the Government winning election at some
 campuses, although a 1981 law forbidding nearly all political
 activity in the country's state-supported universities remains
 in effect. In addition, the Government announced that five
 appointed military rectors would be replaced by civilian
 academics and promised that all universities would eventually
 have appointed civilian academic rectors.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In July 1978, the Government allowed members of an ad hoc
 working group of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) to visit Chile. After the group completed its work, a
 special rapporteur was appointed to sulit human rights reports
 on Chile to the Commission and to the United Nations General
 Assembly. The Government has informed U.N. authorities yearly
 since 1979 that it will not cooperate with the UNHRC's special
 rapporteur, contending that the special status given to Chile
 "has no legal or moral validity and is unjustifiable
 discrimination against Chile," a position supported in recent
 years by the U.S. and several other Latin American nations.
 The Government. has also refused to cooperate with the
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 33
 
 
 504
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission. Nevertheless, the
 Commission commented on several areas of concern in its 1982-83
 report. In 1978 and 1980, the Government allowed visits by
 missions from the International Labor Organization (ILO) to
 check on alleged abuses of trade union rights, particularly
 freedom of association. While the allegations remain pending,
 ILO reports specifically noted the cooperation of the Chilean
 government in the investigations.
 Since the 1973 military takeover, the Intergovernmental
 Committee for Migration (ICM) has been active in Chile,
 conducting a program giving prisoners convicted of politically
 related offenses an opportunity to go into exile rather than
 remain in prison. In recent years, the ICM has been involved
 in helping some migrants, mainly economic ones, to return.
 The Lawyer's Committee for International Human Rights and other
 non-governmental organizations have expressed special concern
 about Chile. Amnesty International, in its 1983 report,
 expressed concern over the complaints of torture of detainees
 by security forces which were submitted to the courts in 1982,
 the detention of demonstrators, the banishment without trial of
 66 persons, and the failure to account for those persons who
 disappeared in the period 1973-77. Although the Government
 contends that virtually all of the reports produced by these
 foreign organizations exaggerate or deliberately distort the
 scope and volume of abuses, it has permitted visits by their
 representatives. International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) representatives also regularly visit Chile to check on
 prison conditions. Freedom House, in its 1983 report, gave a
 "partly free" rating to Chile.
 The Catholic Church since 1973 has taken the lead in defending
 human rights and supplying legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to alleged victims of human
 rights abuses. The Church's human rights group, the Vicariate
 of Solidarity, monitors the human rights situations from Church
 offices throughout Chile and issues monthly reports. The
 Vicariate has protected and defended significant numbers of
 people since 1973. Its activities have resulted in visible but
 now lessening tensions between the Government and the Church
 hierarchy. Some Church activists and human rights lawyers were
 anonymously threatened during 1983, but such incidents
 apparently declined toward the end of 1983.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, a private organization,
 has also publicized alleged abuses and spoken out strongly
 against them, besides issuing monthly reports on the human
 rights situation in Chile. It and the other human rights groups
 operate openly in Chile. In August 1983 the Commission's
 president, Jaime Castillo, was allowed to return following two
 years of government-forced exile.
 The Vicariate of Solidarity, despite having some active
 political figures on its staff, maintains a posture of being
 concerned only with human rights and publicly offers no
 specifically political opinions. The Chilean Commission for
 Human Rights, on the other hand, openly devotes its efforts not
 only to human rights issues but to bringing about major changes
 in the nature of the Government.

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 While real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) did not grow in 1983,
 preliminary evidence emerged in late 1983 of a modest economic
 recovery from the drastic economic deterioration which Chile
 experienced since late 1981. That deterioration was due to a
 combination of factors including pegging the peso to the dollar
 in an effort to bring down inflation, mandatory wage
 indexation, and the international recession.
 Chile signed a two-year stand-by and compensatory financing
 facility with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January
 1983. Notwithstanding the agreement with the IMF to limit
 public sector expenditures, the Government has expanded public
 works programs to bring down unemployment, which in the period
 September-November 1983 was officially 15.9 percent, down from
 a high of 25 percent in late 1982.
 Two public works programs absorb a significant portion of the
 unemployed labor force at wage rates reflecting the social
 welfare character of the programs. The Government has
 increased spending on social programs, such as unemployment
 compensation, and created a work program for heads of household
 in addition to the existing Minimum Employment Program. As
 part of the nonwage benefits of the work programs, families
 also receive subsidies for children less than eight years old,
 as well as some medical coverage. As of November 1983, workers
 in both programs totalled 13.6 percent of the workforce. (Some
 of the persons in the programs are accounted for in the
 unemployment statistics.)  To reduce the level of unemployment,
 the government also continued low-income housing programs,
 stepped-up public works projects in the second half of 1983 and
 provided financial credits to retain or hire new workers in
 private firms.
 Chile's social service network is extensive. In 1982, 59.4
 percent of all budget expenditures went to social services,
 with welfare accounting for 22.9 percent of the social service
 sub-total, education 29.7 percent, and pension and unemployment
 support 33.2 percent. The Government focuses its social
 programs on the poor and it has set the elimination of "extreme
 poverty" as a primary objective. Estimates of Chileans living
 below the absolute poverty level range from 14 to 23 percent of
 the population.
 Health and nutrition programs in Chile have resulted in a
 decline in the level of malnutrition in children under six
 years of age to 8.8 percent in 1982. Infant mortality rates
 declined to 23.4 per 1,000 live births in 1982. Newborn
 mortality rates declined to 12 per 1,000 live births in 1982.
 Average life expectancy at birth increased to 67.5 years. The
 number of doctors per 1,000 inhabitants grew to 10.0 in 1981.
 In 1977, the Chilean calorie supply as a percentage of
 nutritional requirements was 109.8 percent. In 1979, 83.6
 percent of the population enjoyed access to safe water.
 Government funding for education is high, particularly for
 primary and university levels. Government spending on
 education totalled $1.212 billion in 1982. The primary school
 enrollment ratio equalled 119 percent in 1979. The adult
 literacy rate rose to 94.2 percent in 1980. The Government
 started a special adult literacy campaign in 1980 to reduce the
 illiteracy rate to five percent.

 Some legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. For
 example, the legal retirement age for women is five years lower
 than that for men. A married woman may not conduct commercial
 transactions unless a separation of property contract is
 established at the time of marriage. In addition, a married
 woman may not take children out of the country without the
 permission of the father. Nonetheless, the role of women,
 which is shaped largely by the Latin cultural tradition, has
 evolved gradually over the years, and women now enjoy greater
 access to education and employment than in the past. In 1979,
 the primary school enrollment ratios for females and males was
 practically equal. The female literacy rate of 87.2 percent in
 1970 was almost as high as the 88.9 percent male rate. In
 1981, 40.6 percent of all university students were women.
 Women have served as ministers and mayors.   Middle and upper
 class women usually have good access to entry-level
 professional jobs, but they do not hold a proportional number
 of upper-level positions.
 Minority groups do not suffer from legal discrimination. The
 only significant minority group, the Mapuche Indians, remains
 largely separate from the rest of the society because of
 cultural, educational, and geographical factors rather than
 official policy. In general, the Government's policy has been
 to try to gradually integrate this group into the rest of
 society.
