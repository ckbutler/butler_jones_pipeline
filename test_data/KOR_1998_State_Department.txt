 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected president and a unicam-
 eral legislature selected by both direct and proportional voting. Kim Dae Jung was
 elected president in a free and fair election in December 1997 and was inaugurated
 in February. The judiciary operates independently of the executive branch.
 Responsibility lor maintaining internal security lies with the National Security
 Planning Agency (NSP), the Korean National Police (KNP), and the Defense Secu-
 rity Command (DSC). Legislation passed in 1993 restricts the NSP and DSC from
 interfering in domestic politics and grants the NSP investigative authority only in
 cases involving terrorism, espionage, and international crime organizations. The
 Government revised this law in 1996 to allow the NSP to investigate members of
 domestic organizations that are viewed as supporting the North Korean Govern-
 ment. There continued to be credible reports that some members of the security
 forces were responsible for occasional human rights abuses.
 After a long period of sustained growth in gross domestic product (GDP) averag-
 ing about 9 percent per year, the economy slowed in 1996 and 1997. In November
 1997, the country entered a severe foreign, exchange liquidity crisis. The Govern-
 ment reached agreement on a financial package with the International Monetary
 Fund in December 1997, which helped stabilize the won and allowed the country
 to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves. The Government also took significant steps
 to open the economy and attract foreign investment. However, the impact of the fi-
 nancial crisis, necessary financial and corporate restructuring, and sluggish econo-
 mies in major regional trading partners have caused rising corporate bankruptcies
 and unemployment. GDP is expected to decline by at least 5 percent in 1998.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. The use or threatened use of the National Secu-
 rity Law (NSL) continued to infringe upon citizen's civil liberties, including the right
 to free expression. There was no progress toward reform of the NSL, but in Septem-
 ber President Kim promised visiting Amnesty International Secretary General
 Pierre Sane that he would revise the NSL before too long. In July the Government
 announced repeal of the system under which prisoners arrested under the NSL had
 to renounce their real or alleged Communist beliefs in order to receive parole. While
 this was a significant step forward for the new Government, prisoners still had to
 promise in writing to obey the law, including the controversial NSL, and recognize
 the Republic of Korea. A total of 103 prisoners were freed in the August 15 amnesty
 
 
 963
 by submitting such written promises. (An official figure for the number of prisoners
 who refused to submit written promises was unavailable.). The MOJ continued to
 implement guidelines requiring that suspects be told at the time of arrest of their
 right to remain silent and their right to a lawyer. Nevertheless, credible sources re-
 ported instances in which police subjected detainees to verbal and physical abuse,
 although human rights groups report that such cases have declined considerably.
 Women continued to face legal and societal discrimination. President Kim, a long-
 time democracy and human rights activist, has stated repeatedly that promoting the
 rights of women would be a priority goal. Violence against women and physical
 abuse remain serious problems, and to combat these the Government in July en-
 acted the the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Victim Protection Act which de-
 fines domestic violence as a serious crime. Women's groups praised this law as a
 significant step forward in combating domestic violence. There is still insufficient
 legal redress for these problems. Ethnic minorities, very small in number, face legal
 and societal discrimination. Although labor statutes were revised to expand freedom
 of association, they remained below international standards in some respects.
 The Government continued to require released political prisoners to make regular
 reports to the police under the Social Surveillance Law, and it still has not author-
 ized independent investigations of the cases of some prisoners who received sen-
 tences on charges believed to have been fabricated by previous governments. Some
 of these prisoners reportedly were subjected to torture to extract confessions and re-
 ceived trials that did not meet international standards of fairness.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits mistreatment of suspects; the Government has ordered in-
 vestigating authorities to protect the human rights of suspects; and allegations of
 abuse by authorities of those in custody for questioning continued to decline. None-
 theless, prosecutors continued to place much emphasis on securing convictions
 through confessions, this is driven by cultural factors, which see confession as a nec-
 essary prelude to reform. The Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained after a
 suspect had been deprived of sleep during an interrogation could not be used in
 court. In spite of the court ruling and government directives discouraging sleep dep-
 rivation as a technique for obtaining confessions, there continued to be reports of
 police questioning suspects through the night. Credible sources also reported that
 in some cases police verbally or physically abused suspects, including beatings,
 threats, and sexual intimidation in the course of arrest and police interrogation.
 However, human rights groups report that such cases have declined considerably.
 In October during their trial three defendants, accused of a plot to bring about
 a North Korean military provocation in order to ensure the election of the candidate
 of the Grand National Party in 1997 alleged that they were tortured into confessing
 by NSP agents. The Prosecutors Office is investigating the allegations.
 Former detainees who claimed that officials of past military governments had tor-
 tured them continued to request compensation. However, the Government has not
 provided an effective mechanism for redress, such as an independent body to inves-
 tigate complaints of past human rights violations. Officials accused of abuse or har-
 assment of suspects rarely have been prosecuted.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. Prison diets are adequate, but the facilities offer
 little protection against cold in winter and heat in the summer. Some prisoners
 claim that these conditions damaged their health and that medical care has been
 inadequate. Inmates occasionally have criticized guards for using excessive force or
 needlessly putting prisoners in manacles. Inmate access to reading materials and
 television broadcasts has improved significantly in recent years. Authorities an-
 nounced in June that visitors could schedule appointments with prisoners by tele-
 phone or fax and expanded the number of prisons in which exemplary inmates could
 use public phones from 4 to 24.
 There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions, although representa-
 tives of human rights groups may visit certain prisoners at the discretion of the
 prison warden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law is often vague, and prosecutors
 have wide latitude to interpret the law. The NSL defines espionage in broad terms
 and permits the authorities to detain and arrest persons who commit acts viewed
 as supportive of North Korea and therefore dangerous to the Republic of Korea. Au-
 
 
 thorities arrested not only persons spying on behalf of North Korea but also those
 who praised North Korea, its former leader Kim I1 Sung, or its "self-reliance"
 ("juche") political philosophy. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has
 termed the NSL "a major obstacle to the full realization of the rights enshrined in
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." According to Ministry of
 Justice figures, 583 persons were charged with violating the NSL through November
 30. Of these 429 were detained, with the remainder charged without detention.
 These figures represent a 14.5 percent decrease in the number of persons charged
 and a 29.6 percent decrease in the number of persons detained during the same pe-
 riod in 1997.
 The NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of anyone who "with the
 knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State or the basic
 order of free democracy, praised, encouraged, propagandized for, or sided with the
 activities of an antistate organization." The legal standard for knowing that one
 might endanger the security of the State is vague. Consequently, a number of Kore-
 ans have been-arrested for what appeared to be the peaceful expression of opposing
 views, which the authorities apparently considered pro-North Korean or antistate
 views. For example, Duksung University student Kim Eun Hee was arrested in
 1997 for posting a unification greeting from North Koreans on a college bulletin
 board. She was convicted under the NSL and given a suspended sentence. In August
 Catholic priest Moon Kyu Hyun was arrested on charges of violating the NSL, after
 he returned from North Korea. On October 20, he was released on bail; at year's
 end his trial was still underway. Although he had received permission from the Gov-
 ernment to travel to North Korea, prosecutors alleged that Father Moon praised
 Kim I1 Sung in a North Korean visitors book and participated in a North Korean-
 sponsored reunification festival in Panmunjom. The eight other priests who traveled
 with Father Moon were not arrested.
 The Government's rationale for retaining the NSL is that North Korea is actively
 trying to subvert the Government and society, and that due to this special cir-
 cumstance, some forms of expression must be limited to block the greater danger
 to freedom and democracy posed by totalitarianism. The effect sometimes is to re-
 lieve the Government of the burden of proof in a court of law that any particular
 speech or action in fact does threaten the nation's security. For example, the Gov-
 ernment has prosecuted citizens for unauthorized travel to North Korea (see Section
 2.d.). In 1997 novelist Kim Ha Ki was convicted under the NSL after making a trip
 to North Korea in July 1996, but he was pardoned on the occasion of the President's
 inauguration.
 The Criminal Code requires warrants to be issued by judges in cases of arrest,
 detention, seizure, or search, except if the person is apprehended while committing
 a criminal act, or if a judge is not available and the authorities believe the suspect
 may destroy evidence or escape capture if not quickly arrested. In such emergency
 cases, judges must issue arrest warrants within 48 hours after apprehension, or, if
 a court is not located in the same county, within 72 hours. Police may detain sus-
 pects who voluntarily come in for questioning for up to 6 hours, but must notify the
 suspects' families. The police generally respected these legal requirements.
 The standards for issuing warrants were tightened in 1997, but following com-
 laints from prosecutors that the new system was administratively cumbersome, the
 National Assembly voted to amend the rules to ease standards for issuing warrants.
 Authorities normally must release suspects after 30 days unless an indictment is
 issued. Hence, detainees are a relatively small percentage of the total prison popu-
 lation.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to representation by an attor-
 ney, but lawyers are not allowed to be present during police interrogation.
 The Government began in 1993 to permit suspects to consult with "duty lawyers"
 during breaks in interrogation. These duty lawyers are hired and paid by the indi-
 vidual suspects, but often bill at reduced fees as a public service. The Justice Min-
 istry also issued guidelines in 1995 requiring police to inform suspects at the time
 of arrest about their right to be represented by a lawyer, and there were no reports
 of access to legal counsel being denied. There is a bail system, but human rights
 lawyers say that bail generally is not granted when detainees are charged with com-
 mitting serious offenses.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The President appoints the Chief Justice and most justices of the Constitu-
 tional Court. Although judges do not receive life appointments, they cannot be fired
 or transferred for political reasons. In recent years, the judiciary has shown increas-
 ing independence. Judges in some district courts have ruled, for example, that activ-
 ists' exchange of faxes with North Korean students or meetings with North Korean
 
 
 representatives in third countries were not, in themselves, sufficient grounds to con-
 vict them of violating the NSL, contrary to prosecutors' assertions.
 Local courts are presided over by judges who render verdicts in all cases. There
 is no trial by jury. Defendants can appeal a verdict to a district appeals court and
 to the Supreme Court. Constitutional challenges can be taken to the Constitutional
 Court, which was created in 1988.
 The Constitution provides defendants with a number of rights in criminal trials
 including the presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, free-
 dom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the
 right of appeal. When a person is detained physically, the initial trial must be com-
 pleted within 6 months of arrest. These rights generally are observed. Trials are
 open to the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he believes spectators
 may seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense. Cases involving national security and criminal matters
 are tried by the same courts. Although convictions rarely are overturned, appeals
 often result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are appealed automatically.
 Human rights groups believe that many dissidents tried under past military gov-
 ernments during the 1970's and 1980's were sentenced to long prison terms on
 trumped-up charges of spying for North Korea. Furthermore, these persons, dozens
 of whom are still in jail, reportedly had been held incommunicado for up to 60 days
 after their arrest, subjected to extreme forms of torture, forced to make "confes-
 sions," and convicted after trials that did not conform to international standards for
 a fair trial. In July the Government announced repeal of the system by which pris-
 oners had to renounce their real or alleged communist beliefs in order to receive pa-
 role. While this was a significant step forward for the new Government, under the
 new system prisoners still must in writing promise to obey the law and recognize
 the Republic of Korea in order to receive parole. A total of 103 prisoners were freed
 in the August 15 amnesty by submitting such written promises. (An official figure
 for the number of prisoners who refused to submit written promises was unavail-
 able.) Human rights groups criticized the new system on the grounds that requiring
 a promise to obey the law, which included the NSL, was tantamount to forcing citi-
 zens to renounce their beliefs. Some released political prisoners were required to re-
 port their activities regularly to the police.
 Also on the occasion of the Independence Day amnesty, the Government granted
 pardons to 12 former army generals who were close to former presidents Chun Doo
 Hwan and Roh Tae Woo and were convicted for their involvement in the December
 12, 1979 coup and the May 18, 1980 Kwangju incident. On the occasion of President
 Kim's inauguration, the Government granted amnesty to 74 violators of the NSL.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the rights of free
 speech or association or were detained for committing acts of violence or espionage.
 Some human rights monitors estimate the number of political prisoners at around
 300. However, these monitors' definition of political prisoner often includes all per-
 sons imprisoned for politically motivated acts, without distinction as to whether the
 acts themselves included violence or other criminal behavior. The number of politi-
 cal prisoners and detainees as defined by international standards appears to num-
 ber under 200.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance, including wiretaps, of
 political dissidents. The 1995 Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the NSP were
 designed to curb government surveillance of civilians, and largely appear to have
 succeeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad conditions under which the monitor-
 ing of telephone calls, mail, and other forms of communication are legal. It requires
 government officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in
 the event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms
 for those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable
 amount of illegal wiretapping still is taking place, and they assert that the lack of
 an independent-body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps
 hinders the effectiveness of the Antiwiretap ing Law.
 On December 31, opposition lawmakers broke into the NSP liaison office in the
 National Assembly building, and removed documents that they claimed substan-
 tiated allegations that the office was being used to conduct surveillance of National
 Assembly members.
 Citizens are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or read
 books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are doing
 
 
 so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausible claims
 that government informants are posted around university campuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While most political discourse is unrestricted,
 under the NSL the Government limits the expression of ideas that authorities con-
 sider Communist or pro-North Korean. Broad interpretations of the NSL allow for
 restrictions on the peaceful expression of dissenting views.
 Although the Government has abandoned direct control over the news media, it
 continues to exercise indirect influence. Some officials reportedly lobby journalists
 aggressively to discourage them from writing stories critical of the Government, al-
 though this practice reportedly has declined significantly. Newspapers played an in-
 strumental role in 1997 in bringing to light political influence peddling associated
 with Hanbo Steel, which resulted in jail sentences for many senior government offi-
 cials and political figures including a son of former President Kim Young Sam. Nev-
 ertheless, the latent threat of tax investigations against parent media companies
 and government pressure on advertisers is still widely believed to encourage news-
 papers and broadcasters to soften criticism. Moreover, while the Government's
 anticorruption campaign curtailed politicians' payments of money to reporters, it did
 not eliminate them. Yevertheless, press criticism of the Government is extensive in
 all fields, and authorities have not used repressive measures to stop media report-
 ing. Many radio and television stations are state supported, but they maintain a
 considerable degree of editorial independence in their news coverage.
 Journalists allege that the libel laws are used to harass publications for articles
 that are unflattering but not necessarily untrue, and some journalists have been ar-
 rested and jailed for libel. For example, in December 1997 a foreign journalist of
 Korean ancestry was arrested on libel charges for reporting in a story that a local
 newspaper was in financial trouble and would be taken over by a large conglom-
 erate. He was released 3 weeks later. In February a Seoul court ruled that the jour-
 nalist had to pay damages of $2,500 (3 million won) to the newspaper.
 Prosecutors continued to indict dissidents under the NSL for producing, selling,
 or distributing pro-North Korean or pro-Communist materials. Court precedents
 allow citizens to possess these kinds of publications for purely academic use, profit,
 or curiosity, but not with the intent of subverting the State. Prosecutors have wide
 discretion in determining motives for possessing or publishing such material.
 The Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, substantial media cov-
 erage of North Korea. Television networks continued to broadcast edited versions of
 North Korean television programs, and reported extensively on United States and
 South Korean talks with North Korean officials. In September a television station
 received permission for the first time to broadcast a North Korean-produced film.
 The Government Censorship Board, which screens movies for sexual or violent
 content, has followed more liberal guidelines in recent years and allowed a broader
 range of films to be released.
 In 1997 Suh Jun Shik, the publisher of a daily human rights newsletter in Seoul,
 was arrested along with several other activists under the NSL for attempting to
 screen an allegedly pro-North Korean movie. His case still was awaiting trial at
 year's end..
 In 1994 authorities began investigating eight Kyongsang University professors on
 the grounds that their textbook on Korean society endorsed North Korean ideology.
 This investigation was regarded by much of the scholarly community as a serious
 infringement of academic freedom. However, prosecutors who sought to arrest sev-
 eral of the professors under the NSL were denied warrants by a judge who con-
 cluded that authorities had not provided evidence of the scholars' pro-Communist
 activities. This investigation has been closed, and no instances of prosecution for
 scholarly writing were reported during the year. However, student groups plausibly
 report the presence of government informants on university campuses (see Section
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine public order.
 The law forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authori-
 ties and requires that the police be notified in advance of demonstrations of all
 types, including political rallies. Police must notify organizers if they consider the
 event impermissible under this law.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and there are no registration
 requirements. Associations, except those whose aim is deemed by the Government
 tobe the overthrow of the State, operate freely.
 c. Freedom of Religio.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice.
 
 
 967
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens are allowed to move freely throughout the country, but
 police may restrict the movements of some former prisoners. Foreign travel gen-
 erally is unrestricted, but the Government must approve travel to North Korea. To
 obtain approval, potential visitors must demonstrate that their trip does not have
 a political purpose-that is, to praise North Korea or criticize the South Korean
 Government. During the year, the Government took significant steps to expand con-
 tacts between South and North Koreans, granting permission to the Hyundai Group
 to develop a tourist destination in North Korea that could be visited by South Ko-
 rean citizens, allowing civic and religious groups to visit North Korea to discuss aid
 delivery and distribution, and granting permission to advertising companies to film
 advertisements in North Korea. However, travelers to North Korea who do not re-
 ceive government permission are likely to be arrested upon their return to South
 Korea. For example, novelist Kim Ha Ki, who traveled to the North in 1996, was
 sentenced in 1997 to 3V years in prison, but was pardoned on the occasion of the
 President's inauguration. The court held that the novelist revealed state secrets to
 North Korean authorities during his visit.
 In the past, the Government forbade some Koreans convicted of politically related
 crimes from returning to Korea, and some citizens still face sanctions if they return.
 In 1994 the NSP lifted the entry ban on composer Yun I Sang, a dissident who had
 been living in Berlin for many years. However, the Government required that he
 refrain from any political activity while in Korea and that he give an accounting
 of his political activities overseas before authorities would allow him into the coun-
 try. Yun refused these conditions and decided against returning to South Korea. He
 died abroad in 1995.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Government
 guidelines provide for offering temporary refuge in the case of a mass influx of asy-
 um  seekers. However, the issue of provision of first asylum did not arise during
 the year. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they
 had a fear of persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to elect their own government. The Constitution, as
 amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for a mixed
 system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral National
 Assembly. The President serves a single 5-year term and may not be reelected. The
 National Assembly's term is 4 years. All citizens 20 years of age or above have the
 right to vote, and elections are held by secret ballot.
 Because of cultural traditions and discrimination, women occupy few important
 positions in government. There are two women in the Cabinet, the Minister of
 Health and Welfare and the Minister of Culture and Tourism. Eleven female legisla-
 tors were elected to the 299-seat National Assembly, one of whom chairs a special
 committee on women's affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights, and they operate without government restriction. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, Sarangbang, the Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the National Council of Churches in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, Peo-
 ple's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy,. and '"Mingahyup," an association of the
 families of political prisoners. These groups publish reports on the human rights sit-
 uation in Korea and make their views known both inside and outside the country.
 Government officials generally have been willing to meet with international human
 rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and equal opportunity statutes forbid discrimination on the
 basis of race, sex, religion, disability, or social status, and the Government respects
 these provisions. However, traditional attitudes limit opportunities for women and
 the disabled. Ethnic minorities, very small in number, face both legal and societal
 discrimination.
 Women.-Violence against women remains a problem, and some women's rights
 groups maintain that such violence, including spousal abuse, has worsened with the
 recent decline of the economy. A 1997 survey found that 31.4 percent of households
 had seen incidents of domestic violence. In July the Government enacted the Pre-
 
 
 968
 
 vention of Domestic Violence and Victim Protection Act, which defines domestic vio-
 lence as a serious crime. Authorities can order offenders to stay away from victims
 for up to 6 months and to be put under probation or to see court-designated coun-
 selors. The law also requires police to respond immediately to reports of domestic
 violence. Women's groups praised the law as a significant step forward in combating
 domestic violence.
 Rape remained a serious problem, with 6,293 cases reported in 1997 (the last year
 for which statistics are available). Many incidents of rape go unreported because of
 the stigma associated with being a rape victim. The activities of a number of wom-
 en's groups have increased awareness of the importance of reporting and prosecut-
 ing rapes, as well as offenses such as sexual harassment in the workplace. Accord-
 ing to women's rights groups, cases involving sexual harassment or rape generally
 go unprosecuted, and perpetrators, if convicted, often receive very light sentences.
 The amended Family Law, which went into effect in 1991, permits women to head
 a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's property, and al-
 lows a woman to maintain greater contact with her offspring after a divorce. Al-
 though the revisions helped abused women, divorce remains a social taboo, and
 there is little government or private assistance for divorced women. These factors,
 plus the fact that divorced women have limited employment opportunities and have
 difficulty remarrying, leads some women to stay in abusive situations. The Govern-
 ment has created some shelters for battered women and increased the number of
 child care facilities, giving women in abusive situations more options, but women's
 rights groups say that they fall far short of effectively dealing with the problem.
 A conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to men socially
 and economically. Despite the passage of equal employment opportunity legislation
 in 1988, few women work as company executives, and sexual discrimination in the
 workplace remains a problem. Moreover, some government agencies' preferential
 hiring of applicants with military service (nearly always men) point to continued
 legal barriers against women. However, there are means for women to seek redress
 for sexual discrimination. For example, in January two women at a construction
 company who received dismissal notices whlle on maternity leave filed protests with
 the Ministry of Labor and had their jobs reinstated. Women have full access to edu-
 cation, and social mores and attitudes gradually have begun to change. The major
 political parties, for example, are making more efforts to recruit women; the Min-
 istry of Women's Affairs continued its efforts to expand employment opportunities;
 and the military and service academies continued to expand opportunities for
 women.
 In April the Government decided to pay each of 152 identified Korean "comfort
 women" (women who, during World War II, were forced to provide sex to soldiers
 of the Japanese Imperial Government) $22,000 (won 38 million) and announced that
 it would seek no compensation from the Government of Japan. In announcing this
 decision, the Government also called for an official Japanese Government apology.
 Children.-The Government provides high-quality elementary education to all
 children free of charge, and most obtain a good secondary education. High-quality
 health care facilities are widely available to children.
 Child abuse does not appear to be a significant problem, but it has not been stud-
 ied extensively, and statistics on such abuse are limited. A total of 136 cases were
 reported during the year. Although experts believe that a number of cases go unre-
 ported, instances of child abuse still appear to be relatively rare. The Seoul metro-
 politan government runs a children's counseling center, which investigates reports
 of abuse, counsels families, and cares for runaway children. Prior to 1998 there was
 no specific law against child abuse; however, the new Prevention of Domestic Vio-
 lence and Victim Prevention Act, which defines domestic violence as a serious crime,
 allows a child to bring charges against his mother or father in cases of abuse. The
 authorities announced in April that people buying sex from minors would automati-
 cally be arrested on rape charges and would face prison terms of up to 3 years. In
 cases of children under age 13, the authorities said that it would pursue the law
 even more vigorously. The National Assembly is proceeding with the development
 of additional legislation in this area.
 The traditional preference for male children continues, although it is less evident
 among people in their twenties and thirties. Although the law bans fetal testing ex-
 cept for those cases when a woman's ife is in danger, a hereditary disease would
 be passed along, or in case of rape or incest, such testing and the subsequent termi-
 nation of pregnancies with female fetuses frequently occur. The Government has ex-
 pressed concern about the widening disparity in male and female birth rates.
 People With Disabilities.-Although measures aimed at creating opportunities for
 the disabled have been taken, public facilities for their everyday care and use re-
 
 
 969
 mained inadequate. However, there is no legal discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services.
 In 1995 the Government expanded job training programs, medical benefits, and
 welfare facilities for disabled citizens. Since 1991 firms with over 300 employees
 have been required by law either to hire disabled workers or pay a fee. Surveys indi-
 cate that most companies either paid the fee or evaded the law. After human rights
 groups had publicized one such survey in 1996, the Labor Ministry increased the
 subsidies provided to companies that hire the disabled. Nonetheless, hiring of the
 disabled remains below target levels. The disabled make up 0.46 percent of the total
 work force. New public buildings are required to include facilities for the disabled,
 such as a ramp access to entrances, a wheelchair lift, and special parking spaces.
 The Health and Welfare Ministry has announced that existing government buildings
 must be retrofitted with these facilities over the next 7 years.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant size. Citizenship is based
 on blood, not location of birth, and Koreans must show as proof their family geneal-
 ogy. Thus, ethnic Chinese born and resident in Korea cannot obtain citizenship or
 become public servants, and may have difficulty being hired by some major corpora-
 tions. Due to legal as well as societal discrimination, many ethnic Chinese have emi-
 grated to other countries since the 1970's. There are a pproximately 20,000 ethnic
 Chinese, who represent 0.05 percent of the population. The Government passed leg-
 islation in June to allow a Korean woman to transmit citizenship to her child re-
 gardless of the citizenship of the child's father. Amerasians face no legal discrimina-
 tion, but informal discrimination is prevalent, making it more difficult for them to
 succeed in academia, business, or government.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of public sector employees and teachers, the right to free association. However, the
 Government passed legislation to allow government workers to form workplace
 councils, beginning in 1999. In the government sector, unions are restricted to orga-
 nizing blue-collar workers in such agencies as the postal service, railways, tele-
 communications, and the national medical center. As few as two employees may
 form a union. Until 1997 the Trade Union Law specified that only one union was
 permitted at each workplace. However, labor law changes in 1997 authorize the for-
 mation of competing unions from the year 2002. All unions are required to notify
 the authorities when formed or dissolved. About 10 percent of workers belong to a
 union.
 In the past, the Government did not recognize formally labor federations that
 were not affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor groupings-the
 Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Independent Korean Federa-
 tion of Clerical and Financial Workers. In the past several years, however, the
 Labor Ministry officially recognized some independent white-collar federations rep-
 resenting hospital workers, journalists, and office workers at construction firms and
 government research institutes. The courts ruled in 1992 that affiliation with the
 FKTU was not required to be registered as a legal labor federation. In 1997 the Na-
 tional Assembly passed a labor reform bill that cleared the way to authorize dis-
 sident federations, such as the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).
 However, the KCTU allowed the outlawed teachers union to affiliate with it, and
 consequently the Government refused to grant it official authorization. In practice
 labor federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry have operated with-
 out government interference.
 The Government arrested and tried unionists who allegedly instigated violent
 strikes or illegally disrupted normal business operations. though there were sev-
 eral large general strikes, the Government did not punish unionists for their partici-
 pation in these general strikes. The Government also did not punish bank workers
 who went on strike in July to protest the forced closure of their banks.
 The Government retained the ban on teachers unions, arguing that organizations
 such as the Korean Teachers Union (Chonkyojo) are essentially political organiza-
 tions with radical aims. Several teachers were suspended temporarily from their
 jobs because they were union leaders.
 Labor laws prohibiting political activities by unions were rescinded in 1997. Elec-
 tion laws that apply to other social organizations regulate unions. These regulations
 p rohibit donations by unions (and other social organizations) to political parties.
 Some trade unionists have temporarily resigned from their union posts to run for
 office.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, unions in enterprises determined to be of "essential public inter-
 
 
 970
 est," including public transportation, utilities, public health, banking, and tele-
 communications, can be ordered to submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu
 of striking. However, in practice the Government rarely imposes arbitration. The
 number of labor disputes has declined in recent years. According to Labor Ministry
 statistics, about 80 strikes occurred in 1997, the last year for which complete data
 are available. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act requires unions to notify the
 Labor Ministry of their intention to strike, and it mandates a 10-day "cooling-off pe-
 riod" before a work stoppage may legally begin, 15 days in public interest sectors.
 Labor laws prohibit retribution against workers who have conducted a legal strike
 and allow workers to file complaints of unfair labor practices against employers.
 The FKTU and KCTU are affiliated with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU). Most of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain af-
 filiations with international trade secretariats, as does the KCTU Metalworkers
 Council. In 1997 the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom
 of Association criticized some aspects of the labor laws, such as the prohibition on
 organizing unions for teachers and government employees.
 In recent years, the Government has cultivated a more neutral stance in labor dis-
 putes. Striking workers shut down the Hyundai Motors' auto plant in Ulsan in Au-
 gust, and although the Government threatened to use police to clear out the work-
 ers, labor and management settled their dispute peacefully. Unlike in previous
 years, there were no reports that employer-hired squads assaulted workers in 1998.
 South Korea was reinstated in June to the Overseas Private Investment Corpora-
 tion's (OPIC) insurance programs, which had been suspended since 1991 on worker
 rights grounds.
 b.The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law provide for the right of workers to collective bargaining and collec-
 tive action. This law also empowers workers to file complaints of unfair labor prac-
 tices against employers who interfere with union organizing or practice discrimina-
 tion against union members. Employers found guilty of unfair practices can be re-
 quired to reinstate workers who were fired for union activities.
 Extensive collective bargaining is practiced, even with unions whose federations
 are not recognized legally by the Government. The labor laws do not extend the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to teachers, defense industry workers, or
 government employees, (although the Government did pass legislation to allow gov-
 ernment workers to form workplace councils beginning in 1999), including workers
 at state- or publicly-run enterprises.
 There is no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiautonomous agency of theLabor Ministry that adjudicates dis-
 putes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is composed of equal numbers of representatives of labor and management, plus
 neutral experts who represent the "public interest." Local labor commissions are em-
 powered to decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices
 and to mediate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. Arbitration can be
 made compulsory in sectors of the economy (e.g., utilities and transportation) that
 are deemed essential to public welfare.
 In February the Government established the Tripartite Commission, with rep-
 resentatives from labor, management, and the Government, to deal with labor
 issues related to the economic downturn. The work of the Commission made it legal
 for companies to lay off workers due to economic hardship and authorized temporary
 manpower agencies.
 In the past, regulations forbade intervention in disputes by so-called third-parties,
 such as labor federations not recognized by the Government. Labor laws were re-
 vised in 1997 to lift the ban on third-party intervention and allow dissident federa-
 tions to assist member unions involvedin a strike.
 Enterprises in the two export processing zones (EPZ's) had been designated by the
 Government as public interest enterprises. Workers in these enterprises, whose
 rights to organize were formally restricted, have gradually been given all the rights
 enjoyed by workers in other sectors of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor, including forced labor by children, is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition (see
 Section 6.c.). The Labor Standards Law prohibits the employment of persons under
 the age of 15 without a special employment certificate from the Labor Ministry. Be-
 cause education is compulsory through middle school (about age 14), few special em-
 ployment certificates are issued for full-time employment. Some children are allowed
 
 
 to hold part-time jobs such as selling newspapers. To obtain employment, children
 under age 18 must have written approval from their parents or guardians. Employ-
 ers may require minors to work only a limited number of overtime hours and are
 prohibited from employing them at night without special permission from the Labor
 Ministry. Child labor laws and regulations are clear and usually enforced when vio-
 lations are found, but the Government employs too few inspectors to carry out regu-
 lar inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage in 1988, and the minimum wage level is reviewed annually. As of September,
 the minimum wage was raised to approximately $1.17 (1,525 won) per hour. Compa-
 nies with fewer than 10 employees are exempt from this law. The FKTU and other
 labor organizations assert that the current minimum wage does not meet the basic
 requirements of urban workers. In fact, a worker earning the minimum wage would
 have difficulty in providing a decent standard of living for himself and his family,
 despite the fringe benefits, such as transportation expenses, with which companies
 normally supplement salaries. (However, the money an average blue-collar worker
 takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the total compensation
 package.) According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2.6 percent of the popu-
 lation lived below the poverty level in 1997.
 Foreign workers, most of whom come from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh,
 Nepal, and Pakistan, often face difficult working conditions. The Government sought
 to ameliorate the problems of illegal workers by creating a program that allowed
 about 60,000 foreign workers to enter Korea legally to work at established wages
 with legal safeguards. Although close to 50,000 illegal foreign workers took advan-
 tage of a government "grace period" and departed Korea in the first 7 months of
 the year in the wake of the country's economic troubles, an estimated 100,000 work-
 ers remain and still suffer significant hardships in the workplace. It is difficult for
 illegal workers to seek relief for loss of pay or unsatisfactory living and working con-
 ditions because they face the tithreat of being deported. However, the Government
 has established counseling centers that hear complaints from illegal foreign workers
 about such issues as overdue wages and industrial accidents. Foreigners working as
 language teachers have complained that language institutes that hired them fre-
 quently violated employment contracts, for which the legal system provided insuffi-
 cient redress.
 Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in 1989 brought the maximum
 regular workweek to 44 hours, with provision for overtime to be compensated  at a
 higher wage. The law also provides for a 24-hour rest period each week. Labor laws
 were revised in 1997 to establish a flexible hours system, according to which I em-
 ployers could require laborers to work up to 48 hours during certain weeks witkout
 paying overtime, as long as average weekiy hours for 2-weeks did not exceed 44.
 If a union agreed to a further loosening of the rules, management could ask employ-
 ees to work up to 56 hours in a given week. The legislation established a daily cap
 on the working day of 12 hours. Labor groups claim that the Government doe not
 adequately enforce maximum workweek provisions at small companies.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the accident rate is unusu-
 ally high by international standards. However, this rate continues to decline grndu-
 ally due to improved occupational safety programs and union pressure for better
 working conditions. The Labor Ministry still lacks enough inspectors to enforc the
 laws fully. The Industrial Safety and Health Law does not guarantee security for
 workers who remove themselves from dangerous work environments.
