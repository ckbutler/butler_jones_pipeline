 NAMIBIA
 Namibia achieved its independence under United Nations supervision on March
 21, 1990, following 74 years of South African rule. The new nation is a functioning
 multiparty, multiracial democracy, whose Constitution contains an entrenched bill
 of rights, providing for freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, and religion.
 The Government is headed by Dr. Sam Njoma, leader of the South West Africa
 People's Organization (SWAPO), which won Namibia's first free election in Novem-
 ber 1989. The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) SWAPO's major opposition, and
 five other smaller parties enjoy representation in ie first house of Parliament, the
 National Assembly. Members of the second house, the National Council plus local
 and regional officials were chosen in the country's first postindependence elections
 held between Novemier 30 and December 3, 1992. The elections were widely viewed
 as generally free and fair, although some opposition parties complained of pro-
 SWAPO bias within the electoral directorate staff.
 The main security force is the Namibian Defense Force (NDF), comprising former
 troops of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN--SWAPO's military wing)
 and the South West African Territorial Force (SWATF)-forces that battled each
 other in the years prior to inde pendence. Security force members were convicted of
 a number of crimes against civilians during the year. There were no data available
 from the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency on Namibia's total military
 expenditures. However, the military budget is modest at some 5 percent of govern-
 ment spending and has been dropping in real terms. It will probably continue to
 do so for the near future. Since independence defense spending has not been a high
 budget priority.
 The Namibian economy has two major components-a modern market sector that
 produces most of its wealth and a traditional subsistence agricultural sector (mainly
 in the north) that supports most of its labor force. Mining, ranching, and fishing,
 the mainstays of the market sector, are still largely controlled by white Namibian
 businessmen. Throughout 1992 the Government stressed the leading role of the pri-
 vate sector and encouraged new investments by indigenous and foreign entre-
 preneurs on the basis of a new investment code adopted in December 1990.
 Namibians enjoy a wide range of civil and political liberties with much public dis-
 cussion of civic rights and obligations. Controversy continued, however, over ac-
 counting for missing detainees formerly held by SWAPO in Angola and Zambia and
 by South African authorities in Namibia during the preindependence period. The
 Government did not respond to public pressures to establish a "truth commission"
 to account for the missing and to withdraw government appointments of those
 credibly associated with prior abuses. The Government's refugee policy also encoun-
 tered criticism. Problems of racial discrimination and disparities--especially in edu-
 cation, health, employment, working conditions-and discrimination and violence
 against women continued in 1992. A number of police and defense force members
 were suspended and, in some cases convicted and dismissed from service for off-
 duty offenses against civilians, including theft, assault, and rape.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings during 1992. However, several cases of political killings
 which occurred prior to independence remained unresolved.
 
 
 183
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances occurring during
 1992, but public attention and controversy centered on the Government's handling
 of preindependence disappearances. Most, if not all earlier disappearance cases in-
 volved persons detained and unaccounted for by SWAPO and the former South Afri-
 can authorities prior to independence. Estimates of the number of SWAPO detainees
 still unaccounted for range from the 256 listed in 1989 by the special ad hoc com-
 mittee of the U.N. Transitional Assistance Group to over 1,800, as reported by fam-
 ily members to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1992. Ac-
 cording to a 1990 report by the Namibian National Society for Human Rights
 (NSHR), the whereabouts and fate of 59 people detained by the former South Afri-
 can administration in Namibia also remained unclear. The disparity in numbers will
 continue until a full investigation by the Government is completed.
 Because of the sensitivity of the issue, the Government has ignored efforts, includ-
 ing those by human rights  ups, to set up a Namibian commission to examine and
 resolve these cases. Instea  it has relied largely on ICRC assistance in determining
 the identities and whereabouts of Nanibians who may have died or disappeared
 while in detention. In 1991 SWAPO appointed a liaison officer to improve coopera-
 tion between SWAPO and the ICRC. At the request of the Government of Namibia,
 the Governments of Angola and Botswana and the U.N. High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) appointed similar liaison officers, while the Governments of South
 Africa and Zambia failed to do so. Based on an initial ICRC request for information
 on 110 missing SWAPO detainees, SWAPO's liaison officer confirmed 28 of those
 listed were dead. The causes given for death, however, were mostly vague and did
 not conform to standard medical reporting. In some cases, eyewitness reports con-
 tradicted the places of death reported by SWAPO. The SWAPO notifications pro-
 vided insufficient evidence to issue formal death certificates, which complicated ef-
 forts to resolve legal matters for surviving family members.
 Despite these problems, the ICRC launched a new appeal for families to submit
 tracing requests for missing relatives, and some 2,100 new requests were received.
 SWAPO responded that 300 of these missing persons were confirmed as dead, leav-
 ing some 1,800 still unaccounted for. However, the ICRC reduced its presence in Na-
 nbia to one employee in July. This, along with decreased activity by the Parents'
 Committee, raised public concern that interest in pursuing these investigations was
 waning. One important issue is whether persons responsible for past human rights
 abuses will be held legally accountable; a second is whether current government offi-
 cials credibly linked to serious human rights abuses during the preindependence pe-
 riod will be permitted to remain in office.
 In early 1992, the Angolan Government released nearly a dozen Namibians held
 in Bentiaba prison in southwestern Angola, some of whom may previously have
 been reported as missing. Some human rights officials, however, contended that a
 number of Namibians remain under detention by UNITA forces in southeastern An-
 gola. In 1992 some two dozen Namibians reportedly escaped UNITA custody and re-
 turned to Namibia.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Namibia Constitution states that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." Although greatly reduced
 from the preindependence period, there were reports of torture or other inhuman
 treatment by police forces during 1992. In January a person arrested for possession
 of illegal ivory and uranium alleged he was subjected to electric shocks and beatings
 while ]eing questioned by police officers in Windhoek. In another incident, police
 used    aw ainst a group of demonstrators (see Section 2.b.). As the year
 ended, several police officials-were suspended from duty, and others faced charges
 for excessive use of force, including the shooting of suspects during arrests.
 Members of the NDF were charged in several cases of mistreating civilians or
 damaging private property during 1992. Eight such cases were tried by military
 courts; punishments ranged from suspension from the force to small fines for those
 found guilty. Several ND F members were tried by civilian courts in 1992 for shoot-
 ingor otherwise injuring civilians in 1990 and 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention. According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be in-
 formed of the reason for their arrest "promptly in a language they understand," and
 they must be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours of their detention. A trial
 must take place within "a reasonable time," or the accused must be released. The
 accused are entitled to defense by a legal counsel of their choice; the State provides
 a lawyer for the indigent.
 Since indepnennce, the Government has generally respted these rights and
 protections. However, in April the head of the NSR alleged that he was arbitrarily
 arrested, detained, and interrogated for several hours in connection with his inves-
 
 
 184
 tigations into alleged human rights abuses. There were also several reports that tra-
 ditional village elders and one rural expatriate shopkeeper detained and imprisoned
 persons accused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. The
 Government decried these actions and called upon the public to report such prac-
 tices.
 There were no reports of Namibians being exiled for political reasons in 1992 (but
 see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Namibia has an independent judiciary, and under
 the Constitution all citizens have the right to a fair trial. Namibia has retained the
 Roman-Dutch court system it inherited from South Africa, while also maintaining
 a traditional court system. The formal system has three levels: magistrate's court,
 the High Court, and the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the court of ap-
 peals and as a constitutionalreview court. The Supreme Court is also charged wit
 hearing cases of persons who claim to have been tortured by former South African
 authorities.
 The tenure of sitting judges was unaffected by the 1990 change in government.
 Traditional courts have dealt with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft and
 infractions of local customs. A special presidential commission was established in
 1991 to make recommendations on the prospective jurisdiction of traditional courts,
 which have functioned at the village level or members of the same ethnic group,
 but the commission had not reported by year's end.
 In the postindependence period, the right to a fair trial has been afforded in prac-
 tice. The Constitution guarantees that persons claiming that their fundamental
 rights have been violated may seek redress in court and request free legal advice
 from the ombudsman. The lack of qualified magistrates, however, continued to exac-
 erbate the backlog of cases awaiting trial. A number of judgments rendered by inad-
 equately trained magistrates were overturned upon review by the prosecutor gen-
 eral. Other delays resulted from the paucity of legal counsel-fewer than 100 law-
 yers are currently engaged in private practice in the country; fewer than 10 of these
 are black.
 In a 1990 landmark case, the Namibian courts-ruled that the Government of Na-
 mibia-as successor to the South African Government and its Ministry of Defense-
 was liable for redress for abuses by the South African security forces prior to inde-
 pendence. In September compensation payments totalling $35,000 were made to 28
 claimants. These ranged from $9,000 to a person who lost his leg in a shooting inci-
 dent, to $35 to a person whose clothing was torn during harassment by security
 forces.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 legal requirement that arresting officers must have a warrant and the constitu-
 tionally safeguarded right to privacy were respected in practice in 1992. There was
 no evidence of unlawful electronic surveillance or interference with correspondence.
 Such practices were reportedly common prior to independence; senior government
 officials, however, have given public assurances that these practices have been dis-
 continued.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these fundamen-
 tal freedoms, including academic freedom in institutions of higher learning, and it
 states these rights may not be suspended in time of war or during a state of emer-
 gency. In practice, these freedoms have been respected since independence. Officials
 conducting a government investigation were required to obtain a warrant to obtain
 television tapes of demonstrators bing beaten by police (see Section 2.b.).
 The government-wned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) operates all
 radio and television services. A broadly representative government-appointed board
 sets policy for the NBC. Although the N BC routinely gives prominent coverage to
 the activities of government officials, it also provides significant coverage to opposi-
 tion spokespersons and issues.
 Print journalism in Namib'a is free and vigorous. At present there are four daly
 and two weekly newspapers of general interest. One (a weekly) is published by the
 Government, and several others are affiliated to political parties. Several news-
 papers frequently criticized government officials andpolicies. There was no appar-
 ent self-censorship by journalists, aside from the constraints of libel laws. Within
 the local media council, however, one newspaper can charge another with erronous
 reporting, which has resulted in editorial retractions. There are no restrictions on
 academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 of assembly and association. During 1992 various organizations including political
 parties and religious groups, held large meetings an d public gatherings without in-
 
 
 185
 terference. In March, however, police in Windhoek forcibly dispersed a demonstra-
 tion by fired employees, who were blocking access to the premises of their former
 employer. Several senior police officials were suspended from duty as'a result of the
 incident, in which demonstrators were beaten with bullwhips. The incident and sub-
 sequent demonstrations against police brutality received prominent press coverage.
 Other public gatherings included protests to local governments over poor housing
 and sanitary conditions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and Namibians have enjoyed
 freedom of religion since well before independence. There are no restrictions on the
 activities of particular religious groups or on foreign clergy members, and, in con-
 trast to the preindependence period, there were no restrictions on internal or foreign
 travel of church leaders. Although there was significant public controversy over
 plans to erect a mosque in Windhoek, the Government reaffirmed the constitutional
 guarantee of religious freedom to all.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution guarantees the rights to move freely throughout Na-
 mibia, to reside and settle in any part of Namibia, and to leave and return to Na-
 mibia. These rights are respected in practice. During and after the transition to
 independence, a total of 42,736 Namibian exiles returned to the country as part of
 the UNHCR repatriation program, which ended in June 1990.
 Throughout 1992, the local press, local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 and opposition political parties repeatedly criticized the Government's handling of
 citizenship and refugee issues. According to the NSHR and the press, a number of
 Namibian citizens unable to prove their citizenship were arbitrarily deported to An-
 gola or Zambia as illegal aliens. The Government has not acted to correct these de-
 portation actions.
 Although it drafted implementing guidelines in August, by year's end the Govern-
 ment had not passed legislation to implement a consistent refugee or asylum policy
 and had not yet acceded to international conventions on the status of refugees. Spo-
 radic incidents occurred in which persons seeking refugee status were deported or
 jailed under ordinary immigration law upon their arrival in the country. An
 interministerial government committee was established to review refugee and asy-
 lum claims on a case-by-case basis. As of August, this committee had reviewed 70
 cases, and 14 candidates had been accepted as refugees. The 56 cases refused in-
 cluded 20 persons whom the UNHCR believed had valid claims to refugee status;
 their cases were appealed and were still pending at the end of 1992.
 Asylum seekers and those recognized as refugees are officially required to remain
 at a remote settlement camp some 120 miles northeast of Windhoek. It was not
 clear whether the Government would eventually allow bona fide refugees to live,
 work, or study elsewhere in the country. Several persons who defied a government
 order in July to report to the camp were imprisoned and denied contact with the
 UNHCR representative. In its order, the Government threatened to deport all those
 who refused to report to the camp without regard to their claims to refugee status,
 equating them with criminals. One asylum seeker alleged he was beaten by police
 duinK his arrest and detention for having publicly criticized the Government's refu-
 gee policy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government is enjoyed in the Constitution
 and in practice. The Constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament and calls for
 free general elections by secret ballot every 5 years and regional elections every 2
 years. In 1989, for the first time, Namibian citizens freely exercised their right to
 change their government in nonracial, multiparty elections for a constituent assem-
 bly, which later became the National Assembly. Elections for the second chamber,
 the constituent-based National Council, and regional authorities were held from No-
 vember 30 to December 3, 1992, the first exercise of the democratic franchise orga-
 nized by Namibians themselves. With the exception of a few administrative prob-
 lems in the more remote areas, most parties were basically satisfied that the elec-
 tions were free and fair. No substantial incidents of intimidation or violence were
 reported during the voting.
 In a major victory, SWAPO carried 68 percent of the popular vote, winning control
 of most of the local councils, including most of the major urban centers, while also
 garnering control of 9 of the 13 regional councils. The DTA will control 3 regional
 councils, while the DTA and the United Democratic Front (UDF) will share power
 with SWAPO in a fourth.
 SWAPO is expected to enjoy a 19 to 7 majority in the soon-to-be created National
 Council made up of nominees from the regional councils. The Constitution gives the
 
 
 186
 National Council power to initiate legislation on local and regional matters and to
 veto bills passed by the National Assembly. As such, it will provide a crucial check
 on the Assembly's powers.         _
 Seven political parties are currently represented in the National Assembly. The
 SWAPO-led Government has 45 of the 78 seats in the Assembly, and the DTA, the
 major opposition party, holds 21 seats. Five small parties are also represented. The
 DTA, together with the other non-SWAPO parties in Parliament, canblock constitu-
 tional changes, which require a two-thirds majority of all members.
 Since independence, the Government has afforded equal civil and political rights
 to all Namibians. All Namibians, including the indigenous majority, are able to par-
 ticipate in the political process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1992 local organizations, such as the NSHR, the Parents' Committee, and
 the Legal Assistance Center (LAC), operated freely, criticizing the Government's
 handling of the SWAPO detainee issue, the treatment of refugees, misconduct by
 members of the police and defense forces, and other matters. Two new local organi-
 zations, the Namibia Institute for Democracy (NID) and the Africa Human Rights
 and Justire Protection Network (AHRJP), were founded in 1992.
 The AHRJP has stated that it will focus on the rights and protections offered by
 the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to which the Government ac-
 ceded in September. The LAC, highly regarded for its assistance to indigent defend-
 ants, follows the detainee issue. During 1992 the LAC succeeded in obtaining finan-
 cial redress for Namibians detained and tortured by the previous South Afncan au-
 thorities (see Section 1.e.). The LAC, whose current primary focus is on legal edu-
 cation, has worked with the Ministry of Education to develop a constitutional cur-
 riculum for schools and continued to offer lectures on human rights issues for police
 cadets and defense force trainees.
 International human rights organizations are free to travel to Namibia and dis-
 cuss human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental representatives.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, sex, or religion
 and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology. of apartheid." In December
 1991, the National Assembly enacted a bill to outlaw racial discrimination and to
 punish its perpetrators with severe fimes or prison sentences. Racial discrimination
 continues to be a very sensitive political issue. As a result of many years of South
 African administration, racial and ethnic discrimination were institutionalized in
 Namibian society to the same extent as in South Africa itself. Many such statutes
 which predate Namibia's independence remain valid unless repealed or replaced by
 the National Assembly. Nonwhites complain the Government is not taking adequate
 steps to mitigate the continuing and serious inequalities in education, health, hous-
 ing, employment, and use of public accommodations. In a highly publicized 1992
 court decision, a white hotel manager in the northern town of Outjo was found
 guilty of contravening the Discrimination Act of 1979 and fined the equivalent of
 $107 for refusing service to two black Namibians (one of whom was a deputy min-
 ister and Member of Parliament). (See Section 6.e. regarding white/ black wage dis-
 parities.) Women's rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, but in practice dis-
 crimination against women, stemming from pervasive cultural and traditional prac-
 tices of all races, persists. There are also inequalities in the law and in education
 and employment opportunities. For instance, under existing community property
 laws, married women of all groups are defined as legal minors and may not legally
 acquire or purchase property or enter into a legal contract without the signature
 and consent of the husband. At present, any property brought into a marriage by
 a woman is transferred to the ownership of her husband, who has the authority to
 decide its disposition without her consent. A woman is considered a ward of her fa-
 ther until she marries, at which time she becomes a ward of her husband. The cur-
 rent law also does not compel men to provide economic support for their children
 in case of divorce, resulting in many indigent single mothers. Women are not barred
 from pursuing higher education but tend to be directed to certain educational fields
 and areas of employment, such as clerical and secretarial work, teaching, and do-
 mestic service.
 Several women's groups are working to change these inequalities and ensure that
 constitutional guarantees for women are put into practice. In mid-1992, the Na-
 tional Assembly enacted legislation outlawing the traditional practice of family
 members confiscating property and other assets of deceased men from their widows
 and children.
 
 
 Violence against women is widespread, particularly wife beating and rape. The
 courts have generally treated cases of wife beating as assaults, but because of tradi-
 tional attitudes regarding the subordination of women, many such cases are not re-
 ported to the authorities. Women's groups and other women's rights advocates con-
 tend that rape and wife beating are not taken seriously by police, claiming that po-
 lice prefer not to interfere in domestic disputes and that prosecutions of and convic-
 tions for rape are the exception. In October 1991, however the High Court deemed
 unconstitutional the application of the "cautionary rule,* winch held that single wit-
 ness evidence, when that witness was also the victim of a crime such as rape, was
 insufficient in itself for conviction. In April a man was sentenced to 8 years' imprs-
 onment for beating his common-law wfe to death with a stick in 1990, and in Sep-
 tember a man was sentenced to 6 years' imprisonment for rape.
 Children's rights are addressed in the chapter on fundamental human rights and
 freedoms of Namibia's Constitution. Cases involving crimes against children (par-
 ticularly rape and incest) have been vigorously prosecuted by the police and courts.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Namibia's Constitution provides for freedom of asso-
 ciation including freedom to form and join trade unions, a right that was extended
 to pubic servants, farm workers, and domestic employees under the new Labor Act
 passed in March and implemented in November. Although perhaps half of the wage
 sector is organized to some degree, less than 20 percent of those employed full time
 are organized, and few rural laborers are organized. The Ministry of Labor and
 Manpower Development encourages broad cooperation within the labor movement
 and trade union pluralism, while maintaining a strict policy of noninterference with
 internal union matters. Trade unions have no difficulty registering, and there are
 no government restrictions on who serves as a union official. No union has been dis-
 solved by government action since independence.
 Unions are independent of government and can form federations and confed-
 erations, of which there are two of significance. The principal trade union organiza-
 tion is the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW), a SWAPO-aligned federa-
 tion of 7 industrial unions with 70,000 members. Most workers in the mining indus-
 try, the country's key export sector, are members of the NUNW-alfiliated
 Mineworkers Union of Naniia (MUN). The principal public service and construc-
 tion unions are affiliates of the Nanbia People's Social Movement (NPSM), for-
 merly known as the Namibian Christian Social Trade Unions confederation. There
 are also several independent trade unions. The bulk of the trade union movement
 backed SWAPO in the November 1989 elections, and the NUNW reaffirmed its af-
 filiation to the ruling party during its March 1991 Congress. In December 1991, sev-
 eral prominent NUNW officials were elected to SWAPO's Central Committee, and
 union leaders have served in the National Assembly. The NPSM and other inde-
 pendent unions claim to be nonpartisan and in practice confine their activities to
 r-management relations.
 Namibian workers, except for those providing essential services, enjoy the right
 to strike once conciliation procedures have been exhausted. The new Labor Act ex-
 tended the right to strike to public servants, farm workers, and domestics. Under
 the Act, strike action can only be used in disputes involving worker interests, such
 as pay raises. Disputes over worker rights, including dismissals, must be referred
 to the Labor Court for arbitration. Legally striking workers also gained protection
 from unfair dismissal under the Labor Act. An "unfair dismissal" is defined as one
 in which a "valid or fair reason" for termination or dismissal is "not in compliance
 with fair procedure." Because no one has yet challenged a dismissal as unfair under
 the new Labor Act, it is unclear what "unfair" means in practice.
 Since independence, work stoppages over pay, dismissal, and pension issues have
 been relatively common, with most actions lasting 1 day or less. In September the
 MUN carried out Namibia's first legal strike to demand a wage increase. In all
 other cases, however, strikers failed to exhaust existing procedures for settling dis-
 putes. In most instances, union officials acted as mediators after the fact rather
 than as walk-out leaders.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. The unions have exercised this free-
 dom without interference. The NUNW disavowed its ties to the now defunct Com-
 munist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions in 1991 but remains affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and increased its ties to the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The NPSM is affiliated with the
 World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The new Labor Act guaran-
 tees employees the right to bargain individually or collectively. At present, collective
 
 
 bargaining is not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries;
 wages are usually set by employers. As unions become mere active, however, infor-
 mal collective bargaining is becoming more common.
 When a dispute cannot be resolved directly, the first recourse is to a conciliation
 board, with a mediator and representatives from both sides. Conciliation boards
 have mostly been used in wage disputes and to a lesser extent to negotiate working
 conditions, overtime hours, and reinstatements of dismissed employees. In almost
 all cases in which conciliation boards have been convened, the disputes were settled.
 Unlike the previous law, the new Labor At provides a process for employer rec-
 ognition of trade unions and protection for members and organizers. The law also
 empowers the Labor Court to remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids
 unfair dismissals, which can also be brought on appeal to the Labor Court. There
 was     one formal complaint of discrimination filed in 1992 with the Ministry of
 Labr. Aother case involving the dismissal of a union shop steward was referred
 to arbitration.
 Despite the new labor law, labor-management relations have generally been
 strained, as the unions a ppear to have little effective control over the mass of
 semiorganized, mostly black  and bitterly frustrated urban unskilled workers. This
 frustration manifested itslf most tragically when a group of unionized furniture
 workers attacked and killed a factory manager in September. A few months earlier,
 350 workers from that factory were dismissed for staging an illegal strike. With
 union intervention, the factory reinstated the strikers only after they agreed to a
 pay aut.
 Upeta incentives are available for export-oriented industrial investments in
 Arandis, but there are no export or offshore processing zones or facilities in Na-
 mibia. There are no plans to suspend the provisions of-the Labor At as a means
 of attracting foreign investment.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.- Fored labor is prohibited by law,
 but there were continuing reports that farm workers sometimes receive little or no
 compensation for labor and are subject to strict control by farm owners. Although
 there were no formal complaints filed with theMinistry of Labor in 1992, there
 were reports of farm workers being subjected to physical punishment by their em-
 ployers in the past. Due to the isolation of many rural areas and the resulting obsta-
 cles to organizing trade unions, farm workers experienced great difficulties in gain-
 ing recognition of their working rights.
 d.Mininmum Age of Employment for Children-Under the new Labor Act, the ab-
 solute minimum age for employment is 14 years, with higher requirements for cer-
 tain sectors, such as 16 years for mining, manufarg, and construction, 17 for
 underground work, and      or night work. Age regulations under previous legisla-
 tion wer generally enforced. However, children be ow the age of 14 often work on
 family and commercial farms and in the informal sector. Boys in the rural areas
 traditionally start herding livestock at age 7. The Labor Act empowers Ministry of
 Labor inspectors to enforce the prohibitions on child labor. Once they become estab-
 lished, the labor courts will be a le to hear criminal charges against violators.
 e. A  nceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law in
 Namibia. The Labor Act provides for wage commissions to consider proposals for
 sectoral or geographical minimum wages. lnskilled workers in the rematively well-
 paid mining sector earn about twice the amount earned by urban unskilled laborers.
 Domestic workers earn much less. In Windhek s nonwhite townships, workers and
 their families have difficulty maintaining a minimally decent standard of living.
 White Namibians earn significantly more on average than their black compatriotsh
 in large part because whites own most of the country's productive resources and had
 p referential access to education that enabled them to take advantage of the skilled
 abor sortage. Moreover, under the preindependence apartheid system even quali-
 fled nonwhites were often barred from skilled jobs or did not receive equal pay for
 equal work. The legacy of apartheid persists in the current wage structure, although
 the Government is attempting to address the problem through afrmative action
 hiring policies.
 The standard legal workweek since independence was reduced from 46 to 45
 hours, including at least one 24-hour rest period per week. No more than 10 hours
 per week of overtime may be required byan employer. The law mandates 24 con-
 secutive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3
 months of unpaid maternity leave. In practice, these provisions are not yet rigor-
 ously observe or en orked.
 Government-mandated occupational health and safety standards are set by law,
 and the Labor Act empowers the President to strengthen these standardsby issuing
 applicable regulations and enforce them through inspections and criminal penalties.
 The Government has carried out a national survey of health and safety standards,
 
 
 but has yet to release any report or upgrade standards. The law requires employers
 to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of their employees and provides for the
