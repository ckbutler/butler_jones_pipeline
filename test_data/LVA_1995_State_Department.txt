 LATVIA
 Latvia is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as con-
 tinuous for more than 70 years, it regained its independence in 1991 after more
 than 50 years of Soviet occupation. Elections for the 100-seat Parliament (Saeima)
 held in the fall were free and fair, but the election law barred some citizens from
 competing as candidates due to prior activity in pro-Soviet organizations or lack of
 fluency in the state language. The Prime Minister, as chief executive, and the Cabi-
 net are responsible for government operations. The President, as Head of State, is
 elected by the Parliament. The 1991 Constitutional Law, which supplements the
 1922 Constitution, provides for basic rights and freedoms. The judiciary is independ-
 ent but not well-trained, efficient, or free from corruption.
 The security apparatus consists of: the national police and other services subordi-
 nate to the Ministry of Interior, municipal police operating under local government
 control; the counterintelligence service and a protective service operating under the
 Ministry of Defense; and the National Guard, an element of the national armed
 forces, which also assists in police activities. Civilian authorities generally maintain
 effective control of the security forces and a recently established Constitution Pro-
 tection Bureau (SAB) has oversight over intelligence activities. However, Interior
 Ministry forces and municipal police sometimes acted independently of central gov-
 ernment authority. Some members of the security forces, including police and other
 Ministry of Interior personnel, committed human rights abuses.
 Traditionally dominated by agriculture and forestryproducts, with military-indus-
 trial production introduced by the Soviets, the varied economy is increasingly ori-
 ented toward the service sector. As the transition from a centrally planned to a mar-
 ket-oriented economic system continues, private enterprise in trade and services is
 thriving, and about 50 percent of farmland is now in private hands. In the indus-
 trial sector, progress toward privatization and revitalization is much slower. The
 currency remained stable and freely traded, unemployment was around 8 percent,
 and annual inflation about 25 percent, down from 36 percent in 1994. Per capita
 gross domestic product (GDP) was approximately $1,000 per year. GDP had been
 forecast to rise by 2 percent in 1995. However, the economy suffered from the col-
 lapse of the largest and several smaller commercial banks as well as from a severe
 government budget crisis.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large resident noncitizen community, although problems remained in certain areas.
 Members of the security forces, including the police and Interior Ministry mobile
 battalions, continued to use excessive force; police and prison officers beat detainees
 and inmates. The Government did not take adequate disciplinary action against
 those responsible. Prison conditions remained substandard. The inefficient judiciary
 did not always ensure the fair administration of justice. The Citizenship and Immi-
 gration Department (CID) continued to act arbitrarily and, in some cases, to ignore
 court orders concerning the residence status of noncitizens.
 
 
 Among key positive developments were the enactment of the first law clearly de-
 trning the status of most noncitizens, a limited liberalization of the 1994 Citizenship
 Law, the beginning of naturalization under the 1994 law, adoption of a national pro-
 ram for protecting individual rights, and the establishment of an independent
 human rights office. Moreover, by adopting the law on the status of former Soviet
 Citizens ( On the Status of Those Citizens of the Former USSR Who do not have
 the Citizenship of Latvia or Any Other State"), Parliament authorized most of the
 approximately o700000 noncitizen residents to obtain travel documents veriying
 their rights to reside in, leave, and return to Latvia; however, the Law had not been
 fully implemented by year's end.
 Women are discriminated against in the workplace, and spousal abuse is a wide-
 spread problem, as is child prostitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearane.-here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there were credible reports that police
 and prison personnel beat detainees and prison inmates. There were no reported in-
 stances of the Government prosecuting those responsible.
 Prison conditions remain poor. Inadequate sanitation facilities, persistent short-
 ages of blankets and medical care, and insufficient lighting and ventilation are com-
 mon problems, as is the shortage of resources. The law continues to prohibit detain-
 ees awakingtrial from sending mail, but this prohibition is not universally enforced.
 Interior Ministry mzbile battalions reportedly used excessive force to "restore
 order" to prisons in Valmiera, near Daugavpils, and elsewhere. A detention center
 established at Olaine, outside Riga, provided substandard conditions for over 100
 asylum seekers (including more than 40 children) being held indeienitely without
 trial. While new construction at prisons in Jelgava and Riga reportedly provided a
 small percentage of prisoners with improved conditions, state auditors found evi-
 dene that Interior Ministry personnel had misappropriated scarce resources alo-
 cated to the prison system in prior years.
 In December the Riga district court convicted former Latvian Soviet secret police
 head Alfons Noviks of "genocide" and sentenced him to life imprisonment for his in-
 volvement in mass killings, deportations, and torture between 1940 and 1953.
 tihe situation for some imprisoned children, who are not always separated from
 adults, remained poor. Children as young as 14 years of ag were kept in unsanitary
 conditions and suffer from disease and deprivation. Bothboys and girls are subject
 to violence and possible sexual abuse.
 One of the legacies of the Soviet occupation is the regular practice of hazing mili-
 tary recruAits. President Guntis Ulmanis convened meetings to highlight this prob-
 lem and urged military authorities to curb abusive practices. The Parliament also
 amended the Criminal Code to specify criminal sanctions for harassment and abuse
 of soldiers, but reliable reports suggest that the practices continued. Despite the
 high-level attention, the authorities did not take adequate disciplinary or legal ac-
 tion to punish military authorities who accept or tolerate cruel and degrading treat-
 ment o young soldiers. However, at yeapri end authorities were pursuing cases
 against several soldiers arrested for abusing recruits during 1995.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ele.-iThere were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest or exile. As of 1994, the responsibility for issuing arrest warrants was
 transferred from prosecutors to the curts. The law requires the prosecutor's office
 to make a formal decision whether to charge or release a detainee within 72 hours
 after arrest. Charges must be filed within 10 days of arrest. A detainee may not
 be held for more than 6 months without new arrest orders being issued by the pros-
 ecutor's office. No detaine e  a held for more than 1 months without the case
 going to court. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any time.
 These rights are subject to judicial review but only at the time of trial. There were
 credible reports that these rights are not always respected in practice, especially
 outside Ri ga.
 e. Denia ofFair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the courts must rely on the Ministry of Justice for administrative support and the
 Supreme Court does not have a clearly established right to rule on the constitu-
 tionality of legislation. A minority in the Parliament used procedural moves to block
 establishment of a constitutional court to fulfill this function.
 
 
 924
 
 Although the criminal justice system was organized according to the former Soviet
 model, Latvia is reforming its judicial system. In 1995 it completed the establish-
 ment of regional courts which will hear appeals of lower court decisions. For more
 serious criminal cases, two lay assessors join the professional judge on the bench.
 There are no reports that the Government improperly influencedjudges, but corrup-
 tion is reportedly widespread. Most judges have little legal education, and the court
 system is too weak to enforce many of its decisions. There is a lack of information
 available on which to make informed decisions, especially outside Riga.
 Trials may be closed if state secrets might be revealed or to protect the interests
 of minors. All defendants have the right to hire an attorney, and the State will lend
 funds to destitute defendants for this purpose. Defendants have the right to read
 all charges and confront all witnesses and may offer witnesses and evidence to sup-
 port their case.
 While the prosecutor appealed court decisions exonerating three Members of Par-
 liament of charges that they had willingly collaborated with the KGB, the Par-
 liament voted to restore their mandates (a fourth member had been acquitted owing
 to lack of evidence, and the prosecutor is not pursuing the case; a fifth member re-
 signed from Parliament and was not tried). This decision reversed the Parliament's
 1994 decision to suspend parliamentary participation by the five members pending
 the outcome of their trials. The Government ad characterized the Parliaments
 original decision as an unconstitutional infringement of the right to a presumption
 of innocence.
 Following a 25-month trial, former Latvian Communist Party First Secretary
 Alfreds Rubiks was sentenced to 8 years in prison for attempting to overthrow the
 independent Latvian State in 1991. While Rubiks' supporters describe him as a po-
 litical prisoner, claiming that he acted in accordance with the prevailing Soviet leg-
 islation, there is no evidence that his conviction violated human rights standards.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that law enforcement authorities must have a judicial warrant in order to
 intercept citizens' mail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. This pro-
 tection does not apply to the large noncitizen population.
 Following press reports that the Ministry of Defense (MOD) counterintelligence
 service hadmonitored the office telephones of employees suspected of possible secu-
 rity breaches, a senior MOD official indicated that no warrant was required to con-
 duct such monitoring for internal investigative purposes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of
 speech and of the press, and the Government generally respects this right in prac-
 tice. The 1991 Press Law prohibits censorship of the press or other mass media.
 Most newspapers and magazines in Latvia are privately owned. New publications
 continued to appear, but economic difficulties forced others to close. Newspapers in
 both Latvian and Russian published a wide range of criticism and political view-
 points.
 A large number of independent television and radio outlets broadcast in both Rus-
 sian and Latvian, and the number of people receiving satellite television broadcasts
 continued to increase.
 In late September, a reporter for a major media organization claimed to have been
 beaten after being abducted at a location where she had arranged to meet a govern-
 ment official. However, the Government has denied any involvement in this inci-
 dent, and there is no independent evidence linking government officials to the
 crime.
 A new law on radio and television adopted in August contains a number of restric-
 tive provisions regulating the content and language of broadcasts. No more than 30
 percent of private broadcasts may be in languages other than Latvian; in prime
 time, 40 percent of television broadcasts must be of Latvian and 80 percent of Euro-
 pean origin. Moreover, foreign investment may not exceed 20 percent of the capital
 in electronic media organizations.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities legally may
 not prohibit public gatherings. Organizers of demonstrations must provide advance
 notice to local authorities, who may change the time and place of public gatherings
 for such reasons as fear of public disorder. Numerous mass meetings and political
 demonstrations took place without Government interference. However, the Riga city
 council regularly demed permission or sought to change the time and place of dem-
 onstrations by groups representing a portion of the noncitizen community. On occa-
 sion this led to clashes between demonstrators and the municipal police. Noncitizen
 representatives and Russian-language newspapers accused the police of using exces-
 
 
 925
 
 sive force to break up "unauthorizedr meetings. On one occasion the municipal po-
 lice detained several demonstrators briefly for allegedly blocking access to the city
 council building, but the cases against them did not holdup in court.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. How-
 ever, the law on registering public organizations was amended in late 1993 to bar
 registration of Communist, Nazi, or other organizations whose activities would con-
 travene the Constitution. The Justice Ministry also refused to register the League
 of Stateless Persons in Latvia on the grounds that noncitizens are prohibited from
 forming "political" organizations. More than 35 political parties are officially reg-
 istered.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Although the Govern-
 ment does not require the registration of religious groups, a new law on religious
 organizations specifies that religious organizations can enjoy certain rights and
 privileges only if they register. Only religious groups wihich -have at least 25 mem-
 bera who are citizens may be reistered.
 Foreign evangelists and missionaries are permitted to hold meetings and pros-
 elytize, but the law stipulates that only religious organizations in Latvia may invite
 them to carry out such activities.
 Representatives of religions organizations which authorities consider to be "non-
 traditional," including the Mormons, continue to experience difficulties in obtaining
 visas and residence permits to serve as missionaries in Latvia. Religious education
 may be provided to public school students on a voluntary basis only by representa-
 tives of leg ally registered religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens.
  April the Pariament adopted a Law on the Status of Former Soviet Citizens
 which stipulates that registered permanent resident noncitizens also enjoy the
 rights to establish and change residences within Latvia, travel abroad, and return
 to Latvia. The law also provides for issuance of new noncitizen travel documents
 verilying these rights. By year's end, the Government had reportedly contracted
 with a firm to produce these documents, but they were not yet available.
 In the interim, and in apparent contradiction with the Law on Former Soviet Citi-
 zens, the CID continued to require departing noncitizens to obtain separate reentry
 permits. Moreover, because of a continuing shortage of the former Soviet passports
 previously issued to noncitizen1, foreign travel for some noncitizens was temporarily
 restricted in mid-1995. This situation was largely alleviated in the latter half of the
 year when the CID began to issue temoray noncitizen identification documents,
 valid for 2 years and accepted as travel documents by key foreign countries.
 Latvia is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees and does not
 have a law on poitical asym Most of those seeking refugee status are persons
 from the Middle East and Central Asia entering by land from Russia or Belarus and
 hoping to reach Scandinavia; Latvia usually attempts to return such asylum seek-
 ers but neighboring countries are generally willing to accept only their own citizens
 or legal residents.
 One group of over 100 asylum seekers was repeatedly shuttled in a train among
 border posts in Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. After being detained in the train
 under deplorable conditions, the group was finally transferred to a substandard de-
 tention center outside Riga. In December most of these asylum seekers were trans-
 ferred to a newly constructed building at the same location, furnished with the help
 of the Swedish Government, where they remained in detention. Latvian authorities
 remained unwilling to grant asylum to these persons, who were attempting to reach
 Sweden, and no other country was prepared to accept them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Latvia held free and fair elec-
 tions for Parliament (the Saeima) in September and October, with the participation
 of numerous parties and factions representing a broad political spectrum. Can-
 didates from 11 parties won seats in the Saeima, and 72 percent of eligible voters
 participated.
 Although international observers deemed the parliamentary elections to be free
 and fair, the elections law passed in May barred the candidacy of any citizen who
 remained "active" in the Communist Party or various other pro-Soviet organizations
 after January 13 1991. Furthermore, there was a Latvian-language requirement for
 candidates. The law granted wide authority to the Central Elections Commission to
 interpret and apply these relatively vague provisions, and it struck the names of
 
 
 over a dozen of the nearly 1,000 persons on parties' candidate lists. Local elections
 commissions took inadequate steps in some locations to insure that voters could
 make their choices in private booths, but there were no allegations that voters were
 subject to improper pressure or influence.
 There are no ethnic restrictions on political participation, and some nonethnic
 Latvians serve in various elected bodies. There was no mechanism for the many
 residents of Latvia who were not citizens to participate in the elections.
 Following the restoration of independence in 1991, citizenship was immediately
 accorded only to those persons who were citizens of the independent Latvian repub-
 lic in 1940 and their direct descendants. Owing to the russification policy pursued
 during the Soviet era, ethnic Latvians make up only about 54 percent of the total
 population and do not constitute a majority in seven of the eight largest cities. More
 than 70 percent of the registered residents of Latvia are citizens, almost 400,000
 of whom are not ethnic Latvian.
 Under provisions of a July 1994 law, various categories of noncitizens become eli-
 gible to apply for naturalization over a period extending from 1995 until early in
 the next century. Highest priority was given to spouses of Latvian citizens, citizens
 of other Baltic states, and persons born in Latvia. The law includes a Latvian lan-
 guage and residence requirement as well as restrictions on naturalization of several
 groups including former Soviet KGB and military officers. The law requires appli-
 cants for citizenship to renounce previous non-Latvian citizenship, to have knowl-
 edge of the Constitution and Latvian history, and to take a loyalty oath.
 International observers including the resident Organization of Security and Co-
 operation in Europe (OSCE) mission credit the Government with establishing a com-
 petent and professional naturalization board with offices throughout the country to
 implement the 1994 law. Early experience suggested that the board sought to apply
 the law fairly, although international observers expressed some concern that tests
 of Latvian language and history might be overly difficult for some applicants. Just
 under 1,000 persons were naturalized in 1995. The reason for this small number
 may include potential applicants' lack of confidence about their language ability, the
 time needed to establish naturalization and testing procedures, the restricted cat-
 egory of applicants eligible to seek naturalization in the first year, and 1995 amend-
 ments to the citizenship law which granted automatic citizenship (rather than re-
 quiring naturalization) for certain persons. These liberalizing amendments, which
 applied to all ethnic Latvians returning to the country (primarily those returning
 from Russia whose families were not Latvian citizens in 1940) as well as to persons
 successfully completing secondary education in Latvian language schools, allowed
 s-veral thousand additional persons to register as citizens.
 International experts, government officials, and domestic human rights monitors
 agreed that Latvia must continue to place high priority and devote sufficient re-
 sources to implementing the naturalization law in a fair, impartial manner. The
 Government must also provide greater opportunities for noncitizens to learn Lat-
 vian.
 The CID, which has administrative responsibility for registering noncitizens, has
 frequently failed to implement properly and fairly laws affecting noncitizens, most
 often by denyng noncitizen residents' applications for permanent resident status.
 Negative CID decisions are subject to judicial review. However, the CID sometimes
 refused to comply when courts overturned negative CID decisions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A growing number of nongovernmental organizations devoted to research and ad-
 vocacy on human rights issues, including prison conditions and women's and chil-
 dren's rights, operate without government restriction. Several organizations deal
 with issues of concern to local ethnic Russians, presenting them to the courts and
 the press.
 The Government demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialog with nongovern-
 mental organizations working on human rights issues. It welcomed visits by human
 rights organizations and received delegations from, among others, the OSCE, the
 Council of Europe (COE), and the United Nations. A resident OSCE mission contin-
 ued to operate with a mandate to "address citizenship issues and other related mat-
 ters."
 Building on the recommendations of a special high-level team organized by the
 United Nations Development Program, the COE, and the OSCE, the Government
 adopted a national program for the protection and promotion of human rights, and
 the Parliament authorized creation of an independent human rights office to replace
 the interim office of a state minister for human rights. The human rights office has
 a mandate to provide information on human rights, inquire into individual coin-
 
 
 927
 plaints, and initiate its own investigations on alleged violations. Its permanent di-
 rector will be appointed by the Government, confirmed by the Saeima for a 4-year
 period, and subject to dismissal only under limited circumstances. The office began
 working under an acting director, as bf December she had been able to fill only some
 of the office's planned 26 positions owing to budget cuts stemming from the Govern-
 ment's financial difficulties.
 In 1995 the U.N. Human Rights Committee charged with monitoring compliance
 with the International Convenant on Civil and Political Rights expressed satisfac-
 tion at positive changes since 1990 and welcomed its "open and constructive dia-
 logue' with Latvia but registered concern and made suggestions on numerous is-
 sues, including prison conditions and the legal system, as well as the status of
 noncitizens and asylum seekers.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 According to the 1922 Constitution, all citizens are equal under the law. The 1991
 Constitutional Law, which modifies the Constitution, states that 'all persons in Lat-
 via" are equal under the law regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social status,
 political preference, or other grounds and grants equal rights to work and wages to
 "persons of all nationalities." However, the Constitutional Law limits to citizens the
 right to occupy state positions, establish political parties, and own land. Of Latvia's
 more than 2.5 million registered residents, there are more than 765,000 ethnic Rus-
 sians, 100,000 ethnic Belarusians, almost 70,000 ethnic Ukrainians, and more than
 60,000 ethnic Poles. Nearly 400,000 members of ethnic minorities are citizens.
 Women.--Sources indicate that domestic violence against women is fairly wide-
 spread and is often connected with alcohol abuse. There is anecdotal evidence sug-
 gesting that the entire legal system, including the courts, tends to downplay the se-
 riousness of domestic violence. Observers suggest that police are sometimes reluc-
 tant to make arrests in such cases. No government program exists specifically to
 assist victims of domestic abuse. Both adult and child prostitution are widespread
 and often linked with organized crime.
 Women possess the same legal rights as men. The Labor Code prohibits women
 from performing "hard jobs or jobs having unhealthy conditions" which are specified
 in a list agreed upon between the Cabinet and labor unions. Beyond this, the Code
 bans employment discrimination. In reality, women frequently face hiring and pay
 discrimination, especially in the emerging private sector. It is not unusual to see
 employment advertising which specifically seeks men. Sexual harassment of women
 in the workplace is reportedly common. Women apparently have not brought any
 discrimination suits before the courts.
 Women's advocacy groups are growing in size and number. They are involved in
 finding employment for women, lobbying for increased social benefits, assisting vic-
 tims of domestic abuse, and opposing the hazing of military recruits.
 Children.-Although it is government policy to ensure children's rights to basic
 health, welfare, and education, there is no general legislation outlining these rights,
 and the Government lacks resources necessary to provide them fully. Anecdotal evi-
 dence suggests that child abuse and abandonment are relatively widespread. A few
 children's advocacy groups are active, particularly in lobbying for legislation to pro-
 tect children's rights an for increased welfare payments for children. Although leg-
 islative gaps hampered efforts to win convictions in child molestation cases, law en-
 forcement authorities have won court suits to remove children from abusive parents
 and secured convictions in child prostitution cases.
 Although legislation provides for the establishment of special institutions for reha-
 bilitation and vocational training of juvenile offenders, the Government failed to
 budget funds for this purpose. Consequently, juveniles are frequently housed in reg-
 ular prison facilities sfter committing relatively minor offenses.
 People With Disabilities.-Latvia does not have a law banning discrimination
 against the disabled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons.
 It does not enforce a 1993 law requiring buildings to be accessible to wheelchairs,
 and most buildings are not. However, Riga has undertaken an extensive wheelchair-
 ramp program at intersections.
 Religious Minorities.-In May a mysterious bombing caused serious damage to the
 sole remaining synagogue in Riga. The President and other government officials im-
 mediately expressed their outrage, and the authorities actively investigated this in-
 cident. However, at year's end no arrests had been made.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Because the majority of ethnic minorities
 are not citizens, they have difficulty participating fully in civic life. Noncitizens who
 are temporary residents have particular difficulty. Prior to 1995, this group typically
 
 
 had resided in factory dormitories or housing units previously connected to the So-
 viet or Russian military.
 The adoption of a Law on the Status of Former Soviet Citizens who do not hold
 Latvian or any other citizenship was a major positive development in 1995, ending
 years of uncertainty about the legal status of more than 700,000 persons. This Law
 reiterates guarantees of basic human rights and provides noncitizens who have been
 permanent residents continuously since July 1 1992, with the rights to chang resi-
 dence, leave and return to Latvia, and invite ciose relatives to join them for the pur-
 pose of family reunification. It also required the registration of noncitizens regard-
 less of their housin gstatu, helping to resolve cases of persons previously unregis-
 tered because theylived in firmer Soviet military or dormitory housing. The law
 also provides for issuance of new travel documents specifying these rights (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 Various laws prohibit employment of noncitizens in certain categories, some of
 which appear to be reasonatle restrictions (e.g., only citizens can serve as Latvian
 diplomats) while others seem less justified (e.g., service as crewmembers on Latvian
 National Airlines). Parliament failed to adopt compromise proposals on employment
 restrictions.
 The language Law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions, enter-
 prises, and institutes* to know sufficient Latvian to carry out their profession. The
 Law also requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian in
 order to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language Law, there have been
 no reports of widespread dismissals, even in the city of Daugavpils, in which 87 per-
 cent of the population is not ethnically Latvian. Moreover, Russian is the prevailing
 language in state-industrial enterprises. Nevertheless, many non-Latvians believe
 that they have been disfranchised and that the language law discriminates against
 them, although there are no reports of widespread dismissals.
 Some ethmic Russians have also omplained of de facto discrimination resulting
 from the property laws which limit land ownership to citizens. Moreover,
 noncitizens wer given fewer privatization certificates (which can be used to pur-
 chase stocks and will eventually be usable to privatize apartments and land) than
 citizens. However, the law does allow land ownership by companies in which
 noncitizens own shares.
 The Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the language of instruc-
 tion in public schools where the pupils are primarily Russian speakers. It also sup-
 ports eight other minority language schools. Although all non-Latvian-speaking stu-
 dents in public schools are supposed to learn Latvian, there are shortages of Latvian
 teachers. State-funded university education is in Latvian, except for the medical
 school and some classes for outgoing seniors. Incoming students whose native lan-
 guage is not Latvian must pass a Latvian-language entrance examination. The Gov-
 ernment's stated goal is that all public schools eventually convert to Latvian as the
 language of instruction.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law on trade unions mandates that workers, ex-
 cept for the uniformed military, have the right to form and join labor unions of their
 own choosing. Union membership, which had been about 50 percent of the work
 force in 1993, continued to fall as workers left Soviet-era unions that include man-
 agement or were laid off as Soviet-style factories failed. Leaders of the two largest
 trade union confederations, the Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Latvian
 Trade Unions' Alliance of Employees, were among candidates of a "Labor and Jus-
 tice" coalition which gained less than 5 percent of the vote in the 1995 parliamen-
 tary elections. Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are developing con-
 tacts with European labor unions and international labor union organizations. In
 general, the trade union movement is undeveloped and still in transition from the
 socialist to the free market model.
 The law does not limit the right to strike. Although many state-owned factories
 are on the verge of bankruptcy and seriously behind in wage ayments, workers
 fear dismissal if they strike. While the law bans such dismissas, the Government
 has not effectively enforced these laws.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threaten to fire
 union members; these businesses usually provide better salaries and benefits than
 are available elsewhere. The Government's ability to protect the right to organize
 in the private sector is weak.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 929
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced. Inspectors from the Welfare Ministry's Labor
 Department enforce the ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 15, although those age 13 to 15 may work in certain jobs
 after school hours. Children are required to attend school for 9 years. The law re-
 stricts employment of those under age 18, for instance, by banning night shift or
 overtime work. State authorities are lax in their enforcement of child labor and
 school attendance laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In December the Government decided "in prin-
 ciple" to raise the minimum wage to about $70 (38 lats), far below the roughly $95
 (50 lats) which trade union officials describe as the bare minimum for survival.
 Many factories are virtually bankrupt and have reduced work hours. The Labor
 Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum workweek with at least one 24-
 hour rest period weekly, 4 weeks of annual vacation, and a program of assistance
 to working mothers with small children. The laws establish minimum occupational
 health and safety standards for the workplace, but these standards are frequently
 ignored.
