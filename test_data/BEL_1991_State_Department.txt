 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a longstanding parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarch, King Baudouin I, whose role is largely
 ceremonial. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the
 Prime Minister, is responsible for government decisions. The
 Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the confidence of
 the democratically elected bicameral Parliament.
 National, municipal, and judicial police forces bear the primary
 responsibility for domestic security in Belgium. The armed
 forces play no role in domestic law enforcement. In 1991
 Parliament passed legislation which shifts control over the
 Gendarmerie (National Police Force) from the Defense Minister
 to the Interior and Justice Ministers in order to make it more
 responsive to political and judicial authorities.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a mixed, free
 market economy. A vigorous dominant private sector, with
 government participation in certain industries, and an
 extensive social welfare system support a relatively high
 standard of living for most Belgians.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium is provided for in the
 Constitution and laws and observed in practice. The Government
 is sensitive to allegations of human rights violations. In a
 decree issued in 1991, the European Court of Human Rights
 criticized the Belgian judicial system for failing to act
 swiftly on criminal law cases; the Government responded with
 legislation, approved by Parliament, to hire more magistrates.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are not
 known to occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or inhuman treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is provided for
 by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement
 is allowed only under certain legally specified circumstances.
 The premise for such confinement is subject to monthly review
 by a panel of judges, which may extend pretrial detention based
 on carefully circumscribed criteria (e.g., if, in the court's
 view, the arrested person would be likely to commit further
 crimes or attempt to flee if released). Arrested persons are
 allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their choosing or, if they
 cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed by the State.
 Bail exists in principle under Belgian law but is rarely
 granted in practice. Exile is not permitted by law.

 Following publication in 1990 of the findings of a special
 parliamentary investigatory committee which strongly criticized
 the law enforcement agencies for failing to deal adequately
 with organized crime, Parliament in 1991 adopted a bill that
 established two permanent control committees over the police
 and intelligence services. The committees must report to
 Parliament, may issue opinions on policy matters, and have an
 independent investigatory arm empowered to requisition documents
 and call witnesses, including law enforcement officers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is assured by law and honored in practice..
 A suspect is formally charged, if the evidence so warrants,
 once a preliminary judicial investigatory phase is completed.
 Charges are clearly and formally stated, and there is a
 presumption of innocence. Defendants have the right to be
 present, the right to counsel, provided at public expense if
 needed, and the right to confront witnesses and present
 evidence.  Defendants enjoy the right of appeal. The
 judiciary's independence is provided for by the Constitution
 and observed in practice. Imprisonment for political beliefs
 is prohibited. Belgium also has a system of military tribunals,
 before which military personnel are tried for both military and
 common law crimes. One civilian judge sits on the panel. The
 accused has the right of appeal to a higher'military court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Search
 warrants issued by a judge are required, unless the residents
 of a domicile agree to a search. Prior to the dissolution of
 Parliament in October, legislation was enacted allowing judges
 discretion to order wiretapping in narrowly circumscribed cases
 to further judicial investigations into serious crime.
 Parliament alsoenacted privacy legislation aimed at restricting
 the data which authorities may collect and regulating access
 thereto. There is no forced political membership or other
 coercive control of the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are assured by law and respected in practice.
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech
 and press. Academic freedom is respected.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks
 but does not control program content. Programs are supervised
 by boards of directors which represent the main political,
 linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representative
 sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and
 television stations.operate with government licenses. Almost
 all homes have access by cable to television from other Western
 European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is subject to regulations concerning public
 order but is otherwise unrestricted. Groups protesting
 government policies or actions are free from harassment and
 
 
 1060
 BELGIUM
 persecution. Permits are required for open-air assemblies but
 are granted routinely, although there are restrictions on
 blocking major arteries to and from downtown Brussels and on
 entering a small zone near the Royal Palace and Parliament.
 Belgians are free to form organizations and establish ties to
 international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The Roman
 Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, Jewish, and Muslim religions
 are accorded a "recognized" status in law and granted a
 government subsidy. Minority "non-recognized" religions enjoy
 full freedom to practice and are not subject to harassment or
 persecution. Organized religions may establish places of
 worship and train numbers of clergy adequate to serve believers.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists in other countries,
 and foreign missionaries may proselytize. By law, all
 officially "recognized" religions have the right to provide
 teachers to give religious instruction in the schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Belgians are free to travel both at home and abroad and may
 return to Belgium at any time. Emigration is not restricted,
 nor is citizenship revoked for political reasons. Citizens are
 free to choose their places of work and residence.
 The Government does not force political refugees to return to
 countries where they face persecution. Due to the heavy influx
 of refugees, Parliament in 1991 adopted legislation designed to
 speed up the processing of applications, and screening has been
 tightened for Ghanaian, Indian, Pakistani, and Polish asylum
 seekers. The Government in 1987 issued an exception to five
 municipalities which, because of the large immigrant proportion
 of their population (generally more than 40 percent), are not
 required to accept additional foreigners for residence. In
 breach of this regulation, a number of other municipalities in
 1991 refused to register additional foreigners.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the democratic political system is open to all
 citizens. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats
 (excluding 77 of the 183 senate seats apportioned by other
 means) are held at least every 4 years under a system of
 universal, secret, and compulsory suffrage for all adults (age
 18 and over). Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been
 in effect since 1919 for men and 1949 for women. In law and
 practice, opposition parties are free to operate without
 constraints or repression. There are no restrictions, in law
 or in practice, on the participation of women or minorities in
 government or politics. Of the 19 political parties,
 representing the full range of the political spectrum, that
 competed in the general elections in November, 12 gained seats
 in the new Parliament, but no party won a majority.
 Negotiations for a new coalition were continuing at year's
 end.
 The existence of Dutch-, French- and German-speaking communities
 engenders significant complexities for the State. All major
 institutions, including political.parties, are divided along
 linguistic lines. There are special provisions for Dutch-,
 
 
 1061
 BELGIUM
 French-, and German-speaking councils at the regional level.
 Regional and linguistic needs are taken into account in national
 political and economic decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several active independent human rights groups exist. The
 Ministry of Justice and other governmental agencies are
 sensitive to allegations of human rights abuses and take steps
 to correct perceived shortcomings in national legislation. No
 requests have been made for outside investigation of the human
 rights situation in Belgium. The Government is a party to
 various international human rights treaties and has been active
 in international forums in promoting human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally vibrant, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences in general are respected and linguistic
 rights in particular are protected. Some 60 percent of Belgians
 are native Dutch speakers living primarily in the northern
 provinces that constitute Flanders. The 40 percent of the
 population who are French speakers live mostly in the capital,
 Brussels, and the southern provinces of Wallonia. A small
 minority of German speakers lives along the eastern border.
 Language differences have been the subject of hundreds of laws
 over the last century, leading to a fairly rigid structure
 designed to protect each language group from cultural,
 economic, or political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 residents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social
 status, or ethnic background. Some 27 percent of the residents
 of Brussels, the nation's largest city, are foreigners. Many
 of these are North African and Turkish immigrants. Encouraging
 the further integration of the immigrant population and dealing
 with new influxes of asylum seekers and Eastern European
 immigrants is increasingly a focus of public debate. The
 immigrant influx has also nurtured the growth of the extreme
 rightist, openly anti-immigrant Flemish "Vlaams Blok". Running
 on a "Belgium for Belgians." platform in the November 1991
 national elections, the party increased its representation in
 Parliament from 3 to 12 seats.
 In May Brussels was the scene of a series of'riots by Moroccan
 and other immigrant youths, apparently reacting to frequent
 police patrols checking identity papers. The Government
 responded by attempting to improve the dialog with the immigrant
 community and address problems of youth unemployment, but many
 underlying integration issues have yet-to be-addressed.
 Belgium is an advocate of women's rights, both within the
 country and in international meetings on the subject. A number
 of commissions have been established to ensure that women's
 rights are protected and to oversee women's education and
 working conditions. To highlight the importance attached to
 promoting women's rights internationally, a consultative
 commission for the condition of women was established within
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A women's center is being
 constructed at government expense.
 
 
 1062
 BELGIUM
 Physical abuse of women is punishable by law, and the law is
 enforced. In reaction to a 1988 government study which
 concluded that 25 percent of Belgian women had encountered some
 form of physical abuse, new legislation on sexual abuse was
 enacted in 1989, broadening the scope of the previous
 legislation to allow for prosecution of conjugal sexual abuse
 and making penalties more severe. Certain sexual abuse cases
 may be tried before A court of assizes, a higher court than the
 usual district court.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike. With
 an estimated 70 percent of its labor force organized, Belgium
 is one of the most unionized countries in the world and has a
 long tradition of democratic trade union elections. Unions
 striking or protesting government policies or actions are free
 from harassment and persecution. In certain narrowly defined
 circumstances, such as the provision of essential public
 services, the right to strike of public employees may be
 limited.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but
 have important informal links with, and influence on, many of
 the major political parties. Unions in Belgium are affiliated
 with the major international bodies representing labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is recognized
 and exercised freely. In the fall, management and the leading
 unions reached a nationwide collective bargaining agreement
 covering 2.4 million private sector workers, which set the
 framework for negotiations at branch and plant levels.
 The right to due process and judicial review are guaranteed for
 all protected activity. Effective mechanisms exist for
 adjudicating disputes between labor and management. Belgium
 maintains a system of labor tribunals and regular courts which
 hear disputes arising from labor contracts, collective
 bargaining agreements, and other matters. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 14, but there is
 compulsory schooling until the age of 18. New legislation has
 been submitted tightening conditions of child labor in show
 business and related occupations. The labor courts effectively
 monitor compliance with national laws and standards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage rates in the private sector are set in biennial
 nationwide negotiations between the leading trade unions and
 the Belgian Business Federation. After agreement is reached, a
 formal collective bargaining agreement is signed by the National
 Labor Council and is made mandatory upon the entire private
 sector by royal decree. In the public sector, the minimum wage
 
 
 1063
 BELGIUM
 is determined in negotiations between the Government' and the
 public service unions. These wages provide an adequate minimum
 standard of living for full-time workers over age 21. By law,
 workers in the private sector receive at least 4 weeks of
 vacation per year and an annual bonus equal to approximately 14
 percent of their annual wage. Unemployment benefits are also
 guaranteed.
 Working hours, mandated by law and through collective bargaining
 agreements, are among the shortest in Europe. A maximum 40-hour
 week is mandated by law, although many collective agreements
 call for workweeks between 36 and 39 hours.
 Comprehensive health and safety legislation is supplemented by
 collective bargaining agreements on safety issues. The Labor
 Ministry implements this legislation through a team of
 inspectors and determines whether a worker qualifies for
 disability and medical benefits. Health and safety committees
 are mandated by law in companies with more than 50 employees
 and by works councils in companies with more than 100 employees.
 Labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national laws
 and standards.
