 COMOROS*
 The Federal and Islamic Republic of Comoros has been indepen-
 dent since July 6, 1975. However, it existed without a
 constitution until the return to power in 1978 of Ahmed
 Abdallah, assisted by the same group of (largely French)
 fighters who had removed him after one month of rule in 1975.
 A constitution was adopted by popular referendum October 1,
 1978, and Abdallah was elected President on October 22,
 1978. As a result of political turmoil in its early years,
 its small size, isolation, and lack of resourceS, Comoros is
 among the world's poorest and least developed countries.
 The population's poor state of health is the result of wide-
 spread malnutrition, contaminated water supplies, and inade-
 quate health services. Comoros depends on four cash crops for
 virtually all foreign exchange earnings and has a chronic
 foreign trade deficit.
 The overthrow of the Ali Soilih regime was greeted with
 relief by most Comorians, as his government had become
 increasingly repressive. President Ahmed Abdallah has
 ruled with a far lighter hand but has occasionally resorted
 to censorship and repressive action to discourage criticism
 and stop. some manifestations of political opposition. Ahmed
 .Abdallah ran unopposed in the presidential campaign of 1978
 and was elected by a 99 percent vote. Elections for various
 subordinate government positions and bodies were contested,
 but the officially-backed candidates usually were elected.
 All political parties have been banned for a period of 12
 years.
 1. Respect for the-Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The federal constitution, adopted on October 1, 1978, guaran-
 tees certain rights on the basis of the Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights and specifies that penal law and procedures
 are to be governed by federal-law,.but does not mention
 torture specifically. No recent cases of torture have been
 reported.
 b. Cruel,.Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Pive persons were killed during the Nay 1978 coup, and
 Chief of State Ali Soilih was killed in the coup's aftermath
 under circumstances that are not clear. Conditions of deten-
 tion have always been poor in the Comoros and prisoners have
 to depend on food provided by their relatives. Common law
 prisoners, however, have traditionally been allowed out during
 the day to work in their fields.
 c. Disappearances
 No instances of disappearance have been reported in 1981.
 *There is no United States Mission in the Comoros Islands
 and the United States has only limited information about the
 human rights situation there.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A number of persons, most of them former government offi-
 cials, were arrested immediately following the May 1978
 coup and are to be tried for crimes committed under the
 old regime. At an extraordinary session starting August
 29, 1979, the national assembly began consideration of
 the establishment of a special court to try these indi-
 viduals. According to a critical press article in a nearby
 country, a number of other individuals have been arrested
 since the coup on suspicion of plotting against the state.
 The government admits to holding about twenty persons from the
 old regime, but other estimates of individuals held for
 political reasons have been as high as fifty. Amnesty
 International Report 1981 estimates that about 31 individuals
 have been held without trial since the present government took
 power in 1978. Some of these persons were brought to trial in
 1980 (see below).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The new penal laws and procedures called for by the constitu-
 tion are yet to be established, and presumably French law
 still applies with all its guarantees. The constitution
 specifies the right of all citizens to trial, and to legal
 defense. The long-planned trials of imprisoned military
 officers, accused of having participated in a 1978 "massacre"
 of 12 persons under the Ali Soilih regime, took place in
 December 1980. Fourteen officers received sentences ranging
 from life imprisonment to six months incarceration. The
 trials were conducted by a specially created 15-member court
 and, according to the press, were public and broadcast on the
 radio. It is not known whether any other prisoners await
 judgment by the special court. Two prisoners, according to
 the press, were released in May 1980 as a clemency measure.
 The constitution guarantees the independence of judges and
 calls for public trials, "except in certain specified cases".
 The latter are not identified.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides qualified protection for the
 inviolability of the home "on the conditions prescribed
 by the laws of the Republic".
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms appear generally to be enjoyed in the Comoros,
 although under the real constraints imposed by the country's
 poverty. There is only one information medium, the national
 radio which has always been government-owned and operated; it
 cannot be received throughout the country. There is no
 written newspaper. Since 1978, there have been two reported
 cases of outside publications being banned from the country
 and one case of a foreign reporter being evicted arbitrarily.
 There have been reports of a few instances of the security
 forces breaking up gatherings of students demonstrating
 against the government. One such gathering occurred at the
 grave of Ali Soilih. Islam is the state religion of the
 Comoros, but the practice of other religions is allowed.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration-and Repatriation
 There are no obstacles to internal and external travel
 or emigration.
 c. Freedom .to Participate in the Political Process
 :The new constitution guarantees everyone the right to vote.
 The government is reported to have used subtle intimidation
 measures to influence the various elections held in late
 1978 and the continued presence of a small number of Euro-
 pean military advisers is a deterrent to the full exercise
 .of. political rights by the opposition. While opposition
 candidates did get votes, most government-backed candidates
 won. Considerable liberty of expression was noted in the
 process of establishing the new government's institutions.
 The right of labor to strike is guaranteed by the constitu-
 tion-but is not known to have been exercised. While the
 rights of women are guaranteed, their exercise is discour-
 aged by tradition.   .Political parties were banned by the
 president, but the prohibition was never published as
 required by law.
 3. .Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and.Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Comoros'isreceptive to visitors, and various inter-
 national organizations are represented in country dealing,
 with-economic development affairs. In reply to Amnesty
 Internationals queries about the fate of Ali Soilih and the
 imprisoned members of his government, the Ahmed Abdallah
 government has stated that Soilih was killed trying to
 escape and affirmed -that the detainees would receive fair
 .trials in open.courts which international observers would be
 allowed to attend.
 7Amnesty .International has also protested reported death
 sentences pronounced against four Comorian prisoners for
 acts.which they had performed while officials of the Ali
 Soilih government. The.four men are Salim Hamidi, a former
 Minister of Interior, Ali Toihir Kefe, formerly responsible
 for national defense, Amahada Mohamed and Aboul Wahamed.
 -The latter two men are identified simply as former members
 of the Ali Soilih government. The-death sentence was
 reportedly pronounced by a special tribunal headed by
 President Ahmed Abdallah- and composed of government ministers
 -which had been set-up to try such cases. In a subsequent
 broadcast, the Comorian government denied Amnesty Inter-
 'national's.statement-and said no death sentences had been
 pronounced.
 The International Federation of the Rights of Man issued
 a critical report on the Comoros' treatment of political
 prisoners in mid 1980. The. 1981 Amnesty International
 report cites concerns about detention without trial, unfair
 trials, ill-treatment of prisoners and harsh prison condi-
 tions. In response toan invitation from the Comoran
 governmentan Amnesty International mission visited the
 Comoros in late May 1981. No report on the mission has been
 released.

 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The economy of the Comoros was affected severely when the
 French ended their subsidies in 1975 following the island's
 unilateral declaration of independence. In 1978 relations
 with France were restored, and France is providing military,
 technical, and financial assistance. International donor
 institutions, some Arab countries and western European coun-
 tries have also provided assistance to both the Ali Soilih
 regime and the present government. Ahmed Abdallah has stated
 that he believes strongly in free enterprise and the principal
 government intervention in the economy at this time is price
 control at the retail level. Most of the islanders are
 illiterate and poor, living on subsistence agriculture,
 fishing, or working in the vanilla and essential oil planta-
 tions which provide the principal Comorian exports. There are
 serious deficiencies in food, clothing, shelter, and health
 care.
 The best available figures available show GNP per capita
 at U.S. $180, the infant mortality rate at slightly over
 20 percent, and life expectancy currently at 41 years
 for men and 44 years for women. Virtually all children
 between 4 and 6 undergo studies in Arabic in Koranic
 school. Primary enrollment averages 63 percent, with
 75 percent for boys and 51 percent for girls. Secondary
 school figures are 25 percent overall, with 35 percent
 for boys and 16 percent for girls.
 The water system provides running water to approximately
 ten percent of the population. The country has a serious
 problem of deforestation and erosion. Agriculture is the
 primary economic activity involving some 80 percent of
 the population, constituting 40 percent of the GNP, and
 providing virtually all foreign exchange earnings. Annual
 average population growth between 1966 and 1980 was 4 percent.
 There are two hospitals and five clinics for the three islands,
 with a total of 663 beds, and 45 health centers. Malaria
 parasites are said to exist in the blood stream of 80 percent
 of the population.
