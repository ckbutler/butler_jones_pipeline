 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia, a member of the British Commonwealth, has a
 multi-party parliamentary democracy which is the legacy of
 pre-1979 rule by the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, John
 Compton, was democratically elected in May 1982.
 Although the country's first two years as an independent nation
 were marked by political disruption, throughout this period
 constitutional processes prevailed. Prime Minister Compton's
 steady emphasis on promoting economic development has increased
 political stability in the last two years and a half, but
 potential instability remains, due to the country's still
 fragile economy and the large number of unemployed youth.
 The only security force in the country is the police. Its
 Special Service Unit is specifically trained for national
 defense. A coast guard is being developed. The force is small
 but is imbued with traditions of integrity, professionalism and
 respect for human rights.
 St. Lucia continues to have an excellent human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports in 1984 of killing for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The St. Lucian Government abides by the Constitution, which
 prohibits arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and provides that
 anyone arrested shall be brought before a court within 72
 hours. There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or
 other forms of detention or forced exile in 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Accused persons are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty. The Constitution also guarantees
 the provision of legal counsel. St. Lucia's appeals court is
 the regional West Indies Court of Appeal, which is known for
 its impartiality.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary search and
 entry are observed by the authorities. There are no reports of
 arbitrary intrusion of the State into the private life of the
 individual.

 ST. LUCIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees these freedoms, and they are
 respected in practice. St. Lucia has two party-supported
 newspapers which present various shades of opinion. There are
 privately owned radio and television stations as well as the
 Government-owned Radio St. Lucia. There is no censorship of
 the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In St. Lucia's pluralistic society there are no restrictions on
 public meetings. Opposition groups organize freely. Workers
 have the right to form trade unions, to elect their officers,
 to conduct union activities free of government intervention,
 and to engage in collective bargaining. The right to strike
 exists in the private sector if Government-sponsored efforts to
 resolve disputes fail. Trade unions represent the majority of
 wage and salary earners and historically have played a
 prominent role in the economic and political life of the nation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Lucia. The
 majority of the population is Roman Catholic.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in the Constitution and are
 generally honored in practice. The Government restricted the
 travel of sixteen St. Lucian citizens who had planned to travel
 to Libya in 1983. The Government said that they were going to
 receive terrorist training and invoked national security as the
 basis for the revocation of their passports. In fact their
 freedom to travel anywhere outside the country has been
 withheld for the present. Debate on this issue continues in
 the opposition press.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Lucia has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a genuine choice of parties,
 policies, and officials. Its political system continues to be
 vigorous. Opposition parties play an active role in and out of
 Parliament, where they have 3 of 17 seats. Parliamentary
 elections were last held in 1982 and by law must be held again
 before May 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no reports on St. Lucia by international human
 rights bodies or any requests for investigations into human
 rights violations. The major domestic organization that
 follows human rights developments is the multi-denominational
 St. Lucia Christian Council. Freedom House in 1984 rated St.
 Lucia 'free.' The 1984 report of Amnesty International did not
 cover St. Lucia.

 ST. LUCIA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 St. Lucia, an island of 238 square miles, has a population of
 120,000, half of which is under 25 years of age. The 1984
 population growth rate was 1.1 percent. There is a high
 emigration rate.
 The country relies heavily on banana exports and subsistence
 agriculture. Bananas account for about 60 percent of the
 country's export earnings.
 St. Lucia's estimated per capita Gross Domestic Product [GDP]
 is $926 per year. Over the past six years, St. Lucia has
 channeled more than 20 percent of its total recurrent
 expenditures into education, in an effort to expand secondary
 schooling. School attendance is compulsory between the ages of
 5 and 15. Elementary school enrollment includes 95 percent of
 those eligible; however, shortages of facilities and classroom
 space severely limit secondary school enrollment.
 The national insurance scheme provides for an increase in
 medical care; in-patient care at the general hospital is free
 of charge. Ninety-seven percent of the population has access
 to health care centers within three miles of their residence.
 The infant mortality rate is 21.4 per thousand live births.
 Life expectancy at birth is approximately 72 years.
 One-hundred percent of the population has access to safe
 water. The literacy'rate is estimated to be over 75 percent.
 There are no restrictions on the role of women on St. Lucia.
 Women are well-represented in government and the professions,
 although the more traditional household role is the predominant
 one for females. The importance of women in other sectors of
 society is expected to increase as women take advantage of
 public schooling and other government programs which are
 administered non-discriminatorily.
