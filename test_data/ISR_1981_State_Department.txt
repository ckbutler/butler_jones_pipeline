 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 
 From its inception in 1948, the State of Israel found
 itself in a continuing state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors, owing to the refusal of the latter to accept
 its existence and to agree to live in peace with it.
 Israel has been subjected to an increasing number of terror-
 ist attacks including bombings and other forms of violence,
 including for a brief time this year rocket assaults of
 Northern Israeli towns. The absence of peace treaties be
 tween Israel and its Arab neighbors (with the notable
 exception of Egypt) makes security a dominant concern and
 affects many facets of Israel's national life.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees
 by law the civil and political rights of its citizens.
 The human rights situation in Israel was virtually unchanged
 in 1981 from previous years. The government worked to
 improve both the material well-being of its citizens and
 the overall quality of life. The presence of an Arab
 minority presents Israel with the challenge of integrating
 into its society a group which has strong and varied ties
 with Arab communities in states around Israel and which does
 not fully share the Zionist principles upon which the state
 was founded.
 ISRAEL
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Israel. Israeli laws governing
 the rules of evidence state that any evidence or confession
 obtained under duress is inadmissable as legal evidence.
 The administrative codes of conduct of both the prison and
 the police authorities contain stringent sanctions against
 the use of force or brutality. Police officers accused of
 employing brutality or violence on prisoners or suspects
 may be prosecuted either in administrative courts, for
 violation of the code of conduct, or in regular criminal
 courts for criminal assaults, or both. There were no reports
 of torture in 1981.
 *   Because of the sharply differing politico-social envi-
 ronments in Israel and in the Arab territories Israel has
 occupied since the 1967 war, the respective human rights
 situations are treated in separate but parallel fashion.

 995
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is prohibited
 in Israel, and law enforcement normally is carried out
 without the excessive use of force.
 A special committee report on police methods was published
 on February 4, 1980. Prepared largely by police and court
 officials in Tel Aviv, the report found that police officers
 had used unauthorized force in the investigation of a rela-
 tively small number of criminal cases. The report suggested
 that violence is caused by a failure to implement existing
 regulations. It recommended the establishment of indepen-
 dent investigative units and that the police be required to
 publish results of court actions and disciplinary tribunals
 involving violence by police officers.
 Israel acknowledges problems of serious overcrowding in
 its prisons, but has not undertaken significant corrective
 measures in recent years.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports that such practices occur in Israel.
 They would be prosecutable as criminal acts if they did
 occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other
 procedural and substantive safeguards are employed and de-
 fendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention is legal. There were no known
 instances of its use in 1981.
 Under the provisions of article III of the Defense Emergency
 Regulations, judicial review is required at several crucial
 points in the process of applying administrative detention.
 Any individual who is the subject of administrative deten-
 tion must be brought before a judge of the appropriate
 district court within 96 hours of his being taken into
 custody. The detainee has the right to appeal to the
 president of the court. Each case of administrative deten-
 tion must be subjected to judicial review every three months
 thereafter for the entire period of detention. Both at the
 time of the initial order of detention and at each subsequent
 review, the judicial authority is empowered to rule on both
 the procedural and substantive aspects of the case.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. With the
 exception of security cases, all trials are open. In
 security cases, Israeli law provides that part or all of a
 trial may be closed, with the burden of justifying in camera
 proceedings falling on the prosecution. Counsel is always
 present during closed proceedings. Amnesty International
 
 
 996
 in its 1981 annual report expressed concern about the
 secrecy in certain military trials under the Defense
 Emergency Regulations in Israel, particularly noting
 with concern the strict military censorship which sur-
 rounded the trial of 60 Israeli Arabs arrested in early
 1981.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home. There have been no recorded il-
 legal invasions of the home in 1981.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Respect of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Israelis of all faiths and ethnic groups are guaranteed by
 law freedom of religion, expression and assembly. An
 anti-proselytizing measure, adopted by the Knesset in late
 1977, outlaws the offering of bribes or material benefits
 as an inducement to religious conversions. It continues to
 cause uneasiness among certain Christian groups in Israel.
 In a clarification placed in the Knesset record on January
 15, 1979, the minister of justice stated that the law is not
 intended to restrict the religious freedom of any community,
 or to impede them from the pursuit of normal educational or
 philanthropic activities. The attorney general has ordered
 that no action be taken under the law without his express
 permission, and the law has never been employed.
 Freedom of speech, with a few exceptions, is a basic right
 in Israel. Both the Hebrew and Arabic press are free and
 express a wide variety of political opinions, although all
 media are subject to censorship on security and military
 matters. In 1980, the Order for Prevention of Terror Law
 was passed to forbid tangible public manifestations of
 support for organizations defined as terrorist. Such acts
 could include, illustratively, flying- certain flags, dis-
 playing slogans, or publicly expressing support for such
 organizations. In September 1981, two Israeli Arab students
 were convicted and sentenced to 3-4 month prison terms under
 the Prevention of Terror Law, for helping to produce and
 distribute a pamphlet "supporting the PLO struggle against
 the Zionist entity." The two were the first convicted
 under this provision.
 Human rights groups in Israel work for the protection of
 individual liberties and the government maintains an office
 of human rights in the ministry of foreign affairs.
 
 
 997
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Law of Return of 1950 abolished all restrictions
 on Jewish immigration, and the citizenship law of 1952
 granted every Jew the right to citizenship upon arrival in
 Israel. Since 1948, Israel has taken in well over one
 million largely impoverished Jewish refugees from Europe,
 the Middle East and North Africa, and has worked to inte-
 grate them fully into its society and economy. Integration
 of smaller numbers of immigrants continues.
 Israeli Arabs from the northern towns of Ikrit and Baram,
 who were evacuated from their towns during military oper-
 ations in their region in 1948, have not been permitted
 to return to their homes, despite assurances at the time
 that they would be permitted to do so.
 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of Decem-
 ber 11, 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees who
 left their homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they
 are willing to live in peace or, if they so choose, to be
 compensated for their losses. Israel has not recognized
 the validity of this resolution, pointing out the losses of
 its own citizens who fled Arab states, but has on occasion
 in the past indicated willingness to take back some refu-
 gees in the context of a final settlement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multi-party
 system. All Israeli citizens, including Arabs, enjoy the
 freedom to vote and to participate in the political process.
 The organized labor movement functions without hindrance
 and wields substantial political and economic power. The
 right to strike is exercised frequently and effectively.
 Most workers, Arab and Jewish, are members of the Histadrut,
 the general confederation of workers.
 Because of the explicitly Jewish character of the state, and
 the continuing state of war between Israel and most of its
 Arab neighbors, the Arab minority tends to feel powerless
 and largely alienated. Several Arabs are members of the
 Knesset, Israel's parliament.
 Since the founding of the state, Jewish women have played
 an active role in every sphere of life in Israel, including
 the political process. Seven women are members of the
 Knesset.
 
 
 998
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding the International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 This subject is discussed in part three of the section on
 the occupied territories.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Israel is a welfare state with a mixed economy. Per capita
 GNP in 1979 was $4,150 (1979 dollars). Income distribution
 is relatively egalitarian, although because of the dif-
 ferences in education and cultural backgrounds, there
 remains an economic and social gap between the Ashkenazi
 (European) community, on the one hand, and the Sephardic
 (Middle Eastern) Jewish community (along with the Arab
 community), on the other.
 State education in either secular or religious schools
 is free and compulsory for all Israeli citizens through
 age fifteen. The primary school enrollment ratio is
 97 percent (1979) and the literacy rate 87 percent
 (1979). The parallel education systems in Israel for
 Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic respec-
 tively, show a disparity in quality with greater resour-
 ces per student going into the Jewish system. Neverthe-
 .less, the Arab literacy rate of 64 percent is one of
 the highest in the Middle East. Arabs, however, are
 not represented in institutions of higher learning in
 percentages that correspond to their proportion of the
 population.. Although there are no legal barriers to the
 admission of Arab citizens to institutions of higher
 learning, they make up only three percent of university
 students. (Arabs and other non-Jewish citizens consti-
 tute 16 percent of the total Israeli population.) Some
 Israeli Arabs seek education and employment abroad.
 Israel has an excellent health care system with one of
 the highest physician-to-patient ratios in the world.
 Life expectancy is 72 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is 1.8 percent. All of the population in Israel
 has access to safe water.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is held by
 the state or quasi-public organizations in trust for
 the Jewish people. Anyone, including Israeli Arabs,
 may purchase the remaining seven percent of privately-
 owned land through ordinary commercial transactions.
 There have been complaints that expropriations of Arab
 land (although subject to legal review as to purpose
 and amount of compensation) have been used for promoting
 Jewish settlement in densely Arab-populated areas.
 
 
 999
 Freedom House maintains in its annual report that,
 Arabs are, in effect, not allowed to buy land from
 Jews, and Arab land has been expropriated for Jewish
 settlement."
 The Arab minority has equal rights under the law, al-
 though discrimination reportedly occurs in such areas
 as employment and appointment to government positions.
 Some Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the
 civil service, generally in the Arab departments of gov-
 ernment ministries. Several Arabs are members of the
 Knesset, Israel's parliament. Druze and Circassians are
 subject to Israel's military draft and some Bedouins serve
 voluntarily in special units. Other Muslims and Christians
 are not permitted, and generally do not wish, to serve and
 therefore do not qualify for the many economic and social
 benefits that derive from military service. Despite limi-
 ted governmental and private efforts to bridge the gap,
 there is little social interaction between Israeli Arabs
 and Jews.
 The Equal Rights for Women Law (1951) formalized women's
 rights in Israel, granting them the right to own and deal
 in property and the right to guardianship of their children.
 It also abolished unilateral divorce by the husband, poly-
 gamy and child marriage. Minor females were included in
 compulsory education laws. Under the Employment of Women
 Law (1954), women have the right to work, at equal pay for
 equal work, without discrimination in the same jobs as men
 so long as they are physically able to do the job without
 impairing their health.
 Strong secular and religious forces contest changes in the
 status of women in Israel. Since the establishment of the
 state, all matters relating to the family have been handled
 by the religious courts. These courts, while operating
 within the confines of the law, base their decisions on
 religious law, which secular women reportedly find discrim-
 inatory in some instances.
 However, the religious family law includes the advanced
 legal concept protecting married women from marital
 rape. A ruling of the religious courts based on this
 concept was upheld in a 1980 appeal decision of the
 Israeli Supreme Court. A suggestion to alter Israeli
 criminal law to bring it into conformity with the more
 advanced religious concept has been approved by the gov-
 ernment.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories occupied in 1967 consist of the West Bank,
 East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula and
 the Golan Heights. Under the terms of the Egyptian-Israeli
 Treaty, Israel has evacuated some two-thirds of Sinai and
 complete evacuation of Sinai is to take place in April 1982.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied terri-
 tories, particularly in the West Bank and Gaza, where almost
 all of the settled Arab population is located, is largely a
 result of the tensions which exist between the occupying
 authorities and the indigenous population. Arab fears of
 creeping annexation--heightened by the December Knesset
 decree by which Israeli laws are to be applied to the
 Golan Heights as if that area were a part of Israel--
 combined with the cumulative abrasions of fourteen and
 one-half years of military occupation to produce continued
 unrest. Restrictions on Arabs with regard to building homes,
 establishing businesses, installing generators, or drilling
 wells, together with the continued establishment of new
 Israeli settlements and the continuing taking of Arab
 land--approximately one-third of the West Bank is now
 Israeli-controlled--continued to produce widespread Arab
 accusations that the long-term intention of the authorities
 was the gradual squeezing out of the Arab population.
 The occupied territories are under military government, and
 law enforcement and public security are in military rather
 than in civilian hands. A civilian administrator for civil
 affairs was appointed in 1981. The occupation authorities
 govern the territories with a combination of pre-existing
 law and military orders which does not offer to the inhabi-
 tants all the human rights guarantees available within
 Israel itself. The United Nations holds that the Fourth
 Geneva Convention concerning the protection of civilian
 populations under military occupation applies to Israel's
 governance of the occupied territories. Israel declares
 that it voluntarily observes most of the Fourth Convention's
 provisions, but that it does not accept that these territor-
 ies are within the purview of the convention.
 
 
 1001
 The major differences regard the applicability of those
 provisions prohibiting the introduction of civilian sett-
 lers from the occupying power into occupied territories
 (see Section 4) and prohibitions against the use of certain
 forms of punishment to maintain order (see Section Ib).
 In addition, Palestinian Arabs have complained that
 Israel has neglected its duty as an occupying power to
 provide adequate protection against vigilante actions by
 Israeli settlers and against common crime.
 The closing of Bir Zeit University by the military authori-
 ties following demonstrations there led to widespread pro-
 test demonstrations, in some cases involving Israelis, and
 to large-scale arrests and other retaliatory measures.
 Widespread protests in December over the imposition of
 Israeli taxes in Gaza resulted in hundreds of arrests, and
 the shooting of four schoolboys (one fatally) by Israeli
 soldiers during a demonstration in Rafah.
 Both Arabs and Jews resident in the occupied territories
 continued to suffer from terrorist acts, especially from
 bombings. Historically, responsibility for such acts has
 usually been claimed by Palestinian organizations located
 elsewhere in the Middle East, which are opposed to the ex-
 istence of Israel and to the peace process begun at Camp
 David.
 During 1981, Israel and Egypt resumed negotiations to de-
 fine the powers and responsibilities of the Self-Governing
 Authority that, pursuant to the September 1978 Camp David
 Accords, is to be established in the West Bank and Gaza,
 with further negotiations to follow to determine the final
 status of these territories no later than five years after
 this authority is established. The basic solution to the
 tensions that prevail on the West Bank is a new relation-
 ship in which Israel's security needs are fully assured
 and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are fulfilled.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Israeli authorities have stated repeatedly that torture is
 forbidden by Israeli law and that violators are punished.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Allegations of psychological pressures, physical maltreat-
 ment, and instances of brutality by Israeli officials
 during interrogation of Arab security suspects decreased
 in 1981 relative to previous years.
 
 
 1002
 
 Curfews, when they were imposed after security incidents
 had occurred, were of shorter duration than in 1980, but
 curfews still caused considerable hardship to many inhabi-
 tants of the areas placed under curfew. On at least six
 occasions, males in villages and refugee camps have been
 rounded up and held outdoors for extended periods of time,
 apparently as a form of general punishment for security
 incidents. In late October a former mayor of Ramallah was
 permitted to return after twelve years of exile. The exile
 of many other Palestinians leaders deported in previous
 years continued. There were no reported deportations in
 1981. Such deportations, as well as punitive curfews and
 mass punishments, contravene the Fourth Geneva Convention
 relating to the treatment of civilians in time of war.
 Conditions in prisons housing Palestinian prisoners con-
 tinue to be a problem. Overcrowding has been acknowledged
 by Israel prison authorities; however, no significant cor-
 rective measures were taken during 1981. Complaints con-
 cerning medical and dental treatment and sanitation con-
 tinue to be presented to international organizations and
 diplomatic missions. In accordance with recommendations
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as of
 June 1, 1981, identical food was served to detainees in
 the occupied territories and to those in Israel. In re-
 sponse to requests for accelerated access to detainees,
 Israel in 1978 agreed with the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) to allow its representatives
 resident in Israel and the occupied territories to visit
 detainees without witnesses during the period of their
 interrogation. They now can do so no later than the
 twelfth day after arrest to determine identity, state
 of health, and conditions of detention. On subsequent
 visits, allowed every 14 days, they are permitted complete
 freedom of discussion (i.e., beyond identity and health).
 Also Israel agreed to allow the immediate examination of
 the detainee by an approved physician, and to investigate
 any complaints as requested. Israel maintains that 97
 percent of all detainees are visited within the specified
 period, although in certain cases Israel can suspend noti-
 fication and visitation on security grounds.
 In addition to visits to detainees, ICRC delegates visit
 convicted Arab security prisoners in Israel and the occu-
 pied territories. Whenever the ICRC considers it necessary,
 the ICRC physician may conduct medical examinations without
 witnesses. The ICRC may submit inquiries about specific
 cases to the Israeli authorities. During the first half
 of 1981, the ICRC delegates made 1,263 visits to 647 de-
 tainees under interrogation on the West Bank and in the
 Gaza Strip. They visited some 3,000 other prisoners in
 some 15 places of detention in Israel and the occupied
 territories.
 
 
 1003
 On taking office in 1981, the new Israeli Government
 indicated its intention to eliminate some military
 checkpoints and abolish mass punishments in security
 cases. However, despite reductions in the number of
 checkpoints, the utilization of mass punishments con-
 tinued unabated.
 c. Disappearances.
 It was reported that arrests and detentions occasionally
 occurred in 1981 without prompt notification to the family.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment.
 Administrative detention (the imprisonment of individuals
 without formal charges or trial) is authorized under
 Israeli law, as well as under the Jordanian and British
 mandatory codes which were in force before 1967 in the
 West Bank and Gaza respectively, and which continue in
 force there. In mid-1979, Israeli authorities issued
 administrative regulations restricting the use of admin-
 istrative detention in Israel proper, and in early 1980
 extended the new regulations to the occupied territories
 as well. The regulations restrict the initial application
 of administrative detention and provide for more frequent
 review.
 As of September 1, 1981, there were about 2,448 non-Israeii
 citizen Arabs in prison for security offenses in Israel or
 in the territories. Of this number, four were under adminis-
 trative detention. One has been under administrative deten-
 tion without trial since 1975. Other suspected security
 offenders were awaiting trial. As of mid-October 1981 the
 sentences of at least 113 West Bankers and Gazans convicted
 of security and other criminal offenses has been commuted
 and the sentences of 62 others reduced.
 Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, administrative detention
 is not permissible beyond one year from the "general close
 of military operations." Israel maintains that administrative
 detention is occasionally necessary to prevent terrorist
 operations when a court proceeding would jeopardize sensitive
 security information. Administrative detainees have several
 forms of recourse from detention orders, but the right of
 appeal is rarely excercised. Appeals are not known to have
 resulted in a reversal of the decisions of the military
 authorities in 1981.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law as modified by Israeli authorities is
 in force in the West Bank in civil and criminal matters,
 as is British Mandatory law in Gaza. Its adjudication has
 been left in the hands of the Arab judiciary, which acts
 independently of the Israeli authorities. Residents of the
 occupied territories accused of non-security offenses
 receive public trials in local civilian courts. In the
 
 
 1004
 case of some Israeli settlements on the West Bank,
 Israeli courts and Israeli law function, even in
 cases involving Arabs.
 Alleged security offenders are tried in Israeli military
 courts, with a military judge trained in law presiding,
 and are defended by counsel. Most military trials are
 open to the public. There have been complaints from
 Arab prisoners that they are insufficiently able to follow
 the proceedings, or that they signed confessions written in
 Hebrew, a language most of them do not understand. Military
 regulations require simultaneous translation of trial
 proceedings into the language of the accused.
 No appeal of military court verdicts ispossible. The area
 military commander can and does exercise the right of
 commutation. Non-judicial administrative orders by the
 military government may be appealed to the area military
 commanders and to the Israel Supreme Court.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under emergency regulations, military authorities can
 and do enter private homes and institutions in pursuit
 of security objectives as they see fit.
 In contravention of the Geneva Convention, houses of
 individuals believed to have been involved in terrorism
 or security incidents or located in the vicinity of terr-
 orist incidents have been demolished or sealed up and
 families displaced. In 1981, at least one home was sealed
 up on security grounds and at least 12 houses were demol-
 ished, with damage to neighboring houses in some cases.
 As a result, entire families have been rendered homeless
 because a member was suspected of a security offense.
 Following a single incident which received considerable
 publicity, one home in Bethlehem and three in Beit Sahur,
 housing upwards of 35 people, were destroyed simultaneously
 because four teen-aged residents of those houses were
 charged with hurling an incendiary device at a bus. Israeli
 civil authorities subsequently permitted the Beit Sahur
 families to rebuild their homes but provided no compensation.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Israel has protected Muslim and Christian holy places and
 has assured freedom of access thereto. Certain West Bank
 leaders (and less frequently, West Bankers in general)
 were on several occasions prevented on security grounds
 from entering Jerusalem to attend Friday prayers at Al-
 Aqsa Mosque. On several occasions, Jewish groups seeking
 access to the Temple Mount for professedly religious pur-
 poses have been barred by Israeli authorities, citing
 religious and security considerations.
 
 
 1005
 The Military Government, however, has failed to prevent
 the whittling down of the Muslim presence in Hebron's
 Ibrahimi mosque, which is also the site of the ancient
 synagogue of Abraham and the tombs of the prophets, in
 favor of those of Jewish worshippers. On at least two
 occasions, Jewish settlers prevented Muslim worshippers
 from entering the Mosque for Friday prayers.
 Freedom of expression and assembly is restricted on stated
 security grounds. Permits are required for public meet-
 ings and rallies of ten persons or more, and few have been
 granted. Commercial and school strikes are not allowed and
 coercive methods are often used to force reopenings or to
 enforce closures.
 The East Jerusalem press is subject to censorship, but is
 frequently outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies.
 Editorials and news items are regularly censored or ex-
 cised. Orders restricting several editors to their homes
 or villages have been extended, making it impossible for
 them to work in their offices in East Jerusalem.
 Distribution of the English language weekly *al-Fajr'
 through the Israeli Postal System has been banned since
 several particularly outspoken anti-Israeli articles were
 published during the spring of 1981. This effectively cut
 off foreign distribution of the paper. In November 1981,
 al-Fajr's Arab-language edition was also suspended for
 thirty days for editorial opinion implicitly supportive
 of the murder of a Palestinian who was perceived as cooper-
 ating closely with Israeli authorities. Distribution of
 the communist weekly "At-Taliya" on the West Bank has been
 banned outright for several years.
 Educational materials originating in Arab and other for-
 eign countries are screened and censored for allegedly
 anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli content, or content which
 is adjudged to encourage Arab or Palestinian nationalism.
 At least 70 books were officially banned in 1981, bringing
 the total number of banned books to over 7500.
 Individuals generally are not arrested because of privately
 held views, but membership in, or contact with, or expressed
 support for the aims of proscribed organizations, (e.g.,
 the Palestine Liberation Organization or one of its constit-
 uent elements) is grounds for arrest. Display or use of the
 Palestinian flag or its combined colors is illegal. Mayors
 of towns in the West Bank and Gaza have been specifically
 enjoined by military government order from making statements
 supportive of the PLO.
 
 
 1006
 Following student demonstrations in the spring of 1981,
 the Military Government closed several schools, includ-
 ing al-Najah University in Nablus, for several weeks.
 The Hebron Polytechnic was also closed for several
 months after a dispute between the Hebron City Council
 and the Military Government over the ownership of sev-
 eral school buildings built with Hebron municipal funds.
 Bir Zeit University was closed for several months in the
 fall of 1981 following student protests.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement for Arabs generally is unrestricted
 in the occupied territories, and thousands of Arabs travel
 daily to Israel for work. Vehicles owned by inhabitants
 of the occupied territories are so marked, and are frequent-
 ly stopped for security inspection. Arab inhabitants of
 the territories are officially required to obtain permits
 to stay overnight within Israel. Mayors were restricted to
 their towns on at least seven occasions in 1981.
 Most inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza are free to
 travel abroad and return. Many thousands do so each year.
 There are restrictions on certain categories of residents,
 however, including limitations-on the frequency of border
 crossings by young men, occasional temporary bans on exter-
 nal travel of all residents of specific areas of the occu-
 pied territories following suspected terrorist acts or
 demonstrations in those areas, and restrictions on travel
 of specified individuals. The latter include mayors and
 other leaders, and persons suspected of anti-occupation
 activities. Several prominent Palestinians have been
 refused permission to attend conferences on Palestinian
 issues in the United States and elsewhere.
 Students leaving the occupied territories for multi-year
 studies abroad have in some cases lost their right to
 return as a result of non-renewal of their travel docu-
 ments. Net emigration from the occupied territories aver-
 ages approximately 15,000 per year.
 Inhabitants of the territories crossing from Jordan into
 the West Bank, as well as other Arabs or persons of Arab
 descent, are subject to searches for weapons and contraband.
 There have been complaints that these searches are more
 rigorous than necessary on purely security grounds, and
 constitute harassment.
 
 
 1007
 The Israeli government states that it has allowed since
 1967 more than 50,000 Palestinians to return permanently
 to the occupied territories for family reunification.
 Most returned in 1968, with smaller numbers in the years
 since (1,387 in 1977; 1,511 in 1978; 1,001 in 1979; 1,836
 in 1980; and 1,822 through October 1, 1981). Several
 hundred thousand additional Palestinians who left during
 and immediately after the 1967 war have not been allowed
 to return. The Camp David Accords call for the eventual
 establishment of a commission to decide on the methods and
 processes for the return of displaced persons.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There have been two elections of mayors and city councilmen
 in the West Bank since the beginning of the Israeli occupa-
 tion, in 1972 and again in 1976. Israel permitted Arab
 nationalists outspokenly hostile to Israeli occupation to
 run for office in the second West Bank election and honored
 the results of those elections. Since the 1980 attack on
 Jewish settlers in Hebron, however, it has prohibited these
 mayors from engaging in political activities not directly
 related to administering their municipalities. The municipal
 elections that were to be held in the spring of 1980 were
 postponed because of uncertainty whether elections might be
 held later that year for the Self Governing Authority
 envisioned in the Camp David Accords. These elections have
 still not been held.
 The military government must approve all candidates for
 labor union elections. Strikes are not legally prohibited
 but in practice are often prevented or broken up by the
 authorities.
 The status of women in the occupied territories reflects
 traditional Palestinian values and practices. Matters per-
 taining to marriage, family and personal status are governed
 by Muslim or Christian religious law, as interpreted by relig-
 ious courts; accordingly, women generally do not have equal
 status. Changes are taking place, however. Since 1967, the
 proportion of women in school has steadily increased, so that
 now they comprise roughly one-half of the school population.
 Education and enfranchisement are affecting the traditional
 status of women. Unenfranchised under the law enforced
 before 1967, women are now permitted by the military govern-
 ment to vote in municipal elections.
 Relatively few women in the occupied territories participate
 in the hired labor force. Many women workers are not
 counted, since they are employed on farms, at home or in
 small family enterprises excluded from statistics.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The International Committee of the Red Cross regularly
 inspects prison conditions in the occupied territories
 and makes recommendations for improvement.
 For several years, the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and other United Nations bodies have adopted
 resolutions condemning alleged Israeli human rights vio-
 lations in the occupied territories. The United States
 voted against most of these resolutions, regarding them
 as one-sided and politically motivated. Although Israel
 has been generally unresponsive to efforts by United
 Nations bodies to conduct investigations in territories
 under its jurisdiction, on the grounds that its experi-
 ence suggests that the reports of such investigations
 would reflect political bias rather than the facts, it
 has cooperated with recent visits of representatives
 of the World Health Organization, the International
 Labor Organization, and the United Nations Education,
 Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Although comprehensive statistical information is not
 readily available for all economic and social indica-
 tors in the occupied territories, it is obvious that
 living standards have risen steadily throughout the
 period of Israeli control. Official government sta-
 tistics indicate that unemployment in the occupied
 territories is very low, and real per capita income
 has risen 11-12 percent annually since 1968. In the
 West Bank, real per capita GNP in 1980 was $1,478,
 three and one-half times the 1968 figure. In Gaza,
 real per capita GNP more than trebled over the same
 period to reach $956 in 1980. Much of this increase
 in per capita income can be attributed to the large
 number of Palestinian workers employed in Israel and
 in Arab countries plus other capital inflows, and an
 open trade policy between Israel and the occupied
 territories. Nevertheless, numerous complaints have
 been received that Israel restricts economic develop-
 ment on both political and commercial grounds, and
 that as a result, more individuals than otherwise
 would be the case, especially those with higher edu-
 cation, migrate to other countries where greater pro-
 fessional opportunities exist.

 Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories
 has adversely affected the livelihood of considerable
 numbers of Arab residents, particularly as the result
 of the taking of land for settlements and for military
 use. Land utilized by Israel in this way amounts to
 approximately one-third of the entire West Bank. In
 many instances, those affected have had to leave farm-
 ing to become day laborers. Israel has established
 more than 135 nonmilitary settlements in the occupied
 territories, excluding East Jerusalem, with a total
 population exceeding 24,000. Of these settlements,
 17 were established in the first ten months of 1981
 in the West Bank. Israel has agreed to remove 19
 settlements by April 1982 when it withdraws from the
 Sinai under the terms of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty.
 Businessmen participating in commercial strikes have
 frequently had their shop doors welded shut by the
 authorities and were not allowed to reopen for business
 for varying lengths of time.
 The government of Israel allows the inhabitants of the
 occupied territories access to the Israeli court system
 to appeal the taking of land in cases where Israel rec-
 ognizes ownership of the land. The Israeli high court
 in 1979 ruled that private land in the occupied terri-
 tories legally may be requisitioned by the military for
 civilian settlements only when justified primarily on
 security grounds. Despite this decision, however, land-
 owners generally have failed to win back requisitioned
 land, although Israel has tended to avoid requisitioning
 strongly documented private land since the court's decis-
 ion. The Arab residents have found it difficult to chal-
 lenge land requisitions because title requirements are
 quite strict. (Arab land ownership tends in many instances
 to be based on a tradition of generational usage by families
 or villages, rather than registered legal title, as in the
 West.) Many settlements are justified initially on military
 or security grounds; even after conversion from paramilitary
 to civilian administration, this justification continues to
 be advanced. Groups of Arab landowners, however, have won
 several court orders delaying settlement activity.
 A further problem results from the use of a part of the
 West Bank's limited water resources for Israeli settle-
 ments. Israeli water control policies in the West Bank
 and Gaza ensure that water in the area will be available
 to support the development of an infrastructure of
 Israeli settlements in the territories. Diversion of
 new water resources to these settlements deprives Arab
 agriculture and industry of them.

 The military government and the United Nations Relief
 and Works Agency for the refugees meet the basic edu-
 cational needs of students in the occupied territories.
 Overall adjusted primary school enrollment rose from
 57 percent of the school age population in 1967 to 87
 percent in 1980. The number of girls receiving educa-
 tion has markedly increased. While the percentage in-
 crease from 41 percent in 1967 to 44 percent in 1980
 was relatively small, the number of female students
 rose sharply.
 During 1981, the military government began to enforce
 provisions of the 1980 military government amendments
 to Jordanian laws regulating educational institutions.
 The regulations appear to permit greater political
 control over West Bank universities. Many activist
 teachers and school administrators were demoted and/or
 transferred to sparsely populated districts at the begin-
 ning of the fall term.
