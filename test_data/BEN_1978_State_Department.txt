 BENIN
 Benin is a small agricultural country poorly endowed
 with  natural resources. It has experienced frequent
 changes of government since it became independent in
 1960. The Revolutionary Government which seized power
 in 1972 under the leadership of Lt. Col. Mathieu
 Kerekou abrogated the Constitution then in force and
 two years later adopted the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism as its guiding philosophy. The unsuccessful
 attempt by a group of mercenaries to take over the
 government in January 1977 led to increased restric-
 tions on freedom of movement. A new constitution,
 promulgated in 1977 but as yet unimplemented, formally
 provides for-many individual freedoms. However,
 individual rights are considered secondary to social
 and economic development. No constitutional guarantees
 of civil and political liberties exist.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Amnesty International has received reports that in
 1975 some political prisoners were seriously mistreat-
 ed during detention. To the knowledge of the Depart-
 ment of State these reports have not been substantiated
 nor have those of serious mistreatment of persons
 arrested following the 1977 mercenary attack. There is
 evidence, however, that criminal suspects are mistreat-
 ed under interrogation. There are no statutory prohibi-
 tions against the use of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prison conditions are primitive. Individuals who have
 openly criticized the Government have been sent to
 military camps for "revolutionary education" -- a
 process of indoctrination that involves standing for
 
 
 long hours reciting slogans and absorbing the precepts
 of "scientific socialism." Seven hundred students who
 attempted to go to Togo to take the high school gradua-
 tion examination were reportedly subjected to such
 treatment. The use of indoctrination reeducation has
 declined substantially during the past year.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 A large number of Beninese and foreigners were taken
 into custody and questioned immediately after the
 January 1977 mercenary attack. All the foreigners and
 most of the Beninese were eventually released. It
 is estimated that about fifty political prisoners are
 currently being held in connection with four actual or
 alleged coup attempts during the six years the Revolu-
 tionary Military Government has held power. The
 number of political detainees may have declined to 25 in
 recent months, but there is no means of verifying this
 figure. Detainees spend a long time in prison before
 action is taken on their cases, and authorities seldom
 notify families of arrests. Similarly, when the person
 detained is a foreigner the authorities rarely inform
 the appropriate embassy. A major cause of delay is
 bureaucratic; no detainee can be released without
 the signature of the arresting officer whose identity in
 many cases is not known. In some instances, release
 must be approved by the Minister of the Interior, access
 to whom is difficult.
 Little information is available on the status
 of the better-known political prisoners such as the
 three former presidents (Maga, Apithy, Ahomadegbe) and
 the leader of the 1975 coup attempt, Captain Janvier
 Assogba.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Until the Government has completed revision of the
 penal code, civil and criminal offenders will
 continue to be tried under the French colonial code.
 The legal system was crippled by the abrogation of the
 Constitution in 1972 and dealt a final blow by the
 state of emergency instituted after the January 1977
 
 
 attempted coup d'etat. Thus, no guarantees of an
 impartial public trial exist. It is doubtful whether
 any political prisoners have ever been put on trial.
 Certain civil and criminal cases with political over-
 tones may be taken out of the legal process. This is
 done ostensibly to speed the course of justice.
 However, in these cases the Government prefers to
 control the adjudication rather than relying on the
 magistrates. The President's intervention in such
 cases may be decisive.
 In cases of corruption, the Council of Ministers
 appoints a Commission of Inquiry. Officials implicated
 in several recent cases have been arrested but released
 shortly thereafter, and demoted or removed from govern-
 ment service. In no case has a public trial been held.
 Low-level cases of corruption are delegated to an ad
 hoc "Committee of Suppression," which generally meEes
 out fines and demotions.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Following the January 1977 mercenary attack, the
 Government conducted searches of the homes of Beninese
 and foreign nationals. Fears of renewed mercenary
 attack have since abated, and recently there have been
 no known instances of arbitrary searches.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Economic policy is aimed mainly at helping the poor.
 The present regime has revamped the Government's
 planning and administrative apparatus to centralize
 control of the country's limited resources and to give
 a more socialist orientation to development efforts.
 The Government has organized agricultural extension
 services to provide rural areas with both technical and
 ideological instruction. Government-sponsored commit-
 tees of women and youth are increasingly active. The
 labor unions are firmly controlled by the Government
 and wage increases are held down to encourage local
 industry and reduce urban-rural income differences.
 
 
 The regime has intensified efforts to improve health
 services and educational opportunities. Forty percent
 of the Government budget goes to education, and hundreds
 of new schools have been opened in the past two years.
 However, educational expansion has been hampered by the
 lack of qualified teachers (many of whom fled the
 country in search of higher pay or a freer political
 atmosphere) and by efforts to realign the educational
 system with the regime's political ideology.
 The tax system has not been significantly revised
 since the present regime came to power in 1972. It is a
 progressive system but not radically redistributive.
 In 1977 the richer five percent of households received
 31.4 percent of income while the poorest twenty percent
 received 5.5 percent.
 The Government has conducted several well-publicized
 investigations of corruption in several agencies.
 Corruption is still pervasive, but does not appear to
 constitute a significant diversion of resources
 from the poorest elements of the population.
 Although the Government has emphasized basic education
 and rural development, it has failed to alter radically
 the existing social and economic structures. Attempts
 to hold down food prices have aggravated shortages, and
 Government-owned industries suffer from poor management
 and low productivity. However, officials seem prepared
 to adjust policy in the face of unforeseen difficulty.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The Government's abrogation of the previous constitu-
 tion and its efforts to transform Benin into a Marxist-
 Leninist state based on principles of "scientific
 socialism" have led to suppression of independent
 political and labor activity, demonstrations, free
 expression and any other activities implying criticism
 of the regime. Political participation is limited to a
 
 
 small group of Government and party officials, and
 members of the Council of Ministers. The impact of
 proposed National Assembly elections is unclear.
 Nomination procedures began the week of November 27.
 The press is government-controlled and distribution of
 western publications is limited. Labor unions are
 firmly controlled by the Government. Practice of most
 religions is allowed, but the Kerekou Government,
 concerned about the power of local cult practices, has
 heavily curtailed traditional religious ceremonies.
 Christians have been harassed occasionally but churches-
 continue to function normally. The only religious.
 group against which drastic action has been taken is
 the Jehovah's Witnesses, who refused to acknowledge the
 legitimacy of the revolution. All expatriate members
 of this group were expelled in April 1976 and their
 property confiscated.
 The 1977 Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 press, thought, assembly, association and demonstration,
 but the degree to which it will be implemented is not
 yet clear. Article 136 guarantees individual liberty
 to all citizens of the People's Republic of Benin.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on the movement of Beninese
 citizens within the country. Travel restrictions
 on foreigners have been virtually eliminated within
 the past year. The Government does, however, control
 emigration and foreign travel. Despite the difficul-
 ties of securing the country's long borders, the
 Government is making increasing efforts to prevent the
 disaffected from leaving. Passport applications by
 persons lacking compelling reasons to return to Benin
 (students and the unemployed, for example) are rejected.
 A recent decree also requires that any citizen wishing
 to visit a neighboring country for which passports
 are not required have the written authorization of the
 Ministry of the Interior.

 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Such freedoms as existed in Benin were suspended
 with the abrogation of the former Constitution in 1972.
 The new 1977 Constitution makes provision within a
 one-party context for an elected assembly by universal
 adult suffrage. The People's Revolutionary Party
 remains the most important single element in the new
 political system.
 Within the context of the one-party system, nation-wide
 grass roots democracy on a limited scale has been
 organized since 1975. Precinct delegates are elected
 by the people at mass meetings. The delegates then
 choose the commune level representatives who in turn
 elect the Mayor. The Mayor is responsible to the
 government-appointed district chief. The local delegates
 have no power except to carry out the orders of the
 Government. The 1977 Constitution, if implemented,
 would guarantee equal status and the right to vote to
 women, against whom the social structure rigidly
 discriminates. The Government does not appear prepared
 to attempt to alter this situation in the near future.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Records Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State is not aware of any requests in
 1978 for outside investigation of human rights condi-
 tions in Benin. The Government would likely view such
 requests as interference in its internal affairs. In
 its 1977 report, Amnesty International noted the
 obstacles to its investigation and confirmation of
 reports on political prisoners in Benin.
