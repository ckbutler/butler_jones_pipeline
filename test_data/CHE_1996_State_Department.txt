 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure and an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The bicameral Parliament elects the seven members of the Fed-
 eral Council, the highest executive body, whose presidency rotates annually. Be-
 cause of the nation's linguistic and religious diversity, the Swiss political system em-
 phasizes local and national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy to
 individual cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are a civilian-controlled militia based on universal mili-
 tary service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no standing army a part from
 training cadres and a few essential headquarters staff functions. Police duties are
 primarily a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct
 police forces kept under effective control. The National Police Authority has a co-
 ordination role and relies on the cantons for actual law enforcement.
 Switzerland has a hihly developed free enterprise industrial and service economy
 strongly dependent on international trade. The standard of living is very high.
 The Government fully respects human rights, and there were no major human
 rigbts problems. However, there continue to be verbal abuse against foreigners by
 rivate citizens and complaints by NGO's of occasional police harassment against
 foreigners, particularly asylum seekers (see Section 2.d.). Some laws still tend to
 discriminate against women, although a new federal law came into force in July
 that is designed to promote gender eauality in the labor market. The Government
 is taking serious steps to address violeice against women.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Derading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, although some non-
 governmental organizations complain of prison overcrowding. The Government has
 taken measures to improve prison conditions and address overcrowding. The Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal prohibitions on arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile are fully respected at all levels of government. The cantons
 are responsible for handling most criminal matters, and their procedures vary some-
 what from canton to canton. In general, a suspect may not be held longer than 48
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by an investigative magistrate. However,
 asylum seekers and foreigners without valid documents may be held for up to 96
 hours without an arrest warrant. A suspect has the right to choose and contact an
 attorney as soon as the warrant is issued; the State provides free counsel for
 indigents in most situations. Investigations are generally prompt, even if in some
 cases investigative detention may exceed the length of sentence. Release on personal
 recognizance or bail is granted unless the magistrate believes the person is dan-
 gerous or will not appear for trial. Any lengthy detention is subject to review by
 higher judicial authorities.
 There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a means of political control. Non-
 Swiss convicted of crimes may receive sentences that include denial of reentry for
 a specific period following completion of a prison sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The Constitution provides for public trials in which the defendants rights are
 fully respected, including the right to challenge and to present witnesses or evi-
 dence. All courts of first instance are local or cantonal courts. Minor cases are tried
 by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder (or other serious
 cases) by a public jury. Trials are usually held expeditiously. Citizens have the right
 to appeal to a higher instance court, ultimately to the Federal Court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Can-
 tonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These regulations differ wide-
 ly from canton to canton, but al prohibit such practices without a warrant. All gov-
 ernment authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective
 legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The authorities may legally restrict these freedoms for groups deemed to be a threat
 to the State, but no groups were restricted during the year. In addition, an article
 of the Penal Code criminalzes racist or anti-Semitic expression, whether in public
 speech or in printed material.
 Most broadcast media are government-funded but possess editorial autonomy, and
 foreign broadcast media are freely available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Constitution provides for complete freedom of reli-
 gion, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no single state
 church, but most cantons support one or several churches with public funds. In all
 cantons, an individual may choose not to contribute to church funding. In some can-
 tons, however, private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Forein Travel, Emigratlon, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Constitution and the law, citizens are free to travel in or
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to repatriate.
 Switzerland has traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern over
 the high number of asylum seekers generated pressure on the Government to tight-
 en its policy.
 
 
 1142
 
 Some human rights organizations have charged authorities with abuses in connec-
 tion with the implementation of a law adopted in 1995 aimed at asylum seekers or
 illegal foreigners who are suspected of committing crimes or avoiding repatriation.
 In particular, these groups have alleged instances of abuse, including arbitrary de-
 tention as well as denial of access to established asylum procedures by police at the
 two main airports. They also charge that police have used the law to detain or har-
 ass refugees wvho are not suspected of having ommitted a crime. However, the alle-
 gations made by these groups have never been verified, and these groups now indi-
 cate that the situation  has improved over the last year. Under the law, police ac-
 tions are subject to ,iudicial oversight and the federal ourt has overturned many
 cases in which it believed that there was not sufficient regard for the rights of asy-
 lum seekers or other foreigners.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government provides first asylum    and provided it to approximately
 2,000 persons in 1996. Refugees whose applications are rejected are allowed to stay
 temporarily if their home country is experiencing war or insurrection.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully (at all local, cantonal, and federal levels), and citizens exercise this right
 in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal
 suffrage. In addition, initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually in-
 tense popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Participation  by  women   in politics continues to    expand. Women     were
 disenfranchised until 1971 at the federal level, but since then their participation in
 politics has expanded progressively.
 Women occupy 51 of the 246 seats in the Parliament, 1 of 7 seats in the Federal
 Council (Cabinet), and a record 19 in the cantonal government executive bodies. In
 1995 and 1996, however, voters rejected two local initiatives designed to reserve a
 fixed percentage of elective seats for women. A vote on an initiative to mandate
 equal gender representation in all federal institutions will take place no later than
 1999.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 All major international human rights groups are active and operate without gov-
 ernment restriction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, reli-
 n, language, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these pro-
 Women.-While there are no data about violence against women, indications are
 that a problem exists and that many cases go unreported. The Federation of Wom-
 en's Organizations and other groups have heightened public awareness on the prob-
 lem of violence against women. The law prohbits wife beating and similar offenses,
 and spousal rape is explicitly considered a crime in the Penal Code. The Penal Code
 also criminalizes sexual exploitation and trafficking in women. The authorities effec-
 tively enforce these laws. Victims of violence can obtain help, counseling, and legal
 assistance from specialized offices sponsored by local and cantonal authorities.
 Although the Constitution prohibits all types of discrimination, a few laws still
 tend to discriminate against women. However, as noted below, Parliament has
 passed significant legislation improving the treatment of women.
 In July a new federal law on equal opportunity for women and men came into
 force. The law includes a general prohibition on gender-based discrimination and in-
 corporates the principle of "ecual wages for equal work." The new law also includes
 provisions aimed at eliminating sexual harassment and facilitating access to legal
 remedies for those who claim discrimination or harassment. At the aggregate level,
 men earn more than women, but it is not clear if this circumstance reflects overt
 discrimination or other factors. Individual cases of denial of equal pay for equal
 work would be subject to the new law. A revised labor law eliminated special re-
 strictions on working hours for women (see Section 6.e.).
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through a well-funded public education system and medical care.
 The federal and cantonal governments, as well as organizations defending children's
 rights, have devoted considerable attention in recent years to child abuse, especially
 
 
 1143
 sexual abuse. For convicted perpetrators of the latter, the law provides imprison-
 ment for up to 15 years. Officials have proposed changes in the law that would raise
 the statute of limitations in cases of child abuse from 5 to 10 years.
 With respect to child abuse abroad, current law provides for prosecution only if
 the act is considered a crime in the country in which it took place. However experts
 have proposed making such acts punishable in Switzerland regardless of where the
 crime took place.
 People With Disabilities.-Switzerland has strong legal prohibitions against dis-
 crimination directed at disabled persons in employment, education, and the provi-
 sion of other state services. Advocates for the disabled have called for new measures
 to ensure greater protection for the rights of the disabled, including easier access
 to buildings and public transportation. The Government has not mandated that
 building or transportation facilities be made accessible. A member of Parliament has
 proposed legislation to amend the Constitution to provide equality of oportunity for
 the disabled. The legislation has so far received broad support in Parliament, but
 it would be subject to a mandatory voter referendum.
 In January 1995, a law came into force exempting disabled men from the tax im-
 posed on those who have not fulfilled their military duty.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to nongovernmental organizations'
 statistics, which have not been verified, there were 41 reported attacks against for-
 eigners in the first half of 1996, almost double the nua  er reported for the same
 period in 1995. However, these figures include instances of verbal and written "at-
 tacks" which are much more common than physical assaults. Investigations of these
 attacks are conducted effectively and lead in most cases to the arrest of the persons
 responsible. Persons convicted of racist crimes are commonly sentenced to at least
 1 year's imprisonment.
 In accordance with the first antiracism law which was approved in September
 1994 (and which criminalizes racist and anti-Semitic actions or public speech), the
 Government appointed in August 1995 a commission against racism. This grup of
 experts is expected to focus on preventive measures and to serve as a mediator for
 conflicts between individuals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, have the freedom
 to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select their own representa-
 tives. The Government does not hamper the exercise of these rights. About one-third
 of the work force is unionized.
 The right to strike is legally recognized and freely exercised, but a unique labor
 peace under an informal agreement between unions and employers-in existence
 since the 1930's-has meant fewer than 10 strikes per year since 1975. There were
 no significant strikes in 1996.
 Unions are independent of government and political parties, and laws prohibit ret-
 ribution against strikers or their leaders. Unions can associate freely with inter-
 national organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, workers have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects them from acts of
 antiunion discrimination. The Government fully respects these provisions. Periodic
 negotiations between employer and worker organizations determine wages and set-
 tle other labor issues at the national and local levels. Nonunion firms generally
 adopt the terms and conditions fixed in the unions' collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there is no specific con-
 stitutional or statutory ban on forced or compulsory labor, it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15 years, and children are in school up to this age. Children over 13
 years may be employed in light duties for not more than 9 hours a week during
 the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment of youths between the ages
 of 15 and 20 is strictly regulated; they cannot work at night, on Sundays, or under
 hazardous or dangerous conditions. The Federal Office for Industry, Trade, and
 Labor effectively enforces the law on working conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The low-
 est wages fixed in collective bargaining are always adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for workers anr their-families.
 The Labor Act established a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-col-
 lar workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek for all
 other workers. The law prescribes a rest period during the workweek. Overtime is
 limited by law to 120 hours annually.
 
 
 1144
 
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. There have been no reports of lapses in the en-
 forcement of these regulations, but the degree to which enforcement is effective is
 unclear. The Government is currently overhauling the 1948 Labor Act, in part to
 strengthen provisions for workers' health and safety. Parliament passed a revised
 labor law, but it was defeated in a December referendum. A worker may opt out
 of a dangerous assignment without penalty.
