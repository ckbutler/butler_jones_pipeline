 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Governor General,
 appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister,
 represents the Queen as Head of State. The elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is
 the country's chief executive. The Parliament is composed of
 an elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by
 the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and
 the Leader of the Opposition. Two major political parties have
 alternated in power'since the first elections under universal
 suffrage in 1944. In the last general election, held in
 February 1989, Michael Manley's People's National Party (PNP)
 won 45.of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives. The
 opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), which formed the
 government from 1980 to 1989, holds the remaining 15 seats.
 The security forces, which consist of the Jamaica Constabulary
 Force (JCF--police) and the Island Special Constabulary Force
 (ISCF--auxiliary police), are responsible to the Ministry of
 National Security. The Jamaica Defense Force (JDF--army, air
 wing, and coast guard) is responsible to the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as Defense Minister. Since 1974, however, the JDF
 has been authorized to conduct joint operations with the JCF to
 maintain peace and order under the Suppression of Crime Act,
 and when operating under the provisions of that Act is also
 responsible to the Ministry of National Security. The police
 continued to be responisible for incidents of human right abuse.
 Jamaica's economy emphasizes the private sector and is based on
 primary products (bauxite/alumina, sugar, bananas), service
 industries (tourism, banking), and light manufacturing
 (primarily garment assembly). The Manley Government has
 promoted private investment to stimulate economic growth and
 modernization, most dramatically by eliminating foreiqn
 exchange controls on September 25.
 Extrajudicial killings and other abuses by police and prison
 guards, frequently committed with impunity, remain Jamaica's
 principal human rights problem. Conditions in Jamaican jails
 and prisons remain appalling, with serious overcrowding, poor
 sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the norm. An
 overburdened and inefficient judiciary is responsible for
 lengthy delays in trials and in other sectors of the justice
 system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings by
 government, security forces in 1991, but there continue to be
 credible reports that the JCF engages in the summary execution
 of suspects under the guise of "shootouts." Police statistics
 show that fatal shootings by police increased from 89 during
 the first 9 months of 1990 to 116 during the same period of
 1991. Nonfatal shootings totaled 81 in 1991, 59 in 1990. By
 comparison, 8 policemen were shot and killed and 16 wounded in
 the line of duty through September 1991; 9 were killed and 23
 wounded in 1990. Figures compiled by the Jamaica Council on
 Human Rights (JCHR), taken from local media reports, are
 somewhat at odds with police statistics: they show a much
 
 
 657
 JAMAICA
 higher rate of police shootings, averaging over 210 per year
 since 1979. The JCHR, however, also notes a significant
 decrease in such incidents during the first part of 1991.
 A dramatic incident involving unjustifiable use of lethal force
 by JCF members occurred in front of more than 30,000 Jamaicans
 during the July visit of South African leader Nelson Mandela.
 A JCF corporal fired his M-16 into the crowd, killing one man
 and seriously wounding a woman. He and another policeman who
 opened fire were charged in September with murder and wounding
 with intent to kill and released on bail. Their trial,
 scheduled to begin on December 13, was postponed to 1992.
 Major public statements against police violence were made
 during the year by Prime Minister Manley, National Security
 Minister K.D. Knight, Police Commissioner Roy Thompson, and
 Director of Public Prosecutions Glenn Andrade.
 Long-anticipated legislation to set up a police Public
 Complaints Authority was submitted to Parliament in early
 December; approval was expected in early 1992. Despite these
 actions, the JCF claims that 20 policemen were arrested for
 murder in 1991. None was convicted. Police are infrequently
 punished for extrajudicial killing. In many cases,
 investigations undertaken immediately following a fatal
 shooting drag on for years.
 Vigilantim, involving spontaneous mob executions, is a common
 phenomenon in Jamaica. Charges are rarely brought against
 vigilantes, and in the few cases that do go to court,
 acquittals are common. Violence during elections, perpetrated
 largely by armed gangs of political partisans, has decreased
 greatly since the 1988 signing of a "pol-itical code of conduct"
 between Jamaica's political parties. The September 1991
 parliamentary by-election for North East St. Elizabeth took
 place without incident.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by the security forces in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees are
 prohibited by law. Nonetheless, there were numerous credible
 complaints of police beatings, some fatal, of detainees at
 station houses and of inmates held in jails and prisons. While
 government efforts to reduce the problem through police
 training continue, JCF statistics show that only two officers
 were charged with "mistreatment of prisoners"-in 1991; neither
 case had been tried by the end of the year.
 As in past years, some persons brought suit successfully
 against-the police for unlawful actions. Total damages paid by
 the Government have averaged $265,000 annually over the past
 few years. According to police statistics, 207 complaints were
 filed against police between January and August 1991, including
 124 alleging assault by JCF officers. The JCHR in its July
 1990-June 1991 annual report highlighted the problem of abusive
 officers in the JCF. Reports made to the JCHR named 113
 policemen (out of a force of 6,110) as perpetrators in cases of
 unlawful.physical abuse. Only five officers were named for
 more than one offense, and only one-of those was named more
 than twice. The JCHR also cites eyewitness accounts of
 
 
 658
 JAMAICA
 off-duty policemen attempting to intervene in public beatings
 who have themselvesbeen beaten by their own colleagues.
 Conditions in prisons, particularly the penitentiaries and
 maximum security facilities, remain abysmal. Sanitary
 conditions are appalling, food inadequate at best, and
 overcrowding the-rule rather than the exception. At
 St. Catherine's district prison, scene of four major riots
 involving fatalities since May 1990, as many as 6 men are held
 in each 5- by 8-foot cell. A June 1991 disturbance at
 St. Catherine's is indicative of several underlying problems.
 Five men were killed during a prison riot; four inmates were
 later arrested and charged with murder. Subsequently, in
 .September, the media reported that prison warders were under
 investigation -or the June deaths, noting that the men killed
 were witnesses to an earlier incident in which Gun Court
 warders allegedly facilitated the escape of two notorious
 murderers. One newspaper alleged that the June 30 "riot" was
 in fact a cover for the murder of the five witnesses. Another
 longstanding problem is the failure to provide timely and
 adequate medical attention to prisoners and detainees. For
 example, several women prisoners have suffered miscarriages,
 either through lack of prompt medical treatment or from being
 beaten or otherwise physically abused.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Suppression of Crime Act (SOCA), adopted in 1974 and still
 in force in Kingston and two nearby parishes, allows police to
 make arrests and conduct warrantless searches of persons
 "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime. The SOCA
 was revoked islandwide in May 1990 but, following what police
 termed an extraordinary crime wave over the next 2 months, the
 Manley Government reinstituted it in Kingston, St. Andrew, and
 St. Catherine parishes. Police claim the SOCA is useful,
 primarily for its deterrent effect on prospective criminals,
 and that the authority for warrantless searches and detentions
 already exists under the Dangerous Drugs and Firearms Act.
 Detention of suspects without a warrant occurs regularly,
 particularly those from poor neighborhoods. According to the
 JCHR, many detainees are held for several weeks without being
 brought before a judge or magistrate. For Jamaican suspects
 charged with a crime, there is a functioning bail system.
 Foreign detainees, however, are regularly denied bail. Persons
 unable to post bail while waiting for a judicial hearing are
 often detained for long periods.
 For the period from July 1990 through June 1991, the JCHR
 reported 103 habeas corpus violations brought to their
 attention; of these, 57 writs were prepared, and only 14
 persons were eventually charged by the Government (in two
 cases, after the habeas corpus writs were served).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons who have been charged with criminal offenses have
 access to legal representation, and legal counsel is provided
 to indigents in criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the
 Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom.
 A special Gun Court, established in 1974, considers all cases
 involving the illegal use or possession of firearms and
 ammunition. Public attendance is restricted, and rules of
 
 
 659
 JAMAICA-
 evidence are less rigorous. In capital cases, hearings before
 the Gun Court serve as preliminaries to jury trials under the
 jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
 The judicial system, although independent, is overburdened and
 operates with inadequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have
 resulted in a steady attrition of trained personnel, causing
 further delays. Some cases take years to come to trial, and
 others have had to be dismissed because case files could not be
 located. Prisoners have been held for more than 4 years
 awaiting trial or decisions on their appeals. The Government
 has in recent years taken some steps to reverse the
 deterioration of the legal system. These include raising
 judicial salaries, increasing training for justice personnel,
 and upgrading courthouse facilities.
 According to the JCHR, the intimidation--even the murder--of
 witnesses is a chronic problem hampering criminal prosecutions,"'
 and jurors are sometimes threatened by associates of criminal
 defendants. The Government in 1989 announced the development
 of a protective custody program for threatened witnesses and in
 1990 provided additional funding for a witness protection
 program. Nevertheless, the problem of witness intimidation
 remained serious throughout 1991.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Under the SOCA,
 however, homes or businesses believed to be occupied by persons
 "reasonably" suspected by the police of having committed a
 crime may be searched without a warrant. This authority is
 sometimes abused.
 The use of telephone taps without court order has been
 practiced for some 30 years. Prime Minister Manley has
 proposed legislation to codify rules for wiretaps and has
 promised to limit future taps to cases involving the drug
 trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are observed, in practice within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the Official Secrets Act. In 1990,
 however, there were several incidents in which reporters were
 detained briefly by security forces; there were no such
 incidents in 1991.
 The government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JBC)
 operates two radio stations and the island's only.television
 channel. After recent changes in the procedures for naming
 members to the JBC Board of Directors and the General Manager
 of JBC Operations, the Government's influence over JBC program
 content has been. diminished significantly. Three JBC regional
 radio facilities have been sold to groups of private
 investors. A private group was granted a license to begin
 operating a second television channel, but the station had not
 yet gone on the air by year's end. The Government's Broadcast
 Commission has the right to regulate programming during
 
 
 660
 JAMAICA
 emergencies. There are now more than 21,000 satellite antennas
 on the island, permitting many Jamaicans to watch foreign
 television broadcasts without any government restriction.
 Jamaica's three largest newspapers, all privately owned,
 regularly report on alleged human rights abuses, particularly
 those involving the JCF. Foreign publications are widely
 available. There is no censorship or interference in academic
 institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Large numbers and varieties of professional,
 business, service, social, and cultural associations function
 freely. Public rallies are staged by-all political parties.
 Such events require a police permit; they are not denied
 arbitrarily.
 c. Freedom of religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. More than 80 percent of the
 population belongs to various Christian denominations, and
 religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evangelical
 Christian movements have gained a significant following, and
 foreign evangelists visit regularly.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of movement
 and immunity from expulsion from the country. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. Citizenship is
 not revoked for political reasons.
 Those who apply for refugee status are handled on a
 case-by-case basis. Jamaica is a party to the 1951 U.N.
 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Jamaicans have, and freely exercise, the right to change their
 government. All citizens age 18 and over have the right to
 vote by secret ballot. In some urban electorates, however,
 partisan political gangs are known to intimidate voters and
 reportedly interfere with the electoral process. The
 Constitution requires that the Prime Minister call national
 elections within 5 years and 3 months of the first sitting of
 Parliament; he is free to do so at any time within that period.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 . Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The JCHR, the country's only human rights
 organization, has vigorously protested abuses by the police and
 has called for corrective reforms. Their work has been
 hampered, however, by a lack of adequate resources. The
 Government has cooperated with foreign nongovernmental human
 rights group that have visited Jamaica several times in recent
 
 
 661
 JAMAICA
 years and those that have issued reports on Jamaican human
 rights problems.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act requires equal pay
 for equal work. However, in practice, because of cultural and
 social traditions, women often suffer economic discrimination,
 which is frequently evidenced in hiring practices.
 Violence against women occurs with some frequency in Jamaica,
 although useful statistical data are not available. The Bureau
 of Women's Affairs within the Ministry of Labor, Welfare, and
 Sports, along with several nongovernmental organizations, helps
 victims cope with the effects of domestic violence. According
 to officials at a crisis center; police are frequently
 unwilling to assist battered women in taking legal steps
 against their assailants. The JCF, responding in early 1991 to
 complaints about its handling of rape victims, established a
 rape center staffed by women officers to take reports from
 victims and initiate investigations. Women remain reluctant to
 bring assault charges against their domestic partners when jail
 is seen as the likely result. However, the Government is
 preparing to introduce noncustodial sentencing soon for
 nonweapon offenses.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 -  a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to form or.
 join a trade union and obligates the Government to protect the
 person and property of trade unionists. Labor unions function
 freely. The Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act
 (LRIDAY codifies worker rights.
 The Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and National
 Workers Union (NWU) are both closely associated with, but
 independent from, the Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) and People's
 National Party (PNP), respectively. The University and Allied
 Workers' Union (UAWU) is closely affiliated with the Workers'
 Party of Jamaica (WPJ) through mutual officers; the WPJ is
 moribund, however, while the UAWU is thriving.
 Jamaican law neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to
 strike, but unions and workers do go on strike. Striking
 workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but
 cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. However, strikes are
 prohibited by workers in 10 broad categories of "essential
 services," including health and communications workers. In
 1991 the International Labor Organization (ILO) again
 criticized the broad definition of essential services in
 Jamaican law as being overly restrictive of the right of
 association as defined in ILO Convention 87. In 1991 there
 were several work slowdowns and a number of strikes of short
 duration.
 Trade unions are free to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and belong
 to labor unions, and LRIDA provisions include guidelines for
 
 
 662
 JAMAICA
 labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution.
 The Government rarely interferes with union organization
 efforts, and judicial and police duthorities effectively
 enforce the LRIDA and other labor regulations.
 Labor, management, and the Government remain firmly committed
 by law and in practice to collective bargaining in contract
 negotiations and conflict resolution, even in some nonunion
 settings. When labor and management fail to reach an
 agreement, cases may be referred to an independent Industrial
 Disputes Tribunal (IDT), which forms the first appeal level
 above the Ministry of Labor. Any cases not resolved by the IDT
 pass tQ the civil courts. Employees may not be fired solely
 because they are union officers. On the other hand, union
 affiliation is not a prerequisite for employment.
 Domestic labor laws apply in the export processing zones;
 however, union representation in the zones is minimal. Union
 organizers attribute this to resistance by foreign owners to
 organizing efforts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Jamaica is a party to both ILO Conventions which prohibit
 compulsory labor, and there have been no allegations that this
 practice exists in Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Juvenile Act provides that children under the age of 12
 shall not be employed except by parents or guardians, and that
 such employment may be only in domestic, agricultural, or
 horticultural work. Children under 12 years of age may not be
 employed at night or at industrial sites, but enforcement is
 erratic, and children under 12 can be seen peddling goods or
 services on city streets. There is no evidence of widespread
 illegal employment of children in other sectors of the
 economy. However, reports of illegal working conditions for
 "exercise boys" at a large thoroughbred racing farm surfaced in
 September; although prompt action was promised by the Ministry
 of Labor to prevent further abuses, no charges were brought as
 a result of the allegations. The Educational Act stipulates
 that all children aged 6 to 11 must attend elementary school.
 Industrial safety, police, and truant officers are charged with
 enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage is widely considered inadequate for
 rural families with one wage earner, and completely inadequate
 for urban-dwellers. Most salaried workers are paid more than
 the legal minimum wage.
 The LRIDA establishes basic conditions of work, including a
 40-hour workweek, and the Factory Act stipulates that all
 factories be registered and approved by the Labor Ministry
 before they can begin operating. The Ministry's Industrial
 Safety Division is required to make annual inspections of all
 factories, but budget constraints reduce the number of
 inspections actually made. If a private sector work site does
 not meet the definition of a "factory," the Ministry does not
 have the authority to inspect it.
 
 
 663
 JAMAICA
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is charged with
 setting and enforcing industrial health and safety standards,
 which outside experts consider adequate. Industrial accident
 rates are relatively low. The Ministry maintains records on
 industrial accident victims, and they are compensated under the
 National Insurance Scheme. The Ministries of Labor, Finance,
 the Public Service, and National Security are charged with
 enforcing labor laws and regulations. Working conditions in
 the export processing zones are generally comparable to outside
 conditions.
