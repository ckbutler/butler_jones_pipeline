 ARMENIA
 After declaring its independence from the Soviet Union in December 1991, Arme-
 nia began to establish the foundations of a parliamentary democracy. Legislative
 power is vested in the Parliament, which, because no party or combination of parties
 can consistently muster a majority or even a quorum, has been unable either to ap-
 prove a constitution or to pass crucial legislation. The President appoints the Prime
 Minister who presides over the Government. The judiciary is not fully independent
 of the other branches of government. Parliamentary elections are scheduled Tor May
 1995, although Parliament has yet to pass an election law. Democratically elected
 President Levon Ter-Petrosyan will face reelection in 1996 upon completion of a 5-
 year term. In December, President Ter-Petrosyan temporarily suspended the activi-
 ties of the opposition Dashnak party on the grounds that a clandestine terrorist or-
 
 
 731
 ganization subordinate to it was engaging in political assassination, drug traffick-
 mg, and espionage.
 Te Ministry of Internal Affairs supervises the police, which is responsible for
 maintaining order throughout the country. Several police officers were charged with
 brutality in the past year, and a number of cases go unreported. The State Direc-
 torate for National Security, while still responsible for co  ating both external and
 internal threats was reorganized in January and is subordinate directly to the Of-
 fice of the President.
 The 6-year-old conflict over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in neighboring Azer-
 baijan continues to dominate Armenia's political and economic landscape. After the
 hard-fought offensive of the winter of 1993-94, which resulted in few strategic gains
 despite thousands of casualties, the parties reached an informal cease-fire agree-
 ment in May. Formally confirmed in July, the cease-fire was holding by year's end.
 Landlocked Armenia has faced longstanding economic strangulation due to insta-
 bility in neighboring Georgia and enibargoes imposed by both Azerbaijan and Tur-
 key as a result of the conflict. This coupled with the economic chaos produced by
 the breakup of the former Soviet Jnion, has devastated the largely state-owned
 economy. Critical shortages of fuel, electricity, and raw materials severely reduced
 industrial production, resulting in widespread unemployment. Nevertheless,
 progress toward economic reform included moves to privatize industrial enterprises
 and land and to liberalize prices. An agreement with the International Monetary
 Fund was reached in November, calling for far-reaching economic reforms in ex-
 change for $395 million in international and bilateral concessional loans.
 In the absence of a new constitution, Armenia relies on the International Cov-
 enant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by a 1991 parliamentary resolution, and
 those parts of the Soviet Constitution still in force to protect human rights. The So-
 viet-era Criminal Code allows suspects to be detained for up to 72 hours without
 charge; and judges do not appear to be sufficiently insulated from political pressure.
 Within this framework, the Government generally respects human rights, although
 the suspension of major opposition newspapers as part of a suspension of the
 Dashnak Party's activities has tarnished the Government's record on respect for
 freedom of the press. There were several instances of police brutality toward detain-
 ees, many instances of forcible conscription of draft-age men, and suspected execu-
 tions of Azerbaijani prisoners of war.
 The law forbids proselytizing, and the Government further restricts the activities
 of "foreign and unregistered" religious groups. Armenian citizens are free to emi-
 grate, but those wishing to travel abroadare required to secure exit permits from
 the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In addition, deeply ingrained attitudes result in so-
 cietal discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrjudicial Killing.-The only known extrajudicial
 killings in 1994 were the probable executions of eight Azeri prisoners of war being
 held in Yerevan. The report of the Armenian Special Investigator claims that the
 prisoners committed suicide (seven with the same gun) after their escape attempt
 failed. An independent British forensic specialist, who examined the bodies after
 they were returned to Azerbaijan, said the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to exe-
 cution, but he admitted that the possibility of mass suicide could not be absolutely
 ruled out.
 Representatives of independent international agencies maintain that many would-
 be prisoners of war on both sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are summarily
 executed at military front lines. Policemen who were awaiting trial in connection
 with the 1993 death of a detainee in custody were released with the understanding
 that they would not leave Yerevan. All subsequently fled and are now wanted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 In 1994 the General Prosecutor's office officially charged three members of the police
 force with brutality, although many cases go unreported. The General Prosecutor's
 office investigates alegations of mistreatment and files criminal charges if its inves-
 tigation reveals evidence to support the allegations and if there is a serious violation
 of the law. It refers less serious cases to the Ministry of Internal Affairs for adminis-
 trative action. Two of the officers accused of brutality were administratively dis-
 cipined, while the third faces criminal charges.
 Information on prison conditions is not available, but they are believed to be
 harsh. The International Committee of the Red Cross had access to prisoners of war
 from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict until October. At the end of the year, it was
 
 
 732
 still discussing with the Armenian authorities renewed and regular access to all
 prisoners held in connection with the conflict.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to the Criminal Code, much
 of which dates from the Soviet era, suspects may be detained and held without
 charge for up to 72 hours. A suspect has the right to be represented by a lawyer,
 and the police must notify the suspect's relatives if requested. After arrest, a sus-
 pect may be jailed for up to 3 mont  pending trial and completion of the investiga-
 tion or up to 9 months by special order of the Prosecutor. If no indictment is hand-
 ed dwn during that time, a suspect must be released. There is no provision for bail
 or for trial by jury in Armenian law.
 Once criminal or civil charges have been filed, the law requires a trial within 1
 month. In practice, due to current conditions in Armenia, the deadline often is not
 met. In most cases, however, pretrial detention will not exceed 3 months. The Crimi-
 nal Code permits the exile of citizens under certain circumstances, but no one has
 been exiled since Armenia became independent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Arnienia's criminal justice system, including its
 courts, laws, and procedures, follows the former Soviet model. The courts of general
 jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District courts try the over-
 whelming majority of such cases, but a Supreme Court tries some. Both may act
 as the court of first instance, depending on the nature and seriousness of the crime.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district and republic
 levels and are ultimately responsible to the Prosecutor General, appointed by the
 President. Prosecutors and defense attorneys by law have equal status before the
 courts. In practice, prosecutors still are very influential because court proceedings
 are not conducted in an adversarial manner. Prosecutors direct all criminal inves-
 tigations, which are usually conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions
 back to the prosecutor for "additional investigation.' Such cases may then be
 dropped or closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 In their work, judges are not fully independent of the other branches of govern-
 ment. The Ministry of Justice nominates Supreme Court judges, whose candidacies
 are reviewed by a panel of their peers before being forwarded to Parliament for ap-
 proval
 Trials are public except when government secrets are considered at issue. Defend-
 ants may confront witnesses and present evidence. The court appoints an attorney
 for indigent defendants. Defendants have the right of appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners in Armenia. A former presidential
 aide and member of the opposition, Vathan Avakyan, convicted of attempting to di-
 vulge state secrets, was sentenced to a jail term of 4 years. His sentence was upheld
 by the Supreme Court. The arrest and trial were controversial both because of the
 circumstances surrounding the case and alleged procedural irregularities. Opposi-
 tion leaders and some memfbers of Parliament claim that Avakyan is a political pris-
 oner and have called for the creation of an independent commission to investigate
 the case.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Apart
 from the provisions of the International Covenant, there is no legal protection for
 the privacy of citizens, their  ommunications, and their   orrespondence. Proce-
 duraly, the Directorate af National Security must petition the General Prosecutor's
 offie for permission to tap a phone or intercept orrespondene. The General Pros-
 ecutr's offie purportedly must find a compelling need for a wiretap before it will
 grant the agency permission to proceed. One of the leading opposition parties
 claimed to haveiscovered unauthorized wiretaps on its office telephones, but there
 was no official investigation of these allegations.
 There were many instances of interference with privacy during waves of army
 conscription in 1994. Military recruiters appeared at houses where draft-age men
 were reported to live and often threatened or detained the occupants or inflicted ma-
 terial damage. They seized draft-age men in public places, such as markets, thea-
 ters, and the subway. There are credible reports that Armenian and Nagorno-
 Karabakh officials forcibly conscripted refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh and Azer-
 baian.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Information provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, and the Government generally respects these rights.
 The press is generally free and contains a wide variety of political opinion and
 criticism of the Government. However, as a result of a December 28 presidential di-
 rective, the publication of Dashnak Party newspapers and journals has been halted.
 
 
 733
 The Ministry of Justice registers all publications and broadcasting organizations,
 which must state their general subject matter. It is required to act on applications
 for registration within 1 month of receipt.
 There is no prepublication censorship. However the Government reportedly sup-
 plies all mass media editors with a list of forbidden subjects, including sensitive
 military information in categories such as the draft and army recruitment, informa-
 tion on military structure, civil defense arrangements, finance, communications,
 transport, and science and technology. There were no known prosecutions in 1994
 for violations of this ixjunction.
 Shortages of fuel, paper, electricity, and other supplies sometimes delayed or pre-
 vented the publication or distribution of the print media. There was no indication
 that the Government used such problems to control or influence the media. On Octo-
 ber 21, the offices of the Ramkavar Party's newspaper were firebombed. Investiga-
 tions by the Ministry of Internal Affairs into this and a series of other attacks on
 journalists and media offices in late 1994 turned up no suspects. Attacks targeted
 both government-sponsored and opposition media outlets.
 The Government controls broadcasting almost entirely. There is one functioning
 independent radio station, one independent television company, which rents air time
 from a state channel, and several small independent cable television companies
 which are only licensed to show films. In December the Government voided a con-
 tract with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to provide local rebroadcasts of Radio
 Liberty programming. It is widely assumed that the contract was canceled for politi-
 cal reasons.
 The Ramkavar Party newspaper AZ6 was able to register bylaws for a second
 independent radio station on November 16, but the station is not yet operating.
 State television provides a total of 15 minutes of broadcast time per week for all
 opposition political parties. However, the opposition NDU and Dashnak Parties re-
 portedly were both recently denied their time slots. Representatives of other opposi-
 tion parties appeared regularly on political discussion programs. A shortage of elec-
 tricity limited television time to about 6 hours per day.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.---In the absence of an Armenian
 law, the International Covenant provides for freedom of peaceful assembly and asso-
 ciation. Public demonstrations, meetings, and marches occurred frequently in 1994
 without any apparent interference by the authorities. The Soviet-era Law on Meet-
 ings remains valid and requires those wishing to stage marches or demonstrations
 to obtain a permit. The procedure for obtaining a permit is not onerous, and there
 were no known instances of its arbitrary abuse.
 The Ministry of Justice registers social and political organizations, but the Gov-
 ernment does not attempt to control the opposition thrugi the registration process.
 The Ministry has registered some 661 organizations to date, among them many po-
 litical parties and groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1991 Law on Religious Organizations provides for
 freedom of conscience but imposes some restrictions on religious freedom. It estab-
 lishes the separation of church and state and recognizes the Armenian Apostolic
 Church, with which over 80 percent of the population is at least nominally affiliated,
 as the predominant denomination. The law forbids proselytizing and refuses reg-
 istration to organizations whose doctrine is not based on "historically recognized
 holy scriptures." An unregistered religious organization may not own property, pub-
 lish a newspaper or magazine, rent a hail or other meetingplace, sponsor television
 or radio broadcasts, or officially sponsor the visas of visitors to Armenia.
 A 1993 Presidential Decree according the right to "restore and develop the spir-
 itual life of the Armenian people" to the Armenian Apostolic Church supplements
 the 1991 Law. By enjoining the Council on Religions Affairs to investigate the ac-
 tivities of the representatives of registered reigious organizations and to ban mis-
 sionaries who engage in activities contrary to their status, the decree called into
 question the legitimacy of all other religious groups. Some religious groups were
 obliged to reregister in the wake of the decree, often on condition that they alter
 their statutes to include a ban on proselytizing. Some groups, such as the Mormons,
 were quietly discouraged from applying for registration and have kept a low profile.
 The Hare Krishnas, in particular, were victims of harassment and several attacks
 the authorities were neither responsive nor sympathetic. The Government refused
 to release 30 tons of religious literature to the Kishna group, claiming that receipt
 of the books was tantamount to proselytizing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict internal or international travel for
 political reasons. Armenians may not obtain travel passports, however, if they lack
 invitations from the country that they wish to visit if they have knowledge of state
 secrets, or if their relatives have made financial claims against them. The Soviet-
 
 
 era Office of Visas and Re istrations (OVIR) continues to ir. pede travel and emigra-
 tion through delays and te ration of various bureaucratic obstacles, including a
 requirement for "exit permission."
 Some 200,000 people, virtually the entire ethnic Azeri population of Armenia prior
 to independence, took refuge in Azerbaijan. After the 1988-89 anti-Armenian po-
 groins in Azerbaijan connected with the conflict over control of Nagorno-Karabakh
 the Government discriminated a*it these ethnic Azeris and allowed the local
 population to intimidate them, ofen violently, as a way to drive them out of the
 country. The Government forcibly deported many, and the rest fled. It appears in-
 creasingly unlikely that these people will be able to return, as is also the case for
 the nearly 400,000 Armenian refugees who fled Azerbaijan after the pogroms. There
 have been unconfirmed reports of ethnic Armenians resettling in territories occupied
 by Nagorno-Karabakh Armenian military forces. Such actions, if true, would ham-
 per peaceful settlement of the conflict and the return of refugees.
 The Government does not in any way actively hinder emigration. In fact, it is esti-
 mated that as much as one-third of Armenia's population has temporarily or perma-
 nently left the country during the last 6 years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although democracy is not yet firmly rooted in Armenia, citizens exercised their
 right to change their government peacefully in 1990 when the Armenian National
 Movement (ANM) defeated the Communist Party in relatively free parliamentary
 elections. As Parliament began to function, its members affiliated themselves with
 new parties being formed. At present, 12 parties and associations are represented
 in Parliament, and many others are active. The ANM, which supports the President,
 lacks a majority of deputies in Parliament.
 In the absence of a new constitution, the Government's legitimacy rests on the
 1990 Law on the Presidency and the 1991 Law on Parliament. The Law on Par-
 liament established a multiparty system. The large number of seats won by those
 occupying full-time jobs in local government offices around the country and Arme-
 nia's economic probiems have frequently made it difficult to muster a quorum, thus
 limiting the effectiveness of Parliament. On December 21, 46 opposition and inde-
 pendent deputies resigned their parliamentary commissions in protest over what
 they called government ineffectiveness. Their action appears to be serious and will
 make it almost impossible for the Parliament to muster a quorum prior to new elec-
 tions in May 1995.
 On December 28, President Ter-Petrosyan temporarily suspended one of the larg-
 est opposition parties, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, also known as
 "Dashnaks"), on the grounds that the party was operating a clandestine terrorist or-
 ganization involved in drug smuggling, assassination, and espionage. Several party
 members were arrested in conjunction with these activities, and Dashnak news-
 papers were closed. Armenian government officials indicated that the Dashnaks
 could reorganize and the ARF could again be registered as a political party if it
 purged itself of criminal elements. Leaders of the Dashnak party have denounced
 the suspension. The question of what requirements the Party will have to fulfill in
 order to reconstitute itself was under review in early 1995 by the Ministry of Jus-
 tice.
 Women and members of minority groups play a very limited role in &overnment
 and politics. Currently, there are no women or minority group members in Cabinet-
 level positions, and only 9 of the 240 deputies in Parliament are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several fledgling human rights groups, which operate freely and openly
 criticize the Governments human rights policies. The Government generally cooper-
 ates with human rights investigations and supports the presence of international
 human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The International Covenant prohibits discrimination. Since independence, Par-
 liament has passed laws to protect against discrimination based on religion or lan-
 guage, and the Government generally respects these rights. Societal discrimination
 against women continues.
 Women.-Armenia remains a male-dominated society. Women are typically ex-
 pected to do the housework and raise the family even if they have a full-time job.
 In the workplace, they are generally not afforded the opportunities for training and
 advancement given to men. The 1992 Law on Employment, however, prohibits dis-
 
 
 735
 crimination in employment. The extremely high unemployment rate makes it dif-
 ficult to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimina-
 tion.
 Violence against women does exist. Between January and October 1994, there
 were 21 reported rape cases; there were no reports of spousal abuse. It is likely that
 many more incidents go unreported. For those convicted of rape, the average prison
 sentence is from 5 to 10 years.
 Children.-The Government has taken steps to insulate large families (four chil-
 dren or more) from current difficult economic circumstances, and foreign humani-
 tarian aid programs have also targeted large families. However, Armenia does not
 have the means, given the current economic situation, to provide fully for the wel-
 fare of children. Child abuse does not appear to be a serious problem.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1993 Parliament passed a law on invalids that in
 principle provides for the social, political, and individual rights of the disabled. The
 law does not mandate the provision of accessibility for the disabled, however, and
 public concern about the rights of the disabled remains very limited.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Law on Employment guarantees employ-
 ees the right to strike and to form or join unions of their own choosing without pre-
 vious authorization. The vast majority of existing trade unions, holdovers from the
 Soviet period, were not freely chosen by workers. About 80 percent of Armenia's
 work force are members of unions.
 A 1993 Presidential Decree prohibits the Government and other employers from
 retaliating against strikers and labor leaders, and the Government enforces its pro-
 visions. A number of strikes occurred in 1994; the Governmenit did not appear to
 hinder them.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies and to form federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Law on Employ-
 ment provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. However, most en-
 terprises, factories, and organizations remain under state control. Therefore, vol-
 untary, direct negotiations cannot take place between unions and management
 without the participation of the Government.
 Collective bargaining is not practiced. The Government sets wages in state-owned
 industries with reference to the prevailing minimum wage. It encourages profitable
 factories to establish their own pay scales. The factory's management generally sets
 wage scales without consulting the employees. Arbitration courts adjudicate wage
 and other labor disputes. These courts have acted in the past to compel the rein-
 statement of employees fired because of their labor activism.
 Armenia has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1992 Law on Employment
 prohibits forced labor, and it is not practiced. Local councils of deputies, unemploy-
 ment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbitration Commission enforce
 this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the 1992 Law on Em-
 ployment, 16 is the minimum age for employment. Children may work from age 14
 with the permission of a medical commission and the relevant labor union board.
 Child labor is not practiced. Local councils of deputies, unemployment offices, and,
 as a final board of appeal, the Arbitration Commission enforce the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by governmental de-
 cree and was increased periodically during 1994. The minimum wage in September
 was about $0.50 per month. Employees paid the minimum wage cannot support ei-
 ther themselves or their families. Almost all enterprises are either idle or operating
 at only a fraction of their capacity. Workers still on the payrolls of idle enterprises,
 who have not been put on indefinite, unpaid leave status, continue to receive two-
 thirds of their base salary. As a result of the economic dislocations caused by the
 breakup of the Soviet Union, the 1988 earthquake, the conflict in Nagorno-
 Karabakh, and the resultant disruption in Armenia's trade, the overwhelming ma-
 jority of Armenians live below the officially recognized poverty level. The standard
 legal workweek is 41 hours.
 Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure 'healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 definition of "healthy and normal."
