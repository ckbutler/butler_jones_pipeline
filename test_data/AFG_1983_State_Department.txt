 Afghanistan was invaded by the armed forces of the Soviet Union
 in December 1979. It is now wracked by a country-wide
 insurgency in which 105,000 occupying Soviet troops and the
 forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan are pitted
 against the Afghan resistance or mujahidin, supported by the
 vast majority of the Afghan people. This is in keeping with
 Afghan history, in which the greatest moments of common
 endeavor for the independent-minded ethnic groups occur in the
 face of foreign invasion.
 On April 27 and 28, 1978, a Marxist-Leninist coup, called the
 "Great Saur (April) Revolution', overthrew President Mohammad
 Daoud and established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.
 (Daoud had in 1973 deposed his cousin, the last Afghan king,
 Zahir Shah, and had established a republican-style
 government.) Noor Mohammad Taraki, Secretary-General of the
 People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, a coalition of the
 Marxist-Leninist Khalq and Parcham wing's.ef the party, was
 named President of the Revolutionary Council and Prime
 Minister. In March 1979, Hafizullah Amin replaced Taraki as
 Prime Minister, but Taraki kept the office of President.
 Opposition to the Marxist-Leninist Government developed almost
 immediately and subsequently spread throughout the country.
 Differences among the leaders also surfaced and resulted in the
 exile of the Parcham faction leadership by the Khalq, and
 numerous killings, purges, and imprisonments. In September
 1979, the intraparty factionalism erupted in a showdown between
 the two leaders, Amin and Taraki, resulting in the death of
 Taraki and the assumption of full power by Amin. Against this
 troubled background, the Soviet Union intervened directly on
 December 27, 1979, bringing their already strong military
 presence to a total of 85,000 troops. Amin and his family were
 killed by an armored assault against the Presidential palace,
 and in his place the Soviets installed Babrak Karmal, an exiled
 leader of the Parcham faction, who returned to Kabul several
 days after Amin's death.
 Soviet influence had grown steadily in Afghanistan following
 the 1978 coup, and has escalated dramatically following the
 invasion in December 1979. Soviet advisors have been moved
 into controlling positions in government ministeries, in the
 army, and in the organs of the security apparatus and are now
 involved in all significant policy decisions. The
 Sovietization of such important institutions as the media and
 the educational system is virtually complete. Despite repeated
 calls for withdrawal by the United Nations General Assembly and
 regional organizations, the Soviets have shown no intention of
 withdrawing their soldiers or reducing their influence.
 There has been little change in the human rights situation in
 Afghanistan in 1983. The most pervasive and systematic
 violator of human rights in the areas controlled by the regime
 is the 20,000 member secret police organization known as the
 KHAD. This multifaceted and pervasive organization is modeled
 on the Soviet security agency, the KGB, and is responsible for
 foreign and domestic intelligence coljection and clandestine
 operations and for maintaining regime control through
 surveillance, arrest, interrogation, trial, sentencing, and
 imprisonment of perceived offenders against the regime. KHAD
 has become an increasingly efficient agent of repression and a
 prime tool for control of the Afghan population in areas under
 regime domination. The effect of the ubiquitous secret
 
 (1185)
 
 
 1186
 police has been to create a pervasive atmosphere of mutual
 suspicion and fear. Tensions in urban areas were heightened in
 1983 by the systematic violation of the sanctity of the home by
 military and secret police forces searching for arms, military
 recruits, loot, and political opponents.
 In the countryside, where regime control is limited or
 non-existent, human rights have been violated on a massive
 scale by Soviet and Soviet-directed forces. In 1983 the
 Soviets continued and expanded the use of reprisal attacks
 against the civilian population in militarily strategic regions
 and areas of the greatest resistance success and activity.
 This included the bombing, strafing, and destruction of
 villages, cultivated fields, orchards, and herds of livestock,
 as well as the killing of those left behind in villages--the
 old men, women, and children. Bombardments in such areas as
 the Logar Valley and the Shomali region near Kabul, and of
 major towns such as Herat and Kandahar, have continued the
 devastation that has forced many civilians to seek refuge in
 the relative security of Kabul and has contributed to a massive
 flight of refugees out of the country. Since the
 Marxist-Leninist coup in 1978, an estimated more than three
 million Afghans have fled and become refugees because of the
 devastation brought about by regime/Soviet military activity
 and because of their opposition to oppression by the regime.
 In the large areas of the ccintryside where the mujahidin are
 in virtual if fluid control, wartime conditions and animosities
 and even violence among the various resistance groups have
 resulted in further violations of human rights. Multiple
 taxation, arbitrary detention, and even banditry prevail
 intermittently in some areas. There appears to be little
 prospect for early amelioration of the human rights situation
 in Afghanistan since neither the Soviets and the Babrak Karmal
 regime on one hand, nor the mujahidin and the people of
 Afghanistan on the other, show signs of willingness to quit the
 struggle.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Unable to suppress armed resistance to the Soviet occupation of
 Afghanistan or to gain popular acquiescence to the client
 regime of Babrak Karmal, Soviet and regime forces in 1983
 continued the policy of reprisals against the civilian populace
 in areas of greatest mujahidin activity. Villages along the
 strategic highways were regularly bombarded prior to the
 movement of military convoys in order to discourage mujahidin
 attack. Following resistance attacks, entire villages have
 been destroyed by bombardment near Kandahar, Afghanistan's
 second largest city, and in the Maidan Shahr region to the
 southwest of Kabul. The heaviest campaigns against civilian
 populations in 1983 appear to have taken place during the
 bombing and sweep operations in Herat in the spring, in and
 near Kandahar, Paghman, and the Logar Valley during the summer,
 and against villages in the Shomali region just north of Kabul
 in the autumn. Credible accounts by survivors indicate Soviet
 troops have shot unarmed civilians and in some cases bayonetted
 women and children.
 
 
 1187
 Some killings appear even less related to Soviet military
 goals. Anti-personnel mines and other explosive devices
 disguised as household objects or toys have been strewn along
 trails in the southwest and eastern regions of the country. In
 mid-1983, a Soviet tank crew, angered by sniper fire,
 machinegunned Afghan bus passengers having lunch at a tea house
 in northern Afghanistan, while in early October a Soviet
 helicopter attacked a public bus near Herat without apparent
 reason, killing most of its passengers. There are no reliable
 civilian casualty figures, but Soviet and regime operations
 clearly constitute the major cause of death in Afghanistan.
 Summary executions of captured mujahidin on the battlefield are
 not uncommon, while resistance forces frequently kill captured
 Afghan and Soviet soldiers. Though some prisoners in Afghan
 jails have been summarily killed, there is less evidence of
 such executions in 1983 than during the previous year.
 Assassination by mujahidin of Afghan Communist Party members,
 suspected secret police agents, and Soviets in Afghan cities is
 a daily occurrence. Urban terrorism, which peaked in late
 1982, has been sporadically continued by the resistance. While
 bombings are usually directed against restaurants and bars
 which serve as gathering places for the secret police, there is
 no doubt that innocent bystanders and passersby have also been
 killed or injured.
 There have been continuing reports in. 1983 of Soviet use of
 chemical weapons in Afghanistan.   The United States Government
 has not yet been able to confirm these reports, as it was able
 to do in previous years, but is continuing its analysis of
 available data and various material samples that have been
 collected.
 b. Disappearance
 Under the previous Communist regimes of Nur Mohammad Taraki and
 Hafizullah Amin, people frequently disappeared from the street
 or their homes and were never heard from again. Under the
 Babrak Karmal regime, this condition has improved and families,
 as a rule, eventually find out that their missing relatives
 have been swept up in the ubiquitous dragnet for military
 conscripts or have been detained by the secret police, often
 without formal charges.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture remains one of the main techniques used by the Afghan
 security services to extract information from detainees and to
 inflict ad hoc punishment on prisoners. Amnesty International
 released a statement on November 2, 1983, naming eight centers
 in Kabul where regime secret police torture political
 detainees. Victims included schoolgirls and ranged in age from
 16 to over 60. Many victims have died or suffered serious,
 permanent injury. Foreign prisoners, who are not subjected to
 such treatment, have recounted seeing the torturer's
 paraphernalia used by the secret police in the interrogation
 rooms of the Prime Minister's office building. Refugees and
 survivors recount tales of torture by electric shock, immersion
 in water, beatings, extraction of finger nails, repeated blows
 on the soles of feet, and burning of genitalia. The secret
 police also used harsh techniques against persons brought in
 for routine questioning. For example in mid-1983 one old man
 who happened to be near the site of a mujahidin operation
 
 
 1188
 was detained for two days. While not physically assaulted, he
 was kept under bright lights without water and food until he
 was released. There have been isolated, unconfirmed reports of
 torture by the mujahidin, usually directed at captured Soviet
 soldiers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Afghans living in areas controlled by the regime live in
 constant fear of arbitrary arrest or detention by the secret
 police. Persons are often picked up on the word of secret
 police informants, including children informing against their
 parents, and are not told the charges against them. Warrants
 are not used. Formal charges are usually brought only after
 months of delay and interrogation, if at all. Not uncommonly,
 people are rounded up in neighborhood house-to-house searches,
 imprisoned, and then virtually forgotten by the authorities.
 Political crimes range from armed opposition to the authorship
 or distribution of leaflets against the regime and the Soviet
 occupation forces. The regime distinguishes between common and
 political crimes and often announces in the media that special
 .revolutionary courts' have travelled to the provinces to try
 'counter-revolutionaries*.
 There are no firm figures for the number of political
 detainees. The prison population in Kabul probably numbers
 around 25,000 with another 500-1,000 held in secret police
 interrogation rooms. A substantial proportion of these
 prisoners are detained for political 'crimes". The number of
 prisoners and detainees held in provincial jails is not known,
 but probably is double the number held in Kabul.
 Bail is not a feature of Afghan law. However, in cases of
 common crimes involving wealthy persons or persons with good
 connections with the regime, bail is sometimes granted.
 Corruption is widespread, and it is possible for the families
 of those detained for common or political crimes to have them
 released after sufficient bribes are paid to secret police
 agents or members of the regime. In mid-1983 for example, a
 resistance fighter caught with weapons in Kabul was released
 after his family paid $1,000 to his secret police interrogators.
 Afghan regime sweeps for army conscripts and illegal retention
 of soldiers beyond their term of service also regularly occur
 and constitute detention on arbitrary grounds. As a result of
 recruiting problems and the high rate of desertions, the regime
 decided in 1983 to retain reservists beyond their legal release
 date. Revised draft laws further reduced exemptions and led to
 the recall of others who had already completed their military
 service. The regime continued to use house-to-house searches
 and press gangs in the bazaars and markets of the major cities
 in order to obtain conscripts, who often have no legal
 liability to service.
 In areas of Afghanistan not controlled by the regime, civil and
 criminal cases are ordinarily adjudicated by traditional
 Islamic judges. Captured regime soldiers are often considered
 fellow Muslims and instructed to defect or return to their
 villages. Soviet soldiers are sometimes killed on the spot,
 though this seems to happen less frequently than shortly after
 the Soviet invasion, and in many cases, such as in the Panjsher
 Valley, they are kept under detention. Captured Afghan army
 officers and suspected secret police agents are either killed
 or detained after an informal mujahidin inquiry. In 1983,
 eight Soviet prisoners of war captured by the resistance
 
 
 1189
 continued their two-year internment in Switzerland under terms
 of an agreement worked out in 1982 between the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the mujahidin, and the
 Governments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Switzerland, and the
 Soviet Union. One of these prisoners escaped to West Germany
 where he is seeking political asylum. In October, one more
 Soviet prisoner of war from Afghanistan began internment with
 the others in Switzerland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those accused of non-political offenses are apparently
 tried in the civil court system under the norms of
 pre-Communist judicial codes. All courts, whether civil,
 military, or security, are controlled by the regime. The laws
 governing the organization and jurisdiction of the courts of
 the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, issued in 1981, set out
 as the first priority of the system "the safeguarding and
 protection of the gains of the Saur Revolution*. One
 consequence is that plaintiffs may be denied judicial process
 because of their political beliefs or social position. Often
 imprisoned for months without trial or formal charge, Afghan
 political prisoners are tried and sentenced in secret with the
 secret police playing the major role. On the rare occasions
 when foreigners are accused of political crimes, they are given
 a *defense lawyer', but are not allowed to question regime
 witnesses, whose testimony is invariably accepted as fact by
 the court. Though the trials of Afghan political prisoners are
 shrouded in secrecy, it is clear that they are not allowed
 lawyers, seldom are able to question hostile witnesses, and are
 assumed to be guilty. In a pretrial television propaganda show
 in September 1983, after the Afghan detainees gave obviously
 rehearsed confessions, the regime news agency stated that "the
 Afghan citizens will soon be tried by the revolutionary court
 and will be punished for their crimes'. Such statements
 confirm the general belief that such trials are a sham, and
 that the guilt and punishment of political offenders are
 determined prior to any judicial process.
 In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal cases
 are apparently tried by Islamic "Qazis" (judges) under
 traditional Shari'a law and Afghan custom. The imposition of
 such sentences as death, stoning, or mutilation is reportedly
 rare. There are also mujahidin courts for trying Soviet and
 regime soldiers or suspected regime agents. Little is known of
 the working of these bodies, although they are believed to be
 based on Islamic jurisprudence. Under the conditions of a
 wartime resistance movement, it can be assumed that decisions
 on legal questions in the mujahidin-controlled areas vary
 widely and loosely follow regional norms of justice and equity.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Afghan regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right of the people to an undisturbed private
 sphere of activity. This fundamental political axiom is
 reinforced by wartime conditions, and in both the cities and
 during operations against villages, areas are frequently
 cordoned off and subjected to house-to-house searches. The
 main objects of such searches are military conscripts,
 mujahidin, and weapons. Commonly, however, members of the
 secret police accompany the military and read book titles and
 correspondence for evidence of unorthodox opinion or
 connections.
 
 
 1190
 In areas controlled by the regime, the secret police are
 pervasive and number about 20,000. In addition to actual
 agents, there are organized networks of 'informants. Even
 children are told it is their "revolutionary' duty to provide
 information on suspicious activities by their parents and
 neighbors.
 During 1983 there was a concerted regime effort to force
 persons working in government organizations, such as the
 schools and Radio Afghanistan, to join the Communist Party.
 Employees have been threatened with loss of jobs or even
 imprisonment if they refuse to join. This campaign has led to
 a further exodus from the country by Afghanistan's shrunken
 middle class.
 According to regime statistics, the number of domestic and
 international letters has decreased each year since the 1978
 "Saur Revolution-. This trend reflects regime inability to
 deliver letters in areas controlled by the resistance, which
 amounts to approximately 75 to 85 percent of rural areas, and
 the widespread belief that all mail is scrutinized by the
 secret police.
 Rights to privacy and freedom from arbitrary interference vary
 widely in areas controlled by local mujahidin leaders and are
 no doubt influenced by military needs. The Afghan resistance
 has generally tried not to antagonize the civilian population
 by arbitrary demands for shelter or supplies, but there are
 always exceptions, and growing suspicion caused by the
 increased use of informers and agents can only compound an
 already difficult situation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in those areas of
 Afghanistan controlled by the regime, and all media are owned
 and strictly controlled by the regime and its Soviet decision
 makers. The press, radio, and television are used solely to
 convey and reflect regime policy and Soviet interpretations of
 world events. Since mid-1982, the regime has forbidden the
 unlicensed importation and sale of all foreign video and music
 tapes, magazines, books, posters, and other publications. The
 great majority of the new books on sale in Kabul bookstores are
 published in the U.S.S.R. Afghans tend to be guarded in their
 private conversations lest anti-regime or anti-Soviet remarks
 be reported by secret police agents. Western radio broadcasts
 to the area in the local languages are-jammed whenever possible.
 In spite of regime attempts to control all forms of public
 expression, "shabnamas" or 'night letters', which are a
 traditional means of expressing political dissent, circulate
 surreptitiously. The regime considers the printing and
 distribution of such leaflets to be political crimes and many
 university students and professors have been given lengthy
 sentences for such activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in the
 areas controlled by the regime; it permits only assemblies
 which serve its purposes and which are in fact regime-sponsored
 and carefully orchestrated. The regime frequently stages
 'spontaneous* meetings in the capital and provinces to create
 
 
 1191
 the impression of popular support. On several occasions in
 1983, regime troops or secret police broke up large wedding
 receptions, apparently thinking that such congregations provide
 forums for anti-regime conversation. Many Afghans also believe
 that the powerful searchlights often directed on houses in the
 older sections of Kabul are used to intimidate persons from
 meeting on roof-tops after the curfew.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan has for centuries been an overwhelmingly Islamic
 nation, though small Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish enclaves of
 foreign origin have traditionally been tolerated. The former
 Communist regimes of Taraki and Amin were militantly
 secularist. As this orientation was a major factor in the
 armed resistance to these regimes' authority, the Babrak Karmal
 regime makes a great show of dedication to Islamic principles;
 the media portray regime figures as defenders of the faith and
 the resistance as destroyers of mosques, while major regime
 policies are immediately given the imprimatur of the
 regime-controlled Council of Religious Figures. In areas under
 its control, the regime selects, censors, and pays the mullahs
 for individual mosques. Such clerics are considered to be
 secret police agents by many Afghans and are frequently
 assassinated by the resistance. Despite such propaganda, the
 vast majority of the religious leadership and the people of
 Afghanistan consider the regime and its sponsors anathema to
 the tenets of Islam. Conditions pertaining to freedom of
 religion vary widely in areas of mujahidin control.  In those
 parts of Afghanistan under fundamentalist leadership there
 tends to be greater Islamic orthodoxy, while for regions under
 moderate leadership greater diversity is allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel has been severely curtailed by the war.
 Overland movement has become more difficult and dangerous
 because of physical damage to roadbeds and destruction of
 bridges. Surface travellers also run the risk of being caught
 in fights between mujahidin and Soviet and regime convoys. The
 civilian traveller is also faced with frequent checkpoints or
 roadblocks by Soviets, regime forces, mujahidin and, in some
 cases, bandits. Tolls are often extracted at these stops.
 Regime officials in Western dress ordinarily travel by air,
 since they run the risk of being identified and killed by the
 mujahidin. However, domestic air travel has also become more
 dangerous because of occasional resistance attacks on aircraft
 and airports.
 The regime severely curtails foreign travel by Afghans under
 its control. Permission for professionals such as doctors,
 engineers, and academics is routinely denied out of fear they
 will not return. Substantial businessmen can still obtain
 passports, but many Afghans are forced to pay bribes of *1,000
 or more to have a passport issued. Bank accounts and real
 estate are often asked as surety for return, and the regime
 seizes the property of persons absent from Afghanistan for more
 than a year. Passports are often limited to one trip only and
 seized at the airport upon return. Afghan pilgrims to Mecca
 are issued documents valid only for Saudi Arabia in an effort
 to assure return to Afghanistan.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 76
 
 
 1192
 While legal emigration is virtually impossible, large numbers
 of Afghans continue to leave the country clandestinely to seek
 refuge abroad. The regime has seized entire families who
 presented insufficient justification for travelling on routes
 commonly used to leave the country surreptitiously. Most
 estimates place the number of Afghans who have fled the country
 at over three million. Though the regime has often asserted
 that such exiles are welcome to return to Afghanistan without
 penalty, most expatriate Afghans have decided not to return as
 long as practices such as the indiscrimate bombing of villages
 continue.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Since the Soviet invasion in 1979, a one-party state ruled by
 the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has given way to a
 totalitarian apparatus controlled by the Soviet Union. In
 fact, however, the regime and Soviets exert control only over
 the major cities, and in many cases, such as Herat and
 Kandahar, this control is limited and tenuous and is challenged
 frequently by armed resistance attacks. Most of the
 countryside is, for all practical purposes, in the hands of the
 mujahidin.   Soviet military and civilian advisers sit in
 almost all ministries and make or approve every significant
 decision in the name of the regime. The party itself is
 modeled totally along Soviet lines and is headed by a 12-member
 Politburo. The party is torn by unabated feuding between its
 Parcham and Khalq factions, although the less numerous Parcham
 faction, which is favored by Moscow, retains control of the
 party apparatus. Serious clashes between the two wings
 continued throughout 1983, including a confrontation in
 mid-August near Herat in which over 100 were reported killed.
 Political assassinations in Kabul are often suspected to be the
 work of the rival factions rather than of the mujahidin.
 Regime figures put party membership at 90,000 (including
 candidate members) though actual membership is probably lower.
 Membership in the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan,
 which is the only legal political party, is a prerequisite for
 any meaningful participation in public affairs and professional
 advancement in most fields. There has been no legislature or
 election of any kind since the 1978 Communist coup, and the
 regime rules by edict.
 With roughly 75 to 85 percent of the countryside of Afghanistan
 in the hands of the resistance, local mujahidin groups control
 political, judicial, and educational activities there. In some
 areas, resistance leaders are traditional local leaders, in
 others younger military organizers. Since this leadership is
 in defianoe of the formal government apparatus, the authority
 of such leaders necessarily depends on some form of informal
 popular consent, often approval by the traditional local
 "jirga" or council.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The 1983 Amnesty International report on Afghanistan expressed
 concern over the widespread imprisonment of political
 dissidents, the lack of formal charges and the denial of fair
 trial to people accused of political "crimes', trials which do
 not conform to international legal standards, torture and
 ill-treatment of prisoners, the death penalty, and
 extra-judicial executions. While some of Amnesty
 International's concern focused on the activities of the
 
 
 1193
 mujahidin, the majority was directed at practices of the Babrak
 Karmal regime. Freedom House rates Afghanistan one of the
 least free countries in the world.
 The International Afghanistan Hearing held in Oslo, Norway, in
 March 1983 heard the testimony of a number of witnesses who
 detailed a variety of human rights violations committed by
 Soviet armed forces in Afghanistan. Two French doctors said
 that the Soviet Union is conducting a conscious policy of
 village destruction. A Norwegian journalist reported the
 conference discussed "clear indications that the Soviet Union
 has the extermination of major population groups as its
 conscious strategy in Afghanistan'.
 An International Seminar on Afghan Refugees, sponsored by the
 Paris-based International Afghanistan Bureau and held in Geneva
 in November, was sharply critical of the Soviet Union's
 activities in Afghanistan. The Seminar decided to set up a
 commission to examine the conditions of displaced persons
 inside Afghanistan and out.
 The Afghan regime in 1983 continued to refuse to allow another
 visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
 after the ICRC representatives were asked to leave Kabul in
 October 1982. (ICRC representatives had previously been
 expelled in 1980 but were allowed to return earlier in 1982.)
 The Afghan regime also continued to reject resolutions and
 opinions of other organizations and groups, and refused to
 allow international commissions of investigation to visit the
 country to look into charges of chemical warfare.
 The Afghan resistance in 1983 maintained contact with the
 ICRC. Also, two French-based medical groups, "Medicins Sans
 Frontiers' (Doctors without Borders) and 'Aide Medicale
 Internationale* (Intertnational Medical Aid) continued to send
 medical teams into mujahidin controlled areas of Afghanistan
 with mujahidin cooperation.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 While there are no reliable current demographic statistics on
 Afghanistan, standards of nutrition and health care have
 clearly declined since the 1978 Communist coup and the 1979
 Soviet invasion. The war has disrupted the international
 marketing system and interrupted the movement of surplus
 agricultural products from one region to another. Moreover,
 the Soviets have destroyed crops and livestock in certain
 regions of the country such as the Shomali region north of
 Kabul and the Logar Valley to the south. The result has been
 the creation of areas with inadequate food supplies and
 occasional pockets of starvation. Food imported from the
 Soviet Union is distributed mainly in the major cities under
 regime control.
 Given the large number of casualties among the civilian
 population caused by the war, Afghan life expectancy has
 clearly decreased. While rural health delivery services were
 never adequate, at present they are non-existent except for
 folk medicine and a limited number of Afghan paramedics who are
 usually only semi-skilled and serve in mujahidin controlled
 areas and those services provided by foreign doctors who have
 entered the country clandestinely. Medical services provided
 in urban areas under regime control are also inadequate,
 partially due to the influx of rural people driven from their
 villages by military action.
 
 
 1194
 The war has also had a drastic impact on education in
 Afghanistan. The resistance has destroyed most rural schools
 and many others have been closed because of the danger for
 regime teachers. In such areas, education appears to be in the
 hands of traditional Islamic teachers. The regime's inability
 to maintain the strength of its armed forces has led to the
 drafting of boys as young as 15 (though 19 is the publicized
 age limit), and attendance at Kabul University has been limited
 to women, male party members, and men who have completed
 military service. In secure urban areas, schools for girls and
 boys are functioning, though curricula have been reoriented
 along Soviet lines. The regime has initiated a literacy
 program in the military forces using ideological tracts as
 texts. Each year several thousand Afghan young people are sent
 to the Soviet Union for training which is heavily geared to
 political indoctrination.
 Party members, secret police, and some merchants may have been
 enriched by the war, but the vast majority of Afghans have been
 hurt economically. With the exception of regime-subsidized
 wheat, the price of most food items has risen much faster than
 personal income, and heating fuel costs have become exorbitant
 for the average Afghan family. Although electricity is
 relatively inexpensive, it is also frequently unavailable
 during the winter months. The difficulties of surface travel
 and repeated bombings of formerly rich agricultural and
 pastoral areas, such as the Shomali region and the northern
 steppe, have led to a decrease of traditional
 Afghan cash crops and exports such as grapes and dried fruit,
 and Karakul lambskins. Production of traditional handicraft
 items for export, such as carpets, has also been severely
 impeded by the war.
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond home and
 field has been limited by the traditional Islamic beliefs and
 religious practices of Afghanistan. In areas of intense
 fighting and mujahidin control, the role of women remains as it
 traditionally has been. Since the Soviet installation of the
 Babrak Karmal regime, the social position of women has tended
 to improve in Kabul and other cities under its control. Access
 to education by women has increased, emphasis has been put on
 literacy courses for females, and women have entered a number
 of non-traditional professions such as radio and television,
 banking, and the civil service. 'While this trend is a
 conscious regime and Soviet goal, it has also come about since
 men between the ages of 18 and 45 are scarce in the capital as
 the majority are in the armed services, have fled the country,
 or have joined the resistance.
