 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since 1974 as the result of military
 intervention by Turkey that followed a coup d'etat directed from
 Greece which brought down the elected Government of President
 Makarios. Since that time, the Government of Cyprus has been able
 to exercise full control over only about two-thirds of the
 country's territory. About one-third of Cyprus is governed by an
 autonomous administration that since 1975 has used the name
 "Turkish Federated State of Cyprus" and is supported by the
 presence of Turkish military units. The Turkish intervention of
 1974 caused an uprooting of the larger Greek Cypriot population
 from areas now under Turkish Cypriot control, as well as the
 smaller Turkish Cypriot population in the Greek-controlled south.
 Both involved loss of homes and means of livelihood. The Greek
 Cypriots point to these displacements, as well as the
 unwillingness of the Turkish Cypriot authorities to allow
 resettlement of Greek Cypriots in the north, as the fundamental
 human rights question in Cyprus today. The Turkish Cypriots
 assert that the 1974 intervention was legal and prevented the
 island's annexation to Greece. The subsequent regrouping of the
 two communities in separate parts of the island, according to
 Turkish Cypriots, was necessary for their security and the
 eventual establishment of a federal structure.
 The major human rights related problems in Cyprus are the absence
 of freedom of settlement, unresolved property ownership matters,
 and the difficulty of travel between both parts of the island --
 issues whose resolution is a major aspect of the intercommunal
 talks being conducted under auspices of the United Nations.
 Solution of these issues will be a major aspect of any future
 settlement of the Cyprus problem.
 During 1982, the human rights trend in Cyprus has seen little
 change from developments in previous years. Future human rights
 trends in Cyprus will be dependent upon the ability of both sides
 to negotiate their differences and to agree on a basis for
 intercommunal co-existence.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of political killings in Cyprus since
 the violence that accompanied the events of 1974.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no post-1974 reports of persons being.abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention. However, as a result
 of the 1963-74 intercommunal troubles and the events of 1974, the
 issue of missing persons from those conflicts-remains a source of
 dispute between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot.!communities. A
 Committee on Missing Persons was established under the auspices of
 the U.N. Secretary General in 1981 to deal with the problem, but
 its activities have been suspended since February 1982 because of
 procedural disagreements.
 c. Torture
 The Cyprus Constitution prohibits torture. There have been no
 reports that torture is permitted or practiced by the Cyprus
 Government, the Turkish Cypriot administration, or the Turkish
 forces in northern Cyprus.
 
 
 870
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is guaranteed by law in both communities, and there have been no
 reports of violations of this guarantee during the past year.
 Adequate health care is provided in prison and detention
 facilities, and diet is considered normal. Family members may
 visit those in detention at any interval that is not deemed as
 impeding an investigation. Once sentenced, prisoners may be
 visited by family members once a month, or more frequently where
 humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may visit prisoners freely.
 Differing classes of imprisonment do not exist.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by both the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. The right of habeas corpus is
 observed. Preventive detention does not exist in law, nor has it
 been reported in practice. -No individual may be held for more
 than three days for investigation of a crime without referral of
 the case to a court for extension of the period of detention.
 Most periods of investigative detention do not exceed eight or ten
 days before formal charges are filed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair public trial is guaranteed by law. As a
 former British colony, Cyprus has incorporated many features of
 the British judicial system. The judiciary is independent of
 executive or military control. Cases are generally tried before a
 judge or panel of judges, although a request for a jury trial is
 usually granted. There are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses. Civilians are not tried by
 milita y courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Cyprus
 Constitution. The basic document governing the Turkish Cypriot
 community has a similar guarantee. A judicial warrant is required
 for an official to enter a private residence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by law and are widely and freely
 practiced. The press is free throughout the island, and includes
 the entire political spectrum from left to right. Opposition
 papers frequently criticize their own administrations. There is
 no press censorship, although journalists in both communities
 usually stay away from overt criticism of their respective "mother
 countries". Film censorship boards exist in both communities; on
 one occasion during the past year a film by a leftish Turkish
 director was banned in the Turkish Cypriot sector because it was
 deemed insulting to Turkey.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups have the right to organize and hold meetings. Labor
 unions are active in both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
 communities. They have the right to strike, and they participate
 actively in the political process.
 
 
 871
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While freedom of religion exists in Cyprus, the Greek-Orthodox
 Church in the south has the character of a state institution due
 to the historical role of the leader of the Church, the Ethnarch,
 as the spiritual leader of his people. The only remaining
 non-Muslims in the north are the members of the Christian Maronite
 minority, a small number of remaining Greek Cypriots, and foreign
 residents, all of whom can freely practice their religion. There
 is no discrimination against adherents of minority religions nor
 discrimination based on membership or lack of membership in a
 particular faith. Approximately two hundred Turkish Cypriot
 Muslims remain in the south and are allowed to practice their
 religion freely.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots generally enjoy freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. However, the Turkish military
 imposes restrictions on the rights of movement and settlement in
 areas adjoining military camps and near the United
 Nations-controlled cease-fire line.
 Travel between the two sectors is severely restricted. Travel
 into the Turkish-controlled area is under the ultimate supervison
 of the Turkish military. Greeks and Greek Cypriots are barred
 from entry except for a small number of humanitarian cases.
 Turkish Cypriots, except for emergency medical cases and
 journalists on an approved assignment, are also restricted from
 visiting the south. Greek Cypriots still residing in the north
 (about 1000) and Maronites (about 500) are allowed to travel to
 the south after making an application, and there have been
 occasional allegations of arbitrary denial of these applications.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities restrict the entry of foreigners into
 their sector coming from the south, insisting on overnight stays
 and 48-hour notice by visitors intending to travel outside of
 Nicosia. Foreign journalists arriving from the south are normally
 forbidden entry unless accompanied by an employee of the Turkish
 Cypriot public information office.
 The Government of Cyprus also restricts freedom of movement by
 visitors to and from the north. Because the Government has
 declared the use of ports not under its control to be illegal, any
 foreigner arriving through a Turkish Cypriot-controlled port is
 denied entry to the south. Foreigners arriving from the south
 intending to transit through the north to Turkey are also denied
 entry. Citing a law that makes it illegal to use hotels taken
 over from their Greek Cypriot owners in 1974, the Government
 forbids tourists to stay overnight in the north.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed, although
 individuals facing military service or legal action in either
 community may not be allowed to travel. Turkish Cypriots also
 have difficulty in traveling to some countries because their
 travel documents, issued by the "Turkish Federated State of
 Cyprus", are not recognized by most countries. Citizens may
 repatriate freely, although both Greek and Turkish Cypriots
 returning from long stays abroad may be liable for military
 service if this obligation has not been previously met. A small
 number of refugees from Turkey and Eastern Europe sometimes come
 to Cyprus and are.usually sent on to third countries as soon as
 arrangements for their resettlement can be made.
 
 
 872
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot
 administration have lively multiparty political systems. There is
 active and unrestricted competition for support by political
 parties. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north do not
 participate in Turkish Cypriot elections, but elect their own
 village officials. Women are less active in politics than men in
 both north and south although this is due to custom rather than
 any legal impediment. No women in the north or south are members
 of Parliament. Nor are there any women of ministerial rank in the
 north or the south. One woman was previously a minister in the
 Republic of Cyprus Government, and. two women currently serve as
 undersecretaries in the "Turkish Federated State of Cyprus".
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Cyprus participates in the work of the U.N. Commission on Human
 Rights. For several years the question of human rights in Cyprus
 has been on the Commission's agenda but, by agreement of the
 parties directly concerned, has been regularly postponed.
 However, the still unresolved question of missing persons has been
 raised by the Government, which alleges that some 2000 Greek
 Cypriots have remained unaccounted for after the events of 1974.
 Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots claim that these individuals are
 dead and that no prisoners are being held from 1974.
 Representatives of the United Nations' Working Group on
 Disappeared Persons visited Cyprus in the summer of 1982 and spoke
 with representatives of both sides on the matter. The issue is
 still unresolved and a committee on Missing Persons, established
 under UN auspices in 1981, has not met since February 1982, when
 it adjourned sine die due to procedural differences.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Per-capita GNP in the Government-controlled area of Cyprus was
 approximately $4,000 in 1981. The Greek Cypriot economy is
 free-enterprise oriented, with only a modicum of Government
 participation or regulation. The economy is based on
 manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction, and agriculture, with
 manufacturing contributing most to the GNP. The Turkish Cypriot
 economy is closely linked to that of Turkey and is a mixture of
 state-owned and private enterprises. It suffers from problems
 similar to those in Turkey, including high inflation, low
 investment, and significant underemployment.
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are available to members
 of both communities regardless of race, religion, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. Both the Greek and Turkish
 Cypriot societies are essentially middle class, with a small but
 prominent wealthy segment. Housing is adequate, and is available
 for displaced persons. Most Greek and Turkish Cypriots are
 covered by a national health service scheme organized by their
 respective authorities. Illiteracy is virtually unknown among
 persons below the age of 55. Turkish Cypriot authorities in the
 past two years have been making efforts to eradicate remaining
 illiteracy in that community, mainly among the older population.
 In  the Greek-and Turkish Cypriot communities, the legal status of
 women is Identicalto-that of men. ,However, custom has retarded
 -the full- part-icipation -of. women in all aspects of public life.
 -Politics, for instance, has traditionally been a male preserve in
 .both communities. Through changing attitudes and increasing
 contact-with the outside world, however, women are experiencing
 increased mobility.
