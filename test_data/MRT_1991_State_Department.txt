 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been governed since 1984
 by the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) under
 the chairmanship of Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who is
 also Chief of State. The Military Committee functions
 nominally as a legislative body under the direction of
 President Taya, while the President, assisted by his Council of
 Ministers and a few close advisors, wields executive power.
 In the latter half of 1991, the Government, in response to
 mounting public criticism and international isolation, took
 steps to encourage the development of multiparty democracy in
 Mauritania. In July a new Constitution was adopted by
 referendum, and subsequently ordinances were promulgated
 permitting political parties, establishing freedom of the
 press, and granting amnesty to all political prisoners. The
 President announced that legislative and presidential elections
 would be held before April 1992 and promulgated new electoral
 laws. Several newly formed-opposition parties intend to
 contest the elections while challenging the fairness of the
 electoral procedures announced to date.
 Mauritanian'security forces number between 16,000 and 18,000
 and include the regular armed forces, the National Guard, the
 Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and
 the police. The Gendarmerie is directed by the Ministry of
 Defense, while the National Guard and police come under the
 Ministry of .Interior. As in previous years, the security
 forces continued to be responsible for widespread human rights
 violations. The significant difference in 1991 was that, for
 the first time, abuses perpetrated by the security forces were
 directed in the main at a purge of their own ranks.
 Most of Mauritania's 1.9 million inhabitants, either nomadic
 herders or settled farmers, live within a subsistence economy.
 Mauritania is burdened with numerous long-term economic and
 social problems: drought, desertification, insect infestation,
 extensive unemployment, rapid inflation, one of the highest per
 capita foreign debts in Africa, minimal-infrastructure,
 inadequate health and education systems, and growing
 urbanization. Low rainfall levels over the past years have
 forced large numbers of nomads into towns, with a consequent
 weakening of traditional Maur nomadic culture and a Revere
 strain on government resources.
 Although the military leadership has tried carefully to
 maintain control, the reform process shows some promise of
 enabling Mauritanians to deal with their economic problems and
 ethnic tensions in the future within the framework of a more
 open political system. Meanwhile, the actual human rights
 situation in Mauritania did not improve in 1991. In fact, the
 arbitrary arrest, detention, and torture by the armed forces of
 up to 3,000 persons represented a serious human rights
 regression. Those arrested (almost exclusively from the black
 Mauritanian Halpulaar ethnic groups) were accused of plotting
 to overthiow the Government, but none of them was ever charged
 with any crime. There is credible evidence that many, if not
 all, of the detainees were subjected to harsh interrogation
 techniques and brutal torture, in some'cases over a period of 7
 months, in order to extract self-incriminating confessions.
 Although the Government announced that all detainees were
 released by mid-April 1991, approximately 500 remain
 unaccounted for and are presumed dead. Of those who survived
 the detention and torture, very few have been reintegrated into
 the military (or, in the case of civilians, into their former
 
 
 240
 MAURITANIA
 jobs). On the other hand, the number of human rights abuses in
 the riverine area bordering Senegal decreased markedly since
 late 1990 as a result of a gradually improving political
 atmosphere between the two Governments.
 Some restrictions on freedom of the press were eased. The
 right to a fair public trial, the right of citizens to change
 their government, and worker rights remained restricted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There continued to be a number of extrajudicial killings of
 persons, particularly non-Arabic (Hassaniya)-speaking black
 Mauritanians. Whereas most of the riverine violence in 1989
 and 1990 stemmed from mass expulsions and suppression of
 resulting cross-border raiding, the nature of violence changed
 substantially in 1991. Most disputes in the riverine area in
 1991 arose from arguments over land and property, including
 cases of Mauritanian expellees who returned home to find their
 belongings had been expropriated.
 Also in 1991, security forces continued their occasional
 practice of arbitrarily killing non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks,
 who make up the majority of the population living along the
 Senegal river. For example, in September Mamadou Amadou Watt
 was shot to death in his own home, reportedly by a national
 guardsman. The victim and the perpetrator reportedly had
 earlier disagreed over a bribe that the victim had refused to
 pay. No one has yet been charged or arrested in this incident,
 which took place in the town of Olologo in the Brakna region.
 Although the frequency of these types of killings substantially
 diminished in 1991, they continued to occur. As in previous
 years, there were no reports of government inquiries into the
 incidents or any efforts to punish those responsible.
 The principal example of extrajudicial killing was the presumed
 deaths of approximately 500 largely Halpulaar and Soninke
 military and civilian personnel alleged to have attempted to
 overthrow the Government. These persons were part of a larger
 group--possibly as many as 3,000--who were rounded up,
 detained, and tortured in prison (see Section l.c.). To date
 the Taya Government has not provided credible evidence of such
 a plot, and critics claim the Government used this charge to
 mask a purge of blacks from the military and civil service.
 The results of an internal military investigation have not been
 made public, and no one has been charged with or faced trial
 for the tortures and deaths. It appears that the highest
 levels of the military hierarchy--including several members of
 the ruling CMSN--were involved and may personally have taken
 part in torture or execution. Although two CMSN members were
 placed on probation and removed from their commands for 6
 months, presumably for their role in the events, they have now
 been reintegrated, promoted to full colonels, and given new
 responsibilities. Two other high-ranking officials said to be
 implicated also received promotions during the year.
 Furthermore, some of the officials named to the investigative
 board may themselves have been involved in the incidents.
 A local press investigation implicated the police in four
 suspicious homicides in 1991. The. Government has neither
 
 
 241
 MAURITANIA
 acknowledged these allegations nor taken any measures to
 investigate them.
 b. Disappearance
 It is impossible either to enumerate or confirm instances of
 disappearances in Mauritania for the past year. Of the many
 (up to 3,000) Halpulaar and Soninke military officers, enlisted
 men and civilians who were arrested and tortured in military
 custody for involvement in an alleged coup attempt,
 approximately 500 never returned to their homes. They are
 presumed to have died, although the Government has refused to
 confirm this.
 d. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite the Government's stated opposition to torture and the
 legal prohibition against its use, the security forces
 routinely mistreated persons in custody, particularly political
 dissidents and black Mauritanians. Many of the detainees
 arrested in the fall of 1990 in connection with the alleged
 coup plot were subjected to particularly brutal interrogation
 techniques, as security forces attempted to extract
 self-incriminating confessions of involvement. According to
 those who survived, scores of officers and enlisted men
 participated in the mistreatment of prisoners. These incidents
 took place in at, least a dozen military bases, prisons, and
 installations throughout the country.
 The forms of torture included beatings, forced feeding of sand,
 electrocution, anal rape, burning of genitals, denial of water
 and food, and the so-called jaguar technique, in which victims
 are bound and suspended upside down while the soles of their
 feet are beaten. Prisoners detained at military installations
 at Jreida and at Inal, for example, were held in cramped and
 unsanitary quarters, denied adequate food and water, chained
 for prolonged periods, frequently beaten, and forced to sign
 confessions. One survivor from Jreida said that he had been
 held in a single large room with roughly 100 other persons.
 All prisoners were forced to .sit in fixed positions, with
 wrists chained to ankles. They were fed small portions of rice
 and water, twice daily. They had no separate access to toilets,
 and as sanitary conditions rapidly deteriorated, many became
 ill with beri-beri and other gastrointestinal disorders. This
 witness estimated that 15 to 20 of the prisoners with whom he
 was confined were taken away and never returned, so he presumed
 that they had been killed. Another Jreida survivor stated that
 he was held in solitary confinement for many days in a one-room
 cell measuring one square meter, so that he was forced to sleep
 diagonally with his legs propped against one wall. He received
 one piece of bread daily, along with a bowl of rice mixed-with
 sand.
 Survivors from the military facility at Inal, where up to 200
 prisoners reportedly died, have said that some of the detainees
 there were tied by their testicles to the rear of
 four-wheel-drive vehicles and dragged at high speeds through
 the desert. Several detainees, including Captain Lome
 Abdoulaye, a former senior officer in the Mauritanian Navy,
 died as a result of-this particular treatment. It was also at
 Inal that 28 prisoners were hung simultaneously on November 28,
 1990, ostensibly "in celebration" of Independence Day. A
 survivor of military custody at Nema stated that his accusers
 tied him to a tree, removed his trousers, and tied ropes to his
 
 
 242
 MAURITANIA
 genitals. They then pulled the ropes tightly each time the
 victim refused their demands to confess to involvement in the
 alleged coup plot. The same witness said that a senior officer
 at Nema tortured another victim by setting him afire. A
 survivor of the military installation at N'Beika stated that he
 had been buried alive in the sand, threatened with a pistol to
 his head, and kicked in the face. This survivor is now blind
 in one eye.
 In June police officers in Nouakchott used nightsticks to
 disperse a peaceful protest by female relatives of those who
 had been tortured and killed in prison. Police singled out
 Halpulaar women in the crowd, beating and kicking them. As a
 result, 10 protesters were hospitalized, 5 with serious head
 injuries.
 In late June and early July, four members of the Union of
 Mauritanian Workers (the national trade union) were tortured
 while in police custody. The four had been arrested in the
 aftermath of a street fight that broke out on June 28 between
 union members and police officers. All four were severely
 beaten and subjected to the "jaguar" treatment. One victim
 also suffered cigarette burns on his lips and nostrils.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Mauritanian law requires expeditious arraignment and
 trial, access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal, these
 rights are frequently not observed, particularly in cases of
 political dissidents or persons suspected on national security
 grounds. They are somewhat more often observed in ordinary
 criminal cases. The courts are required to review the legality
 of a person's detention no more than 72 hours after his or her
 arrest. Until recently, however, it was common practice to
 detain prisoners incommunicado for prolonged periods without
 charging them for any crime and without judicial review.
 In late June and early July, security officers arrested several
 opposition leaders, including seven prominent members of the
 United Democratic Front, a dissident (and then illegal)
 organization. These persons were sent into internal exile at
 various locations around the country, where they remained in
 incommunicado detention for several weeks. They were released
 in a general amnesty at the end of July and were never charged
 with any crime.
 As stated elsewhere, the Government in late 1990 began
 arresting non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians in the
 military as well as civilian sectors. By the end of the year,
 between 1,500 and 3,000 persons had been arrested and held
 incommunicado. More than 300 of the former detainees have been
 dishonorably discharged from the military without explanation.
 Some also apparently have been denied back pay and other
 benefits due them.
 In addition to the incidents described above, there continued
 to be credible reports in 1991 of arrests, intimidation,
 prolonged detention, and expulsion committed by security forces
 in communities along the Senegal river.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three types of courts: the Shari'a, the special
 courts, and the State Security Court. The legal system
 functions primarily under the Shari'a (Islamic law). While the
 
 
 243
 MAURITANIA
 judiciary is nominally independent, many observers believe that
 judges take their cues from the Government when sentencing
 opponents of the regime. The Ministry of Justice administers
 the Shari'a and selects judicial-personnel. The use by Islamic
 judges of extreme physical punishments, such as amputations, is
 no longer practiced in Mauritania. The Government also is
 slowly eliminating a number of unqualified Shari'a judges.
 Judges cannot be tenured until they have completed 7 years of
 service.
 Commercial and banking offenses, traffic violations that cause
 bodily harm, and offenses against the security of the state
 fall under the jurisdiction of the special courts, which
 supposedly render judgments on the basis of laws modeled after
 the French example. The-effective implementation of justice in
 these courts is particularly problematic because the majority
 of Mauritanian judges-have been'trained neither at the
 university level nor in the French juridical tradition.
 In theory, all defendants, regardless of the court or their
 ability to pay, have the legal right to be present with legal
 counsel during the proceedings. Defendants may confront
 witnesses and present evidence. They may appeal the'sentences
 of the ordinary courts but not those'of the State Security
 Court.
 Mauritanian law specifies that all persons, including
 foreigners, have the right to their property and possessions,
 and may be deprived of them only by a court decision. In 1991,
 as in previous years, the practice of justice in Mauritania
 continued to differ substantially from its theory, particularly
 as a result of the wide discretionary powers allowed in
 practice to the forces of order in rural jurisdictions and to
 the lack of trained public defenders. The right to a fair
 public trial was often abused, particularly in the riverine
 area.
 While it. is true that large-scale confiscations and expulsions,
 such as those, that occurred in the previous 2 years, were not
 repeated in 1991, there were nevertheless occasional reports of
 extrajudicial deportations by security forces in the rverine
 area. None of those expelled had recourse to the courts. In
 many cases, the homes and property of deportees were
 subsequently expropriated by the Government. The Government
 has always maintained that many, if not all, of the persons who
 fled or were expelled were in fact Senegalese nationals, and
 that their Mauritanian identity documents were fraudulent. As
 of late 1991, the Government had failed to set up procedures to
 permit access to the courts by expellees who wished to obtain
 confirmation of their citizenship and the right to return to
 Mauritania. However, in the'general context of improving
 relations with Senegal, informal arrangements with security
 forces resulted in a-number of expellees returning home.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Mauritanian law, judicial warrants are required to-
 perform home searches. This requirement is often ignored in
 practice in "national security" cases. There were in 1991
 repeated reports of government surveillance of suspected
 dissidents. Intimidation and harassment of
 non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians in the Senegal river
 valley also continued on a regular basis.
 
 
 244
 MAURITANIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Ka~ritanians in the latter half of 1991 experienced for the
 first time limited freedom of speech and press. Ironically,
 the new"[climate of liberalization was'an indirect result of the
 mass.detehtion, torture, and execution of those alleged to have
 plotted tb overthrow the Government. As evidence of the
 arrests and deaths came to light in early 1991, the Mauritanian
 public began to demand an explanation from the authorities.
 When no such explanation was forthcoming, the public reacted in
 a way it had not before: in print. Antigovernment tracts,
 newsletters, and petitions began circulating in Nouakchott and
 other major cities. These were followed by articles in
 international magazines and newspapers, as those who had
 survived the incidents reported them from abroad. By early
 sumner, public outrage over the tortures and executions had
 reached a fever pitch, and opposition leaders were for the
 first time calling for Taya's ouster and a complete reworking
 of the political system. In the face of these demands,
 President Taya on July 25 promulgated ordinances permitting the
 creation of political parties and a free press.
 Since that time a lively competition has developed among more
 than a dozen weekly papers, all of which have become
 increasingly bold at criticizing the Government, particularly
 for its perceived insensitivity to, and condonation of, human
 rights abuses. The papers have formed an independent press
 association, which was successful at heading off censorship of
 at least one publication. However, both the press and the
 parties operate within tightly circumscribed limits. All
 newspapers and political parties must register with the
 Ministry of Interior, for example. There is still only one
 daily paper, which is published and controlled by the Ministry
 of Information. Furthermore, the independent weeklies reach
 only a limited audience, not only due to financial constraints
 but also because the majority of Mauritanians cannot read.
 Access to television and radio, to which large numbers of the
 population presumably listen, remains the unique preserve of
 the Ministry of Information. However, the Government has
 stated it will give the opposition parties radio and television
 air time during the electoral campaign.
 The regime continued to sanction publishers for any public
 comments it considered a threat to state security, particularly
 those criticizing the Government's ethnic policies. For
 example, the Government halted publication of the August 1991
 issue of the magazine Mauritanie Demain, which contained
 first-hand accounts of Halpulaars who had survived torture
 while in military confinement. In practice, freedom of
 expression continues to be restricted. Most Mauritanians
 criticize government policies only in conversations with
 friends and relatives. Military personnel are under tight
 surveillance, and views expressed to military colleagues in
 private that could be construed as even mildly critical of the
 Government are likely to cause .intense interrogation by
 military security bfficers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly'and Association
 Although Mauritanian law guarantees the rights of assembly and
 association, all political movements and activities had been
 prohibited until just recently, and most groups operated
 clandestinely or from outside the country. Even under the new
 
 
 245
 MAURITANIA
 ordinances legalizing political parties, all groups must be
 registered with the Minister of Interior and obtain permission
 .for large meetings or assemblies. By year's end, the Interior
 Ministry had recognized 12 political parties, all of which held
 open, regular meetings. Despite some government harassment,
 several of the parties also organized large rallies, drawing
 thousands of participants. In late November, the Government
 was criticized for denying a party permit to a group of
 self-proclaimed radical Islamists. The Government justified
 its action by citing the new Constitution, which forbids the
 establishment of parties based on religion.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually all
 citizens are Muslim. Mauritanian Muslims-are prohibited from
 entering non-Islamic houses of worship and from converting to
 another religion. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and the
 construction of Christian churches and other non-Islamic houses
 of worship are prohibited. The Roman Catholic community in
 Mauritania has five churches, which operate freely as long as
 they restrict their services to resident foreigners.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,-and Repatriation
 Traditionally, there have been few restrictions on movement
 within Mauritania,.- where nomadism has long'been a way of life.
 However, following the rupture of relations with Senegal in
 1989'and the attendant violence in the riverine area, local
 authorities imposed and enforced at their own initiative
 dusk-to-dawn curfews in some villages. This practice continued
 in 1991, though on a much-diminished level. Although
 Mauritanians since 1985 have not needed exit visas to travel
 abroad, there are recurrent reports that some
 persons--primarily kntiregime activists and
 non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks-were denied passports for
 unexplained; and possibly political, reasons.
 The 100,000 or more Mauritanian nationals expelled from Senegal
 and Mali in 1990 and earlier were largely reabsorbed into
 Mauritania.through government and private means by the end of
 1991. However, as some of them were settled on land belonging
 to expelled Mauritanian residents, the seed of future trouble
 has been planted if those expelled eventually return.
 Approximately 55,000 expelled Mauritanian residents are still
 resident in camps in.Senegal, awaiting a political settlement
 between the two couhtries which could include terms for
 repatriation or indemnification. These refugees, plus an
 additional 13,000 Halpulaar refugees in Mali, were expelled
 from or fled Mauritania beginning in 1989.
 Mauritania has become the refuge for some 18,000 Tuareg and
 Maur refugees fleeing from ethnic strife in Mali's northern
 regions.. They live in camps largely supported by an
 international effort led by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Finally, as a result of the
 ongoing conflict in neighboring Western Sahara between Morocco
 and the Polisario Front, a small number of refugees from the
 Western Sahara have settled in Nouadhibou and other northern
 towns and have been successfully absorbed into Mauritanian
 society.
 
 
 246
 MAURITANIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1991 citizens did not have this right. However, the Taya
 Government in the latter part of 1991 took steps in the
 direction of a multiparty system, scheduling presiddntial
 elections for January 24, 1992. Legislative elections are to
 be held before April 1992. At year's end, all political power
 continued to rest in the hands of the military regime.
 The Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) continued
 to wield all executive and legislative functions. Membership
 is limited to military officers, who occupy ministerial
 positions or important military and security posts. The CMSN
 is comprised predominantly of Maurs. Non-Maur membership on
 the CMSN and in other senior civilian and military positions
 has decreased in the wake of ethnic tensions.
 The Government uses a quasi-political organization, the
 Structure for the Education of the Masses (SEM), to mobilize
 people to carry out local improvement projects, to relay policy
 initiatives, and to serve as a channel to discuss grievances.
 SEM's are found at all governmental levels down to villages and
 neighborhoods. In practice, most significant grievances,
 including violence, are discussed at the family, clan, or
 tribal level first and passed along to influential governmental
 figures of the same family or tribe. In late 1991, there was
 rising public sentiment against the SEM's, which according to
 many were a conduit for patronage and election fraud in the
 municipal elections held in previous years. Opposition parties
 were demanding that the SEM's be dismantled.
 The parties criticized the Government for the way it
 implemented the new Constitution and for its control of
 election planning. The parties also demanded that Taya step
 down in favor of a transitional government. Taya made several
 unilateral concessions but did not accede to the opposition's
 principal demands for a delay of the elections and the
 installation of a neutral transition government.
 The opposition argued that the new Constitution was neither
 drafted in consultation with. opposition leaders nor approved by
 a majority of the population. The Constitution was adopted in
 a controversial July referendum; the opposition disputes the
 Government's claims that 85 percent of the population went to
 the polls and that 96 percent of those voting favored adoption
 of the document. Notwithstanding the complaints about the
 electoral process, four persons, including President Taya, are
 candidates for the Presidency.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The only officially recognized human rights organization within
 the country is the Mauritanian Human Rights League. Many
 Mauritanians and international observers no longer consider the
 League a viable or independent organization. Not since July
 1989 has it publicly commented on or questioned the
 Government's human rights excesses. A new human rights
 organization is in gestation but had not been legally
 recognized by the Ministry of Interior by the end of the year.
 In the wake of the 1989 dispute with Senegal and the 1990/early
 1991 detentions and deaths, the Taya regime took a defensive
 
 
 247
 MAURITANIA
 posture toward human rights investigations. It refused to
 appoint an independent commission to investigate the incidents,
 despite continued pressure from foreign countries and
 international nongovernmental organizations. It objected to
 the activities of Amnesty International and Africa Watch, both
 of which published reports on human rights abuses in
 Mauritania. It also objected to actions by the United States
 Government, including the suspension of military assistance and
 congressional hearings into the human rights situation in
 Mauritania. However, in December, a visiting Mauritanian
 presidential counselor invited Amnesty International and Africa
 Watch to visit Mauritania to observe the human rights situation
 first hand.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situatedgeographically and culturally on the
 divide between traditionally nomadic Arabic (Hassaniya)-
 speaking Maurs of the north and the sedentary black cultivators
 of the African south. The interaction of these two groups
 produces complex cultural diversity as well as ethnic tensions
 in Mauritanian society. Historically, the Hassaniya-speaking
 white Maurs have dominated the political and economic system.
 Taken together, the Hassaniya-speaking black Maurs and
 Mauritania's non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks outnumber the white
 Maurs by a considerable majority. This racial majority is by
 no means cohesive, however, because black Maurs identify in
 many ways more closely with the white Maur population. White
 Maurs hold the dominant positions in government, state
 enterprises, business, and religious institutions, and many
 non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians have long contended
 that this situation is a result of ethnic and linguistic
 discrimination.
 It has been a longstanding policy of the Government to promote
 Arabization and the use of Arabic as the country's principal
 language. Although French is still widely used as well,
 particularly among black Mauritanians, the new Constitution
 enacted in July 1991.eliminates French as an official
 language. Non-Hassaniya-speaking black Mauritanians also
 charge that the Government's 1983 land reform law is
 increasingly being misused to allow white and black Maurs to
 encroach on fertile land in the Senegal river valley that had
 been traditionally their preserve. Mauritania's dry and
 inhospitable climate has contributed to the hostile feelings
 between livestock raising Maurs and farming blacks. A
 decade-long drought has increased the traditional flow of
 nomads from the north into the more fertile southern regions,
 further exacerbating tensions.
 The longstanding ethnic divisions within Mauritanian society
 came dramatically to the fore in April 1989. The events of
 that period resulted more from an eruption of underlying ethnic
 hostilittes than from officially sanctioned government policy.
 However, the extrajudicial exbulsions that followed were
 clearly based on ethnicity. Only non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks
 were deprived of citizenship and deported. The resulting
 cross-border raids were thus carried out by non-Hassaniya-
 speakers, and security force reprisals were therefore directed
 solely against these groups.
 Theoretically, women have legal rights to property, divorce,
 and child custody. In practice, both marriage and divorce can
 take place without the woman's consent. Although there is a
 
 
 248
 MAURITANIA
 somewhat lower percentage of women than men educated at the
 university level, there are no legal restrictions on education
 for women. Women do not wear the veil, may operate
 automobiles, and may own and manage their own businesses. The
 Government is encouraging the entry of women into the
 professions, government, and business, and a number of women
 have moved into senior or midlevel government positions in
 recent years. In late 1991, there were two women at the
 highest levels of government: the Assistant Director of the
 President's Cabinet and an Advisor to the President. However,
 many Mauritanian women feel that these positions are more.
 symbolic than substantive.
 The Government has been instrumental in opening up new
 employment opportunities for women in areas traditionally
 reserved for men, such as hospital work. According to
 Mauritanian law, men and women must receive equal pay for equal
 work; Mauritania's two largest employers, the Civil Service and
 the State Mining Company, SNIM, respect this law.
 Violence against women occurs, but no data exist to indicate
 its extent. The police and judiciary have been known to
 intervene in domestic disputes, but only recently has the
 Mauritanian media begun to investigate this. The Government
 has taken no position nor issued any statements on violence
 against women or on female genital mutilation (circumcision), a
 tradition in some areas of southern Mauritania where the most
 dangerous form, infibulation, is practiced. This custom is
 seldom, if ever, practiced in the north, and some evidence
 indicates that the incidence of female circumcision is
 diminishing in the modern, urbanized sector.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish unions at the local and national
 level. There are currently 36 trade unions in the country.
 All, however, must be affiliates of the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM), by law the country's only central labor body.
 The UTM's traditional independence from the Government was
 broken in 1991 when its leadership, responding to members'
 anger at the continued detention of military prisoners, called
 an unsuccessful general strike. Through a combination of
 strong-arm tactics, co-optation, and successful inside
 maneuvering, the Government undercut the union leadership,
 discredited the strikers, and installed a tame replacement UTM
 leadership. UTM members arrested after street fighting in June
 were tortured (see Section l.c.).
 Although Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike, in
 practice strikes rarely occur, due to government pressure.
 Under Mauritanian law, tripartite arbitration committees,
 composed of union, business, and government representatives,
 may impose binding arbitration that automatically terminates
 any strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are free to organize workers without government or
 employer interference. According to the UTM, close to 90
 percent of industrial and commercial workers in Mauritania are
 members of unions. The laws providing workers' protection
 against antiunion discrimination are regularly enforced. True

 role. Wages and other benefits are decided informally between
 individual unions, employers, the Government, and the UTM. In
 addition,'employees or employers may bring labor disputes to
 threerperson labor courts that are-overseen jointly by the
 Ministries of Justice and Labor. Labor leaders regard these
 courts as unbiased bnd effective.- There are no export
 processing'zones in Mauritania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery'was officially abolished in-Mauritania several times,
 most recently in 1980, but many persons whose ancestors were
 slaves still occupied positions of servitude in 1991. This was
 due in part to the economic hardships they would have
 encouhtered if they had left. However, in some areas persons
 were sometimes held against their will and forced to perform
 unpaid labor. Human rights organizations claim that slavery
 persists and charge that the Government has taken no
 significant practical steps to eradicate the practice. Several
 reports indicated that some instances of forced labor involved
 young children.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Education is not compulsory in Mauritania, but Mauritanian law
 specifies that no child may be employed before the age of 13 in
 the agricultural sector without the permission of the Minister
 of Labor, nor before-the age of 15 in the nonagricultural
 sector. The law provides that employed children aged 14 to 16.
 should receive 70 percent of the minimum wage, and those from
 17 to 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum wage. There
 is limited enforcement of child labor laws by the few
 inspectors in the Ministry of Labor. In practice, much younger
 children in the countryside pursue herding, cultivation, and
 other significant labor in support of their families'
 traditional activities. In accordance with longstanding
 tradition, some children serve apprenticeships in small
 industries, but overall, child labor in the nonagricultural
 sector does not appear to be widespread.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The guaranteed minimum wage for adults was raised at the end of
 1991 but even so it barely enabled the average family to meet
 its minimum needs. The standard, legal nonagricultural
 workweek in Mauritania cannot exceed either 40 hours or 6 days
 without overtime compensation, which is paid at rates that are
 graduated according to the number of supplemental hours
 worked. Reliable data on actual wage levels is scarce.
 Enforcement of the labor laws is the responsibility of the
 Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor but in practice is
 limited by the shortage of qualified personnel.
 In April 1990, the Senegalese Confederation of Workers (CNTS)
 submitted a representation to.the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), charging the Government of Mauritania with
 violating several ILO conventions. The CNTS detailed the
 Government's "deportation and banishment of its own black
 African citizens" and specified numerous sectors in which
 significant numbers of non-Hassaniya-speaking blacks were
 dismissed without cause and, in many cases, deprived of basic
 rights.
