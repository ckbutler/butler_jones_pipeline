 ARMENIA
 Armenia has a constitutional government in which the President has extensive
 powers of appointment and decree, and the role of the legislature relative to the ex-
 ecutive branch is severely circumscribed. The President appoints the Prime Min-
 ister, who is in charge of the Cabinet. President Levon Ter-Petrossian was reelected
 in a controversial multicandidate election in September 1996, which was flawed by
 numerous irregularities and serious breaches of the election law. A transitional Na-
 tional Assembly in which ruling Armenian National Movement (ANM) members and
 their allies won about 88 percent of the seats was elected in July 1995; local and
 international observers characterized these elections as "generally free but not fair."
 To pretest the presidential elections, a number of opposition parties continue to boy-
 cott parliamentary sessions. Both the Government and the legislature can propose
 legislation. The legislature approves new laws and can remove the prime minister
 by a vote of no confidence. Elections for a new National Assembly are scheduled for
 1999. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however, in practice
 judges are subject to political pressure from the executive branch.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security is responsible for domestic
 security, intelligence activities, border control, and the national police force. Over-
 sight of the security services improved after the merger of the Interior Ministry with
 the National Security Ministry, but members of the security forces committed seri-
 ous human rights abuses.
 The transition from a centralized, controlled economy to a market economy contin-
 ues to move forward. Industrial output remains low, leaving over 50 percent of the
 population unemployed or underemployed, with a high degree of income inequality.
 Most small and medium enterprises have been privatized, as has most agricultural
 
 
 954
 land. About one-third, of permanent land titles had been issued by the end of the
 year. Gains in the privatized trade, service, and agriculture sectors generated an ap-
 p roximately 3 perent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, to about
 550 per capita. However, inflation rose to about 21.9 percent for the year. Foreign
 assistance and remittances from Armenians abroad play a major role in sustaining
 the economy.
 The Constitution provides for broad human rights protections, but human rights
 problems persist in several important areas. The Government's manipulation of the
 1996 presidential election continued to restrict citizen's ability to change their gov-
 enent. Members of the security forces made arbitrary arrests and detentions
 without warrants, beat detainees during arrest and interrogation, and did not re-
 spect constitutional guarantees regarding privacy and due process. At least two
 cases of police abuse resulting in death occurred; adequate institutional mechanisms
 do not exist to protect individuals from police abuse. Prison conditions remained
 poor. The judiciary is subject to political pressure and does not enforce constitu-
 tional protections effectively. Opposition groups charged that defendants in three
 major criminal cases were political prisoners. The Government continued to place
 some restrictions on freedom of the press and maintains the dominant role in na-
 tionwide television and radio broadcasting. A semiofficial list of forbidden subjects
 encourages some media self-censorship. However, the nongovernmental media often
 criticize the country's leadership and policies. Local independent television and
 newspapers, along with private radio stations, continued to multiply. The Govern-
 ment maintains some limits on freedom of association. A previously suspended
 prominent political party, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF/Dashnaks),
 was not reinstated, although the authorities tolerated its activities, restored its of-
 fices, and permitted publication of a Dashnak newspaper. The legislature called into
 question its commitment to constitutional provisions for freedom of religion, by
 amending the law on freedom of conscience to further strengthen the role of the Ar-
 menian Apostolic Church and create new barriers to other denominations. The Gov-
 ernment places some restrictions on freedom of movement. Discrimination against
 women, minorities, and the disabled remained a problem.
 Efforts began in October to train current and prospective judges and prosecutors
 on the draft civil and criminal law codes, scheduled for passage in 1998.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings There were a number of deaths of military servicemen
 reportedly due to mistreatment (see Section 1.c.). There were a number of deaths
 in custody due to poor prison conditions and inadequate medical treatment (see Sec-
 tion 1..).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the law prohibit torture. However, the practice of security per-
 sonnel beating pretrial detainees during arrest and interrogation remains a routine
 part of criminal investigations. Most cases of police brutality go unreported. Pros-
 ecutors rely on confessions to secure convictions. Although defense lawyers may
 present evidence of torture in an effort to overturn improperly obtained confessions,
 and according to law all such charges must be investigated, judges and prosecutors
 routinely ignore such complaints even when the abuser can be identified. No one
 has been charged or disciplined for the beatings of opposition figures following the
 September 1996 postelection disturbances.
 The Government has not conducted investigations of abuse by security services
 except in rare cases where death has resulted. A death in police custody, in Gyumri
 in August, alleged by police to be a suicide, prompted intensified press and human
 rights group criticism of mistreatment of detainees. Photographic evidence showed
 that the detainee had been seriously beaten. In September four police officers were
 arrested for abuse of authority in connection with that death. In November the
 Prosecutor held a press conference to publicize the ongoing investigation, but the
 trial had not begun by year's end. Investigation of a second death in custody in
 April at Yerevan's horhrdayin police station was closed without prosecution.
 Charges against five police officers for a 1993 death, a case repeatedly remanded
 for investigation by the Supreme Court, will once again be taken up in 1998, accord-
 ing to the Prosecutor General.
 The press also reported on a number of deaths of military servicemen, officially
 reported as accidents or suicide, where forensic evidence obtained by the families
 suggested mistreatment or possible murder. The Ministry of Defense responded that
 
 
 955
 these human rights group charges were baseless. The military does not pvide in-
 formation on peacetime deaths of servicemen, but a human rights group alleged that
 as     a s one soldier a day died in 1997 of noncombat causes.
 In July members of a local "Yerkrapah" group (an armed veteran's militia that
 is part of the Defense Ministry implicated in 1995 and 1996 human rights viola-
 tions) broke into a human rights library in Vanadzor and removed the contents (see
 Section 1.f.).
 Prison conditions are poor. Facilities are often overcrowded, and food is inad-
 equate to preserve health unless supplemented by families. Medical and sanitary fa-
 cilities in prisons are inadequate. Tuberculosis and other communicable diseases are
 common with eight deaths from tuberculosis officially reported in the first half of
 the year. The Government's judicial reform package under debate in the legislature
 at year's end included a provision to transfer responsibility for prisons to the Min-
 istry of Justice from the Ministry of Internal and  ation  Security Affairs in 1998,
 wit a goal of improved oversight.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) enjoyed unimpeded access
 to detention facilities run by the Ministry of Interior and National Security, a sig-
 nificant improvement over 1996. The ICRC continued to visit all the prisoners in-
 volved in the "Dro," "31," and "September 25" trials (see Section 1.e.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Authorities continued to arrest and de-
 tain criminal suspects without legal warrants, often on the pretext of being a mate-
 rial witness. Those arrested are frequently brought to prison without notcation of
 family members. It is often several days bfore family members obtain information
 as to whether someone has been arrested and their location. Access of lawyers and
 family members to prisoners is often restricted until the preliminary investigation
 phase is complete, a process that can last weeks.
 There was no repetition in 1997 of the massive violations of constitutional safe-
 guards which followed the September 1996 elections. At that time, many opposition
 politicians or activists were detained and seriously beaten. Most were released in
 the following weeks. Of 16 individuals held into 1997 for "participation in mass dis-
 order," several were administratively released. No charges are pending against
 those released. Another 11 were tried, convicted, and released with suspended sen-
 tences during the course of the year.
 The transitional provisions of the Constitution provide that the Soviet-era proce-
 dures for searches and arrests are to be maintained until the Soviet-era Criminal
 Code and Criminal Procedure Code are redrafted and brought into line with the
 Constitution in 1998. A suspect may be jailed for no more than 12 months pending
 trial, after which the suspect must be released or tried. This latter provision, how-
 ever, is not always enforced. There is no provision for bail although detainees may
 sign a document and remain at liberty under their own recognizance pending trial.
 For example two political figures who emerged from hiding in September to face
 charges stemming from the election protests were released by the prosecutor after
 signing such documents.
 The ICRC reported that civilian and military personnel on all sides of the
 Nagorno Karabakh dispute conflict occasionally engage in cross-border hostage tak-
 ing, usually to win release of a friend or relative held on the other side, but some-
 times for financial gain. The ICRC successfully assured a number of prisoner ex-
 changes but has no access to undeclared hostages.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution nominally provides for
 an independent judiciary, its provisions do not appear designed to insulate the
 courts from political pressure. Other legal and constitutional provisions make judges
 dependent on the executive branch for their employment. In practice courts are sub-
 ject to political pressure and corruption. The inherited Soviet system views the court
 largely as a rubber stamp for the prosecutor and not a defender of citizens' rights.
 Prosecutors still greatly overshadow defense lawyers and judges during trials. The
 constitutionally mandated presumption of innocence is ineffective, and acquittals
 are very rare once a case comes to trial. Under the Constitution, the Justice Council,
 headed by the President, the Prosecutor General, and the Justice Minister, appoints
 and disciplines judes for the tribunal courts of first instance, review courts, and
 the Court of Appals. The President appointhe he other 14 members of the Justice
 Council and 4 of the 9 Constitutional CouW judges. This authority gives the Presi-
 dent dominant influence in appointing and dismissing judges at all levels. Judges
 are subject to review by the President thrugh the Council of Justice after 3 years.
 Thereupon, their tenure is permanent until they reach the age of 65.
 The judicial system continued its transition and restructuring is due to be com-
 pleted in 1998. The revised civil and criminal codes under preparation are designed
 to clarify contradictory provisions of the law and create a more unitary, modern, and
 
 
 956
 workable legal system. However, prosecutors are expected to continue to have more
 influence than judges. There are calls from within the udiciary to strengthen judi-
 cial review and to give the courts more authority in safegarding human rights. In
 addition to the proposed reforms, increased judicial independence and a balance
 among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches are critical to the success of
 judicial reform.
 According to the transitional provisions of the Constitution, the existing courts are
 to retain their powers until the new judicial system is established. District courts
 try most cases, with a right of appeal to regional courts and then the Supreme
 Court. In 1998 the Supreme Court and regional courts are to be replaced by review
 courts and a court of appeals as required by the Constitution. As part of the package
 of judicial reform legislation mandated by the Constitution, both judges and pros-
 ecutors will be subject to retraining and recertification by examination in April or
 May 1998 in order to retain their positions.
 The Constitutional Court rules on the conformity of legislation with the Constitu-
 tion, approves international agreements, and decides election-related legal ques-
 tions. It can accept only those cases proposed by the President, one-third of all Na-
 tional Assembly deputies, or election-related cases brought by candidates for par-
 liament or the presidency. Unless the Constitution is amended, the Constitutional
 Court is not an effective guarantor of constitutional human rights safeguards.
 The military tribunal operates essentially as it did in the Soviet era. Military
 prosecutors perform the same functions as their civilian counterparts, operating in
 accordance with the Soviet-era legal code.
 Trials are public except when government secrets are at issue. Defendants are re-
 quired to attend their trials unless they have been accused of a minor crime not
 punishable by imprisonment. Defendants have access to a lawyer of their own choos-
 ing. The court appoints an attorney for any defendant who needs one. Defendants
 may confront witnesses and present evidence. The Constitution provides that those
 accused of crimes shall be informed of charges against them. Defendants and pros-
 ecutrs have the right of appeal.
 Three major criminal trials involving political parties or personalities continued
 into 1997. Opposition parties and some human rights groups charge that some of
 the defendants are political prisoners. The law lacks an adequate test (e.g., "clear
 and present dange') for defining the difference between protected free speech and
 illegal calls to overthrow the Government by violent means. Without the safeguard
 of a strong, independent judiciary, allegations that the Government exploited these
 trials for political purposes cannot be refuted.
 Final appeals in the long-running "Dro" trial of a goup of 11 persons accused of
 terrorist activities concluded in June 1997. The Government cited such accusations
 when it banned the ARF/Dashnak party in 1994. In December 1996, the judge pro-
 nounced the defendants guilty of premeditated murder, banditry, arms violations,
 or concealing a crime. Although these crimes were committed, with evidence for the
 guilt of most of the accused, the trial was marred by procedural irregularities, alle-
 gations of torture, recanted testimony, and accusations of deliberate delay by the au-
 thorities. The appeals judges commuted one of the three death sentences. There
 have been no executions since independence when the President announced a mora-
 terim. The Government has made a political commitment to the Council of Europe
 to abolish the death penalty.
 The "Trial of 31," involving a group of 31 alleged coup plotters, including Vahan
 Hovannisyan, a senior ARF member, opened in March 1996. Closing arguments
 were completed in October and all but two of the defendants were found guilty of
 various charges in December. Hovannisyan was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment
 (including time in pretrial detention), with sentences of 3 to 7 years for 14 others.
 One defendant was sentenced to death for the murder of two policemen. Eleven de-
 fendants were released for time served or with suspended sentences. Appeals are
 reportedly planned. Most defendants in the case charged that they were denied
 timely access to legal counsel. They subsequently complained that they had been
 tortured and pressured into giving false testimony. The Court denied defense mo-
 tions to investigate these allegations. Credible evidence linked some of the 31 to the
 deaths of 2 policemen and other serious violations of the criminal code. The prosecu-
 tor dropped treason and other charges against Hovannisyan, accusing him instead
 of "inciting armed insurrection,' in his meetings with an extremist group. No evi-
 dence was presented linking him to acts of violence.
 The trials of 11 persons accused of involvement in the postelection protests at the
 parliament building on September 25, 1996 that turned violent were completed in
 July. After lengthy detention, the defendants were convicted on minor charges,
 given suspended sentences, and released. One person, arrested in October, remained
 in pretrial detention for the same events, and two others, in hiding for a year, pre-
 
 
 957
 sented themselves to the Prosecutor in October and were released on their own re-
 cognizance, pending completion of the investigation. Security forces badly beat many
 of the defendants at the time of arrest or afterwards.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits unauthorized searches and preserves citizens' rights to pri-
 vacy and confidentiality of correspondence, conversations, and other messages. Pro-
 cedurally, the security ministries must petition the prosecutor's office for permission
 to wiretap a telephone or intercept correspondence. The prosecutor's office purport-
 edly must find a compelling need for the wiretap before granting the agency permis-
 sion to proceed. No evidence of illegal wiretapping came to public attention during
 the year.
 The law requires security forces to obtain a search warrant from a prosecutor be-
 fore conducting a search; in practice, searches continue to be made without a war-
 rant. New legislation passed in December improved secrecy of bank deposits, requir-
 ing a court order for account information to be released to tax or law enforcement
 authorities. The offices of the National Self-Determination Union, a political party,
 were ransacked by police in September 1996. When the Interior Ministry was
 merged with National Security, the new minister promised to provide compensation.
 During 1997 some $10,000 (5 million dram) was paid, about one-third of the total
 damages claimed.
 In Vanadzor in July, members of a local "Yerkrapah" group (an armed veteran's
 militia that is part of the Defense Ministry implicated in 1995 and 1996 human
 rights violations) broke into a human rights library and removed the contents. This
 library was housed in two rooms in a children's library granted by the mayor of
 Vanador to the Constitutional and Human Rights Protective Center. Although the
 dispute was primarily over control of the space rather than the activities of the cen-
 ter, and the center was subsequently promised new quarters elsewhere, the incident
 underscored the freedom of these local militias to act outside the law-in this case
 against a human rights organization. No action was taken against the persons re-
 sponsible. The mayor of Vanadzor offered the Center a new site, but the necessary
 permissions to make the transfer had not been granted at year's end.
 There continued to be violations of the right to privacy during army conscription
 drives. Armed forces recruiters periodically engage in sweep operations for draft-age
 men, and have taken hostages to compel the surrender of draft-evading or deserting
 relatives. There are credible reports of improper conscription of refugees from
 Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, and of punitive conscription of males who have
 offended local officials.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, while the Government generaly respects freedom of speech,
 it continues to place some significant restrictions on freedom of the press. Publica-
 tions present a variety of views, and the opposition press regularly criticizes govern-
 ment policies and leaders, including the President, including on sensitive issues
 such as the Nagorno Karabakh peace process. However, the range of subjects con-
 sidered sensitive for national security is relatively large. Although there is no offi-
 cial censorship, the Government circulates an informal list of "forbidden subjects"
 and journalists practice some self-censorship to avoid problems with authorities. Be-
 cause of past episodes of retribution by powerful ministers or businessmen, includ-
 ing beatings, detention and financial pressure, journalists are cautious in reporting
 on major corruption or national security issues.
 Newspapers operate with extremely limited resources, and few are completely
 independent of patronage from economic or political interest groups or individuals.
 Total newspaper circulation is small, about one copy per hundred persons. State-
 owned companies have a monopoly on newspaper printing and distribution facilities,
 and most newspapers are permanently in debt to the printers. The State retains,
 through its ownership of the printing and distribution network, the potential to shut
 or otherwise pressure newspapers that take too strident an opposition position. The
 Government disbanded the Ministry of Information at the ent of 1996, a move wide-
 ly welcomed by the nongovernment media; however, the Government then partly re-
 created the ministry as a department of the Prime Minister's office in early 1997.
 In December a new board of directors was created for the state television, news
 agency, and press distribution company, made up of three representatives each from
 the President's office, the Government, and Parliament. The declared aim of the
 board is to supervise these agencies' transformation into commercial enterprises, al-
 beit with the State retaining controlling interest in the near term.
 In June three employees of Noyan Iaan news agency were summoned to the
 Ministry of Interior and National Security and pressured unsuccessfully over sev-
 
 
 958
 eral hours to reveal the source of information for an article containing details of con-
 fidential negotiating documents regarding Nagorno Karabakh. The editor of
 Yerevanyan (er was seriously beaten by unidentified attackers in March after re-
 fusing to delete a newspaper article from the computer. ARF-affiliated media, which
 the Government shut down in 1994, remained closed, but a new ARF-linked news-
 paer began publication and another newspaper, published abroad, resumed public
 The two most widely visible television channels belong to state television, and
 tend to present a positive view of officials and their activities. However, television
 coverage of opposition protests of the Government's Karabakh policy from October
 through December demonstrated some tendency toward greater balance. Most radio
 stations are now private. The opening of more nongovernmental television and radio
 outlets has encouraged greater freedom of expression and somewhat broader news
 coverage. There are now 6 independent radio stations and 8 independent television
 stations operating in Yerevan, and 1 independent radio and 13 independent tele-
 vision stations in the regions. Opposition parties and politicians received adequate
 news coverage and access on these channels. Legislation has not yet been passed
 to regulate the current arbitrary and nontransparent process of license issuance, al-
 though at year's end a draft broadcasting law on this subject was circulating in the
 legislature.
 The few international newspapers and magazines imported are not censored. Mid-
 dile and upper class citizens have access to international satellite and cable tele-
 vision from abroad. Internet and electronic mail have substantially increased the
 amount of foreign and domestic information available.
 The Government partially respects academic freedom. Over 50 private institutions
 of higher education have been established since independence in 1991. The Ministry
 of Education must approve the curriculum of all schools that grant degrees recog-
 nized by the State, seriously limiting the freedom of individual schools and teachers
 in their choice of textbeoks and course material.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 A series of peaceful demonstrations took place in 1997, organized by opposition
 groups to protest the 1996 elections and, in the fall, the Governments Karabakh
 policy. On one occasion in December, Yerevan municipal authorities refused to grant
 permission for organizers of a demonstration to march to the Foreign Ministry. The
 march took place, nonetheless, and the organizers theoretically were subject to a
 small fine, which had not been levied at year's end.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice with some important exceptions. There are reg-
 istration requirements for all parties, associations, and organizations. The process
 of registering an organization is time consuming, and some human rights or political
 organizations have been compelled by the Government to revise their bylaws several
 times in order to have their registration accepted. No political parties were refused
 initial registration in 1997. The ARF party, suspended since 1994, has had an appli-
 cation for reinstatement pending with the Ministry of Justice since 1996; the law
 requires a written answer within 30 days of filing, but by year's end the Ministry
 had not provided a response. Although the party is still officially suspended, officials
 did not interfere with its activities.
 In October the ARF offices were restored to the party. The authorities charge that
 the ARF is not really a domestic political party but rather the arm of a foreign-
 dominated international political organization (the ARF International Bureau), and
 thus does not conform to the law on public political organizations requiring Arme-
 nia-based leadership. The party reconstituted its ruling bodies in 1996 and created
 indigenous local structures, which, ARF claimed, distinguish it from the inter-
 national organization and meet the law's criteria. Many observers charge that con-
 tinuation of the ban is political, designed to keep the ARF from competing in poli-
 tics.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, in practice the law imposed growing restrictions on religious freedom, in par-
 ticular on the religious freedom of adherents of faiths other than the Armenian Ap-
 ostolic Church (the Armenian Orthodox Church).
 The 1991 law on freedom of conscience establishes the separation of church and
 state, but grants the Armenian Apostolic Church special status. The law forbids
 "proselytizing (undefined in the law) except by the Apostolic Church, and requires
 all religious denominations and organizations to register with the state Council on
 Religious Affairs. Petitioning organizations must "be free from materialism and of
 a purely spiritual nature," and must subscribe to a doctrine based on "historically
 recognized holy scriptures."
 
 
 A presidential decree issued in 1993 supplemented the 1991 law and strengthened
 the position of the Armenian Aostolic Church. The decree enjoins the Council on
 Religious Affairs to investigate the activities of the representatives of registered reli-
 gious organizations and to ban missionaries who engage in activities contrary to
 their status. No action was taken against missionaries in 1997.
 In June Parliament passed legislation amending the religion law. The legislation
 tightened registration requirements for other denominations by raising from 50 to
 200 adult members the minimum number required for registration. It also tightened
 funding restrictions so that foreign-based churches may not be supported by funds
 from their headquarters outside Armenia (a prvision that seriously affects the ac-
 tivities of several substantial denominations). The legislation also mandated that re-
 ligious organizations except the Apostolic Church need prior permission from the
 state Council on Religious Affairs to engage in religious activities in public places,
 travel abroad, or to invite foreign guests to Armenia. The President, however, re-
 turned the law to Parliament with a recommendation that these objectionable as-
 StS be deleted. In September Parliament voted to drop most of the items that the
 sident recommended for deletion. However, Parliament confirmed the increase in
 the membership requirement and the ban on outside funding. All "foreign" (i.e. non-
 Apostolic) denominations are now required to reregister within 6 months of the
 law's entry into force. The President signed the law in September. So far religious
 groups have reported no adverse consequences from the new law.
 Fifteen religious denominations and an assortment of smaller religious associa-
 tions were registered in 1997 under the old law, including Catholics, Protestants,
 Russian Orthodox, Mormons, and others. According to the law, a religious organiza-
 tion refused registration cannot publish a newspaper or magazine, rent a meeting
 place, have its own program on television or radio, or officially sponsor the visas
 of visitors. The Council on Religious Affairs continued to deny registration to Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses on the grounds that the group does not permit military service. As
 of September, 14 Jehovah's Witnesses were in prison, including 4 who had already
 served 1- to 3-year sentences for refusing military service and upon release were re-
 tried and convicted by a military tribunal for desertion, even though they had never
 entered the military. Seven Jehovah's Witnesses were in pretrial detention, and
 seven others were reportedly in hiding to escape prosecution for refusing military
 service. A large quantity of Jehovah's Witnesses literature was seized in April, on
 the grounds that it could not be imported legally in the absence of registration.
 Despite a government pledge to apprehend those, allegedly "Yerkrapah members,
 who staged a series of destructive attacks against a dozen religious groups in 1995,
 the authorities took no steps in 1997 to bring the perpetrators to justice (see Section
 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but the Government places restrictions
 on some of these rights. According to informed estimates, up to one-third of the pop-
 ulation has temporarily or permanently emigrated during the last 7 years. Travel
 passports may be denied to persons possessing state secrets, to those subject to mili-
 tary service, and to those whose relatives have made financial claims against them.
 The Office of Visas and Registrations (OVIR) has eased travel and emigration proce-
 dures by discontinuing the requirement for exit visas; however, men of military age
 need to overcome substantial bureaucratic obstacles to international travel. The
 Government does not restrict internal movement, and citizens have the right to
 change freely their residence or work place; however, they must negotiate with a
 corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy to register these changes.
 Once the Nagorno Karabakh conflict erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan in
 1988, ethnic minorities on both sides were subject to discrimination and intimida-
 tion, often accompanied by violence intended to drive them from the country. Almost
 all of the ethnic Azeris living in Armenia at the time, some 185,000 persons, fled
 to Azerbaian. Of the 400,000 ethnic Armenians then living in Azerbaijan, 330,000
 fled to and were granted refugee status in Armenia. The majority of the rest took
 refuge in Russia, with small numbers remaining in Azerbaijan.
 Armenia is a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Ref-
 ugees and its 1967 Protocol. The National Assembly passed a law on citizenship in
 1996 which provides for refugees of Armenian ethnicity to gain citizenship, provided
 they are stateless and have resided in the country for the past 3 years. Implement-
 ing regulations for the law and naturalization procedures have not yet been com-
 pleted, and few refugees, even those who have resettled permanently, have gained
 citizenship.
 
 
 960
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ethnic Arme-
 nian refugees.
 Armenia respects the right of first asylum in principle, but has no practical mech-
 anism to provide it, and border officials have no training in asylum issues. In the
 absence of a law specifying procedures for formal recognition of political asylum,
 asylum seekers not of Armenian ethnicity have no legal status. In some cases, those
 denied permission for legal residence are subject to fines for illegal residence when
 they attempt to depart the country. There were no reports of forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government's manipulation of the 1996 presidential election continued to re-
 strict the constitutional ability of citizens to change their government peacefully. Se-
 rious breaches of the election law and numerous irregularities in the 1995 and 1996
 elections resulted in a lack of public confidence in the integrity of the overall elec-
 tion process.
 In the 1996 presidential elections, incumbent President Ter-Petrossian was de-
 clared the victor. His leading challenger, Vazgen Manukyan claimed fraud and filed
 an appeal with the Constitutional Court. The Court upheld the official election re-
 sult, but many questions were raised regarding the Court's procedures in the case
 and the Central Election Commission's refusal to release detailed voting results
 from all preciL.ts. An OSCE election observer mission noted "irregularities,' "dis-
 crepancies," and "very serious breaches of the election law" which caused "concern
 for the overall integrity of the election process." Nevertheless, observers concluded
 that although the presidential election was flawed, the conduct of the campaign was
 an improvement over the 1995 parliamentary elections.
 In anticipation of the 1999 parliamentary elections, Parliament took up the ques-
 tion of a universal electoral code. In the spring, a draft was prepared by the State
 and Legal Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, with the cooperation of op-
 position parties, nongovernmental organizations, and international experts. In Sep-
 tember a competing draft was prepared by a working group of the National Assem-
 bly under the auspices of the majority ANM faction, without such input. The new
 chairman of the State and Legal Affairs Committee held a series of meetings and
 conferences with political party representatives, local nongovernmental organiza-
 tions, and international experts in an attempt to create a compromise draft that
 would, he stated, be consistent with international standards. This draft was not
 complete at year's end. It was clear that serious differences remained between the
 ruling ANM and opposition parties on a number of issues, particularly on how to
 constitute balanced and effective electoral commissions.
 Yerevan mayor Vano Siradeghian won election to the Parliament in a closely
 watched by-election in Hrazdan in October. Domestic observers, who were given full
 access to the electoral process, reported that the voting and counting were free of
 major irregularities. Their report highlighted gaps in the current electoral law on
 registration and voting of miitary personnel and on uniformed  olice presence at
 poling stations. They also noted that authorities did not enforce a ban on campaign-
 ing outside polling stations.
 In November Siradeghian, in his capacity as recently-elected ANM chairman, stat-
 ed that the ANM would not accept an electoral law that condemned them to elec-
 toral defeat. Siradeghian was Interior Minister during the Government's brutal
 crackdown after the flawed 1996 presidential election and demonstration that
 turned violent. He retains his position as mayor while serving in the Parliament.
 Under the Constitution, the President appoints the Prime Minister and has con-
 siderable influence in appointing judges. The Constitution provides for independent
 legislative and judicial biranches, but in practice these branches are not insulated
 from political pressure from the executive branch.
 The Government appoints the 10 regional governors (marzpets). The Constitution
 gives local communities the right to elect local authorities. However, local elected
 officials have limited powers, and are overshadowed in practice by powerful presi-
 dentially appointed governors, who can remove them from office.
 The National Assembly continues to operate as a part-time institution for the du-
 ration of its first term. Regular sessions are held twice a year: the first from mid-
 September to mid-December and the second from early February until mid-June.
 Approximately one-third of the parliamentarians have been designated full-time
 deputies. Special sessions may be called, but may not last more than 6 days.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 government and politics. However, due to traditional social attitudes, both are
 
 
 961
 underrepresented in all branches of government. There is one woman in the Cabinet
 (Minister of Social Welfare). Only 11 of the 190 deputies in the Parliament are
 women. There are no members of minorities in the Cabinet or in the Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several nongovernmental human rights organizations that are active
 and operate openly, criticizing publicly and publishing their findings on government
 human rights violations. The Government has permitted monitoring of human
 rights by the Council of Europe and the ICRC, which had full access to civilian de-
 tention facilities in 1997, including detainees in politically sensitive trials.
 The Government accepted an OSCE election observer mission for the 1996 presi-
 dential elections and provided international observers with countrywide access; how-
 ever, local observer organizations, which had observed the 1995 parliamentary elec-
 tions, were not allowed to observe the presidential election.
 The new Prosecutor General created a special office in July to communicate with
 international organizations, and pledged to provide more detailed human rights in-
 formation than was publicly available earlier. Although the Prosecutor's office did
 provide responses on specific cases, this information remained relatively incomplete
 and general, as are most government statistics.
 A human rights group that publicly criticized peacetime deaths in the military
 was accused by the Defense Ministry in a public statement of colluding with an
 enemy country.
 In July members of a Yerkrapah group in Vanadzor broke into the library of the
 Constitutional and Human Rights Protective Center (see Section 1.f.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status
 is prohibited by the Constitution. Cultural and economic factors, however, prevent
 women, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with disabilities from partici-
 pating fully in public life.
 Wonen.-The law (the old Soviet code) cites specific punishments for rape, forced
 abortion, forbidding a woman from marrying, and discrimination in hiring due to
 pregnancy. There is no specific law banning violence against women. Few cases of
 rape, spouse abuse, or other violence against women were reported in this conserv-
 ative, patriarchal society, however, their number is likely higher than the statistics
 indicate. In 1997 the Prosecutor's Office registered approximately 28 cases of rape.
 In the workplace, women receive equal pay for equal work, but are generally not
 afforded the same professional opportunities given to men and are often relegated
 to more menial or low-skill jobs. The 1992 Law on Employment prohibits discrimi-
 nation in employment, but the extremely high unemployment rate makes it difficult
 to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimination.
 According to a women's group, women make up 73 percent of those officially reg-
 istered as unemployed.
 Currently there are more women receiving university and postgraduate education
 than men.
 Children.-The Government does not have the economic means to provide fully
 for the welfare of children. Education is free, universal, and compulsory through age
 16, but facilities are poor and teachers are forced to tutor pupils privately to sur-
 vive. Free children's health care is available, but of poor quality, with an increasing
 trend toward overt or concealed payment of fees for service. The Government fo-
 cuses its efforts on children's rights and welfare with measures to insulate large
 families-four or more children-from the effects of the country's current difficult
 circumstances. The Government similarly targets foreign humanitarian aid pro-
 grams at large families. A program led by the President's wife has helped to address
 the growing problem of street children. The family tradition is strong, and child
 abuse does not appear to be a serious problem.
 Girls and boys receive equal educational opportunities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides for right to social security in
 the event of disability. The 1993 Law on Invalids provides for the social, political,
 and individual rights of the disabled but does not mandate the provision of acces-
 sibility for the disabled. In its current economic circumstances, the Government has
 difficulty fulfilling its commitments in this area. The Government's enforcement of
 the rights of the disabled remains rudimentary. There is societal discrimination
 against the disabled. Hospitals, residential care, and other facilities for the seriously
 disabled do not meet international norms.
 
 
 Religious Minorities.-There was no reported violence against minority religious
 groups. However, newer reliious organizations, especially of an evangelical nature,
 are treated with suspicion. uch groups are accused of proselytism, including using
 material inducements or offers of emigration to entice converts. A relatively high
 percentage of members of same of these religious groups joined the wave of emigra-
 tion from Armenia, for social, economic, and philosophical reasoins. Despite the Gov-
 ernment's pledge to apprehend those allegedy"Yerkrapah" members who staged a
 series of destructive attacks against a dozen religious groups in 1995, the authori-
 ties took no steps in 1997 to bring the perpetrators to justice.
 National/IRacial/Et hnic Minorities.-The Government does not discriminate
 against the small, officially recognized, "national" communities, though their eco-
 nomic and social situation has deteriorated substantially since Armenian independ-
 ence. Groups which the Government include in this category are Russians, Jews,
 Kurds, Yezidis, Georgians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Following the protracted
 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (see Section 2.d.), there is no significant Azeri minority.
 The several hundred Azeris or persons of mixed Azeri heritage still living in Arme-
 nia maintain a low profie in the face of societal discrimination.
 The Constitution grants national minorities the right to preserve their cultural
 traditions and language, and the 1992 law on language provides linguistic minori-
 ties with the right to publish and study in their native language. There are token
 publications in minority languages, but the Government has devoted minimal re-
 sources to maintaining minority language schools. The large network of Russian-
 language schools has been greatly reduced in recent years. in practice, virtually all
 students, including members of the Yezidi and Greek communities, now attend Ar-
 menian-language schools with very limited classes in their mother tongue. In the
 Yezidi commuity, a high percentage of pupils do not attend school, partly for family
 economic reasons and partly because of discrimination from ethnic Armenian school-
 mates and teachers.
 Yezidi leaders complained in a July letter to the President that their community
 (which speaks a Kurish dialect and practices a traditional non-Christian, non-Mus-
 lim religion) is subject to discrimination by police and local authorities. They cited
 numerous incidents of unfair adjudication of land, water and grazing disputes, non-
 receipt of privatized agricultural land, and lack of police response to even serious
 crimes committed against Yezids. They alleged unfair adjudication of land and
 water disputes. The letter also complained of unequal treatment by the military,
 and  aite  nine Yezidi conscripts who allegedly died since 1996 during peacetime
 military service. The Armenian authorities made no effective response to these seri-
 ous complaints, although the letter received coverage from human rights journalists
 in the independent press.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides employees with the right
 to form and join trade unions and the right to strike. The Constitution stipulates
 that the right to form associations-including political parties and trade unions-
 may be limited with respect to persons serving in the armed services and law en-
 forement agencies. A 1993 presidential decree prohibits the Government and other
 employers from retaliating against strikers and labor leaders, but workers have no
 confidence in this guarantee. In practice labor organization remains weak due to
 high unemployment and the poor economy. Workers have neither financial resources
 to maintain a strike nor enforceable legal protection against retaliation, and the ex-
 isting unions play a relatively passive role. There has not, however, been any retal-
 iation against strikers or labor leaders. Creation of a new, purportedly independent
 labor federation was reported in December, involving members of the journalists
 union and a few other relatively stronger labor organizations.
 Unions are fre leto ailiate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.--Collective bargaining is not
 practiced. The Constitution provides all citizens with the right to a just wage no
 lower than the minimum set by the Government. Although the 1992 Law on Em-
 ployment provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively, voluntary and
 direct negotiations do not take place between unions and employers without the par-
 ticipation of the Government because most large employers remain under state con-
 trol. The near collapse of major industrial prodution has undercut the organization
 of labor unions.
 The Government encourages profitable factories to establish their own pay scales.
 Factory directorates generally set the pay scales, without onsultation with employ-
 ees. Wage and othr abor disputes are adjudicated through the Arbitration Court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the 1992
 Law on Employment prohibit forced and bonded labor, including by children, and
 it is not known to occur. This provision is enforced by the local councils of deputies,
 unemployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbitration Commission.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Forced or
 bonded labor by children is prohibited, and is not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 According to the 1992 Law on Employment,
 16 years is the minimum age or employment. Children may work from the age
 of 14 with the permission of a medics commission and the relevant labor union
 board. The Law on Employment is enforced by the local councils of deputies, unem-
 ployment offices, and, as a final board of appeal, the Arbitration Commission.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets the minimum wage by
 decree. In September the national minimum wage was $2 (1000 drams) per month,
 a purely theoretical figure given that 10 times the minimum wage is insufficient to
 support an individual.
 The majority of the population lives below the officially recognized poverty level
 as a result of the economic dislocations caused by the breakup of the Soviet union,
 the 1988 earthquake, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the resulting blockade
 and disruptions in trade. The majority of enterprises are either idle or operating at
 a fraction of their capacity. Some furloughed workers are still receiving minimal
 partial compensation from their enterprises, but most are no longer receiving any
 payment if they are not working. The standard legal workweek is 41 hours; many
 people work multiple jobs.
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to clean and safe work places,
 but Soviet-era occupational and safety standards remain in force. Labor legislation
 from 1988 places responsibility on the employer and the management of each firm
 to ensure "healthy and normal" labor conditions for employees, but it provides no
 definition of healthy and normal. The employment situation is such that workers
 are unlikely to attempt to remove themselves from hazardous working conditions
 due to the risk of losing their jobs.
