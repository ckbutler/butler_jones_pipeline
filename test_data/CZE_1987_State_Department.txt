 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is a totalitarian state in
 which the Communist party leadership decides all important
 political, economic, and social questions and sharply limits
 the scope of individual human rights. Until 1987 there had
 been no significant change in the leadership of the party
 since the purges following the Soviet invasion of 1968. In
 December 1987, however, Gustav Husak resigned as General
 Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, although he
 remains President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
 Presidium member Milos Jakes succeeded Husak as General
 Sebretary.
 Czechoslovakia has a large, well-funded internal security
 establishment, directed by the Ministry of the Interior and
 the party hierarchy. It includes uniformed police (public
 security) who are'similar to Western police forces, and the
 secret police (State Security), who deal with those they judge
 to be past, present, or future opponents of the regime. This
 powerful internal security force--backed by the Czechoslovak
 army and the 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country
 since 1968--is the main pillar of the party's control.
 Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy allows very limited
 private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing, retail
 operations, agriculture, or services. In recent years, the
 economy, characterized by excessive central planning, obsolete
 equipment and infrastructure, and an almost complete lack of
 incentives for innovation and initiative, has become less
 competitive on world markets. Party leaders have admitted to
 problems with the economy and proclaimed a policy of
 "restructuring the economic mechanism" in order to improve
 efficiency while maintaining centralized control.
 Although the Constitution provides for freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and religion, these provisions are not
 generally implemented. Independent associations are not
 legally permitted in Czechoslovakia; all labor unions,
 professional associations, and even amateur groups are
 controlled by the Communist Party and subordinated to it.
 The basic human rights situation in Czechoslovakia showed a
 slight improvement in 1987: there were fewer arrests, fewer
 trials resulting in prison-sentences, and some signs of
 greater official toleration for independently organized
 activities. Significant human rights trials of 1987 included
 those of the leadership of the Jazz Section of the Musicians
 Union and of the Wonka brothers. Harsh repression continues
 to be directed at religious activists and at those persons and
 groups, such as signatories of Charter 77 and members of the
 Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS),
 who monitor human rights abuses in Czechoslovakia.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the police in
 1987. In the course of trying to prevent Czechoslovak citizens
 from fleeing to the West, border guards in recent years have
 caused a number of casualties, including fatalities. It is
 not known if any such incidents occurred in 1987.
 
 
 882
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Deqrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government does not appear to practice a systematic
 program of torture. In a collection of articles published in
 1987 by the independent human rights group Charter 77,
 however, current and former prisoners in Czechoslovak jails
 reported instances of cruel and degrading treatment during the
 past 10 years. In addition, there are reports that the Wonka
 brothers were severely beaten during their extended detention.
 Jiri Wdlf also appear to have received several arbitrary
 administrative punishments and was subjected to threats by
 prison authorities. Karel Srp, chairman of the Jazz Section
 of the Musicians Union, was held incommunicado for several
 weeks. All reportedly are in very poor health as a result of
 their prison experiences. Wolf remains in prison, but Srp was
 released on January 1, 1988.
 Generally, prison conditions are poor and sometimes approach
 the level of cruel and inhuman treatment. This is especially
 true under the "third category" of imprisonment (the harshest
 regime). In general, cells are small and unheated, family
 visits are strictly limited, and prisoners report such
 punishments as reduction in pay and limitations on free time,
 bathing, and exercise periods if they fai. to meet
 unrealistically high work standards. Informed sources report
 that prisoners are assigned unpleasant and hazardous work
 which normal workers refuse to perform. Inmates are
 occasionally given such health-threatening assignments as
 polishing crystal and costume jewelry in environments lacking
 sufficient ventilation to prevent glass fragments and chemicals
 from being inhaled. Sanitary facilities, diet, and medical
 facilities are reliably reported to be deficient. Former
 prisoners have reported that prison guards sometimes encourage
 hardened criminals to prey on persons serving sentences for
 political offenses. Prisoners or former prisoners who complain
 publicly of mistreatment have been severely punished, sometimes
 being tried and sentenced anew for "offenses" deriving from
 this activity.
 In its July 1983 meeting, the World Psychiatric Association
 accused Czechoslovakia of misusing psychiatry for political
 purposes. Czechoslovakia thereupon resigned its membership in
 the organization. In the absence of confirmed instances of
 such practice, there is no consensus among independent
 observers on the issue of psychiatric abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Czechoslovak citizens are frequently arrested, detained, or
 subjected to searches and interrogations for the expression of
 personal views 6ontrary to those of the regime. Judicial and
 police authorities often explain such actions in legal terms
 and perform them with warrants. They have also arrested and
 detained citizens without warrants. Under the law, a person
 may be detained for up to 48 hours without being charged,
 although in practice this limit has not always been strictly
 observed. Searches, detentions, and frequent interrogations
 are among the tactics used by the regime when it has decided
 to harass rather than to prosecute.
 
 
 883
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 According to law, a detainee may be held in investigative
 detention for 60 days if the authorities decide to press
 charges. A detainee lacks the right to have visits by family
 members until after his or her trial is over. Investigative
 detention may be, and often is, extended beyond 60 days at the
 request of the prosecution, and detainees are occasionally
 held for long periods without being brought to trial. For
 example, Jan Dus, an evangelical minister without state
 license and a Charter 77 signatory, was arrested on May 20,
 1986 and held without trial until June 9, 1987. Jiri and
 Pavel Wonka (see Section 3) were held for a full year before
 their trial.
 Persons arrested for expressing personal views that take issue
 with the regime's official position generally are charged with
 "subversion," "incitement," "defamation of the Republic," or
 "damaging the interests of the Republic abroad." Czechoslovak
 citizens who have unauthorized contacts with foreign diplomats
 or who frequent embassies and their libraries have sometimes
 been charged with "espionage." Those arrested for religious
 activities usually are charged with "obstructing state
 supervision over churches and religious societies." Many
 articles of the criminal code are sufficiently elastic to
 encompass almost any activity. In certain instances, the
 authorities have also resorted to arbitrary or trumped-up
 criminal charges (e.g., "hooliganism" or "stealing Socialist
 property") to punish those whose real offense was to engage in
 unauthorized political or cultural activity.
 The Czechoslovak authorities do not formally impose internal
 exile or house arrest. In 1984, for the first time, the
 Government introduced a regime of "protective supervision,"
 which combines features of both. A former political prisoner
 currently subjected to this regime is Petr Cibulka. Protective
 supervision includes travel restrictions, curfews, frequent
 searches of persons, homes, and guests, and the obligation to
 report regularly to the police. The imposition of such a
 regime, intended for habitually violent offenders, against
 persons who have never committed or advocated an act of
 violence sharply curtails their freedom of movement and
 isolates them from contact with the outside world.
 In the past, the Government has turned to forced exile in
 order to rid itself of critics. In numerous cases, people
 working or visiting abroad with official permission have been
 stripped of their citizenship and refused the right to return.
 The authorities at times have exerted heavy pressure on those
 who have already served a jail sentence to emigrate. If they
 refuse, they and their families may suffer harassment, denial
 of jobs and schooling, and the threat of rearrest. Frequently,
 after a year or more of this treatment, these ex-prisoners
 apply for emigration passports.
 Forced labor does not exist in Czechoslovakia, but "work
 education" is required of prisoners. Former prisoners report
 that convicts face higher norms (quotas), lower pay, and
 poorer working conditions than do ordinary workers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to Czechoslovak law, people charged with criminal
 offenses are entitled to fair and open public trials. The law
 provides that accused persons have a right to be informed
 concerning the charges against them., to retain counsel, and to
 present a defense. In practice, however, the exercise of
 
 
 884
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 these rights may be reduced to a mere formality, especially
 where political offenses are concerned.
 Defendants may either choose their own lawyers or request
 court-appointed lawyers. However, lawyers, like judges, are
 subject to direct and indirect pressures from political
 authorities, and they do not always vigorously represent their
 clients. Defense attorneys who have defended their clients
 with vigor have in some cases been disbarred and even
 prosecuted. Defendants may exercise their right to defend
 themselves in court and occasionally succeed in having charges
 dismissed or reduced at the original trial. Thereafter, the
 prosecution may file an appeal which may result in an increase
 in the sentence or in additional charges.
 In 1987 trials with political content were more open to
 attendance by friends of defendants, press representatives,
 and diplomats than in previous years. (See discussion of the
 Jazz Section trial in Section 2.b. below.)
 The judiciary is not independent of the regime and the
 Communist Party. In theory, judges can be removed only by the
 Federal Assembly (parliament) or by the Czech or Slovak
 National Councils. In practice, they are subject to direct
 control and supervision by the party, to which most judges and
 ambitious lawyers belong.
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 difficult to estimate. The Government does not release
 figures on its prison population and does not recognize
 political prisoners as a separate category. The only figures
 available are those from the Committee for the Defense of the
 Unjustly Persecuted (VONS), which to the best of its ability
 documents individual cases. By VONS' account, there are at
 least 15 political prisoners at this time. However, VONS does
 not monitor certain categories of political prisoners, such as
 those sentenced for attempts to leave Czechoslovakia without
 official permission. The number of such prisoners--most of
 whom serve terms of 1 to 2 years--has been variously estimated
 at between 200 and 800.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government often monitors and controls the leisure-time
 activities of citizens whom it suspects of engaging in
 antiregime or independent activity. Consequently, it also
 interferes with privacy of communications.
 Those who are considered opponents of the regime bear the
 brunt of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their
 families, and their friends are subjected routinely to such
 measures as electronic surveillance, tapping of telephones,
 and interception and destruction of mail. Discrimination in
 employment is a regular aspect of the harassment and
 persecution of families of dissidents and religious
 activists. Feat that their children may be denied higher
 education is a major factor in preventing open dissent among
 intellectuals and white-collar workers.
 A special problem exists for religious believers who wish to
 raise their children in their faith. Organization of religious
 instruction or of ceremonies in private homes is forbidden.
 Parents must obtain the permission of local authorities if
 their children are to receive religious education at school.
 
 
 885
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 School authorities warn parents that participation in religious
 classes could be damaging to a child's education and career
 prospects.
 The Government discourages contacts with persons and
 organizations in the West and receipt of information from the
 West. It also requires persons in a variety of professions to
 file a report each time they have a conversation with a
 Westerner. Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe in Czech and
 Slovak are jammed in Prague and in other major cities,
 although they often can be heard in rural areas. Other
 Western radio broadcasts are not jammed. Many people who live
 near the country's western or southern borders can receive
 West German or Austrian television broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press, it states that these freedoms must be
 exercised "in accordance with the interests of the working
 class." In effect, persons may not ordinarily voice opinions
 publicly that differ from party policy or that question the
 legitimacy of party rule, the fundamental principles of the
 "Socialist" State, or the regime's relationship with the
 Soviet Union. Likewise, political directives severely limit
 academic freedom. While there is some limited evidence that,
 in the light of recent Soviet examples, the Czechoslovak
 authorities may be allowing marginally greater freedom of
 expression in some instances, no pattern has yet emerged.
 All newspapers and magazines are published and controlled by
 political parties or mass organizations of the National Front
 (e.g., the Youth League, Revolutionary Trade Union Movement,
 or Sports Federation). These in turn are controlled by the
 Communist Party. Legally published religious literature and
 periodicals are subject to strict censorship and are available
 only in limited editions. Publishing houses and the news
 media, all state owned, employ self-censorship under Communist
 Party guidelines. Editors who are insufficiently vigilant
 suffer fines or dismissal. Writers who wish to publish must
 belong to the state-controlled Union of Writers.
 Only a limited number of Western non-Communist periodicals are
 imported, and these are usually beyond the reach of ordinary
 citizens. Since the early 1970's, libraries have restricted
 access to Western publications of a political character to
 those persons who have obtained special permission from their
 employers or their universities, documenting their need for
 the material for official purposes. Periodicals such as Time
 and Newsweek are locked in cabinets controlled by special
 personnel. Books and periodicals published during the 1968-69
 period, or other publications considered ideologically
 "harmful," are subject to similar controls.
 The Interior Ministry controls printing and photocopying
 equipment, except typewriters, which cannot be obtained
 legally by private citizens. Despite these restrictions, a
 lively underground samizdat (self-published) press publishes a
 variety of fiction and nonfiction, usually in very small
 editions. A group of Charter 77 signatories regularly
 publishes a newsletter entitled Informace o Charte 77
 (Information about the Charter), which carries Charter
 documents and VONS communiques reporting human rights
 
 
 886
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 violations. Some samizdat literature is sent abroad, where it
 is reprinted in emigre publishing houses and then brought back
 to Czechoslovakia in large editions. Persons prosecuted for
 exercising their right to free speech or for engaging in
 independent publishing activities in 1987 included Ervin Motl,
 who received a 3-year sentence for discussing and criticizing
 internal conditions; Jiri Bohac, a 2 1/2-year sentence for
 verbal attacks and hostility toward the Socialist system;
 Michal Mrtvy, a 13-month suspended sentence for producing and
 distributing religious material; and the leadership of the
 Jazz Section, whose case is discussed below.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution theoretically grants freedom of
 assembly, that freedom is severely limited in practice.
 Generally, public meetings may be held only with the
 permission of the police, and this permission depends upon
 whether or not the proposed meeting supports state
 objectives. When the authorities wish to have a large rally
 (May Day or "peace" demonstrations), they exert pressure on
 people to attend.
 In 1987 Czechoslovak authorities permitted the public
 observance of the 50th anniversary of the death of Thomas G.
 Masaryk, President of the first Czechoslovak Republic, in an
 event organized at Masaryk's grave-site by signatories of
 Charter 77. Dozens of Czechoslovak citizens attended the
 ceremony which transpired without incident. Several
 independent art exhibits also occurred in 1987 without
 official interference, although others were prevented. The
 authorities may also interfere with lectures and film showings
 in private homes if they object to the subject matter or the
 participants. In February Czechoslovak authorities prevented
 several Charter 77 signatories from meeting with American
 officials. However, more recently, Czechoslovak citizens,
 including Charter personalities, have been able to meet
 unhindered with visiting foreign dignitaries.
 The Government does not permit spontaneous independent
 associations. Its unwillingness to tolerate independent
 initiatives is 'seen in its treatment of the Jazz Section of
 the Musicians Union. This once legally constituted
 association of 7,000 jazz fans throughout Czechoslovakia
 formerly organized jazz festivals and sponsored publications
 on music and the arts for its members. In March 1985, the
 Jazz Section was dissolved under a 1968 statute banning
 "counterrevolutionary activity." Leaders of the Section
 protested and addressed a series-of letters and petitions to
 the authorities. Their actions brought down upon them
 surveillance interrogations, loss of employment, and other
 forms of haiassment. Because of its international status as a
 member of the UNESCO-affiliated International Jazz Federation
 and because of growing Western public attention to its
 struggle, the Jazz Section was able to continue operating for
 a time.
 In September 1986, police raided the Jazz Section's offices
 and its leaders' apartments and places of employment and
 confiscated approximately 800 books, several hundred magazines,
 and the Section's records. They arrested seven members of the
 Jazz Section, including its leadership, and charged them with
 "unauthorized enterprising." In March five members of the
 leadership were tried, convicted, and sentenced to up to 16
 
 
 887
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 months' imprisonment. Jazz Section Chairman Karel Srp was
 released on January 1, 1988.
 In May 1987, the founding committee of a proposed organization
 to be named the Society of Friends with the United States
 submitted a request for approval of its bylaws to the Ministry
 of Interior. The organization was to be a voluntary, social
 association within the framework of the National Front, and
 dedicated to developing friendship, trust, and understanding
 between Czechoslovakia and the United States. In June the
 Ministry rejected the request, but its decision has been
 appealed.
 Czechoslovak workers do not have the right to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing without previous
 authorization. An attempt to establish an independent trade
 union in the early 1980's was suppressed. Membership in
 official trade unions or professional associations is
 virtually obligatory for workers and for those seeking to
 practice a profession. Communist Party membership is an
 unwritten but commonly acknowledged prerequisite for nearly
 all higher-level jobs.
 The Czechoslovak labor union umbrella organization, the
 Revolutionary Workers' Movement (ROH), is a mass organization
 strictly controlled by the Communist Party. Strikes,
 independent organizing efforts, and collective bargaining are
 not permitted under the Czechoslovak system. The ROH is
 affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions, whose
 headquarters are in Prague.
 The Constitution ensures the right and duty to work. In
 practice, persons considered politically unreliable are barred
 from professional positions and forced into menial, low-paid
 jobs such as coal stokers and nightwatchmen. The International
 Labor Organization has condemned this practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 '"Scientific atheism" is part of the official ideology, and
 freedom of religion, provided for in the Constitution, is
 strictly limited in practice. The regime actively discourages
 all religious activity, especially among the young, and in
 general denies higher education to active believers and to
 their children. Teachers, policemen, Communist Party
 officials, and members of certain other professions encounter
 problems in their careers if they are seen in church.
 The Government exercises strict control over all religious
 affairs. A church must be registered officially in order to
 function legally in Czechoslovakia. Groups which proselytize,
 such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are banned outright,
 and their members suffer frequent harassment and arrest.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have been reported in several prisons, but
 there is no reliable estimate of their number.
 Organized religious practice is hampered by both written and
 unwritten restrictions. Clergymen are paid by the State and
 must receive a state license in order to practice. Such
 licenses can be--and are--withdrawn without explanation.
 Estimates of the number of clergymen who have lost their
 licenses vary, but they are known to include several bishops.
 Those who continue to practice despite revocation of their
 licenses are liable to criminal prosecution. During 1987 at
 least two priests were tried for obstructing state supervision
 
 
 888
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 of churches and religious societies. One, 80-year-old
 Ladislav Hanus, was sentenced to 1 year in prison (suspended)
 for hearing a confession without a state license. A second
 priest, 62-year-old Stefan Javorsky, was sentenced to 8
 months, imprisonment for celebrating a mass in a private home.
 The printing of religious literature is severely restricted,
 and Bibles are in short supply. The demand for religious
 literature exceeds the supply, and Bibles and other pieces of
 religious literature are smuggled in from abroad and produced
 by underground samizdat (self-published) methods. Samizdat
 and other unofficial efforts to increase the supply of
 religious materials are illegal. Frantisek Adamik and Michal
 Mrtvy, religious activists, received suspended sentences of 14
 and 13 hionths, -respectively, for producing and distributing
 religious literature.
 The Czechoslovak authorities do not facilitate travel by
 religious officials to and from Czechoslovakia unless the
 proposed visit serves the purpose of the State. In the case
 of the Catholic Church, the Government has followed an
 extremely restrictive policy. Pope John Paul II has not been
 permitted to visit Czechoslovakia, despite an invitation from
 Cardinal Tomasek and petitions signed by thousands of Czech
 and Slovak Catholics. Catholic priests and other religious
 leaders are frequently denied permission to travel outside the
 country. In October the Vatican drew public attention to
 Czechoslovak oppression of the Catholic Church and criticized
 the Government's refusal to issue exit permission to two
 persons, Bishop Hirka of Presov and lay delegate Dr. Silveste
 Krumery, who had been invited to attend the Synod of Bishops.
 Nonetheless, Cardinal Tomasek was allowed to travel alone to
 Rome for the Synod. Unofficial or unsanctioned travel by
 religious groups for purposes the Government considers
 illegal--e.g., importing religious literature or objects,
 conducting religious training, and similar activities--is
 severely punished.
 For many years, no proposed construction of new Catholic
 churches has been approved. However, some Protestant
 congregations--including Baptists--have been allowed to build
 new churches.
 The Roman Catholic Church is the largest of Czechoslovakia's
 18 officially registered religious bodies. There are an
 estimated 8 to 11 million Roman Catholics in the country, and
 up to 450,000 members of the affiliated Greek Catholic
 (Uniate) Church. The Greek Catholic Church was reestablished
 in 1968 after having been for-cibly united with the much
 smaller Orthodox Church in 1950. However, the Greek Catholics
 have been unable to reclaim their property, which remains in
 the possession of the Orthodox Church.
 Students in Czechoslovakia's 2 remaining Catholic seminaries
 (out of a prewar total of 13) need state approval to be
 admitted and ordained. In addition, the State must approve
 each priest's assignment to a parish or higher office.
 Consequently, many priests have to cover more than one parish,
 and only 3 of 13 dioceses have resident bishops.
 In 1950 all male religious orders were dissolved. A few
 female religious orders were allowed to continue functioning,
 but they were prevented from accepting new members, except
 during a brief interlude in 1968. Despite these limitations,
 some Catholic monastic orders have continued to operate
 
 
 889
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 clandestinely, with members making occasional public
 appearances.
 In Slovakia there were three Catholic pilgrimages in 1987 in
 which several hundred thousand people took part with no
 substantial police interference. Mother Theresa from India
 visited the Shrine at Sastin and addressed the crowd.
 "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored "peace association" of
 Catholic clergy, founded by the State in 1970, has been a
 major instrument of state control over the Catholic Church.
 The association has been losing ground since 1982 when the
 Vatican banned clerical participation in political
 organizations worldwide. Although Cardinal Tomasek and the
 overwhelming majority of Catholic clergy in Czechoslovakia
 have disassociated themselves from "Pacem in Terris," priests
 associated with the organization have retained control of
 Katolicke Noviny (Catholic News), the only legally published
 Catholic newspaper. The Pope refused to receive an ad limina
 (quinquennial) visit from a bishop active in "Pacem in Terris."
 Protestant denominations registered by the Government operate
 under constraints similar to those for the Catholic Church.
 Proselytizing is forbidden; religious education is strictly
 regulated and may not be organized in private homes; religious
 ceremonies are restricted for the most part to church
 premises; and education of clergymen is closely controlled.
 Clergymen who become popular with young people or associated
 with Charter 77 soon find themselves barred from preaching.
 Two Jewish community councils, one in the Czech lands and the
 other in Slovakia, serve the Jewish community of several
 thousand. These councils are central religious organizations
 financially supported and controlled by the Government. There
 are synagogues and prayer houses open for worship and two
 rabbis, one in Prague and one in Kosice. In Prague there is a
 Jewish museum operated by the State. There are no Jewish
 schools or rabbinical seminaries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 For most Czechoslovaks, freedom of movement within the country
 is not restricted, except near military installations and
 along the borders with Austria and the Federal Republic of
 Germany. However, the Government has increasingly restricted
 the movements of Charter 77 activists and other "suspect"
 persons.
 Persons wishing to travel to Western countries must obtain
 permission and, unless they are visiting close relatives, a
 hard currency authorization. The number of such authorizations
 issued each year is far below demand. The Government
 announced in November, however, that citizens who have someone
 in the West willing to sponsor them financially will in the
 future be exempt from the requirement to secure a hard
 currency authorization, although they must still obtain
 official permission to travel. Travelers to the West usually
 must leave some member of their immediate families at home as
 a hostage to ensure their return. These restrictions often
 are relaxed for retired persons.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to other East European
 countries also is regulated. A special passport is required
 for trips to Yugoslavia, and travel to Poland has been
 
 
 890
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 restricted since 1981. Travel to Hungary has been made more
 difficult by limiting the amount of currency which may be
 exchanged and the number of trips which may be made in 1 year.
 Citizens deemed politically unreliable may be denied
 permission to travel to either Eastern or Western Europe.
 The right to emigrate is extremely limited. In general, only
 those wishing to join a foreign citizen spouse, or, in the
 case of retired persons, foreign citizen children abroad, have
 this right. Those caught while seeking to leave Czechoslovakia
 without official permission may be sentenced to between 6
 months and 5 years in prison.
 Czechoslovakia in the past has denied the right of repatriation
 by stripping the citizenship from those citizens it wished to
 keep out. Emigration passports are not valid for return
 without special endorsement, and in some cases permanent exile
 is a condition for emigration or study abroad.
 There is a moderate outflow of persons from Czechoslovakia,
 primarily persons who leave the country legally on vacation to
 non-Warsaw Pact countries and do not return. This may amount
 to about 10,000 persons annually, but precise statistics are
 unavailable.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change the system of
 government. The Communist Party leadership makes all
 significant decisions regarding government, the economy, and
 social affairs. It determines who will be placed in
 decisionmaking positions not only within its own ranks but
 also throughout the Government, the economy, the media, and
 mass organizations. Real power is exercised by only a few
 top-level officials in the party Presidium and Secretariat.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party members,
 have no role in selecting their leaders or in participating in
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 are permitted to exist and publish their own newspapers, but
 they must conform strictly to Communist Party directives. All
 parties and mass organizations are incorporated in the National
 Front, which is completely controlled by the Communist Party.
 Among its tasks is the nomination of a single slate of
 candidates to stand unopposed at all elections.
 Czechoslovak citizen Pavel Wonka is currently serving a
 21-month prison sentence for distributing an independent
 election ballot for the May 1986 election to the Federal
 Assembly. Wonka had hoped to present himself as an
 independent candidate in the elections. The authorities
 convicted him on charges of subversion.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government reacts negatively to expressions of concern
 about human rights violations in Czechoslovakia either by
 other governments or by nongovernmental institutions.
 Officials have spoken candidly with U.S. officials, however,
 about the Czechoslovak Government's interpretation of human
 rights and of-the limits which it-contends must exist to
 provide adequate protection for society. During 1987
 
 
 891
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 representatives of the Helsinki Watch Committee and Amnesty
 International were permitted to travel to Czechoslovakia.
 Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern themselves with human
 rights. One is Charter 77, a group of persons who signed a
 document, first made public in January 1977, calling on the
 Government to honor its commitments to international
 agreements on human rights, including the Final Act of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as
 human rights provisions, in the Czechoslovak Constitution. The
 second group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted, uses public records and reports from friends and
 relatives of the accused to issue communiques in cases where
 it believes the police, the courts, or the prisons have abused
 citizens' civil rights. These communiques are distributed to
 the Czechoslovak authorities. Members of both these groups
 are targets for harassment by the regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Health care, educational, retirement, and other services are
 provided without regard to race or sex. Membership in the
 Communist Party confers special access to goods and services
 (including education, medical services, and consumer items),
 and party officials receive particularly favorable treatment.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small numbers of
 women in the professions. However, female representation is
 very low in higher-ranking party, government, and managerial
 positions. There is one woman in the party Secretariat, and
 she holds her position by virtue of being Chairman of the
 Woman's Union. There are no female ministers or ambassadors.
 Women comprise 46.5 percent of the work force, but they tend
 to be concentrated in lower-paying, less skilled jobs. In
 nonagricultural activities, women's average wages amounted in
 1985 to 68.4 percent of those of men. Women do, however,
 receive pay equal to that of their male colleagues if they
 hold the same job.
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks--and two substantial minorities--Hungarians and
 Gypsies. Czechoslovakia provides certain guarantees for
 minorities, but interethnic relations are still colored by
 historic animosities. Hungarians, who are concentrated in
 southern Slovakia, form the country's largest minority
 (555,000, according to official statistics). They are
 represented proportionately in Federal and local legislative
 bodies but are underrepresented in high-level jobs in
 industry, government, and the party apparatus. The State
 provides some primary and secondary education in Hungarian and
 permits a limited number of ethnic Hungarians to pursue higher
 education in Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians complain, however,
 that Hungarian-language instruction at the elementary and
 secondary levels is being reduced, and that the lack of
 opportunities for higher education in Hungarian is creating a
 growing shortage of qualified Hungarian-language teachers.
 Gypsies, who number about 250,000, are the only other sizable
 minority. They tend to suffer from disproportionately high
 rates of poverty, crime, and disease. Their problems appear
 to result as much from tradition and popular prejudice as from
 government policies. Nonetheless, a Gypsy has attained the
 rank of general in the armed forces and is currently on active
 duty.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Approximately 30,000 Vietnamese laborers are temporarily
 working and residing in Czechoslovakia. Reportedly, they are
 allowed to retain two-thirds of their salary. The remainder
 is shared by the Czechoslovak and Vietnamese Governments.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although
 younger persons may accept part-time employment. The average
 workweek is 42.5 hours. Beyond 45 hours, workers are paid
 overtime, and there are additional bonuses for some shift and
 weekend work. The retirement age is 57 years for women and 60
 years for men. The average pension is 55 percent of the
 average wage, and many retirees supplement their pension
 payments by working.
 There is a nominal labor shortage induced by low productivity
 and the underutilization of resources. The need for unskilled
 and semiskilled labor is filled in part by workers from other
 Communist countries.
 Working conditions appear generally acceptable, although far
 less attention is paid to occupational safety and the problem
 of environmental pollution than in the West. When employee-
 management problems arise, workers have little recourse, since
 strikes and independent labor organizations are prohibited and
 the major preoccupation of the state-controlled labor union is
 to ensure that production plans are fulfilled.
