 NIGER
 On January 27, 1996 a group of army officers led by then Colonel Ibrahim
 Mainassara Bare overthrew the elected government of Niger. The leaders of the
 coup d'etat quickly established a Military Council of National Salvation (CNS) and
 a subordinate interim cabinet. The CNS suspended the 1992 Constitution, dissolved
 the National Assembly, implemented a state of emergency, and temporarily prohib-
 ited political activity. Top civilian government leaders were put under house arrest.
 The Government subsequently organized a Constitutional Conference, held a ref-
 erendum on the new Constitution, and conducted a seriously flawed presidential
 election, which was won by Bare. The November 1996 legislative elections were boy-
 cotted by the opposition. Pro vernment parties and supporters claimed all 83 Na-
 tional Assembly seats. The judiciary remains subject to executive interference.
 Security forces consist of the army, the Republican Guard, the gendarmerie (para-
 military police), and the national police. The police and the gendarmerie tradition-
 ally have primary responsibility for internal security. However, since the coup, the
 army has ad a much more prominent role. The 1996 coup was led by army officers
 with some support from the gendarmerie. Following the coup, members of all secu-
 rity forces committed human rights abuses. Security force members continued to
 commit abuses in 1997.
 The economy is based mainly on traditional subsistence farming, herding, small
 trading, and informal markets. Less than 15 percent of the economy is in the mod-
 ern sector. Uranium is the most important export. Per capita income is about $260.
 Persistent drought, deforestation and soil degradation, low literacy, a flat uranium
 market, high import prices and burdensome debt further weakened the already
 troubled economy. Niger is heavily dependent on foreign assistance, and one of the
 aftermaths of the coup was a sharp fall in foreign aid, only partially reversed in
 1997.
 The Government's human rights record remained the same, and serious problems
 remained in many areas. The 1996 coup and the fraudulent 1996 presidential elec-
 tion effectively disenfranchised citizens, preventing them from exercising the right
 to change their government. Security forces on occasion beat and intimidated opposi-
 tion political figures and violated laws governing searches, treatment of prisoners,
 and length of detention. Prison conditions remained poor. The overloaded judicial
 system and delays in trials resulted in long periods of pretrial confinement. The
 Government continued to intimidate the private press and radio and arrested, de-
 tained and mistreated journalists. The Government also passed a stringent new
 press jaw. The Government continued to ban peaceable meetings and demonstra-
 tions, although less often than in 1996. The Government restricted freedom of move-
 ment. Societal discrimination and domestic violence against women continued to be
 serious problems. Female genital mutilation persists. The Government restricts
 some worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings by government officials. A civilian, Hassan
 Ali, died under suspicious circumstances while being detained by soldiers near Diffa.
 Violence in the north decreased following the signing in April 1995 of a peace pact
 between Tuareg separatists and the Government. A similar agreement in April 1996
 between the Government and the Arab/Toubou/Kanouri Front (CRA) based in east-
 ern Niger, which seeks independence for its region, also reduced the sporadic vio-
 lence in that area. However, there were numerous potentially destabilizing incidents
 in the north and east. The Government claimed to have killed 14 rebels near the
 Libyan border on January 19 after the rebels attacked a civilian convoy. Clashes
 took place between government forces and Toubou rebels in May and June in the
 Lake Chad region, resulting in about eight deaths. On September 20, Toubou rebels
 attacked an army outpost at Madama in northeast Niger, resulting in five military
 deaths and five wounded (three military and two civilians). On October 8, Revolu-
 tionary Armed Forces Union (UFRA) elements attacked a 15-vehicle truck convoy
 and killed one of the military escorts. During a rebel attack on Aderbissnat on Octo-
 ber 19, 6 soldiers, 1 civilian and 20 rebels were killed. On November 14, rebels at-
 tacked an army post on the border with Nigeria; the Government claims three
 rebels were killed and 1 soldier injured.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, individuals widely believed to be
 
 
 members of the security forces detained and beat opposition political activist Elhadj
 Oumarou Oubandawaki on February 3 for repeated criticism of the Government on
 the radio. He suffered head injuries, and a broken arm, and had several teeth
 knocked out.
 On April 10, four unidentified men, again widely believed to be security officers,
 seized Suley Adji, an academic who had written critically of the Government, at
 his home, drove him outside of Niamey, stripped him naked, and beat him into un-
 consciousness. Government inquiries into both beatings produced no results.
 Police used tear gas and force to break up a peaceful protest march in January
 injuring over two dozen persons (see Sections 1.d. and 2.n.).
 Pson conditions are poor. Prisons are underfunded and understaffed. They are
 overcrowded and diet, health, and sanitary conditions for prisoners are very poor.
 The national health budget for prisoners was $40,000 (cfa 23.9 million) a slight in-
 crease from 1996.
 Prisoners are segregated by sex, but minors and adults are incarcerated together.
 Family visits are allowed, and prisoners can receive supplemental food and other
 necessities from their families. There are no reports of unduly harsh treatment, be-
 yond the very poor conditions of detention, but petty corruption among prison staff
 is also reported to be rampant.
 Human rights monitors visit the prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary detention, and laws officially prohibit detention without charge in excess of 48
 hours, police violate these provisions in practice. If police fail to gather sufficient
 evidence within the detention period, the prosecutor gives the case to another offi-
 cer, and a new 48-hour detention period begins.
 The judicial system is seriously overloaded. There are no statutory limits on pre-
 trial confinement of indicted persons; detention frequently lasts months or years,
 and some persons have been waiting as long as 7 years to be charged. Of 795 pris-
 oners in Niamey's prison in May, 696 (86 percent) were awaiting trial.
 The law provides for a right to counsel, although only one defense attorney is
 known to have a private practice outside the capital. A defendant has the right to
 a lawyer immediately upon detention. The State provides a defense attorney for
 indigents.
 Bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years imprison-
 ment. Widespread ignorance of the law and lack of financial means prevent full ex-
 ercise of these rights.
 On January 11, police put former president Mahamane Ousmane, former National
 Assembly Speaker Mahamadou Issoufou, and opposition party leader Tandja
 Mamadou under house arrest for 3 days, ostensibly for "threatening state security."
 They were then detained in undisclosed security facilities for 9 days before being
 released on January 23. No charges were brought against any of them.
 On January 11, police also detained dozens of other opposition activists, including
 many women who had attempted to stage a peaceful protest march. About 26 per-
 sons were injured when the police, using tear gas, forcefully broke up the march
 (see Section 2.a.). Police held the majority of the detainees without charges for about
 10 days before releasing them. All were released by January 23, and there was no
 evidence of mistreatment by the police while they were detained.
 On January 23, police arrested Souley Oumarou, a lawyer for the political opposi-
 tion, apparently to intimidate him from bringing legal charges against President
 Bare over the coup d'etat. He was released 3 days later.
 In March police detained nine persons after a peaceful assembly, in which several
 of the arrestees had apparently not even participated. They were sentenced to 2
 months' imprisonment for alleged "armed illegal assembly."
 In March 23 electric utility workers were arrested for sabotage, in most cases
 without evidence. In April two of those arrested were sentenced to prison terms of
 2 months, and two others to 2 years; the rest were released. The workers sentenced
 to 2 years of imprisonment were subsequently released and have resumed work at
 the electric utility.
 In February and April, coinciding with Muslim holy days, President Bare par-
 doned all prisoners with less than 6 months yet to serve, all juveniles, nursing and
 pregnant women, prisoners over 55 years old, and those with certain illnesses. The
 April pardon was also extended to certain other convicts with less than 1 year re-
 maining on their sentences.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and there were no reports of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, hut it is subject to executive interference. Although the Supreme Court has
 on occasion asserted its independence, human rights groups assert that family and
 business ties influence the lower courts and undermine their integrity. Judges some-
 
 
 251
 times fear reassignment or having their financial benefits reduced if they render a
 decision unfavorable to the Government, though such coercive tactics are reportedly
 less frequently used.
 Defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, first to the Court of Appeals,
 then to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law,
 while the Supreme Court reviews only the application of law and constitutional
 questions.
 Traditional chiefs can act as mediators and counselors and have authority in the
 realm of customary law as well as status under modern law where they are des-
 ignated as auxiliaries to local administrators. They are charged with collecting local
 taxes and receive stipends from the Government, but they do not have police orjudi-
 cial powers and can only mediate, not arbitrate, disputes under customary law. Cus-
 tomary courts, located only in large towns and cities, try cases involving divorce or
 inheritance. They are headed by a legal practitioner with basic legal education who
 is advised by an assessor knowledgeable in the society's traditions. The judicial ac-
 tions of chiefs and customary courts are not regulated by code, and defendants may
 appeal a verdict to the formal court system. Women do not have equal legal status
 with men and do not enjoy the same access to legal redress (see Section 5).
 In January shortly after government forces broke up opposition demonstrations,
 the Government revived a 1974 law authorizing a State Security Court. According
 to government spokesmen, the Court would have jurisdiction over crimes committed
 against national security. Although members of the Court were sworn in on January
 17, no trials were held.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, to be present at trial, to confront witnesses,
 to examine the evidence against them, and to appeal verdicts. The Constitution af-
 firms the presumption of innocence. The law provides for counsel at public expense
 for minors and indigent defendants charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10
 years or more. Although lawyers comply with government requests to provide coun-
 sel, they are generally not remunerated by the Government.
 At year's end, there were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge. Police may
 search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters
 criminals or stolen property. However, human rights organizations report that police
 often conduct routine searches without warrants. The law authorizing the State Se-
 curity Court also provides for warrantless searches. Such searches were carried out
 repeatedly in January at the homes and offices of opposition political figures.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but the Government took actions that limited press freedom.
 The local independent press remained relatively assertive in criticizing govern-
 ment actions. No newspaper was forced to shut down. Foreign journals circulate and
 report freely.
 However, on March 1 five persons in military uniforms vandalized the independ-
 ent radio station Anfani. Two weeks later police arrested five Anfani employees, in-
 cluding general manager Gremah Boucar, for "defamation of the army," after he
 lodged a complaint. Three of the employees were quickly released, but Gremah and
 the watchman who witnessed the attack were held for 6 days. They were released
 after agreeing to repudiate their version of the events of March 1. A government
 inquiry into the incident never produced a report.
 On April 10, four unidentified men seized at his home university professor and
 independent newspaper contributor Souley Adji, who had written critically of the
 Government. They drove him outside of Niamey, stripped him naked, and beat him
 until he became unconscious.
 On June 24, the National Assembly adopted a new press law, which made jour-
 nalist accreditation more stringent, disqualifying many independent journalists, and
 stiffened libel laws, prescribing stiff fines and jail terms for anyone defaming or in-
 sulting the President or other high officials. The journalists union quickly de-
 nounced the measure as unnecessary (a 1993 press law was already in force) and
 as an attempt by the Government to destroy the independent press.
 The Government used the new law to intimidate the press. On October 7, the
 Government sentenced independent newspaper publisher Moussa Tchangari to 3
 months in prison and an approximately $80 (cfa 50,000) fine for reproducing inter-
 nal government correspondence; the Supreme Court granted Tchangari provisional
 release after he served 2 months.
 On October 23, Bangnou Bonkoukou, President of the Niger League for the De-
 fense of Human Rights, was sentenced under the new press law to a 2-year prison
 
 
 252
 
 term "for libeling" the President. He was arrested on October 10 and tried on Octo-
 ber 20. The court found Bonkoukou guilty of libel based on his interview with a
 Burkina Faso newspaper in which he questioned the President's "legitimacy" and
 accused him of imposing a "dictatorship" on the country.
 On October 26, in a statement broadcast on the evening news, Minister of Interior
 Idi Ango Omar warned government opponents that capital punishment was per-
 mitted under the country's laws and, after attacking Bangnou Bonkoukou, implied
 that capital punishment might be used against those who allegedly "prefer the dis-
 memberment of Niger more than its stability." Bonkoukou was subsequently re-
 leased after serving less than 3 months of his 2-year sentence, while the constitu-
 tional issue is being decided.
 The Government has not yet denied accreditation to any journalists; the Govern-
 ment has not begun issuing new press cards according to the new press law criteria.
 Journalists may function without accreditation, although if accredited they could ob-
 tain financial advantages.
 The most important public medium is the government-operated, multilingual na-
 tional radio service. It provided only minimal air time for opposition political views.
 The Government publishes the French language daily, Le Sahel, and its weekend
 edition. There are about 12 private French language weeklies or monthlies some of
 which are loosely affiliated with political parties.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 The faculty of the University of Niamey began an open-ended strike on October
 22 to protest the deterioration of their living and working conditions. They de-
 manded back pay and more resources for university instruction. Riot police were de-
 ployed in Niamey on November 13 as thousands of university students, accompanied
 by parallel marches of junior high and high school students, demonstrated to de-
 mand unpaid allowances. A student sit-in at the national treasury was dispersed
 by tear gas, and two student leaders were arrested. According to the Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Treasury Workers Union, riot police locked the treasury staff and the
 students in the building and tossed in tear gas canisters. Press reports stated that
 four people were injured and many windows were broken when the occupants tried
 to escape. Simultaneously, on the campus of the university, riot police and gen-
 darmes attacked students to clear the campus. Observers report that three students
 were injured seriously.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides fot
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government on occasion banned peaceable meet-
 ings and demonstrations. The Government retains the authority to prohibit gather-
 ings either under tense social conditions or if advance notice (48 hours) is not pro-
 vided. Opposition parties are legally permitted to hold demonstrations, but their re-
 quests for permission to march are still occasionally denied or canceled. Despite
 having rescinded its temporary ban on public demonstrations prior to the 1996 elec-
 tion, the Government frequently banned or broke up peaceable assemblies and dem-
 onstrations in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, however, the
 Government generally allowed such gatherings to take place
 On January 11, police using tear gas forcibly broke up peaceful demonstrations
 organized by the pitical opposition in Niamey, Zinder and Diffa, principally to de-
 mand greater access by the opposition to government radio broadcast facilities. Po-
 lice arrested dozens of demonstrators and caused several injuries (see Sections 1.c.
 and 1.d.). On March 9, police again used tear gas to disperse a smaller peaceful op-
 position demonstration in Niamey.
 On July 8, the anniversary of President Bare's disputed election, security forces
 prevented opposition parties from staging protest demonstrations in Niamey, sealed
 off opposition p arty headquatrs, and ejected their activists. In other cities, includ-
 ing Tahoua, Maradi, and Zinder, violent clashes occurred the same day between po-
 lice and demonstrators, and police arrested dozens of protesters. The demonstrators
 were released; none were tried.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association with some limitations. Citi-
 zens may form political parties of any kind, except those that are based on ethnicity,
 religion, or region, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. There
 are now 24 political parties, 2 of which were organized during the year. Opposition
 parties are sometimes permitted to hold meetings, but their requests for permits to
 assemble are still occasionally denied or canceled.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits any interference with the
 practice of religion, and the Government generally respects freedom of religion. Most
 citizens practice Islam. In February authorities arrested and briefly detained a local
 Islamic religious leader for celebrating the end of the Muslim holy month of Rama-
 dan on February 9 instead of the official date of February 8. Seven policemen and
 
 
 253
 six civilians were injured, and a police station and vehicles were damaged when his
 fundamentalist followers attempted to free him from detention.
 Christians (including Jehovah's Witnesses) and Baha'i practice freely. Foreign
 missionaries work freely, but their organizations must be registered as Nigerien as-
 sociations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement and does not restrict either
 emigration or repatriation. However, there were numerous cases in which the Gov-
 ernment restricted the travel, both internal and external, of opposition  litical fig-
 ures, even though no formal legal grounds exist for such restrictions. Customs and
 immigration officials maintain a list, prepared by the Government in 1996 after the
 presidential election, of people who were not permitted to leave Niger.
 Among the Hausa and Fulani peoples in eastern Niger, some ,women are clois-
 tered and may leave their homes only if escorted by a male and usually only after
 dark. Security forces at checkpoints monitor travel of persons and the circulation
 of goods, particularly near major population centers, and sometimes demand extra
 payents. Attacks by bandits on major routes to the north have declined consider-
 ably, although people often travel in convoys with military escorts for security.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. In accordance with United Nations principles, the Government offers first
 asylum to refugees. To date it has offered asylum to several thousand persons from
 neighboring countries, as well as to smaller numbers from distant countries. There
 are less than 600 Chadian refugees in eastern Niger; others returned voluntarily to
 Chad earlier in the year following a repatriation agreement between Niger and
 Chad. In addition it was anticipated that several thousand Tuareg refugees from
 Mali residing in Niger would voluntarily return to Mali with UNHCR and Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross assistance, but by year's end only small num-
 bers of refugees had returned. About 400 refugees voluntarily repatriated in August
 from Burkina Faso. About 3,500 Nigerien refugees in Algeria had been expected to
 voluntarily repatriate to Niger in 1997; however, this repatriation was delayed until
 1998.
 There were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees or of forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government;
 however, the January 1996 coup and the fraudulent July 1996 presidential election
 effectively disenfranchised citizens, preventing them from exercising this right. The
 boycotted November 1996 National Assembly elections, and the detention of many
 opposition figures in January leave this right in question. President Bare rules by
 decree when the National Assembly is not in session, and his regime continues to
 govern, although its field of maneuver is circumscribed by fiscal constraints. The ex-
 ecutive is largely unchecked by the weak assembly and judicial branches. The Gov-
 ernment and the opposition are unable to reach agreement on a more inclusive and
 representative government. Communal elections are proposed for early 1998; the
 next presidential and legislative elections are scheduled to be held in 2001.
 The January 1996 coup d'etat led by (then Colonel, now General and President)
 Tbrahim Mainassara Bare overthrew the democratically elected government. In the
 days following the coup, Bare and the coup leadership dissolved the National As-
 sembly, banned political party activity, suspended the 1992 Constitution, and de-
 clared a state of emergency.
 In a 1996 referendum with a low turnout, voters approved a new Constitution
 that reiterated rights granted under the 1992 document. The Constitution provides
 for a political system with checks and balances, an ethnically representative 83-seat
 National Assembly, and an independent judiciary. Citizens 18 years of age and over
 can vote, and balloting is by secret ballot. The most prominent constitutional
 changes ar the provisions for a stronger presidency, which make the Prime Min-
 ister more clearly subordinate to the President.
 The military government organized presidential elections on July 7 and 8, 1996,
 in which General Bare ran against four political party candidates. However, midway
 through voting, when preliminary results showed Barre running last, the regime
 dismissed the independent electoral commission, took control ofballot boxes, and
 prevented political party representatives and neutral observers from monitoring the
 vote tabulation. Bare claimed 52 percent of the votes, a result widely viewed as
 fraudulent by both local and international observers.
 
 
 In November 1996, a new National Assembly was chosen by popular vote in a low
 turnout contest boycotted by most of the political opposition. The legislative elec-
 tions were generally regarded as administratively correct but considered meaning-
 less since the opposition fully boycotted them. Observers selectively monitored the
 elections.
 In January the Government detained the leaders of the three principal political
 parties and dozens of their supporters, following demonstrations against the Gov-
 ernment. The Government also revived a State Security Court, broke up other dem-
 onstrations, and denied opposition applications to assemble and protest.
 On November 24, Bare dismissed his government, citing its poor performance in
 managing the country's problems. On November 28, he appointed the previous for-
 eign minister as Prime Minister. On December 1, he named a new 24-member Gov-
 eminent which includes 16 members from the previous government. Opposition
 leaders declined to play a role in the new Government.
 Women traditionally play a subordinate role in politics. The societal practice of
 husbands' voting their wives' proxy ballots effectively disenfranchises many women.
 This practice was widely used in presidential and National Assembly elections.
 In the National Assembly elected in November 1996, only 1 of the 83 elected
 members was female, compared with 3 in the previous legislature. The last precoup
 government appointed five women to cabinet positions; the present one has three
 female ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several independent human rights groups and associations normally operate with-
 out explicit governmental hindrance, and they publish findings and conclusions
 often higlly critical of the Government, in their own publications and in the small
 indendent press. However, the Government maintains a certain atmosphere of in-
 timidation, notably as a result of the restrictive press law and its use to charge and
 convict a newspaper publisher and human rights group head for publication of inter-
 nal government documents and defamation of the President (see Section 2.a.). Domi-
 nant among the associations are the Nigerien Association for the Defense of Human
 Rights (ANDDH); Democracy, Liberty, and Development (DLD); the Nigerien
 League for Defense of Human Rights; Adalci; the Network for the Integration and
 Diffusion of Rights in the Rural Milieu (known as "ridd-fitla "); the Niger Independ-
 ent Magistrates Assciation (SAMAN); and the Association of Women Jurists of
 Niger. There are several other women's rights groups. The International Committee
 of the Red Crss is active in Niger. In November the Government banned a prtest
 meeting by two groups intending to protest the conviction of a journalist undler the
 stringent new press.
 In 1996 an association of local NGO'S representing all political views created an
 umbrella association, the "Collectifh, to promote human rights and democracy. The
 Collectif continued to operate, but was less active during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constituon prohibits discrimination based on sex, social origin, race, eth-
 nicity, or religion. In practice, however, there is discrimination against women, chil-
 dren, ethnic minorities, and disabled persons, including limited economic and politi-
 cal opportunities.
 Woren.-Domestic violence against women is widespread, although firm statistics
 are lacking. Wife beating is reportedly common, eve in upper social strata. Fami-
 lies often intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce
 because of physical abuse. While women have the right to seek redress in the cus-
 tomary or modern courts, few do so from ignorance of the legal system, fear of social
 stigma, and fear of repudiation. Women's rights organizations report that prostitu-
 tion is often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave her hus-
 band.
 Despite the Consitittion's provisions for women's rights, the deep-seated tradi-
 tional belief in the submission of women to men results in discrimination in the po-
 litical process (see Section 3), and in education, employment, and property rights.
 Discrimination is worse in rural areas, where women do much of the subsistence
 farming as well as child rearing, water and wood gathering, and other chores. De-
 spite comprising 47 percent of the work force, women have made only modest in-
 reads in civil service and professional employment and remain underrepresented in
 these areas.
 Women's inferior legal status is evident, for example, in head of the household
 stats: a male head of household has certain legal rights; but divorced or widowed
 
 
 women, even with children, are not considered to be the heads of their households.
 In 1995 the Government considered a draft family code modeled on codes in other
 African Muslim countries intended to eliminate gender bias in inheritance rights,
 land tenure, and child custody, as well as end the practice of repudiation, which per-
 mits a husband to obtain an immediate divorce with no further responsibility for
 his wife or children. In June 1995, when Islamic associations condemned the draft
 code, the Government suspended discussions and has taken no further action, nor
 has the current legislature discussed the family code. Islamic militants reportedly
 threatened women who supported the code with physical harm.
 Children.-Although the Constitution provides that the State promote children's
 welfare, financial resources are extremely limited. Only about 25 percent of children
 of primary school age attend school, and about 60 percent of those finishing primary
 school are boys. The majority of young girls are kept at home to work and rarely
 attend school for more than a fewyears, resulting in a female literacy rate of 7 per-
 cent, versus 18 percent for males. Tradition among some ethnic gups allows young
 girls from rural families to enter marriage agreements on the basis of which girls
 are sent at the age of 10 or 12 to join their husband's family under the tutelage
 of their mother-in-law. There are credible reports of underage girls being drawn into
 prostitution, sometimes with the complicity of the family.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by several ethnic groups in the extreme western and far eastern areas of the coun-
 try. Clitoridectomy is the most common form of FGM. FGM is not illegal, but the
 Government is firmly engaged in an effort to eliminate the practice. The Govern-
 ment is working closely with a local NGO, United Nations Children's Fund, and
 other donors to develop and distribute educational materials at government clinics
 and maternal health centers.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution mandates that the State provide for
 people with disabilities. However, the Government has yet to implement regulations
 that call for accessibility to buildings and education for those with special needs. So-
 cietal discrimination against people with disabilities exists.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou,
 Kanouri, and Arab--continue to assert that the far more numerous Hausa and
 Djerma ethnic groups discriminate against them. The Djerma and Hausa dominate
 government and business. The Government has supported greater minority rep-
 resentation in the National Assembly and increased education and health care. It
 supports the April 1995 peace accord calling for special development efforts in the
 north where the Tuareg population is dominant. However, nomadic peoples, such as
 Tuaregs and many Fulani, continue to have less access to government services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides formal recognition of
 workers' longstanding right to establish and join trade unions. However, more than
 95 percent of the work force is employed in the nonunionized subsistence agricul-
 tural and small trading sectors.
 The National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN), a federation made up of 38
 unions, represents the majority of salary earners; most are government employees,
 such as civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned corporations. The
 USTN and the affiliated National Union of Nigerien Teachers (SNEN) profess politi-
 cal autonomy, but, like most unions, have informal ties to political parties. There
 is also a small breakaway union confederation, and independent teachers' and mag-
 istrates' unions.
 However, police, water, and forest worker unions, shut down by the Government
 in 1996 because of their "paramilitary nature," remain suspended. The customs
 workers union, suspended in 1996 for the same stated reason, was dissolved on
 March 24.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, except for security forces and po-
 lice. In March 1994, the National Assembly passed a strike law specifying that labor
 must give notice and begin negotiations before work is stopped; that pub ic workers
 must maintain a minimum level of service during a strike; that the Government can
 requisition workers to guarantee minimum service; and that striking public sector
 workers will not be paid for the time they are on strike. The latter condition already
 prevailed in the private sector.
 During 1997 labor continued to challenge the Government on various issues af-
 fecting workers. The USTN called many short strikes, generally of 1 to 3 days' dura-
 tion and unevenly observed, to support its demands for: Payment of several months'
 wage arrears; cancellation of salary reductions for civil servants and an increase in
 income tax rates; and an end to government plans to privatize several state enter-

 prises. The USTN also sought the release of several trade unionists arrested in
 M    hon charges of abotage (19 were released, 4 were sentenced from 2 months
 to 2 years in jail). Although these strikes failed to achieve all their objectives, they
 indicated that the iight to strike, within accepted procedures, is permitted. Teachers
 at the University of Niamey began an open-ended-strike on  October 22 (see Section
 2.a.) which was resolved by year's end.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance fr'om some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions such as the teachers union are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a basic framework ageement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, emplayers, and the Government, which defines all classes and
 categories of work, establishes basic conditions of work, and defines union activities.
 In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use their right to bargain col-
 lectively with management without government interference for wages over and
 above the statutory minimum as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collec-
 tive bargaining also exists in the public sector. However, since most organized work-
 ers, including teachers, are government employees, the Government is actually in-
 volved in most bargaining agreements. The USTN represents civil servants in bar-
 gaining with the Government, and labor/management agreements apply uniformly
 to all employees.
 The Labor Code is based on International Labor Organization principles; it pro-
 tects the right to organize and prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers.
 Labor unions reported no such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except for legally convicted prisoners. The Code does not spe-
 cifically prohibit forced or bonded abor by children. There were no reports of viola-
 tions.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor in nonindustrial enterprises is permitted by law under certain conditions.
 Children under the age of 14 must obtain special authorization to work, and those
 14 to 18 years of age are subject to limitation on hours (a maximum of 41/ hours
 per day) and types of employment (no industrial work) so that schooling may con-
 tinue. Minimum compulsory education is 6 years, but far fewer than half of school-
 age children complete 6 years of education.
 The law requires employers to ensure minimum sanitary working conditions for
 children. Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work. Forced or bonded
 labor by children is not specifically prohibited (see Section 6.c.). Ministry of Labor
 inspectors enforce child labor laws. Child labor is practically nonexistent in the for-
 mal (wage) sector, although children work in the unregulated agricultural, commcr-
 cial, and artisan sectors, and some, especially foreign youths, are hired in homes as
 general helpers and baby sitters for very low pay. Rural children (the majority) reg-
 ularly work with their families from a very early age-helping in the fields, pound-
 ing grain, tending animals, getting firewood and water, and other similar tasks.
 Some children are kept out of school to guide a blind relative on begging rounds.
 Others are sometimes employed by marabouts (Koranic teachers) to beg in the
 streets. There is no official regulation of this labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code establishes a minimum wage
 for salaried workers of each class and category within the formal sector. The lowest
 minimum is approximately $34 (20,500 cfa francs) per month. Additional salary is
 granted for each family member and for such working conditions as night shifts and
 required travel. Minimum wages are not sufficient to provide a decent living for
 workers and their families. Government salaries are substantially in arrears, which
 was a factor in stimulating the strike by teachers at the University of Niamey. Most
 households have multiple earners (largely informal commerce) and rely on the ex-
 tended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours with a minimum of one 24-hour rest period. How-
 ever, for certain occupations the Ministry of Labor authorizes longer workweeks-
 up to 72 hours. There were no reports of violations.
 The Labor Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards; Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors enforce these standards. Due to staff shortages, however,
 inspectors focus on safety violations only in the most dangerous industries: Mining;
 building; and manufacturing. Although generally satisfied with the safety equip-
 ment provided by employers, citing in particular adequate protection from radiation
 in the uranium mines, unions say workers should be better informed of the risks
 
 
 posed by their jobs. Workers have the right to remove themselves from hazardous
 conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
