 'HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 The Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, heads a three-party coalition Government which
 was formed alter the 1990 national elections.
 The state internal and external security services report directly to a minister
 without portfolio. The police are controlled by and are responsive to the Govern-
 ment. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms
 Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $4,064 mil
 lion. Defense budgets are failing to keep pace with inflation, resulting in a net de-
 caste in such exenditures.

 The Government continues to nurture the country's delicate transition from a
 state to a market economy. Hungary has attracted over half of all foreign invest-
 ment in Eastern Europe, and some three-fourths of its trade turnover is now with
 advanced industrial countries. However, its ivatization and liberalization pro-
 grams were accompanied by declining standa  of living, with a fourth of the popu-
 lation livin at or below the poverty line, and high unemployment, which exceeded
 11 percent gy the end of 1992.
 Human rights and civil liberties are provided for in the Constitution and sen-
 erally respected in practice. While the print media flourished, the lack of media leg-
 islation contributed to uncertainty over the status of state broadcast media. Efforts
 to enact appropriate legislation codifying their status foundered because the coali-
 tion Government and the opposition in Parliament disagreed fundamentally over
 the role of the broadcast media and the independence of its leadership.
 Rightwing ppulists, especially from the Prime Minister's party, the Hungarian
 Democratic Forum (MDF), exploited popular discontent with some of the negative
 effects of the Government's economic restructuring progam, such as rising unem-
 ployment and a higher cost of living. A notorious example of an antidemocratic and
 anti-Semitic outlook was Istvan Csurka's study in August. Caurka, at the time one
 of six vice presidents of the MDF, blamed Hungary's problems on a conspiracy of
 the Communist nomenklatura (ruling elite) allied with the liberal opposition to
 maintain power Jewish influence in the media and in the opposition, the
 debasement of Hungarian values, and the Prime Minister's ineffective leadership.
 The Prime Minister distanced himself and his Government from Csurka's views
 without repudiating them forcefully but has taken steps together with the party
 leadership to lessen Csurka's influence in the MDF. In December the MDF Presid-
 ium abolished the position of vice president in the party, with the result that
 Csurka and the other vice presidents lost their titles (although they all remain Pre-
 sidium members).
 Significant prejudice against the Gypsy population continued. There was an in-
 crease in physical attacks on Gypsies, Africans, and Arabs by 'skinheads." During
 the first half of the year, there were approximately 40 skinhead attacks against
 Gypsies and foreign students, 22 occurring in Budapest. It is estimated that police
 responded to only one-third of these attacks. The police, in an effort to ameliorate
 the situation, stepped up their patrols and sought to engage skinhead leaders in dia-
 log.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence that political
 killings occurred. However, in September a park ranger shot and killed two Gypsies
 for allegedly stealing pears from an orchard. A Gypsy Member of Parliament (M.P.)
 publicly questioned whether the ranger would have behaved in the same way if
 ypsies had not been involved. The ranger is currently under arrest, awaiting trial
 for homicide.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known instances of torture occurred. The press, however, regularly carried re-
 ports of police abuse against Gypsies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Upon arrest, suspects must be informed
 of the charges against them and may be held for a maximum of 72 hours before
 charges must be filed. It is a requirement, followed in practice, that persons be al-
 lowed access to counsel from the moment they are suspects undergoing questioning
 and throughout all subsequent proceedings. The authorities must specifically pro-
 vide counsel when a person is mentally handicapped, juvenile, or unable to afford
 counsel. There is no bail system; however, depending upon the nature of the crime,
 the accused may be released upon his or her own recognizance. Pretrial detention
 is based on a warrant issued by a judge and is limited to 1 year while criminal in-
 vestigations are in progress, after which the accused must be brought to trial or re-
 leased. There were no known instances of incommunicado detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible
 for the administration of justice, with the Supreme Court exercising policy control
 over the operations and judicature of all courts. There are three levels of courts in
 the current system. Original jurisdiction in most matters rests with the local courts.
 Appeals of their rulings may be made to county courts or to the Budapest Municipal
 Court, all of which also have original jurisdiction in some matters. The highest level
 of anoeal is the Suoreme Court. whose determination in nonconstitutional issues are.
 
 
 799
 binding. There is no jury system; hence, judges are the final arbiters. In the case
 of military trials, appeals also may be addressed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewinq the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it for review. The Courts 10 members are elected by
 Parliament to a 9.year term which may be renewed. (According to the law, the Con-
 stitutional Court is to be composed of 15 members; 10 have been elected to date,
 and the remaining 5 are scheduled to be seated by 1995.) No judge or member of
 the Supreme Court or the Constitutional Court may belong to a political party or
 engage in political activity.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and respected in practice.
 In some cases however, judges may agree to a closed trial if it is for the protection
 of the accused, such as in some rape cases. This is also true for military trials,
 which follow civil law and may be closed if state, service, or moral grounds justify
 a closed trial. In all cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are enti-
 tled to counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than ad-
 versarial in nature.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 current law, search warrants may be issued independently by the prosecutor's office.
 House searches must be carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A written in-
 ventory of items removed from the premises must be prepared. These provisions are
 observed in practice.
 According to the law, only the Minister of Justice has the authority to approve
 wiretapping for national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is provided for in the Con-
 stitution and is respected in practice. However, the Government's takeover of the
 budgets of the state-owned television and radio at the end of the year raised serious
 concerns about the freedom of the press from government control. A wide range of
 newspapers, magazines, and books are available in Budapevt, representing a broad
 spectrum ofpolitical opinion, and the press is not subject to censorship.
 There was one incident during 1992 of a government crackdown on a Budapest
 tabloid. When the weekly Heti Su per Pszt! published allegations on August 7 that
 the Foreign Minister had been a double agent during the Communist regime, the
 Government moved quickly to confiscate virtually all copies of the paper before it
 could be sold on the street, basing its action on the existing media law (dating from
 the Communist period) and charging that the article violated the personal rights of
 the Foreign Minister and discredited the Government. The Government also filed
 criminal  ares against the publisher.
 The case orSzent Korona, a weekly indicted in 1991 for incitement of anti-Semitic
 feelings, was still pending. A corollary action concluded in May when the Constitu-
 tional Court ruled on the validity of the law under which the newspaper was in-
 dicted. In an attempt to balance freedom of speech with protection of minorities, the
 Court stated that inciting hatred against nations, ethnic communities, or races wan
 an abuse of the freedom of spih;dowever, it noted that the law's provisions per-
 taining to punishment for disseminating demeaning statements were unconstitu-
 tional.
 A moratorium on the granting of licenses for radio and television stations has
 been in effect since the spring of 1990, due to Hungary's failure to enact media leg.
 islation. Several attempts at passage of media legislation were blocked by disagree-
 ment among political parties over who should have the authority to designate mem-
 bers of the radio and television office and appoint presidents and deputies at the
 state television and radio stations, with the opposition claiming that the draft laws
 would give the Government excessive control over the media.
 Hungarian radio (MR) and Hungarian television (MTV) enjoyed near monopoly
 status. There were two private commercial radio stations in Budsapeat and two other
 stations owned by private ivestors and the Government. Many Hungarans, espe-
 cially in Budapest, watched Western European programs on satellite television and
 cable. Several stations started broadcasting illegally.
 In another issue widely perceived as bearing u pon press freedom, the Prime Min-
 ister tried to remove the p residents of MTV and MR, purportedly for mismanage.
 ment, but President Arpad oncz twice refused to sign the orders for their dismis-
 sal. In December, ater a November 30 deadline for enactment of a media bill im-
 posed by the Constitutional Court passed without parliamentary action, a govern-
 ment investigatory committee suspended MTV     President Elemer Hankiss and
 launched criminal proceedings (for financial malfeasance) against two of his top
 aides. Also in December, Parliament approved, despite resistance in its own cultural
 
 
 800
 committee (which has responsibility for media legislation), a government initiative
 to transfer budgetary authority for MTV and MR from those entities to the office
 of the Prime Minister. Although the Government insists that this is nothing more
 than an effort to impose needed fiscal discipline upon the state media, the opposi-
 tion claims that the Government seeks the power to coerce or eliminate personnel
 and programs perceived as unfriendly to its interests. Opposition parliamentarians
 appealed this action to the Constitutional ourt, which, however, declined to rule
 until passage of the Government's budget. International organizations have ex-
 pressed concern over this apparent threat to freedom of soeech.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Peaceful public gatherings are
 essentially unrestricted. In general no permits are required for assembly except in
 cases when a public gatheringis planned near sensitive installations such as mili-
 tary facilities, embassies and key government buildings. Police may sometimes alter
 or revoke permits, but there is no evidence that this right is abused. Several mass
 demonstrations reflecting diverse political views took place in 1992, including those
 calling for immediate changes in the Government and in the state-run media.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Associations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Hungary is approximately 65 percent Roman Catholic;
 members of other faiths practice their religions freely. There is no officially pre-
 ferred religion, and religious affiliation carries no benefits or penalties. Religious
 groups may and do maintain international contacts. Religious orders and schools
 have regained property confiscated by the Communist regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement of Hungarian nationals within
 or outside Hungary, including the rights of emigration and repatriation. Emigration
 may be delayed, but not denied, for those who have significant court-assessed debts
 or who possess state secrets. Foreign students from countries not having a visa
 waiver agreement with Hungary must obtain exit visas every time they leave the
 country.
 The fighting, in the former Yugoslavia resulted in a continued flow of refugees into
 Hungary. While the exact tally changed from day to day, the Government estimated
 the total to be between 50,000 and 60,000, most of them in private housing. Despite
 its difficult economic situation, Hungaor provided basic food and housing assistance.
 Hungary is a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and to its 1967 Protocol but with a caveat that it will grant refugee status only to
 European nationals. Prospective refugees who only seek transit to Western Europe
 are encouraged to return to their countries of departure. Local and international
 human rights organizations and a Budapest local newspaper accused the Govern-
 ment of detaining aliens in unacceptable conditions for excessively lengthy periods
 at the detention center at Kerepestaresa, which is operated by the police. Illegal
 aliens, mostly non-European, are kept at the center pending their deportation or
 their qualification for resettlement in a third country by the local office of the Unit-
 ed Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCR). While the police seek the
 timely deportation of detainees who do not qualify for refugee status, a lack of funds
 and the detainees' lack of proper documentation, such as passports, often result in
 lengthy stays. Recognizing there was validity to the complaints from human rights
 groups, the Government allowed some detainees to leave the center on temporary
 passes. The detainees complained of inadequate food supplies, unsanitary facilities,
 and the lack of opportunity to qualify for refugee status. The UNHCR, however, vis-
 ited the camp regularly and stated that very few of the detainees met the definition
 of a refugee. Besides UNHCR, several organizations, including Inter-Faith Services,
 a religious group that operates a few refugee camps in southern Hungary, regularly
 visit the detainees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hungarians over the age of 18 have the right to change their government through
 national and local elections held everv 4 years. The Parliaments 386 members are
 elected through a complex formula of individual and party lists. The Prime Minister
 is the head of the largest party in Parliament, the Hungarian Democratic Forum
 (MDF). Currently, Hungary has a center-right coalition government, formed by the
 MDF, the Independent Smallholders Party, and the Christian Democratic People's
 Party. Three parties, ranging from left to center-right constitute an active opposition
 in Parliament. Several parties have been formed recently; however, only those that
 attract at least 4 percent of the vote in the 1994 elections may be represented in
 Parliament.
 
 
 801
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or the po-
 litical precess; 27 of 386 parliamentary deputies are women. There are few women
 in leadership positions in the Government or the political parties. Several minori-
 ties, including Germans, Gypsies, Croats, and Slovaks, are represented in Par-
 liament, as members of one party or another.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations operate in Hungary, including the Hungarian
 Helsinki Committee, the Wallenberg Association for Minority Rights, and the Hun-
 garian Human Rights League. The newest addition is the Martin Luther King Orga-
 nization, which was formed by the foreign student community in response to the
 growing incidence of racially motivated attacks. A 25-member parliamentary com-
 mittee for Human, Minority, and Religious Rights also considers human rights is-
 sues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution allows each minority group one parliamentary ombuds-
 man to speak for its ollective rights, this prevision has not yet been implemented.
 On the local level, minorities have the right to establish self-governing bodies, and
 minority candidates need only two-thirds of the minimum number of votes required
 of non-minority candidates for election to corresponding regional legislative bodies.
 A Minority Roundtable, at which all minorities are represented, negotiates with the
 Government over the content of prospective legislation on minorities. The Govern-
 ment established an Office for National and Ethnic Minorities (NEKH) in Septem-
 ber 1990 to address the needs of national and ethnic minorities.
 Gypsies constitute the largest minority group, officially estimated at between
 400,000 and 600,000 in a total population of 10.5 million. The second largest group
 are the 200,000 Germans, followed by 111,000 Slovaks, and 80,000 Jews. There are
 also Croatian, Romanian, Polish, Greek, Serbian, Slovene, Armenian, Ruthenian,
 and Bulgarian minorities.
 To varying degrees, education is available in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language printed media, and Hungarian Radio broadcasts 20-minute
 daily programs in the mother tongue of each nationality. Hungarian television car-
 ries a 20-minute program for each minority, complemented by 5-minute weekly
 news bulletins. Minority groups were dissatisfied with the broadcasting hours allot-
 ted them, complaining es  *ially about early afternoon time slots for such programs.
 Conditions of life within the Gypsy community are significantly poorer than
 among the general population. Gypsies tend to be considerably less educated, with
 lower than average incomes and life expectancy, and higher unemployment crime
 rates. The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Gypsy languages and
 cultural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. Nonetheless, wide-
 spread popular prejudice continues. The press regularly carries reports of police
 abuse against Gypsies. The Government has apparently made no significant attempt
 to investigate these reports. Gypsies are generally assumed to be untrustworthy and
 treated as such (see Section 1.a.). In one incident, following a longstanding feud be-
 tween a Gypsy family and non-Gypsy residents of a villag, the Gypsies' homes were
 tirebomb  one ni ht. Arrests were made in the case. Gypsies in at least one com-
 munity charged that local restaurants and clubs were usingskinhead bouncers to
 keep them out. Gypsies complained that skinheads followed them and made threats
 and occasionally attacked lone Gypsies. They said if Gypsies filed complaints, the
 courts acted as if the Gypsies were the perpetrators, not the victims. Anti-Gypsy
 graffiti proliferated.
 A founder of the Hungaan National Socialist Action Group, Istvan Gyorkos, and
 four other members of the neo-Nazi group were arrested in February and charged
 with inciting hatred against minorities and aliens, as well as illegal possession of
 weapons and ammunition. Gyorkos was convicted of incitement against the commu-
 nity and possession of illegal firearms. He received a 1-year suspended sentence.
 Three of the other four were convicted and were either med or given suspended jail
 sentences. Skinheads who harass or attack Gypsies and foreigners have generally
 been charged either with the crime of hooliganism or assault with intent to do seri-
 ous bodily harm. The Martin Luther King Organization claims that most skinheads
 are charced with hooliganism. The Government has criticized attacks on the Gypsy
 communty, but few perpetrators have been triedeand n seriously punished for such
 abuses.
 The Jewish community in Hungar, although the target of occasional anti-Semitic
 expression, is generally well assimilated. Jews are we represented in politics, the
 media, culture, and business. Many Hungarians. however, are concerned that, while
 
 
 802
 the Government does not actively condone anti-Semitic activities, prominent mem-
 bers within the Prime Minister's party, the MDF, have fueled anti-Semitic and anti-
 democratic sentiment with some of their writings. In particular, a study written by
 Istvan Csurka, at the time one of six vice presidents of the MDF, and published in
 August in his newspaper, Magyar Forum, created a furor with its antidemocratic
 and anti-Semitic outlook and language. In his analysis of the political scene Csurka
 alleged that, in an effort to maintain its political and economic power, the Com-
 munist nomenklatura, in which Jews were well placed, under cover of the liberal
 opposition parties, in which Jews also played leading roles, had joined an inter-
 national conspiracy to destroy the MDF. He accused President Arpad Goncz of tak-
 ing orders from the Communist reform Communist, liberal, and radical members
 of the nomenklatura influenced from Paris, New York, and Tel Aviv. He argued that
 the MDF must take radical measures against the nomenklatura and support "Hun-
 n values. He blamed many of the evils in society on the disadvantaged, cumu-
 latively disadvantaged strata, and groups in which the rigor of natural selection
 does not function.. and who have been living among us for far too long. He also
 suggested that, upon the expiration of the Yalta agreements in 1995 (sic, Hungar-
 ians would have the opportunity to reconsider the creation of an appropriate "living
 s pace" (ebenraum).
 In an August 31 speech to Parliament the Prime Minister disassociated himself
 and his Government from some of Ceurka's treatise asserting that it was full of
 misinterpretations and politically damaging proposals. The Cabinet also issued a
 statement rejecting "extremist political views a   policy of exclusion burdened by
 p~uieOpposition parties considered Antall's statement insufficient because it
 didnotconemnCurka's treatise forcefully, and they called for the Government
 to repudiate Csurka. A demonstration in support of democratic ideals and against
 rightwing extremism brought out tens of thousands of Hungarians in repudiation
 ofCsurka's views. Another MDF M.P. and member of the party presidium, Gyula
 Zacsek, published a newspaper essay in which he claimed that "former Communist,
 liberals, and Jews" had seized power in Hungary. Anti-Semitic graffiti became mre
 prevalent. The MDF has taken some steps aimed at reducing Csurka's influence, in-
 cluding elimination of the post of party vice president.
 Hungary experienced an increase in skned attacks agai  foreigners of color,
 including two African and Middle-Eastern diplomats. Skineads were arrested and
 charged with hooliganism in both cases. The Martin Luther King Organization
 claimed to have documented over 80 separate incidents agai the foreign student
 community. The police increased their patrols in areas where foreigners reside and
 met with some of the skinhead leaders in an at least partially successful effort to
 prevent further incidents. Successful prosecutions are usually for hooliganism and
 generally result in light or suspended sentences.
 Legally, women hav   e same rights as men, including identical inheritance and
 property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions is low. Women are heavily rep-
 resented in the judiciary and in the medical and teaching professions.
 Women's rights groups, still in their infancy, have nOt'ad a major impact on soci-
 etal attitudes. Groups, such as the Feminist Network, have become more active lob-
 byists with Parliament. While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported
 for cultural reasons. Similarly, police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse re-
 portedly are often unsympathetic.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A new Labor Code passed in 1992 recognizes the
 right of unions to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade uon plural-
 ism. Except for judicial and military personnel and the police, workers have the
 right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, openly promote
 members' interests and views, and go on strike. The 1992 legislation guarantees
 workers the right to strike, but strike action was limited during theyear and more
 often directed against government policies than those of employers. A separate law
 applicable to public sector workers was also passed in 1992. Under this law, public
 servants may negotiate working conditions, but the fina decision on increasing sala-
 ries rests with Parliament. There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with
 international organizations, and unions have developed a wide range of ties with
 European and international trade union bodies.
 The trade union movement is characterized by a conflict among the independent
 unions, led by the Democratic League of Independent Unions (LIGA), the Federation
 of Workers' Councils, and the Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions (MSzOSz),
 the successor to the former monolithic Communist union. MSzOSz had challenged
 the constitutionality of a 1991 law that called for a complete accounting of trade
 
 
 803
 union assets. In September the Constitutional Court ruled against MSzOSz, and the
 Interest Reconciliation Council (IRC), a forum for tripartite consultation among rep-
 resentatives from the employers, employees, and the Government, aeed on a for.
 mula for the division of trade union assets which was presented to the Government
 for approval. The assets of the old Communist labor confederation would be divided,
 with approximately 40 percent going to MSzOSz, 36 percent to the LIGA, 20 percent
 to autonomous unions, and 5 percent to other unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The 1992 Labor Code permits
 collective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, and it exists. Minimum
 wage levels are set by the IRC, and hiher levels (but not lower ones) may be nego-
 tited at the plant level between individual trade unions and management. By
 agreement, the legal minimum wage is centrally negotiated at the lRC to control
 the rate of' inflation. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for drafting labor-related
 legislation, while special labor courts enforce labor laws. The decisions of these
 courts may be appealed to the civil court system. Under the new legislation, employ-
 ers are prohibited from discriminating against unions and their organizers. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibitin of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited b, law, which is enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 d. Minimum Agefor Employment of Children.-Labor courts enforce the minimum
 employment age of 16 years, with exceptions for apprentice programs, which may
 begin at 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of this statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The leal minimum wage is established by the
 IRC and subsequently implemented by Mimistry of Labor decree. The current mini-
 mum wage is insufficient to provide an adequate living for workers and their fami-
 lies. Many Hungarians, therefore, supplement their primary employment with sec-
 ond jobs.
 Th~e 1992 Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termi-
 nation procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights
 in some management decisions, annual andsick leave entitlements, and labor con-
 flict resolution procedures. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of this legislation.
 Under the new Code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; it may vary, however,
 depending upon the nature of the industry. Labor courts and the Ministry of Labor
 enforce occupational safety standards set by the Government, but specific safety
 conditions are not always up to internationally acepted standards.
