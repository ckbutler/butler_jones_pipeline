 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the major political
 forces. The NDP commands a large majority in Parliament, but
 opposition parties play an important role by criticizing
 government policies and performance. The Cabinet is headed by
 a Prime Minister responsible to the President. The
 parliamentary institutions are the People's Assembly and the
 Shura (consultative) Council.
 Vice President under Sadat, Hosni Mubarak was elected
 President by the People's Assembly in 1981 following Sadat's
 assassination; his election was affirmed by referendum in.
 accordance with the Constitution. The next presidential
 election is due in October 1987. In People's Assembly
 elections in May 1984, the NDP won 391 of 448 elected seats,
 while the centrist opposition New Wafd Party won 57 seats.
 President Mubarak exercised his discretionary power to appoint
 several members of two other opposition parties to the
 Assembly. The governmental and legal systems are based on
 Egypt's Muslim and Arab heritage, as well as the experience of
 the 1952 revolution. Western influences are also present,
 reflected in the country's Napoleonic legal code.
 The state of emergency proclaimed after Sadat's assassination
 has been maintained through extensions decreed by President
 Mubarak, with the approval of the People's Assembly. Under
 it, the President and his delegate, the Minister of Interior,
 can suspend certain constitutional and legal safeguards
 normally associated with the protection of civil and political
 liberties. Since Zaki Badr became Minister of Interior
 following the February police riots, the Government has used
 its emergency powers against striking railroad conductors,
 Islamic militants, and a few Christian converts from Islam.
 Islamic activists who are pressing for political and social
 change are, by and large, able to pursue their cause through
 legitimate channels such as the People's Assembly, the
 judiciary, and the press without fear of government
 retribution. Opposition parties of the left and the right
 function legally, and their influence is particularly felt
 through their weekly newspapers. The opposition parties
 boycotted elections held in October for the Shura Council, the
 advisory upper house of the Parliament, claiming that the
 electoral system of proportional representation provided the
 NDP with an unfair advantage. Several opposition leaders,
 however, subsequently accepted presidential appointments to
 the Shura Council.
 The Government has continued to give priority to economic
 development and liberalization while continuing its policy of
 trying to maintain living standards. This policy has depended
 on a massive subsidy system that in fiscal year 1985-86 cost
 an estimated $3 billion--about 10 percent of total government
 expenditures. In an effort to develop solutions to its
 economic difficulties, the Government has pursued economic
 reform measures and cooperated with international financial
 institutions.
 Egypt's human rights record in 1986 reflected increased
 security concerns resulting from its difficult economic
 situation and regional instability. President Mubarak's
 continuing commitment to political liberalization was evident
 in his public statements on domestic affairs in which he
 stressed the importance of tolerating press criticism and
 
 
 1131
 EGYPT
 developing a responsible opposition. Egyptians and other
 observers generally credited the President in 1986 for
 protecting press freedoms and promoting greater freedom of
 political expression. Some government restrictions on
 political activities and dissent remained, however. While
 some members of the Christian minority were concerned by the
 potential threat to their rights posed by resurgent Islamic
 forces, the Government has generally demonstrated its
 commitment to protecting minority rights. Coptic Pope
 Shenouda III has indicated-that his relations with the
 authorities are good. Reports of draft legislation applying
 strict penalties to apostasy concerned members of the small
 Baha'i community, but the legislation is currently stalled in
 committee. Legal action reportedly was still pending in the
 case of 41 members of the Baha'i faith who were detained and
 released in February 1985. The Bahais were charged under a
 law, existing since Nasser, banning public (though not
 private) Bahai religious activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings for
 political reasons.
 Police conscripts of the Central Security Forces rioted for
 3 days in February, burning hotels and nightclubs near the
 pyramids, destroying cars and other property, and clashing with
 the army. Officially about 70 persons died--most of them
 police conscripts killed by the army--but unofficial estimates
 have been considerably higher. One 73-year-old Danish tourist
 died when the hotel where she was staying burned down. Elite
 units of the army were able to restore order with widespread
 public support, and over 3,000 conscripts were arrested.
 Although the rioting spread from Cairo to a few other areas,
 there is no convincing evidence of a plot. Rather, it appears
 the rampage was caused by the bad living conditions of the
 conscripts and rumors that their term of service would be
 extended by 1 year. As of the end of the year, the courts had
 postponed hearing the cases of 675 conscripts and 31 civilians
 who are to stand trial for the riots. The President appointed
 a new Minister of Interior and announced that steps would be
 taken to improve the lot of the security police.
 A group of unknown assailants attacked a car full of Israeli
 embassy employees leaving the Cairo fairgrounds on March 19.
 One Israeli woman was killed, and her three colleagues were
 wounded. A group calling itself "Egypt's Revolution" claimed
 responsibility for the attack. "Egypt's Revolution" had also
 taken responsibility for a failed attack on an Israeli embassy
 employee in 1984 and the murder of an Israeli diplomat in
 August 1985. At year's end, the cases were still unsolved,
 but the investigation was continuing. "Egypt's Revolution"
 also claimed responsibility for the hijacking to Malta of an
 Egypt Air jet in November 1985 which resulted in the death of
 over 60 passengers. In October Interior Minister Badr
 reiterated earlier official denials of the organization's
 existence.
 
 
 1132
 EGYPT
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are forbidden by the Constitution and by law.
 Persons claiming to have been tortured have redress in the
 courts, which have awarded financial compensation to various
 torture victims. Information gained through torture is not
 admissible in court. The law provides that police and security
 officials convicted of torture are subject to punishment, and a
 major case against alleged offenders is under way. In the
 past, reported cases of officials being penalized have been
 rare. On occasion, detainees and prisoners have claimed that
 they were tortured and have appealed for redress to the courts
 or the public prosecutor. These appeals, which generally led
 to investigations by legal and medical authorities, sometimes
 concluded with the Government's denial of the alleged torture.
 More often, the Government has not revealed the findings of
 the investigations.
 In November 1984, the public prosecutor initiated a major
 investigation of torture incidents disclosed by the Supreme
 State Security Court in the Al-Jihad case that ended in
 September 1983. The court had cited torture as a factor in
 its decision to acquit 190 out of 300 Al-Jihad defendants and
 reduce prison sentences for others. According to the
 opposition press, former Interior Ministers and still active
 senior police officers were among the many security officials
 suspected of involvement in the torture. In September 1986,
 the prosecutor announced that torture charges against 44 police
 officers of various ranks and 4 court assistants would be
 referred to criminal court. The prosecutor declared that, on
 the basis of 422 reports of torture of the Al-Jihad defendants,
 28 torture charges would be brought against the accused police
 officers, while 22 other charges would continue to be
 investigated. The prosecutor noted that evidence against the
 police was based on both eyewitness accounts and the report of
 the court physician. If convicted, the accused officers could
 face sentences of between 3 to 10 years of hard labor or
 imprisonment. The leftist opposition paper Al-Shaab reported
 on September 16 that the Minister of Interior and other
 ministry officials had met with the accused officers, who
 insisted that they had engaged in torture at the express order
 of their superiors.
 Allegations of torture have appeared periodically in the
 opposition press, especially after the arrests of persons
 belonging to Islamic organizations who were allegedly involved
 in burning a number of Cairo video clubs and liquor stores in
 late June. The opposition newspaper Al-Wafd has accused
 Interior Minister Badr of reinstituting torture against
 Islamic activists. Al-Wafd has published photographs of the
 scarred bodies of Islamic activists and asserted that the
 scars were caused by torture inflicted in Egyptian jails and
 prisons. The Egyptian Bar Association's Committee for the
 Defense of Freedom has also charged the security services with
 using torture against the defendants in the video club cases.
 Al-Wafd reported on September 18 that police in Alexandria had
 beaten a prisoner to death. Although the police maintain that
 the man died by jumping from a balcony in an escape attempt,
 
 
 1133
 EGYPT
 other reports indicated that the man was beaten to death
 inside the police station.
 In a special report, "Egypt: Evidence of Torture 1981-1983"
 (originally published in March 1985 and reissued in August
 1985, together with a memorandum from the Egyptian Government,
 under the title "Torture in Egypt 1981-1983: Amnesty
 International's Evidence and the Government's Response"),
 Amnesty International reviewed medical authorities' forensic
 records on torture victims and found a "disturbing and
 consistent pattern of torture or ill-treatment of political
 detainees," including Islamic militants linked to the Ai-Jihad
 organization, and some left-wing elements. The report
 mentioned Cairo's Citadel prison as a reputed site of torture
 activities. This prison was subsequently closed.
 Prison conditions and treatment vary considerably; some
 facilities appear to be overcrowded and lacking adequate
 medical and sanitary facilities. Tora prison, in which the
 Al-Jihad convicts are imprisoned, has a particularly bad
 reputation. Other prisons, however, provide better living
 conditions and offer inmates recreational programs and
 vocational training.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile are forbidden by law.
 Two systems of criminal procedure are in effect: ordinary
 criminal procedures and the emergency law. Under ordinary
 procedures, arrests follow investigations, and arrested
 persons are charged with violations of specific laws. With
 some exceptions, preventive detention is not practiced.
 Arrested persons have the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention, and there is a system of bail. The
 ordinary law states that a detained suspect must be brought
 before a magistrate and formally charged within 48 hours of
 his arrest or else released. By and large, there is careful
 observance of constitutional and legal safeguards in the arrest
 and pretrial custody stages. Arrests occur openly and with
 warrants, and the accused are brought before an independent
 judiciary. The Government does not appear to practice
 incommunicado detention.
 The major exceptions to the normal procedures arise when the
 emergency law, which gives the Government extraordinary
 powers, is applied. The Constitution and the Emergency Law of
 1958, as amended, empower the President, when security or
 public order are in peril, to invoke emergency powers
 authorizing the arrest and detention of persons suspected of
 being dangerous to state security, irrespective of provisions
 of the penal code. These persons must be charged. Egyptian
 law specifies a wide range of offenses deemed harmful to
 national security which may be tried before a parallel system
 of state security courts under the emergency law. Despite
 opposition complaints and hints from the Government that the
 law would be abolished, the NDP majority in the People's
 Assembly has repeatedly extended the law--most recently in
 April 1986 for a 2-year period. Under the emergency law a
 person may be held indefinitely for renewable 30-day periods,
 provided the executive is willing to override any judicial
 findings to the contrary. After each 30-day interval, the
 detainee is allowed to petition the state security courts for
 release. If the court approves the petition, the President or
 the Minister of Interior may exercise a veto over the decision
 and keep the detainee in custody for another 30 days. Another
 
 
 1134
 EGYPT
 circuit of the state security courts then reviews the case.
 Amendments to the emergency law in 1982 expanded the detainees'
 rights of appeal and provided for prompt redress, including
 judicial review, against improper treatment.
 The emergency law was invoked selectively in 1986 against
 members of banned leftist organizations, striking train
 conductors, Christian converts, and suspected Islamic
 extremists; the ordinary rules for arrest, trial, and detention
 continued to be applied in all other instances. A number of
 striking train conductors were arrested under the emergency law
 after a nation-wide wildcat strike in July. The State Security
 Court ordered their release pending further hearings in
 October, and they were subsequently reinstated in their jobs.
 Six Egyptian Christian converts were arrested early in the year
 on the grounds that their activities constituted a threat to
 national unity. They were released in August when the State
 Security Court determined that no specific law prohibited
 conversion from Islam. Two Tunisian and two Moroccan Christian
 converts were also arrested in April while they were attending
 a church leadership training program in Alexandria, again on
 the grounds that they constituted a threat to domestic
 security. They were subsequently released and allowed to
 leave the country. There were numerous arrests of Islamic
 activists after the burning of video clubs in June, although
 many were subsequently released. According to press reports,
 the number of detainees currently held under the emergency law
 is probably around 80.
 There have been no reports of the use of forced labor, which
 is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law provides for public trial and equal treatment
 before the law, and these legal safeguards are generally
 observed. However, provisions for public trials do not apply
 in state security cases. Persons accused of these offenses,
 which may trigger emergency law provisions at the Minister of
 Interior's discretion, are usually tried in closed session in
 the state security courts. These courts handled various
 sensitive cases in 1986, at which all defendants were present
 and represented by lawyers actively defending them. State
 security courts are conducting hearings in the cases of the
 train conductors who went on strike in July and the central
 security police conscripts who rioted in February. Civilians
 arrested for certain crimes may be tried in military tribunals
 as well as state security courts.
 No public statistics are available on the number of persons
 serving prison sentences (as opposed to detainees on trial or
 awaiting prosecution) for acts of violent protest or for
 membership in proscribed organizations espousing terrorism or
 the violent overthrow of the State. However, based on the
 convictions in the Al-Jihad proceedings as well as reports of
 trials in the opposition press, the number may reach 150 to
 200. The conviction and sentencing of other nonviolent
 dissenters appear to occur rarely, if at all. The emergency
 law provides ample authority to detain without trial people
 believed to be planning violent acts against the Government.
 Under Mubarak the judiciary has enjoyed an unprecedented degree
 of independence. Certain officials who investigate the
 propriety of police charges against suspects have been given
 judicial immunity to protect them from police pressure. The
 
 
 1135
 EGYPT
 High Judicial Council, which Nasser dissolved but which was
 later reinstated, is empowered to override decisions by the
 Ministry of Justice regarding judicial appointments,
 promotions, and other personnel matters. The Council of
 State, a court system having jurisdiction over disputes
 between private citizens and government agencies, is
 independent of the Ministry of Justice, and the Council is
 effectively safeguarded against arbitrary dismissal of its
 members.
 In 1986 the courts continued to demonstrate their autonomy.
 There have been numerous reports in the opposition press of
 courts ordering the release of Islamic activists, although the
 Minister of Interior has often rejected the rulings. Under the
 terms of the emergency law, the Minister of Interior, by the
 authority of the President, may reject a court order to release
 defendants in state security cases. In October a judge ordered
 the release without bail of the deputy editor of Al-Wafd
 newspaper, who was accused of soliciting a substantial bribe,
 reportedly because the prosecution had failed to submit its
 report to the court within the 24 hours required by law.
 Courts also ordered the release of the striking train
 conductors and the members of the Al-Jihad organization who
 were arrested after holding public prayers in Cairo's Abdeen
 Square on a religious holiday.
 Two judicial institutions criticized by the opposition and
 others as superfluous and potentially dangerous to the
 judicial system are the Court of Ethics and its investigating
 agency, the Office of the Socialist Public Prosecutor. Created
 in 1980, the court is charged with trying offenders of
 "Socialist values." In 1986 the court continued its recent
 focus on cases of corruption and illegal business activities.
 The Office of the Socialist Public Prosecutor functions as
 investigator and prosecutor for the Court of Ethics. Its
 other tasks include approving candidates for elective positions
 in the trade union movement and performing security checks on
 appointees to senior government positions.
 Article 2 of the Constitution states that Islamic jurisprudence
 is the principal source of law. However, literal application
 of Islamic law is limited to the Family Status Courts, which
 have jurisdiction over such matters as divorce and inheritance
 for Muslims. In addition to Islamic law, these courts apply
 the codes of other religions in family matters if the parties
 are non-Muslim. In May 1985, the People's Assembly debated
 proposals for the implementation of the Shari'a (Islamic law)
 and voted by a large majority to conduct a law by law review
 of all statutes in order to change those conflicting with
 Islamic law, The review process is expected to require years
 to cofplete.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference in private life by the
 State or by political organizations is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. Except when the emergency law is applied,
 police must obtain a warrant from the State Security
 Prosecutor before undertaking arrests, searches, or seizures.
 The warrant need not specify the material being sought in a
 search, and the material seized can be presented as evidence
 during trials. On occasion, the courts have dismissed cases
 when they determined warrants to have been issued without
 sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches
 
 
 1136
 EGYPT
 without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties, but
 there were no reports that officials were punished for this
 offense in 1986.
 The emergency law empowers the President to authorize searches
 of individuals or premises without following normal penal code
 procedures. In the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in 1981,
 a few reports in the opposition press have referred to
 warrantless searches in connection with investigations of
 extremist organizations, both Islamic and leftist.
 The opposition press reported in 1986 that the security
 services had obtained new equipment to expand their capability
 to monitor telephone conversations of opposition figures and
 Islamic activists. However, monitoring of correspondence or
 telephones appears to take place only with the legally required
 prior authorization of the State Security Prosecutor.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.
 The Government's respect for these freedoms is reflected in the
 lively debate of national issues and criticism of government
 officials in the media. Considerable debate appears in the
 so-called "national press"--the major government-owned dailies
 and news magazines--but the weekly opposition party newspapers
 and publications of Islamic groups are especially critical.
 Although the emergency law can be used to ban publications,
 the Government under Mubarak has not invoked it for this
 purpose.
 There is a widely held view, which extends to opposition
 circles, that the Egyptian press has never been freer.
 Egyptian editors appear to exercise less and less control over
 journalists and columnists, to the extent that columnists for
 the same newspaper have begun to attack each other in their
 columns. The opposition papers are free to publish whatever
 stories support the political inclinations of their sponsoring
 organizations, with little regard for the factual bases of
 these stories. Journalists and other individuals slandered or
 maligned in the press may sue in court or, in the case of
 journalists, raise the matter with the press syndicate. By
 virtue of their positions, the President and members of the
 People's Assembly and the Shura Council may not sue for libel.
 Nonetheless, the Government occasionally exercises influence
 on the government-owned dailies and magazines, whose editors
 in chief are appointed and can be dismissed by the
 NDP-dominated Shura Council. The Council theoretically
 supervises the press to some extent through the Government's
 ownership of the major nonparty newspapers and magazines and
 through the Higher Press Council.
 The latter, a 45-member body chaired by the Speaker of the
 Shura Council and composed of senior press figures, is not
 designed to facilitate press censorship, nor does it appear to
 be a very active body. One of the Higher Press Council's
 functions, however, is to approve applications for new
 publications; on a few occasions applications to publish
 independently owned journals have been rejected or delayed for
 lengthy periods. This approval, however, is required only for
 publications appearing regularly on a set schedule. Items
 
 
 1137
 EGYPT
 appearing irregularly are published without the Council's
 certification.
 Overt censorship does not exist. Nevertheless, journalists
 and editors working for the government-supported newspapers
 are occasionally "guided" by officials about the treatment of
 specific issues. Government guidance, when exercised, is given
 informally to senior editors and board chairmen by senior
 officials such as the Minister of Information. This does not
 happen often; usually the editors know the policy and are aware
 of the limits which they are expected to observe. The
 Government does not give such "guidance" to the opposition
 press. Since Mubarak assumed the presidency, there have been
 no confirmed reports of government action to silence press
 critics. Press coverage of the arrests of Islamic extremists
 and other sensitive topics during the year was not censored.
 No journalists have been arrested on political grounds,
 although many observers regard the bribery charges leveled
 against the deputy editor of the opposition Al-Wafd newspaper
 to be politically motivated harassment. In October the
 prosecutor created a furor by turning this case over to the
 Higher State Security Court and seeking a life sentence with
 hard labor for the defendants. The courts overturned an
 attempt to confiscate an edition of an opposition newspaper in
 1984. No attempt at confiscation was made in 1985 or 1986.
 Two of the five Muslim and Coptic religious publications
 suspended by the Sadat government in 1981 have yet to reappear,
 despite a 1982 court decision canceling the suspensions. The
 two publications are the Muslim Brotherhood's AI-Dawa and the
 Coptic Al-Kiraza Al-Murqusiya.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in both Arabic and
 other languages is readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can place limitations
 on the constitutionally guaranteed right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Interior Ministry to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 Despite this emergency authority to restrict gatherings of
 government opponents, the Government has allowed opposition
 parties to hold numerous meetings and rallies, usually
 stipulating that they be held indoors. The Interior Ministry
 allowed Islamic organizations to organize Greater Bayram
 prayers in specified areas in September 1986, but denied
 Islamic activists access to Abdeen Square in Cairo. Most of
 the gatherings proceeded peacefully and without interference,
 but some members of the Al-Jihad organization defied the ban
 on gathering in Abdeen Square and were arrested.
 Professional associations, in particular the bar association
 and the press syndicate, criticize government policies in
 their pronouncements and occasionally sponsor protest
 activities. The associations operate largely free of
 government interference. In the most recent elections for the
 governing boards of the bar association and the commerce and
 engineers syndicate, the balloting was fair and competitive,
 with no intervention by the authorities.
 There are no restrictions on workers' freedom to organize, and
 about 20 to 25 percent of the work force are unionized. Every
 50 workers in a given activity can form a committee, which
 operates as a local union. These locals are affiliated with
 national unions, all 23 of which are required to affiliate
 
 
 1138
 EGYPT
 with the sole labor federation, the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF). There have been complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that requiring all
 unions to join a single national federation infringed upon
 workers' right of freedom of association. In response to these
 complaints, the Government established a commission to study
 the possibility of amending the labor laws to bring them into
 conformity with the ILO conventions on freedom of association.
 Although there was considerable public discussion in 1986
 about reforming the labor law, the debate largely focused on
 issues unrelated to the ILO.
 The trade unions' principal function is to defend their
 membership's rights in dealing with management on such issues
 as wages and working conditions. Labor groups pursue these
 issues with considerable freedom. However, there are
 restrictions. Setting wages through collective bargaining is
 not permitted. Instead, management consults closely with
 unions in fixing wages. The labor code also provides for a
 system of arbitration to resolve wage and working condition
 issues, but omits any reference to the right to strike. The
 law of national unity prohibits strikes that threaten the
 national economy; the striking train conductors were arrested
 under this provision. In practice, strikes are discouraged by
 both government and trade union leaders.
 The Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) adheres to the
 principle of nonmembership in international labor
 organizations, except for the Organization of African Trade
 Unity, the Arab Labor Organization, and the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions. However, the latter
 suspended Egypt's membership in 1978 in response to the Camp
 David accords, as did the Arab Labor Organization in 1979.
 Despite the ETUF's prohibition, some individual unions have
 affiliated with international trade union organizations. The
 ETUF itself has signed various international trade union
 agreements, one of them with the AFL-CIO. There appear to be
 no restrictions on the international affiliations of
 professional associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 guarantees freedom of religious expression and equality before
 the law regardless of religion. Egypt has a tradition of
 religious toleration, and the authorities generally uphold the
 rights of religious minorities. Islam and Coptic Christianity
 are the two major religions. While most Egyptian Jews
 emigrated many years ago, those few who remain appear to
 practice their faith without restriction or harassment.
 Synagogues and churches are routinely provided police
 protection. Various Protestant sects operate, some with
 significant Egyptian membership, while others have a small
 following, largely among expatriates. All organized religions
 which are recognized may maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad. Those who engage in proselytizing Muslim Egyptians
 may be prosecuted for "despising a heavenly religion" (Article
 98f of the penal code) or under the broad terms of the law of
 national unity, even though missionary work is not specifically
 banned. Conversion from Islam, while officially not restricted
 or penalized, is discouraged by the Government. Conversion to
 Islam or between Christian denominations is unaffected.
 
 
 1139
 EGYPT
 In February 1985, the Government arrested 41 adherents of the
 Baha'i faith, which is not considered a recognized religion
 but apostasy from Islam; within a week those arrested were
 reportedly all released. The press later reported that the
 State Security Prosecutor had declined to try the Baha'is
 because their ostensible offense, belonging to an apostate
 religion, is not a crime under Egypt's penal code; instead, he
 transferred the case to another court for prosecution under
 statutes forbidding the use of religion to promote seditious
 ideas and for the violation of a 1960 law outlawing organized
 activities by Baha'is. As of the end of 1986, the court had
 not ruled on the charges.
 In January three Egyptian sisters and the husband of one of
 them, all four Protestant converts from Islam, were arrested.
 Two more Egyptian Protestant converts from Islam, a 56-year
 old man and his daughter, were also arrested. All six were
 held under the emergency law and accused of "despising Islam."
 On August 11, in response to defense arguments that existing
 law did not prohibit conversion from Islam, the court ruled
 for their release; the Minister of Interior did not contest
 the decision. The Islamic opposition newspaper Al-Nur
 subsequently urged the People's Assembly to pass a law
 prohibiting conversion from Islam, claiming that apostasy
 should be treated as seriously as treason.
 Two Moroccan and two Tunisian Christian converts were arrested
 in Alexandria in April while attending a church leadership
 training seminar organized by the Campus Crusade for Christ.
 They were subsequently transferred to Tora prison near Cairo.
 The emergency law was applied to these arrests, and the charges
 were based on the law of national unity. After several
 appeals, the court released them in October to the custody of
 the Ministry of Interior, and they were allowed to leave the
 country.
 In March draft legislation that would impose the penalty of
 life imprisonment with hard labor or the death sentence on
 anyone promoting apostate views was proposed in a committee of
 the People's Assembly. The original proposal was later changed
 to provide for punishment of persons who claim to prophesy or
 who attribute prophecy to someone else. Although the proposed
 law did not refer directly to any group, the apparent targets
 of the legislation were members of Egypt's small Baha'i
 community and the small Mahdist sect, whose leader claims to
 be a prophet. Since Muhammad's status as the "seal of the
 prophets" is a fundamental Islamic tenet, subsequent claims to
 prophecy are viewed by some Muslims as apostasy. This draft
 legislation has not been approved by the NDP leadership in the
 Assembly, and remains stalled in committee.
 All faiths can, in principle, establish places of worship, run
 schools, and train enough clergy to serve believers. Under a
 law dating back to the Ottoman era, non-Muslims must obtain
 numerous official permits, not required of Muslims, to build
 places of worship. Obtaining authorization can take years.
 Permits are not required for the restoration of existing
 churches but are needed to enlarge the structures.
 Coptic Christians, the most significant indigenous religious
 minority, constitute an estimated 10 percent of the population.
 Copts work in all career fields, occupying many leadership
 positions in the business and professional communities. Copts
 seem by and large to enjoy equal access with Muslims to public
 employment, although there appear to be instances of
 
 
 1140
 EGYPT
 discrimination. They are not strongly represented at the
 highest levels of government; 2 of 33 cabinet ministers and
 9 of 458 People's Assembly deputies are Copts. Copts seldom
 advance to the senior ranks of the military.
 University officials have denied allegations that general
 admissions procedures were revised in the fall of 1984 in
 order to discriminate against Copts. Allegations of anti-Copt
 discrimination in admissions to some fields of medical study
 are still heard. There are also reports that the universities
 effectively block Coptic professors from becoming chairmen of
 certain departments and administrators. The Government has
 denied a request to establish a Coptic university.
 Though Copts face prejudice and isolated acts of discrimination
 from some Muslims, there is no evidence that these acts are
 officially inspired. President Mubarak has emphasized
 publicly the full equality of Copts and other religious
 minorities. The courts' application of Islamic law to family
 matters in the Muslim community (marriage, inheritance,
 personal property)--and the Islamic influences elsewhere in
 the legal system--have not affected the constitutionally
 guaranteed freedoms of Copts and other minorities.
 Since reaching a peak in the period preceding Sadat's
 assassination, reports of persecution and physical attacks on
 Copts by Islamic extremists have sharply diminished. The
 Government, however, continues to take precautions, such as
 posting security forces near Coptic churches. In an October
 1985 interview with Al-Ahram, Pope Shenouda praised the spirit
 of national unity prevailing among Egyptians and said that
 "sectarian violence" is an expression alien to Egypt. His
 publicly stated view that Muslim-Copt relations have improved
 greatly appears to be widely shared in Coptic circles.
 Political activity along religious lines is forbidden, and
 various Islamic and Coptic societies are legally proscribed.
 Although the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is technically banned,
 its activities are tolerated so long as they do not threaten
 state security or foster sectarian tensions. In the May 1984
 elections to the People's Assembly, eight MB adherents were
 elected on the New Wafd Party's slate; in May 1985, the courts
 ruled that mere membership in the MB is not a criminal offense.
 The MB has a lawsuit pending, seeking restoration of its legal
 status. Following its short-lived alliance with the New Wafd,
 the MB has flirted with other opposition groups and proposed
 its own political organization.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction.
 Although the Government maintains that sermons by Islamic and
 Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim prayer
 leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for
 delivering allegedly inflammatory declarations in their
 mosques. The Ministry of Awqaf (religious endowments) has
 also been known to substitute imams for troublesome preachers
 at mosques under its control as well as to take over the
 administration of some privately run mosques considered to be
 the centers of antigovernment activity.
 Pope Shenouda III, whose recognition as Coptic Orthodox
 Patriarch was revoked by the Government in 1981, remained in
 government-enforced seclusion (internal exile) for over
 3 years until his release by presidential decree on January 1,
 
 
 1141
 EGYPT
 1985. There appear to be no conditions attached to his return
 to public life and full papal responsibilities. In 1986 he
 traveled to Alexandria and maintained contact freely with his
 principal dioceses. Elections postponed by the Pope's
 seclusion were held in April 1985 for the Coptic Melli Council,
 a 24-member lay body that oversees some church administrative
 matters.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are guaranteed freedom of movement except in well-
 defined military districts; there are additional restricted
 areas to which foreigners may not travel. Except for
 limitations affecting males who have not completed compulsory
 military service and restrictions imposed under the state of
 emergency, freedom of foreign travel and emigration is
 guaranteed. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return. Some who left for political reasons have returned
 since President Mubarak assumed office. There are no known
 cases of citizenship being revoked for political reasons.
 Under the state of emergency, the Prime Minister has authority,
 which he may delegate to the Interior Minister, to restrict
 foreign or domestic travel. The opposition has alleged that
 this emergency authority has been used to prevent suspected
 Islamic militants from leaving the country. According to an
 Interior Ministry statement of April 1985, fewer than 500
 persons were subject to travel restrictions (in contrast to
 45,000 in the Nasser era). All restrictions were imposed by
 judicial order in accordance with penal code provisions and
 most of the persons had criminal cases pending. The situation
 appears to have remained materially unchanged in 1986.
 Egypt has a liberal policy on political asylum, and the
 extradition of political refugees is prohibited by law. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has commended
 Egypt for contributing to refugee relief by allowing about 500
 school-age African refugees to enter Egypt temporarily and
 attend school for nominal fees while awaiting resettlement
 elsewhere. In September 1985, the Interior Minister testified
 to People's Assembly committees that there were 3,000 political
 refugees from other Arab countries in Egypt. Sudanese
 officials have sought the extradition of former Sudanese
 President Jaafar Nimeiri from Egypt and have challenged his
 refugee status in the Egyptian courts, thus far unsuccessfully.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Egypt's political system is characterized by a strong
 presidency. The President heads the National Democratic Party
 (NDP), which wields a substantial majority in the People's
 Assembly, but a number of opposition parties are allowed to
 organize, publish their views, and, in some cases, represent
 their followers in the People's Assembly and on the local
 level.
 The largest and most influential of the five legally formed
 opposition parties is the New Wafd, a revival of the Wafd, one
 of the major political parties before the 1952 revolution.
 The New Wafd resumed activity in 1983, following court
 decisions that restored its leaders' political rights and
 affirmed the party's legal status.
 
 
 1142
 EGYPT
 The Communist Party has been banned since the early 1950's,
 although the National Progressive Unionist Grouping, a Marxist
 party frequently referred to as Communist by Egyptians, is
 legal. A 1977 law prohibits the formation of new parties based
 on religious or class lines, or whose platforms duplicate those
 of existing ones or include opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli
 peace treaty. The law also established the so-called "Parties
 Committee" which must approve the formation of new parties.
 Applicants are entitled to challenge in court an adverse
 decision by the Committee. In 1985 the sponsors of a proposed
 Nasserist party filed suit when the Committee turned down their
 application. The Administrative Court referred the case to
 the Supreme Constitutional Court where the matter has remained
 pending. The Administrative Court stated that provisions of
 the 1977 parties law may be unconstitutional because of
 apparent contradictions with the political rights of citizens
 and their right to freedom of expression. In October 1986,
 Nasserist party leaders claimed to be nearing completion of
 the party's legal establishment. They were increasingly
 engaged in open political activities, including rallies.
 Security authorities questioned the party leader concerning
 these activities, which may have exceeded the fledgling
 party's rights.
 The People's Assembly comprises 458 members, of whom 10 are
 appointed by the President. Half of the elected seats are
 reserved for worker and peasant representatives, and 31 for
 women. Following the most recent elections in 1984, the NDP
 controls the People's Assembly with 395 seats. The New Wafd
 has 58 seats, and other parties have 5 (all appointed). Both
 NDP and opposition deputies can and do strongly criticize the.
 Government. Cabinet ministers appear before assembly
 committees. Assembly members occasionally call for
 parliamentary investigations of government actions or policies
 that require the testimony of government officials.
 In the hard-fought 1984 campaign, the NDP and the four
 participating opposition parties together fielded over 2,000
 candidates. The elections, in which 43 percent of Egypt's
 approximately 12 million voters cast ballots, were generally
 regarded as the freest and most competitive since the 1952
 revolution. A number of losing opposition candidates filed
 court cases challenging the election results. These cases are
 still pending.
 A major opposition complaint focused on the July 1983
 electoral law which replaced the previous system of single-
 member constituencies with a party list system. In each of
 the 48 electoral districts, assembly seats were awarded in
 proportion to the number of votes for each party's list,
 subject to the requirement that a party receive at least
 8 percent of the total vote. The opposition parties have
 criticized this "8 percent" proviso as excessively high and
 have filed court suits challenging its constitutionality on
 the grounds that it infringes upon the equal rights provisions
 of the Constitution.
 During the months leading up to the October 1 Shura Council
 elections, the leaders of the opposition parties made a joint
 request to President Mubarak to change the electoral system
 for the Council. According to this system, the party list
 winning a majority of the votes in a given governorate gains
 all the seats for that constituency, provided the party wins
 at least 5 percent of the national vote. Charging that this
 system unfairly disadvantaged them, the opposition parties
 
 
 1143
 EGYPT
 boycotted the elections when the Government refused to change
 the rules.
 The Government announced a voter turnout of 81 percent for the
 uncontested Shura Council elections, and overwhelming support
 for NDP condidates. Some observers said that the Government's
 claim about the high turnout seemed greatly exaggerated and
 noted that voters had no alternative to NDP candidates except
 to vote "no." Arguing that the 11 million votes claimed by
 the Government exceeded the number of registered voters then
 present in the country, the opposition parties said they would
 present charges of electoral fraud to the public prosecutor.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Egypt has signed the Organization of African Unity's African
 Human Rights Charter and has reaffirmed its commitment to the
 U.N. Human Rights Declaration and respect for related
 international conventions. The Government is responsive to
 queries from Amnesty International and other international
 groups about human rights concerns, including requests for
 visits. Within the Government, primary responsibility for
 international human rights matters rests with the Foreign
 Ministry's Legal Office and Office of International
 Organization Affairs.
 Human rights groups in Egypt are increasingly active in
 promoting domestic and foreign human rights issues. Their
 activities cover such areas as prisoners' welfare and women's
 rights; some groups are also trying to mobilize public support
 on certain political issues. The Egyptian chapter of the Arab
 Human Rights Committee contacts the Ministry of Interior
 directly on human rights issues. For example, it raised the
 Amnesty International report on the six detained Egyptian
 Christian converts (see Section 2.c.) with Minister of
 Interior Badr. Women's rights groups actively lobbied for
 passage of the family status bill enacted by the People's
 Assembly in July 1985. The Government generally does not seem
 to interfere with these organizations, though it apparently did
 not permit the holding of one conference in Cairo sponsored by
 the Arab Human Rights Committee.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International noted that it had
 published a separate report, "Egypt: Evidence of Torture
 1981-1983" (see Section l.c.) and had sent a copy to the
 Egyptian Government for comment. Amnesty International noted
 that, in a replying memorandum, the Minister of State for
 Foreign Affairs had referred to constitutional and other
 legislative guarantees of personal and social liberty, as well
 as provisions safeguarding detainees from torture, and had
 reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to international human rights
 instruments. In its reply to the Government's memorandum,
 Amnesty International welcomed Egypt's response but also
 expressed the hope that the Egyptian Government would give
 serious consideration to implementing Amnesty International's
 specific recommendations for safeguards against torture and
 ill-treatment of detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law, and in many respects in practice, there is equality of
 the sexes. Women are represented in medicine, law, education,
 
 
 1144
 EGYPT
 and the military (in the medical units). They vote and serve
 in the People's Assembly and the Cabinet. They are generally
 free to travel, though a married woman must have her husband's
 permission to obtain her initial passport. A husband may
 rescind his permission and request that his wife's passport be
 canceled, but such cases are rare. A married or divorced
 woman also may not take her children abroad without her
 husband's permission. Under Islamic law, female heirs are
 entitled to one-half the amount of inheritance that male heirs
 can receive. In rural areas and within more traditional
 communities, prevailing cultural values make it more difficult
 for women to pursue careers outside the home. In such
 households, by custom and tradition, women occupy a subordinate
 and dependent role.
 The new family status law, enacted in July 1985 with strong
 support from President Mubarak, amplified the legal basis for
 equality of the sexes. The statute largely preserved women's
 right to divorce and divorced women's child custody and
 property rights, spelled out in a 1979 act which had been
 declared unconstitutional on narrow technical grounds by the
 Supreme Constitutional Court. Although the 1979 statute
 provided that a husband's second marriage was sufficient
 grounds for the first wife to obtain a divorce, the new version
 required proof that the second marriage had caused her material
 psychological harm. On the other hand, the new law also
 required the husband to declare second and subsequent
 marriages, with failure to do so constituting grounds for
 divorce by the first wife. The successor law retains the
 controversial provision that, in case of divorce, the woman has
 the option of retaining possession of the family residence or
 of receiving financial compensation.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers. The mininum wage
 is approximately $22 a month, and the regular workweek is fixed
 at 48 hours for factory workers.
 Employers are legally required to meet worker safety and health
 norms, which are modeled on the ILO's suggested standards.
 There are special provisions for female workers. Employers who
 violate wage, hour, and safety and health provisions face civil
 and criminal penalties, and independent sources confirm that
 the courts occasionally impose fines on offending companies.
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 12, which is also
 the minimum school-leaving age. Certain forms of dangerous or
 heavy labor, such as mining, are not legal for children aged
 12 to 18. There is evidence that the traditional practice of
 using underage children to perform full-time jobs continues,
 particularly in the rural areas. In the latest survey (1981)
 of the labor force, the Government's Central Statistics Agency
 reported that over half a million children aged 6 to 12 were
 regularly employed, a majority in the agricultural sector.
