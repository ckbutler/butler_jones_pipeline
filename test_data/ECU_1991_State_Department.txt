 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a
 72-member unicameral legislature chosen in free elections.
 Members of the Supreme Court, chosen by Congress, preside over
 a judiciary that is independent according to the Constitution
 but which is susceptible to political pressure. Seventeen
 registered political parties, a free press, and active human
 rights groups and labor unions are the mainstays of an open and
 lively political system. The Congress has important powers to
 question and censure executive branch ministers,, and such
 censure results in automatic dismissal of the minister. While
 this power enhances the democratically elected Congress' check
 on the Presidency, many Ecuadorians believe it has increased
 governmental instability as well.
 The Ecuadorian military has significant autonomy, reinforced by
 access to revenues from the nation's oil exports, civil
 aviation, shipping, and other economic activities. It has
 maintained a low profile in domestic politics since the return
 to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police are
 responsible for domestic law enforcement and maintenance of
 internal order. They also have primary responsibility for
 carrying out antinarcotics efforts, although the military is
 increasing its role in the war against drugs. The President
 controls the police through the Minister of Government, and the
 command structure of the National Police is completely separate
 from the armed forces joint command. In response to numerous
 instances of police. mistreatment of criminal suspects,
 including the use of physical force against detainees, there
 were widespread demands for reform of the National Police to
 improve its human rights performance.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there is
 heavy government invo-lvement in such key sectors as petroleum,
 utilities, and aviation. Inflation remained high at about 50
 percent in 1991 and overall economic conditions remained
 difficult for the vast majority of Ecuadorians. Rural poverty
 is extensive, and little improvement was evident in 1991. The
 combined unemployment  nd underemployment rate was over 60
 percent-
 Ecuadorians enjoy, both in law and in fact, a, wide range of
 freedoms and individual rights, but serious human rights
 problems remain. Principal among these are torture and other
 mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, impunity for human
 rights abusers, violence by paramilitary groups in rural areas,
 brutal prison conditions, lengthy detention without charge, a
 politicized court system, and pervasive discrimination against
 women, blacks, and Indians. In September 1991, an
 international commission named by the President to investigate
 the 1988 disappearance of the Restrepo brothers (see Section
 l.b.) concluded that the two boys had disappeared "at the hands
 of the police." As a result of the commission's report, the
 former commanding general of the police and 12 other active
 duty and retired police officials were detained; they remained
 in detention as of year's end. No date had been set for their
 trial. Although the Administration of President Rodrigo Borfa
 abolished the National Police's Criminal Investigative Service
 (SIC) in September in response to the Restrepo Commission's
 findings, serious problems remain, including the failure to
 investigate and prosecute many of those who commit abuses.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Both the physical mistreatment of suspects by the police, which
 has sometimes led to deaths of suspects, and the impunity with
 which many of these crimes are carried out, were continuing
 problems in Ecuador in 1991. According to a report in a
 respected Quito newspaper, of 74 cases brought against police
 in police courts for the deaths of suspects between 1986 and
 1989, 60 were still "pending," and in 4 of the cases the
 outcome was unknown; 10 officials had been absolved of criminal
 charges.
 In addition, indigenous groups charge that they are the target
 of violent and lethal reprisals by paramilitary groups during
 land invasions and other squatter demonstrations. The
 paramilitary groups are armed civilian bands and security guard
 forces hired by private landowners to protect their property..
 These forces often use military-like uniforms and weapons; some
 are reportedly operated or trained by former military or police
 officials, but there is no evidence of complicity with
 active-duty forces or personnel.
 During 1991, at least one indigenous activist, Julio
 Cabascango, was killed, possibly by. paramilitary forces: The
 1990 deaths of Oswaldo Cuvi and Cesar Morocho (both indigenous
 activists) under suspicious circumstances were still unresolved
 at the end of 1991. Human rights activists charge that Cuvi
 was killed by Ecuadorian regular military forces on June 6,
 1990, during a nationwide indigenous uprising.
 There is credible evidence that public security forces, both'
 police and military, were responsible in 1991 fdr
 nonpolitically motivated deaths of private citizens under
 detention or during investigations. For example, in July,
 Mayer Mina of the port town of San Lorenzo was apprehended by
 seven marines and brought to the local naval base for allegedly
 stealing a scale. Two days later, after the marines failed to
 find the scale, Mina's body was returned to his family. He had
 been severely beaten and died of cardiac arrest. During a
 demonstration in San Lorenzo to protest Mina's death, one
 protester was killed by-gunfire, allegedly shot by marines
 stationed at the naval base. No charges had been filed by
 year's end. There are credible reports that other suspects
 have died while in police custody. With the exception of the
 Restrepo case, previous deaths which occurred at the hands of
 the public forces (for example, the 1985 death of Consuelo
 Benavides) have not been satisfactionly resolved, nor have any
 alleged perpetrators been tried, convicted or sentenced.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disapperances during 1991.
 In September, an international commission named by President
 Borja to investigate the 1988 disappearance of two teenaged
 brothers, Santiago and Andreas Restrepo, concluded that the
 boys had disappeared and later died "at the hands of the
 police." Ecuadorian military forces assisted the investigation
 by carrying out a well-publicized 1-month search for the bodies
 
 
 584
 ECUADOR
 of the two teenagers at a lake south of Quito. The bodies were
 never found. The Restrepo Commission accused senior police
 officials, particularly those associated with the Criminal
 Investigative Service (SIC), of'engaging in a cover-up and of
 obstructing the investigation. In mid-September, a Quito judge
 ordered detained 13 police officials, including the
 just-retired chief of police and a former head of the
 counternarcotics division. The civilian courts will decide
 whether sufficient evidence and legal authority exists to try
 the officials on criminal charges in regular (nonpolice)
 courts. The police officials claim immunity from criminal
 charges and procedures for acts committed while on police duty,
 which would allow them to be judged by internal police
 disciplinary courts. The parents of the Restrepo brothers have
 filed a civil suit against two former cabinet officials who
 served as Ministers of Government and Police at the time of the
 disappearance and during the subsequent cover-up.
 In addition to the judicial branch's attempt to prosecute those
 deemed responsible by the commission for the Restrepo brothers'
 disappearance, and presumed death, in September the Borja
 Administration announced the abolishment of the SIC. The SIC
 had been accused by many credible human rights activists and
 organizations of involvement in torture, mistreatment,
 disappearances, and deaths of criminal suspects. Many members
 of the SIC have been reassigned to other police units, although
 most officers continue to work in the Office of Criminal
 Investigation (OID). With the exception of the Restrepo
 brothers 19a8 case, no earlier cases of disappearances were
 resolved, nor were any of those allegedly responsible punished.
 c. Torture .and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture and similar forms of intimidation and
 punishment are prohibited by law, reports in 1991 of physical
 mistreatment by police of suspects and prisoners continued to
 be persistent, widespread, and credible. Beating a suspect to
 obtain a confession is the most common tool used by police to
 carry out criminal investigations. The resort to torture and
 other physical mistreatment to extract information from
 suspects is caused, in part, by police lack of knowledge and
 technology to carry out modern, scientific investigations. The
 fact that officials are almost never punished for such abuses
 is also a significant factor. Nearly every month the
 Ecuadorian Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU) publishes
 detailed reports on suspects claiming to have been tortured by
 the police. CEDHU's reports frequently name police officials
 alleged to be responsible for specific torture cases and often
 include photographs of the victims with their wounds. Police
 immunity and resort to police courts is a major factor in
 preventing accountability for abuses by polite.
 Prison conditions in Ecuador's 20 extremely crowded detention
 centers are abysmal. Human rights activists charge that these
 detention centers constitute a serious violation of individual
 rights. There are no separate facilities for hard-core or
 dangerous criminals. A major mutiny and breakout at Quito's
 Garcia Moreno prison in September resulted in one death and
 several wounded guards. The breakout, which was carried out by
 suspected drug traffickers who bribed a number of guards to
 assist them, pointed out the urgent need for reform in the
 prison system. Prisoners with economic resources are usually
 able to secure highly favorable treatment through payments to
 
 
 585
 ECUADO.
 prison officials, while the indigent suffer severe deprivation
 and generally inhuman conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and Penal Code provide that no one may be
 deprived of liberty without a written order from a competent
 governmental authority, either a police chief or a judge of
 instruction. Specific written orders must be signed within 24
 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is caught
 in the act of committing a crime. The suspect must be charged
 with a specific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest.
 All prisoners have the right to a review of the'legality of
 their detention within 48 hours of arrest, a review which is
 supposed to be carried out by the senior elected official of
 the locality in which the suspect is held. Incommunicado
 detention is legally prohibited. In practice, these legal
 protections against arbitrary arrest or'detention are often
 violated.
 The process of arrest normally begins with an accusation of a
 criminal act brought by one or more private citizens against
 another. The police often detain suspects without the required
 written order. Suspects are frequently detained longer than 24
 hours before orders are signed, and few are charged within 48
 hours of arrest. Preventive detention before sentencing is
 legal under certain circumstances. Trial is supposed to begin
 within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest (60 days is the
 maximum period a suspect charged with a specific crime is
 required to wait before the trial commences). In practice, the
 initiation of the trial phase may take several years... Suspects
 are frequently held in detention longer than the maximum
 sentence imposed for the crime for which they are ultimately
 charged.' To avoid this long, arduous, and arbitrary process,
 families of detainees sometimes seek to secure the prisoner's
 freedom through illegal means.
 Exile is not generally used as a tool of political cbntrol.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The vast majority of civilian defendants are tried by the
 regular court system, although some indigenous groups try
 members privately for violations of tribal rules. The Congress
 elects a 16-member Supreme Court which chooses its president
 from within its ranks. The Supreme Court names the
 approximately 115 members of the Provincial Superior Courts
 which serve as appeals courts for criminal, civil, tax, and
 labor cases. The executive branch names the other "first
 instance" judges. While the courts are supposed to be
 independent by law, political party leaders exercise
 significant influence over the selection of judges at all
 levels.
 Minimum due process rights are provided for by law but are
 often not observed in practice. In theory, the accused is
 presumed to be innocent until proven guilty; defendants have
 the right to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal;
 they may present evidence but have the privilege not to testify
 against themselves; and defendants may confront and
 cross-examine witnesses. In theory, there is a public defender
 system. In practice, there are relatively few attorneys
 available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 
 
 586
 ECUADOR
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police are required to have a warrant to enter a private home
 or business, except in the case of hot pursuit. The police
 generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence, although there were continuing cases of illegal
 entry in 1991. Police surveillance is permitted, but
 wiretapping is prohibited by the Constitution. The naval and
 marine authorities who apprehended Mayer Mina in San Lorenzo
 (see Section l.a.) entered his home in July without a warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, and this right
 is generally respected in practice. However, the
 Guayaquil-based radio station Radio Sucre, owned by an
 opposition political party, was closed down in 1990 by the
 Government for broadcasting unsubstantiated charges of
 corruption by.President Borja's brother, and it remained closed
 as of the end of 1991. The principal owner, a Congressman from
 the opposition Social Christian party, appealed the closure
 decision in the judicial system but continued to be denied a
 license to reopen. In late 1991, all Radio Sucre network
 frequencies were assigned to Quito's Central University in a
 well-publicized ceremony.
 With the exception of two small government-owned radio
 stations, all of the major media outlets-television,
 newspapers, and radio--are in private hands. Using a law
 promulgated by the last military regime that requires the media
 to give the Government free space or air time, the Government
 frequently requires television and radio to broadcast
 government-produced programs featuring the President and other
 top administration officials. It also requires newspapers to
 carry a minimum amount of news prepared by the National
 Secretariat of Social Communications. The media and opposition
 political figures have criticized the Government's use of the
 media for its own political ends.
 The media represent a wide range of political views and
 criticize the Government. However, some degree of
 self-censorship in the print media occurs, particularly with
 respect to stories about the military or corruption at high
 levels of national, provincial, or municipal government.
 Nevertheless, in 1991, the media gave wide coverage to the
 Restrepo disappearance case in which high ranking police
 officials were implicated (see Section l.b.). There are 2
 major daily newspapers in the capital, Quito, 5 in the
 principal commercial center, Guayaquil, and more than 20
 additional papers published daily in other regions and cities.
 There are 4 national television networks and about 300 radio
 stations, as well as cable television programming from the
 United States, Canada, Brazil, Spain, and Mexico, all free of
 government censorship. Journalists working in the preparation
 and reporting of news (as opposed to opinion) must be graduates
 of an accredited Ecuadorian university journalism school.
 Ecuador has a large university system comprising both
 state-subsidized and private universities. The state
 universities are active in politics, particularly on the left
 of the political spectrum. The Government has scrupulously
 avoided interference in issues involving academic freedom.
 
 
 587
 ECUADOR
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of free assembly and
 association for peaceful purposes. These rights are generally
 respected in practice. Public rallies require prior government
 permits, which are generally granted. Numerous political
 demonstrations took place in 1991, including a February 6
 general strike, student protests against government economic
 measures, as well as numerous demonstrations throughout the
 country against the war in the Persian Gulf. Generally, the
 security forces intervene in demonstrations only when there is
 violence against persons or property. However, Professor Felix
 Preciado died during a demonstration in San Lorenzo protesting
 the murder of Mayer Mina at the hands of navy personnel. In
 addition, indigenous organizations protested the use of private
 paramilitary groups to break up demonstrations and land
 invasions. The Minister of Government and the police announced
 strengthened controls over private guard forces and other armed
 groups that are not properly registered. However, there have
 not been any reported charges brought against such groups. In
 general, police were restrained in the use of force during
 demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 There is no official state religion, although the population is
 nominally over 90 percent Roman Catholic. There are active
 Protestant and Jewish communities in the major cities and
 evangelical movements continue to attract new adherents. The
 Constitution prohibits discrimination for religious reasons,
 although members of the clergy are barred by the Constitution
 from election to the Congress, the Presidency, or Vice
 Presidency. Numerous foreign-based religious orders and
 missionary groups are active in Ecuador.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution assures the right of all citizens to travel
 freely throughout the country, to choose their place of
 residence, and to depart from and reenter Ecuador. These
 rights are respected in practice. Ecuadorian citizens who
 return to the country after residing abroad are not harassed or
 discriminated against by the Government. No cases of forced
 resettlement were reported in 1991.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since the return to civilian rule in 1979, Ecuadorian citizens
 have exercised their right to change their national and local
 governments. Free elections for the Presidency and the
 Congress have taken place regularly since 1979, and power has
 been transferred peacefully to different parties. The June
 1990 congressional election saw significant losses by
 progovernment parties, leaving the Government without a
 majority in Congress. In 1991 there were 17 legally registered
 political parties, spanning the ideological spectrum. Eleven
 of the 16 parties, including 4 of the leftist parties, are
 represented in the Congress.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over the age of 18
 and voluntary for illiterate citizens. There are no
 restrictions on voting by women or by minority groups.
 
 
 588
 ECUADOR
 Active-duty members of the military forces cannot vote although
 there was periodic debate on this subject in 1991. All
 citizens, regardless of sex, religion, socioeconomic status, or
 ethnic origin, have the right td form and join political
 parties and to run for local or national office. The
 white/mestizo male-dominated elite tends to be
 self-perpetuating, and blacks, Indians, and women continue to
 be underrepresented in high positions in government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights groups such as the Catholic
 Churdh-affiliated Ecumenical Commission on Human Rights (CEDHU)
 and the Latin American Human Rights Associaticn (ALDHU) are
 independent and actively monitor human rights issues in
 Ecuador. These groups, particularly CEDHU, have been outspoken
 in their criticism of the Government's record on specific
 cases, and CEDHU has taken a particular interest in defending
 the human rights of the poor. Following demonstrations and
 protests by indigenous groups in 1990 and 1991, the Borja
 Administration, besides opening a dialog with the groups,
 generally cooperated with international environmental and human
 rights groups. In July 1991, four foreigners, who were looking
 into environmental and human rights conditions in the Amazon
 basin region where significant petroleum development activity
 takes place, were detained for a number of'days by Ecuadorian
 military forces and later detained by police in Quito who
 questioned whether the activists had permission to be in the
 area.
 Foreign and international human rights groups had access to a
 wide range of government officials in 1991 and were able to
 investigate human rights conditions without government
 hindrance.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, or social status. Nevertheless, discrimination
 against women, blacks, and Indians is pervasive in Ecuadorian
 society, particularly with respect to educational and economic
 opportuiity. The vast majority of the rural population of
 approximately 5 million (slightly less than 50 percent of the
 population) are peasants of Indian or Indian-mestizo ancestry.
 The population of the rural, northern coastal area of Ecuador
 includes large numbers of black citizens. Most peasants live
 in varying degrees of poverty. Land is scarce, infant
 mortality, malnutrition,-and epidemic disease are common, and
 potable water and electricity are often unavailable. The rural
 education system is -seriously deficient, even while the
 Government continues to heavily subsidize the state
 universities' largely white or white/mestizo students from the
 middle and upper classes.
 Efforts to improve living standards for Indian and black
 peasants were hampered in 1991, as in previous years, by the
 Government's reluctance to change traditional spending
 patterns, especially those favoreing the cities. The
 long-simmering frustration of Ecuador's largest minority group,
 the Indians, over these socioeconomic issues exploded in
 nationwide protest demonstrations in 1990, and sporadic
 demonstrations continued in 1991. The Borja Administration
 
 
 589
 ECUADOR
 pursued a dialog with indigenous groups to attempt to resolve
 some of the key issues they raised, but the dialog was broken
 off on a number of occasions by both sides during 1991.
 There was little improvement in the status of women in 1991.
 The Ecuadorian women's liberation movement believes that in
 practice culture and tradition inhibit achievement of full
 equality for women. While no current data on salaries or
 occupation by sex are available, anecdotal evidence suggests
 that the number of women in the professions or working as
 skilled laborers is substantially fewer than men, and salary
 discrimination is common. Although violence against women,
 including within marriage, is prohibited by, law, it is a common
 practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the victims'
 reluctance to confront the perpetrator. To date the Government
 has not addressed this question as a serious public policy
 issue.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Constitution and Labor Code, most workers enjoy the
 right to form trade unions. In November the Legislature passed
 Labor Code reforms which seek to boost employment without
 significantly limiting workers' rights. Workers not free to
 form trade unions include public security and military
 officials, and public sector employees in nonrevenue earning
 entities. The Labor Code reforms raised the number of workers
 required for an establishment to be unionized from 14 to 30.
 While employees of stated-owned organizations enjoy full. rights
 similar to that of the private sector, the majority of public
 sector employees are prevented from joining unions and lack'
 collective bargaining rights. The International Labor
 Organization Committee of Experts (COE) reiterated in 1991 that
 the prohibition on establishment of trade unions by public
 servants in nonrevenue earning entities is incompatible with
 Ecuador's ratification of Convention 87 on freedom of
 association.
 Approximately 12 to 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 There are four large labor centrals or confederations, three of
 which maintain strong international affiliation. Ecuador also
 has numerous unaffiliated labor federations, such as the
 drivers union, the teachers' organization, the national
 artisans and mechanics confederation, and numerous peasant
 groups.
 Workers by law have the right to strike. There are few
 restrictions on this right, except for workers in some
 state-owned enterprises involved in basic services or products
 such as hospitals, petroleum, telephones, water, and
 electricity. -A 20-day cooling-off period is required before
 declaring a strike. The new Labor Code limits solidarity
 strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved
 by the Labor Ministry. Many legal strikes occurred in 1991.
 In addition to the large number declared legal, there were
 numerous illegal strikes, such as those by medical workers,
 doctors, teachers, and provincial workers. In a legal strike,
 workers take possession of the factory or workplace, thus
 ending production at the site, and receive police protection
 during the takeover. All salaries and benefits continue to be
 paid by the employer during a legal strike. There were no
 reports of use of police to controrl strikes in 1991, although
 
 
 590
 ECUADOR
 police were called out during the national strike of February
 6, 1991.
 A Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of
 temporary workers for the maquila industries only. While there
 is no express prohibition on association rights in the Maquila
 Law, organizing temporary contract workers will be difficult in
 practice, as many will be temporary employees with short term
 contracts. The Government approved a law permitting the
 creation of free trade zones, but none had been established by
 year's end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Ecuador has a highly segmented labor market with a minority of
 workers in skilled, usually unionized, positions in state-run
 enterprises or in protected import substitution industries.
 The vast majority of the economically active population is
 either unemployed or underemployed in the informal sector.
 Most rural labor is not organized. The Labor Code requires
 that all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to
 a union must negotiate collectively when the union so
 requests. This broad right does not extend to most public
 sector employees in nonrevenue earning ministries nor to
 management in certain entities with social or public
 objectives. The new Labor law has streamlined the bargaining
 process in stated-owned enterprises by requiring workers to be
 represented by only one labor union. The Labor Code prohibits
 discrimination against unions and requires that employers
 provide space for union activities upon the union's request.
 The COE, however, reiterated in its 1991 report that the Labor
 Code inadequately protects against antiunion activity at the
 time of recruitment. The ILO Committee of Freedom of
 Association's review of a specific complaint involving
 antiunion discrimination was rendered moot when union strike
 leaders accepted compensation in lieu of job reinstatement.
 Despite the reforms promulgated in November 1991, the Labor
 Code remains highly unfavorable to employers and is a
 disincentive to the hiring of union members and to employment
 in general. Employers often try to avoid hiring additional
 workers and unionization by substituting machinery for workers
 or "atomizing" their production processes to maintain plants
 employing less than the number needed to form a union.-
 Employers are not permitted to dismiss a worker without the
 express permission of the Ministry of Labor. Dismissals ruled
 as unjustified require payment to the worker of large
 indemnities or separation payments by employers, although the
 reforms have set a cap on such payments. The Labor Code
 provides for resolution of labor conflicts through an
 arbitration and conciliation-board comprised of one
 representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union,
 and two representatives of management. Participation in this
 process is voluntary, and strikes and lockouts occur even while
 arbitration is under way.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by both the Constitution and the
 Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Persons less than 14 years old are prohibited by law from
 working except in special circumstances such as
 
 
 591
 ECUADOR
 apprenticeships. Those between the ages of 14 and 18 are
 required to have the permission of their parent or guardian to
 work. In practice, enforcement of child labor laws is
 seriously inadequate. In rural areas most children leave
 school at about 10 years of age to contribute to household
 income as farm laborers. In the city many children under age
 14 work in family-owned "businesses" in the informal sector,
 shining shoes, collecting and recycling garbage, or as street
 peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The basic minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and his family. The vast
 majority of organized workers in state industries and formal
 sector private enterprises earn substantially more than the
 minimum wage and also have significant other benefits.
 However, the minimum wage is the operative wage in many
 informal sector activities where the majority of the
 economically active population is employed. The Ministry of
 Labor has the principal role.in enforcing labor laws and
 carries this out with a corps of labor inspectors who are
 active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a
 40-hour workweek, a 15-day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and
 other variable employer-provided benefits such as uniforms and.
 training opportunities.
 The Labor Code also provides for general protection of workers'
 health and safety on the job. In the formal sector
 occupational health and safety is not a major problem. The
 Government enforces health and safety standards and regulations
 through the Social Security Institute. There are no specific
 regulations governing health and safety standards in the
 agricultural sector and, in practice, there is no enforcement
 of safety rules in small mines and remote locations.
