 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a multiparty democracy. Its Constitution, adopted
 in 1978, provides for a strong executive president who is
 independent of the unicameral parliament. Both are elected by
 universal adult suffrage, with members of parliament to be
 selected in future general elections on the basis of a system
 of proportional representation. The Constitution also provides
 for an independent judiciary and the rule of law. When the
 1978 Constitution came into effect, the then-Prime Minister
 and leader of the ruling United National Party (UNP), J.R.
 Jayewardene, became President. He was returned to office in
 an election in 1982.
 A developing country, Sri Lanka has achieved a high quality of
 life despite low per capita income which in 1985 was only
 $372. Tea exports are Sri Lanka's largest source of foreign
 exchange earnings. Approximately 60 percent of Sri Lanka's
 productive capacity is state owned or controlled.
 The two largest ethnic groups in Sri Lanka are the Sinhalese
 (74 percent) and the Tamils (18 percent). A growing
 conviction among Tamils that they do not enjoy political
 rights equal to those of the Sinhalese majority led some
 political leaders and frustrated Tamil youths to conclude, by
 the mid-1970's, that separation of the Tamil-majority areas of
 the island into an independent Tamil state or "Eelam" was the
 only solution. The political leaders renamed their party the
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and contested the 1977
 elections on a platform of independence, winning all 14 seats
 in the heavily Tamil Northern Province and 2 seats in the
 Eastern Province, which has a sizable Tamil population. A
 number of Tamil youths formed militant groups which turned to
 armed struggle and terrorism as a way of attaining Eelam.
 TULF members lost their seats in Parliament in 1983 when,
 rather than comply with a new legal requirement to swear
 allegiance to a unitary Sri Lanka, they left Parliament and
 did not return within the required 60 days. Since bi-elections
 to fill these seats have been postponed due to the unsettled
 security situation in the north and east, Tamils living in
 those constituencies are now without representatives in
 Parliament. Currently three Tamils from the UNP are members
 of Parliament, all of them also serving as cabinet ministers.
 The TULF has participated in various inconclusive and
 unsuccessful rounds of negotiations with the Government for a
 political resolution of Tamil grievances. The militant Tamil
 groups have refused to enter the negotiations, depending
 instead on armed insurgency to attain their goal of a Tamil
 homeland. In June 1986, President Jayewardene announced new
 proposals aimed at restoring communal peace, and a new round
 of negotiations between the Government and the TULF, with the
 assistance of the Government of India, commenced soon
 afterwards. By the end of the year, the negotiations had
 reached a crucial stage with the Tamil demand for the merger
 of the Tamil majority areas of the Northern and Eastern
 Provinces being a principal obstacle to a settlement.
 The military conflict between the Government and Tamil
 militant separatists has steadily spread and intensified since
 the communal incidents of July 1983, despite efforts to reach
 a negotiated settlement. There is substantial, credible
 evidence that both the Tamil militants and the government
 secutity forces have been responsible for human rights abuses,
 including indiscriminate attacks on civilians.
 
 
 1291
 SRI LANKA
 Basic human rights are guaranteed to Sri Lankan citizens by
 the Constitution and affirmed by the Government. Significant
 human rights violations continued to be reported during 1986.
 Critics cited the Government's failure to vigorously prosecute
 those accused of human rights abuses as a major cause of
 continuing violations. The Government, in affirming its
 support for Constitutional guarantees, has stated that it has
 investigated allegations of human rights violations but the
 absence of evidence has hindered its efforts to prosecute
 those accused.
 As in 1985, critics continued to accuse government security
 forces and police of human rights violations. The Government
 did attempt to improve training and discipline within the
 reportedly expanding security forces during the past year, but
 its efforts have proved disappointing. Overall, military
 personnel reportedly increased by 70 percent from 1985 to 1986
 and the number of part-time militiamen, known as "home
 guards," reportedly doubled. The increasingly Sinhalese
 composition of the expanded security forces and police has
 probably contributed to human rights problems. The enlisted
 ranks of the armed services are now virtually 100 percent
 Sinhalese. A considerable number of Tamils were once found in
 the police, and as recently as 1984 the Senior police officer
 was a Tamil. By 1985 no more than 5 percent of police
 personnel were Tamils and the police Special Task Force (STF),
 which is charged with counterinsurgency operations, is now 100
 percent Sinhalese. The STF and the home guards, in
 particular, were both accused of attacks on civilians during
 1986, and government forces, for the first time, resorted to
 aerial bombing and strafing which resulted in civilian
 casualties.
 In 1986 Tamil militants continued to attack both civilian and
 military targets. The militants bombed civilian targets in
 the south and in Colombo and killed Sinhalese villagers in the
 north and east. Several bombings in May and June resulted in
 over 250 civilian casualties. Tamil militant groups fought
 among themselves several times. In the Northern Province,
 where the Tamil militants have largely taken over civil
 administration, a number of civilians who refused to cooperate
 have-.been kidnaped and killed.
 During 1986 some traditional rights remained restricted as a
 result of laws enacted earlier to deal with the continuing
 insurgency. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the
 regulations under the State of Emergency give the security
 forces broad powers to arrest and detain. The courts tried
 and convicted hundreds of detainees held under the PTA and
 emergency regulations in 1986; two were acquitted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The number of deaths from politically motivated violence
 arising from the ethnic insurgency rose still higher in 1986.
 According to the Government, over 2,000 people were killed; of
 this total, over 200 were members of the security forces,
 about 1,000 were alleged members of the Tamil militant groups
 and 700 were noncombatants killed by the militants. Of the
 700 civilian deaths, 170 were Tamils, 190 were Sinhalese,
 
 
 1295
 SRI LANKA
 and 40 were Muslims; over 300 were unidentified. The
 Government has acknowledged its difficulties in collecting
 information in disputed areas due to the breakdown of civil
 administration. One nongovernment source estimated the death
 toll for 1986 to be nearly 2,700. Most of the deaths occurred
 in the north and east, the scene of most of the clashes in 1986
 between government forces and Tamil militants. Civilians were
 also killed in Colombo and other areas in the south as a result
 of a series of Tamil militant bombings,
 Government and militant forces both appeared responsible for
 significant numbers of noncombatant deaths. Government
 security forces opened fire in civilian areas following
 hit-and-run insurgent attacks or land mine explosions and
 launched air strikes or mortar shellings in densely populated
 areas, particularly in the Jaffna peninsula. Tamil insurgents
 bombed and mined transportation facilities and public
 buildings, attacked Sinhalese villagers living in areas
 considered by separatists as constituting part of the Tamil
 homeland, and executed suspected government informants or
 sympathizers.
 Among the most significant alleged incidents in 1986 involving
 the security forces were the following: On January 25 in the
 Northern Kilinochchi District, following a series of clashes
 between soldiers and insurgents, an enlisted man reportedly
 went berserk and killed 10 Tamil civilians at the train
 station. According to another, nongovernmental, version of
 the incident, the train station killings were the work of a
 group of soldiers, not of a deranged individual. The
 Government responded by transferring the accused enlisted man
 to Colombo and keeping him under observation. On February 19
 at Lahugala in eastern Sri Lanka, the Government reported that
 its security forces killed 40 Tamil insurgents. Other reports
 of the incident alleged that the security forces shot as many
 as 103 local farmers and burned the remains. Two separate
 government inquiries into the Lahugala incident concluded that
 the security forces had not exceeded their authority. On June
 10, military personnel on a small island off the Jaffna
 peninsula were shot at and returned fire; 30 Tamil fishermen
 in the vicinity were reported killed in the crossfire. Other
 reports allege that the security forces deliberately killed
 the fishermen. On July 17, soldiers in a village south of
 Trincomalee killed 37 people whom the Government identified as
 terrorists. Other reports of this incident allege that the
 security forces shot Tamil refugees near the site of an
 earlier land mine blast which killed more than two dozen
 soldiers. On September 18, a car bomb in Batticaloa exploded,
 wounding several policemen. According to a government press
 statement, 12 people near the blast were killed in the cross
 fire between police and the militants. According to other
 accounts, the policemen, unopposed by Tamil militants, opened
 fire on nearby civilians.
 A new tactic of the security forces in 1986 was the use of air
 force attacks against insurgents in heavily populated areas.
 Some reports allege that as many as 50 Tamil civilians in
 Jaffna may have been killed as a result of these attacks in
 the first half of the year. Tamil militants and government
 security forces sometimes exchanged mortar fire in populated
 areas, also resulting in civilian casualties.
 As in previous years, in the few instances in which
 investigations revealed that the security forces acted
 improperly, the Government maintained that it was unable to
 
 
 1296
 SRI LANKA
 obtain adequate evidence to prosecute. Generally, the
 Government dealt with misbehavior administratively, a policy
 which many observers believe does little to deter wrongdoers.
 The Government said that there were far fewer reports of
 -misbehavior by the security forces in 1986. Accordingly,
 whereas 200 members of the security forces were "discharged
 with ignominy" in 1983 and 4 were similarly discharged in
 1985, no members of the security forces were discharged for
 misbehavior in 1986 and no courts martial were held.
 Tamil militants continued their practice of attacking
 government security forces and public infrastructure such as
 rail lines, electric grids, and roads and bridges. The
 militants also mounted a campaign of bomb and land mine
 attacks on civilian targets in the Sinhalese-majority south.
 Included in this campaign, which peaked in May and June, was
 the May 3 planting of an explosive on an Air Lanka Tristar,
 resulting in the death of 17 people, including a number of
 foreign tourists; a May 7 bombing of the central telegraph
 office in Colombo in which 12 people were killed; a bombing on
 May 30 at a Colombo bottling plant which killed 11; and the
 bombings of 2 large public buses on June 25, which killed 22
 people. In December two bombs believed to have been planted
 by Tamil militants were discovered at a Colombo power station
 before they .could explode.
 The insurgents also attacked Sinhalese farms and villages in
 an effort to drive residents from what the insurgents consider
 to be traditional Tamil areas. Almost all of these attacks
 occurred in the vicinity of Trincomalee on the east coast, an
 area of relative ethnic heterogeneity. On May 11, and again
 on May 18, Tamil guerrillas struck the village of Morewewa,
 killing 17 Sinhalese civilians. Insurgents also launched a
 string of attacks on Sinhalese villages near Trincomalee May
 23-25, killing at least 32 Sinhalese civilians. As many as
 100 Sinhalese civilians may have been killed in similar
 attacks.
 Another Tamil militant practice in 1986, continued from
 previous years, was the execution on lamp posts of suspected
 informers.  There were an estimated 80 to 120 "lamp-post
 killings" during 1986. Perhaps the most prominent of the
 lamp-post victims in 1986 was the widely respected Jaffna
 leader of the Sri Lankan rural self-help development
 organization, Satvodaya--himself a Tamil--who was killed by
 Tamil militants in Jaffna on September 26.
 Increasingly in 1986, the various Tamil militant groups fought
 with each other as they struggled for control over parts of
 the north and east. This internecine warfare peaked in May,
 when members of one group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
 Eelam (LTTE), killed 150 to 170 members of a rival group, the
 Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) in Jaffna. In
 December the LTTE attacked camps of the Eelam People's
 Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), reportedly killing at
 least 50 EPRLF members.
 b. Disappearance
 Amnesty International (AI) published a special report in
 September on disappearances in Sri Lanka. Most of the
 272 disappearance cases cited in the report date from
 1983-1985, and involve persons who were living in the north
 and north central part of Sri Lanka when they disappeared.
 
 
 1297
 SRI LANKA
 There were more reports of disappearances in 1986, primarily
 in the Eastern Province.
 Due to the deterioration of security conditions and civil
 administration in the areas where most of the disappearances
 have taken place, the Government has found it difficult to
 investigate. The Government criticized the AI report because
 it is based on affidavits which have not been subjected to
 cross-examination in court and denied the general thrust of
 the report, which is that many of the "disappeared" were
 arrested by government security forces and died while in
 custody. The Government suggested that many of the
 "disappeared" may have left the country, joined the Tamil
 militant groups, or are in detention centers under assumed
 names, making them difficult to trace. It challenged those
 concerned to file habeas corpus proceedings on behalf of those
 who allegedly had disappeared. At year's end, 20 such cases
 had been filed and were pending.
 According to government statistics, 108 Sri Lankans were
 kidnaped by the Tamil militants in 1986. The Government
 believes that most of those abducted were killed by the
 militants.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment.
 The Constitution guarantees that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment," and in 1982 the Government submitted to the U.N.
 a unilateral declaration opposing the use of torture.
 However, there have been persistent reports that the military
 and police have tortured or mistreated persons detained under
 the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the emergency
 regulations.
 In 1986 a group of Tamil prisoners at Welikade prison, who
 previously had been held in a large, overcrowded detention
 center at Bussa in the south, wrote an open letter describing
 the poor conditions and mistreatment which they had suffered
 there and called for an impartial investigation. Government
 investigators who checked on conditions at Bussa found no
 evidence of mistreatment of prisoners and found the prison
 conditions generally acceptable. They criticized the sanitary
 conditions, however, and prison authorities have been
 instructed to make improvements. Also in 1986, the Government
 initiated a rehabilitation program to provide vocational
 training for prisoners.
 The Government has stated that it does not condone torture of
 detainees or prisoners, adding that it has been unable to
 investigate charges of torture since the various allegations
 generally do not identify individual victims. There have been
 no convictions of police officers accused of causing physical
 harm to persons in custody.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 The Constitution stipulates that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his arrest.
 Within 24 hours, an arrested person must be brought before a
 magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes,
 continued detention. A suspect may be detained up to 3 months
 without bail, or longer if a court so rules.
 
 
 1298
 SRI LANKA
 There are exceptions to the normal rules for a person detained
 under the emergency regulations or the Prevention of Terrorism
 Act. Under the State of Emergency, first declared in May 1983
 and renewed monthly by Parliament since then, the President
 reissues the emergency regulations by gazette notification
 each month: The regulations give extraordinary powers to the
 police to use preventive detention on persons suspected of
 planning to commit offenses or to arrest individuals suspected
 of having committed a wide variety of crimes. Detainees under
 these emergency regulations can be held for up to 90 days on
 orders of the.Attorney General, after which time the suspect
 must be produced before a magistrate. The magistrate is not
 empowered to investigate the case, but under the regulations
 he "shall" remand the detainee to a prison, where he can be
 held indefinitely. Bail may be granted at the discretion of
 the Government.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) provides that any person
 arrested under this law must be produced before a magistrate
 within 3 days unless-the Minister of National Security orders
 the suspect to be detained for a period of 3 months. Such an
 order may be renewed for a period of up to 18 months. The
 terms of detention are set out in this order; detainees do not
 have the same rights as other prisoners regarding visits by
 family, access to lawyers, food, and other conditions of
 incarceration.
 The PTA and emergency regulations were used extensively in
 1986 to detain large numbers of persons, mostly Tamil youths,
 from the north and east and Sinhalese allegedly belonging to
 radical political groups. Some Sri Lankans allege that
 between 3,000 and 5,000 detainees are being held under the PTA
 and emergency regulations. The Government has said that 2,526
 persons were in detention under these laws at year's end, 67
 under the emergency regulations, and the rest under the PTA.
 The Government said 67 detainees were Sinhalese and the rest
 were Tamils. The Government stated that 126 detainees had
 been enrolled in the Government's new rehabilitation program.
 As in 1985, there were reports of several persons who had been
 held without charges longer than the 18 months legally
 permissible under the PTA.
 In 1986.the security forces continued their practice of
 rounding up young men in areas of suspected Tamil militant
 infiltration. Many of those taken into custody are held for
 short periods for questioning and released. Those not
 released are taken to detention facilities. Relatives may
 write to the Ministry of Defense and ask that the case of
 their family member be reviewed. The review is conducted by a
 three-man advisory board which considers the evidence,
 interviews the police and the detainee, and makes a
 recommendation. Although it frequently takes several months
 for cases to be reviewed, many reviews have led to a
 recommendation of immediate release.
 Unless a review of the detention.is requested, detainees can
 remain for long periods without being charged or informed of
 the provision-of law under which they have.been detained. It
 is not unusual for detainees to be held incommunicado and,
 especially for PTA detainees, to be denied-ready access to
 their attorneys. Bail may be granted at the sole discretion
 of the Attorney General's office.
 Persons may challenge the legality of their detention either-
 by filing a suit in the High Court, or in the Supreme Court by
 
 
 1299
 SRI LANKA
 charging the Government with illegal violation of a person's
 fundamental rights as they are enumerated in the
 Constitution. Some observers claim these legal remedies are
 time-consuming, expensive, and beyond the means of the average
 detainee, limiting their effectiveness. Fundamental rights
 suits, for example, must be prepared and filed with the
 Supreme Court within 30 days of the alleged first violation of
 fundamental rights, a requirement with which it is often
 difficult for detainees to comply. Relatives of persons
 arrested under the PTA or the emergency regulations have
 initiated legal challenges several times in recent years. In
 no instance where the courts inquired into the detention and
 subsequent disappearance of a suspect detained under these
 measures have the results been publicly released.
 There is no forced labor in Sri Lanka, but criminals may be
 sentenced to "rigorous imprisonment" (hard labor) under which
 they are required to work.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Generally speaking, an accused person is entitled to a fair
 trial in open court, is represented by counsel of his choice,
 and is informed of the charges and evidence against him.
 Accused persons tried in the High Court are provided an
 attorney if they need one, but no attorney is provided by the
 Government for defendants tried in other courts.
 Although public trial by jury is the custom, juries are not
 provided in trials under the PTA on the grounds that jury
 members could be intimidated. Like others convicted of crimes
 under Sri Lanka's laws, those convicted of violations under
 the PTA or the emergency regulations have the right of appeal,
 although attorneys are not provided at public expense for
 cases in the Appeals and Supreme Courts.
 The independence of the judiciary is constitutionally
 guaranteed. The Chief Justice is a Tamil. He and all judges
 of the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, and High Courts are
 appointed by the President. The Chief Justice and two Supreme
 Court judges comprise a judicial service commission which
 appoints, transfers, and dismisses all lower court judges.
 In the northern Jaffna peninsula, the judicial system has
 virtually ceased to function due to intimidation by the Tamil
 militants. Outside the Jaffna peninsula, Sri Lanka's
 judiciary demonstrated its independence in 1986 by handing
 down acquittals in two well-publicized cases of detainees who
 had been held under the PTA and the emergency regulations. In
 one case, the Government chose not to appeal the acquittal.
 In the other case, concerning Father Aparnam Singarayar, the
 Tamil Catholic priest accused in February 1983 of two counts
 of withholding information from the police, the Government has
 decided to appeal the acquittal on the first charge. The
 trial on the second charge was under way at year's end.
 Hundreds of PTA detainees were brought to trial during 1986.
 Virtually all of the detainees had been held for long
 periods. Most were sentenced to short prison terms in
 exchange for guilty pleas to lesser charges, thus obviating
 the need for lengthy trials.
 However, in many cases, such as that of the Tamil student
 Ramanujam Manikkalingam, there have been long delays on the
 government side in completing its investigation and preparing
 
 
 1300
 SRI LANKA
 charges. Manikkalingam, arrested under the PTA in March, had
 not been charged 9 months later.
 Estimates of the number of political prisoners vary widely.
 Sri Lankan human rights activists, counting only those
 convicted under the PTA and currently serving prison
 sentences, estimate that there are 30 political prisoners. If
 less restrictive definitions are used, the number could be
 much higher.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Government respects individual privacy and the sanctity of
 the family and the home. The judiciary has a good record of
 upholding rights to privacy in those cases which reach a High
 Court. Ordinarily, search and arrest warrants are required in
 order to enter private premises. Under the PTA, however,
 police officers above a certain rank and less senior officers
 authorized by them in writing may, without a warrant, enter
 and search any premises and seize "any document or thing" when
 there is a presumption or evidence of support for, or
 involvement with, unlawful activity. Critics claim that
 police and military personnel often enter the homes of Tamils
 without cause. Monitoring of telephones is not known to be a
 common practice, despite allegations by some critics of the
 Government that it taps their telephone lines.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 The Constitution guarantees "freedom of speech and expression
 including publication," but it also-permits these guarantees
 to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the interests
 of national security."
 In contrast with the previous year, there was no formal press
 censorship in Sri Lanka in 1986. Although the Government
 controls the country's largest newspaper chain and owns the
 radio and television services, a variety of independent
 newspapers and journals provide a full range of viewpoints on
 foreign policy and most domestic matters. Many small
 circulation periodicals published by opposition political
 parties operate in an unrestricted manner.
 Foreign and Sri Lanka-based journalists generally encountered
 fewer difficulties in 1986 than in 1985, when journalists'
 work was screened before visas were issued. However, in 1986
 the Government penalized one foreign journalist for reporting
 it considered too pro-Tamil by refusing to renew his visa and
 requiring his departure.
 Sri Lankans are generally free to express their views in
 private but may be prosecuted under the emergency regulations
 for making certain kinds of remarks in public. A Canadian
 citizen of Sri Lankan descent, the chairman of the Citizens
 Committee of the town of Kalmunai who had been charged with
 sedition under the emergency regulations for repeating to a
 foreign journalist information he had given to the police
 about an alleged atrocity by government security forces, was
 tried and acquitted of the charge in 1986. Also in 1986,
 there were hundreds of arrests of alleged members of a
 proscribed political party, the revolutionary Marxist Janatha
 Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), in southern Sri Lanka for alleged
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1301
 SRI LANKA
 disruptive activities, including antigovernment public
 statements.
 Academic freedom is generally respected. Responding to
 student boycotts and other disruptive activities, the
 Government closed affected universities for short periods.
 Generally, however, 1986 was a year of relative student peace.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and association
 and the right to form and join trade unions. Sri Lanka has an
 abundance of private associations, devoted to the promotion of
 business, professional, educational, religious, charitable, and
 humanitarian causes, which are free to maintain ties with
 international bodies. However, there are a few restrictions on
 free assembly and assoc4ation. One leftist political party,
 the JVP, has been proscribed since 1983.
 Under the emergency regulations,,-the President (or his
 designee) is empowered to prohibit public meetings which would
 be "likely to cause a disturbance to public order or promote
 disaffection." In practice, the police issue permits for
 outdoor, public meetings or processions, and special
 permission is required for use of a loudspeaker. The question
 of whether to issue a permit is left to the discretion of the
 Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent of an area, who may
 refuse a permit if he anticipates a breach of peace.
 Worker- rights are recognized and protected by law. Any seven
 workers may-form a. union, draw up their own procedures, elect
 their own representatives, and formulate programs. Workers
 are expressly granted the right to bargain collectively. When
 workers and employers are not able to resolve a dispute, there
 is an arbitration system which involves Labor Department
 officers. These officers are stationed throughout the country
 to assure that employers fulfill their legal and contractual
 obligations to workers and to be available for arbitration in
 minor local disputes.
 Excepting public service employees, workers are free to strike
 in Sri Lanka and have done so frequently. Under the emergency
 regulations, the President may declare any business to be an
 essential service, making a strike illegal. During 1986, the
 Government used this power to terminate strikes or other job
 actions several times. In the case of public service
 employees as well as workers in "essential services," the
 Government generally agreed todiscuss grievances with a labor
 representative.
 About 1,000 labor unions and federations together represent
 about one-third of the 5.5 million-strong labor force; 80
 percent of the organized work force are in the plantations.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zone, are not represented by unions. Employees in
 the zone participate in labor-management company associations.
 Although there are a few independent unions, most of the
 largest worker organizations are affiliated with political
 parties, frequently operate as arms of those parties, and play
 a significant role in the political process. Despite
 constraints arising from their political affiliations, Sri
 Lankan unions have been effective in improving conditions for
 workers. Many unions maintain ties with international labor
 federations and trade secretariats.
 
 
 1302
 SRI LANKA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official
 religion and requires the Government "to protect and foster"
 it, it also guarantees the right of all Hindus, Muslims, and
 Christians to practice their religions freely. Most members
 of the majority Sinhalese ethnic group are Buddhists, while
 most Tamils are Hindu. There are Christians from both groups.
 Two cabinet ministers are assigned the additional portfolios
 of Minister of Muslim Affairs and Minister of Hindu Affairs to
 deal with issues involving those minority religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees every citizen "freedom of movement
 and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom
 to return to Sri Lanka." These guarantees are generally
 honored. The present Government removed exit visa
 requirements imposed by its predecessor and now permits
 virtually unimpeded emigration and foreign travel. Many Sri
 Lankans have taken advantage of.this policy to seek jobs
 abroad. According to some estimates, there were 180,000 Sri
 Lankans working abroad in 1986.
 Some Sri Lankans, predominantly young male Tamils, have sought
 refugee status or political asylum abroad on the grounds that
 they are members of a persecuted minority. Despite the
 freedom to return cited in the Constitution, in 1986 there
 were a few cases of returning Tamils being arrested on arrival
 and detained for days while authorities checked their records
 for adverse information.
 Sri Lanka is not a signatory of the U.N. Convention Relating
 to the Status of Refugees.
 Refugees or displaced persons from other countries are
 generally denied entry to Sri Lanka. The Government does not
 permit refugees to stay in the country even while they are
 seeking permanent residence elsewhere. The few prospective
 Afghan refugees who have come to Sri Lanka have been forced to
 live in the transit lounge at the international airport for as
 long as it took--sometimes several months--for U.N. officials
 to locate a recipient country.
 Due to concern that Tamil militants were frequently crossing
 from southern India to northern Sri Lanka via the Palk
 Straits, the Government adopted a series of measures in 1984
 which progressively restricted freedom of movement in that
 area. Expanding the maritime surveillance zone imposed in
 April 1984, in November of that year the Government announced
 a prohibited zone along some 200 miles of Sri Lanka's northern
 coastline. It also imposed a security zone in the entire
 Jaffna peninsula. These measures considerably restricted free
 movement and made it virtually impossible for the large number
 of fishermen in that area to earn their livelihood. Although
 these restrictions were relaxed somewhat in 1985, throughout
 1986 they remained technically in effect under the emergency
 regulations.
 As a result of these various restrictions as well as the fear
 of becoming involved in the spreading communal violence, in
 1986 many Sri Lankans joined the ranks of displaced persons
 from previous years. According to some estimates, 125,000 Sri
 
 
 1303
 SRI LANKA
 Lankans had sought refuge in India as of late 1986. An
 additional 97,000 persons had been displaced from their homes
 and were living with relatives or in camps in Sri Lanka by the
 end of the year. Of these displaced persons, two-thirds were
 Tamil and one-third Sinhalese.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka is an open, working, multiparty democracy. Citizens
 enjoy universal adult suffrage, and voter turnout is generally
 over 80 percent. Traditionally, the UNP and the other major
 political party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), both of
 which draw their-following mainly from the Sinhalese majority
 community, have alternated in forming governments. The
 current UNP Government came to power in the general elections
 of 1977, gaining 51 percent of the popular vote and 83 percent
 of the seats in Parliament. The UNP government formulated a
 new Constitution, adopted by Parliament in 1978, which
 established the office of a directly elected executive
 president and provided for a proportional representation
 system in future parliamentary general elections.
 J.R. Jayewardene became the first President under the 1978
 Constitution and was returned to office in the presidential
 election of 1982, gaining 53 percent of the popular vote. The
 general elections to Parliament due in 1983 were not held.
 Instead, citizens went to the polls in a referendum held in
 December 1982 to vote on a constitutional amendment to extend
 the term of the 1977 Parliament from 6 to 12 years.
 Restrictions were imposed on the activities of opposition
 parties during the referendum campaign, and some voting
 irregularities were reported. The amendment was approved with
 54.5 percent of the votes and Parliament's term now runs until
 1989. UNP candidates have won most of the by-elections since
 1977, but the SLFP candidate won the single by-election held
 in 1986. President Jayewardene's United National Party now
 holds 138 out of 153 occupied seats in the legislature.
 Sri Lanka's political parties represent a variety of political
 views.  Most opposition parties function freely, several
 operate their own newspapers, and the activities of their
 leaders are covered by the media. However, one party, the
 extreme leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), has been
 proscribed since 1983 for alleged involvement in communal
 riots. In addition, the civic rights of the leader of the
 SLFP, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were suspended for 7 years
 from 1980 on the grounds that she exceeded her authority during
 her tenure as Prime Minister from 1970-1977. President
 Jayewardene pardoned her on January 1, 1986.
 Tamils, who comprise approximately 18 percent of the country's
 population, are primarily represented by two parties. The
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) claims to speak for the
 Ceylon Tamils resident in the north and east, and the Ceylon
 Workers Congress (CWC), which is also a trade union, represents
 the Indian Tamils. The President of the CWC serves as a
 minister in the present Government.
 Indian Tamils, who make up about one-third of the country's
 Tamil population, are descended from the Tamils who were
 brought from India in the 19th century to work on the
 plantations. They do not qualify for Indian citizenship under
 Indian law and were denied citizenship under Sri Lankan law at
 independence. Under agreements between the Sri Lankan and
 
 
 1304
 SRI LANKA
 Indian governments in 1964 and 1967 to address the problem of
 the stateless Indian Tamils, many were repatriated to India or
 granted Sri Lankan citizenship. However, after these
 agreements lapsed in 1981, there were at least 150,000
 stateless Indian Tamils remaining. In January 1986, the Sri
 Lankan Government announced that it would grant citizenship to
 all remaining stateless Indian Tamils, and administrative
 processes to complete the procedure were under way at year's
 end.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to adverse reports on its human
 rights situation but generally does not interfere with
 investigations. Senior government officials frequently make
 themselves available to visitors looking into human rights
 issues.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) renewed
 its offer to the Government, as it has for a number of years,
 to provide relief assistance and to visit detainees held under
 the Emergency Regulations and the PTA. The Government at
 year's end had not accepted the ICRC offer.
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights in Sri Lanka. They collect information from families
 of victims or members of citizens' committees near the site of
 alleged incidents. Their periodic reports and appeals for
 change, however, are generally not addressed by the
 Government. Some attorneys represent defendants pro bono in
 those human rights cases which reach the courts. In February
 1986, the Legal Aid Society was founded to provide assistance
 to detainees under the PTA or emergency regulations who are
 unable to afford the cost of legal services.
 In 1986 the Government established a new human rights
 commission, charged with monitoring the human rights situation
 and investigating allegations of discrimination. The findings
 of the new commission will not be legally binding, nor is it
 empowered to advocate redress for victims of discrimination.
 The Commission is intended to function as an ombudsman and is
 scheduled to commence operations in January 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Sri Lankans are ethnically and religiously diverse: 74 percent
 are Sinhalese, mostly Buddhist; 18 percent are Tamils,
 predominantly Hindus; 7 percent are Muslims of varying ethnic
 origins; the remainder consist of Malays, some descendants of
 European colonists, and a small number of aborigines, the
 Veddahs. Of the Tamil population, two-thirds are so-called
 "Ceylon Tamils" whose presence on the island dates back many
 centuries. The rest are "Indian Tamils," whose forebears were
 recruited in India during the last century to work on the tea
 plantations.
 Under the British Colonial Administration prior to 1948,
 Ceylon Tamils held a disproportionate share of influential
 positions in government service, the police, the professions,
 and commerce. With independence, Sinhalese political leaders
 sought to redress what their community regarded as an
 imbalance in favor of Ceylon Tamils; typical of their efforts
 
 
 1305
 SRI LANKA
 was the so-called "Sinhala-only" act of 1956 which made
 Sinhalese the sole official language of the country. For
 Tamils, the act stood for government-sanctioned discrimination
 against them.
 In the Constitution of 1978, Tamil was designated a "national"
 language and its use in government, education, and the courts
 is specifically protected in the Constitution. Nevertheless,
 Tamils have charged that these legal protections are not
 enforced. Members of the Tamil ethnic community charge that
 they suffer from systematic discrimination in competition for
 university entrance, employment opportunities, and other
 matters under government control.
 Members of virtually all of Sri Lanka's ethnic minorities
 occupy prominent positions in all walks of public and private
 life, but since independence the Sinhalese majority has
 steadily strengthened its relative position of influence in
 most sectors of society. Sinhalese government officials have
 denied charges of discrimination against Tamils, pointing out
 that several prominent Tamils occupy a number of senior-level
 civil service positions. In November 1986, a Tamil army
 officer was appointed Chief of Staff of the Sri Lankan Army.
 However, many of these Tamils are approaching retirement age
 and there appear to be fewer Tamils in the lower ranks of the
 civil service and military to take their places.
 Following the May-June series of bombings by Tamil militants
 of civilian targets in the south, many Tamil employees of the
 affected institutions as well as 200 Tamil employees of the
 two television stations were either temporarily furloughed or
 transferred for security reasons. Most of those furloughed
 were subsequently called back to work.
 Religious differences generally are not a basis for
 discrimination. Sri Lankans of every faith are free to
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries, as well
 as to undertake religious travel.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. The various ethnic and
 religious groups have their own strictures, however, which
 place some limitations on women. Some Tamil families believe
 their women members should not be seen working in public.
 Some Muslim women are discouraged by members of their community
 from seeking higher education or employment. Some women fill
 important posts in the civil service, the professions, and
 business, but the majority are found in manual and semiskilled
 jobs and in the home. Women vote in large numbers but
 otherwise play a more limited role than men in the political
 process. There are currently six women members of Parliament,
 including one woman minister of cabinet rank. Sri Lanka had
 the world's first woman Prime Minister.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Under Sri Lankan labor laws, employment of children under age
 12 is prohibited. Those between age 12 and 14 are called child
 workers and may not be employed in industry or dangerous
 occupations; employment of young persons between the ages of
 15 and 18 is subject to certain restrictions. Employees under
 age 18 cannot be required to work outside of specified hours.
 In addition, employers are required to provide annual leave,
 rest periods, and meal breaks. In practice, however, there is
 a child work force, probably numbering at least several
 
 
 1306
 SRI LANKA
 thousand, which works illegally in Sri Lanka, mostly at jobs
 in rice cultivation, as domestics, or as street peddlers.
 Efforts to address this problem have been hampered by the fact
 that, in some cases, child workers are a major source of
 family income.
 There is no minimum wage, but wage boards for 34 different
 trades set minimum wages and working conditions. Actual wages
 and working conditions generally exceed these minimums. Most
 permanent, full-time workers are covered by laws which provide
 that they shall work no more than 45 hours per week, no more
 than 9 hours per day, or no more than 5-1/2 days per week, and
 that they will receive a 14-day paid holiday annually. Minimum
 conditions for the protection of safety and health of workers
 are set forth in legislation passed by Parliament and
 implemented by the Department of Labour, which employs a staff
 of engineers and inspectors for this purpose. The Depart- t
 also educates workers about minimum standards for differ .
 workplaces and encourages the use of safety equipment such as
 earplugs. Workers in the unorganized agricultural sector are
 not covered by labor laws, although the Government may
 investigate individual complaints.
