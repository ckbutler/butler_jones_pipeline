 BANGLADESH
 
 Bangladesh is one of the world's most impoverished and
 overpopulated countries. During the four-year rule of
 the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman' (Mujib), government
 institutions were politicized, the economic situation
 deteriorated, and there were thousands of political
 assassinations. Culminating a series of coups touched
 off by opponents of Mujib, the present government of
 President Ziaur Rahman (Zia) took power as a martial
 law administration in November 1975 but has gradually
 been turning over responsibility to civilian authorities
 in the past year. Under Zia, there has been a modest
 but broad-based improvement in public order, the
 quality of public administration and the economy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence that torture occurs in Bangladesh,
 and recent reports by international hunan rights
 organizations do not allege that it does.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 It is a crime in Bangladesh to coerce or intimidate
 citizens or abuse police powers, but sane physical
 abuse of ordinary prisoners does take place. The
 Bangladesh Government is attempting to 2rmprove the
 discipline and the quality of the personnel in the
 police force. The present government h-s released
 nearly 12,000 prisoners, more than half of these in the
 last six months. This should ame-liorabt the over-
 crowding in the jails and provide more access to
 medical facilities and services now insufficiently
 available to prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonmeit
 Nearly half of the 12,000 detainees whon the Bangladesh
 Government has released since assuming :?ower were
 considered political prisoners. Most o these persons

 had been jailed by previous governments. While
 the Bangladesh Government has never stated how many
 political prisoners it holds, we estimate that up to
 two thousand remain incarcerated. The Zia government
 has arrested more than 100 political figures, including
 former President Mushtaque Ahmed, during the past
 year. However, some of these, including Mushtaque,
 have been accused of non-political crimes such as
 corruption.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 At present, two court systems operate in Bangladesh.
 Civil courts with appropriate guarantees of fair and
 public trials have jurisdiction in most rases; however,
 cases involving treason, sedition, corruption, smug-
 gling, and other charges which are defined as "anti-
 state crimes" fall under the jurisdictioz of martial
 law courts which often hold in camera praceedings.
 Former President Mushtaque Ahmed was triad on three
 separate corruption charges by martial law courts and
 found guilty of two. Following a recent abortive
 military mutiny and coup attempt, several hundred
 mutineers were tried by military tribunals for their
 involvement. The Bangladesh Government las announced
 that 37 of those found guilty have been executed. We
 believe there may have been others.
 According to the martial law ordinances, counsel may
 not appear before the courts on an indivdual's
 behalf, but "friends" may. Under a receat amendment to
 tne ordinances, civilian courts may in some instances
 review the proceedings of the martial lav courts. In
 November 1977, the Bangladesh Government announced the
 release-of a political prisoner after a igh court
 ruled that her detention under emergency powers was
 illegal.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Bangladeshi authorities do not engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home; during the Mujib regime they
 did.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The ability of Bangladesh to carry out programs to
 improve the welfare of its citizens depends in the
 first instance on effective institutions and strong
 leadership. For some time after independence, near
 anarchy prevailed and the Bangladesh Government was
 only gradually able to meet the most basic responsi-
 bility of government, the maintenance of public order.
 Most roving bands of former "freedom fighters" were
 eventually disarmed or integrated with the regular
 military forces, but some armed dissident activity
 continues.
 In the two years since Zia took power, the government
 has made progress -- albeit with occasional setbacks
 -- toward extending control throughout the country,
 bringing discipline to the armed forces, and esta-
 blishing a local infrastructure. Three moderately good
 crop years have contributed to greater stability, owing
 to the close relationship between adequate food and
 political stability.
 Moreover, Bangladesh has been spared its usual quota of
 natural catastrophes in the past few years. This has
 allowed the Bangladesh Government to address the almost
 overwhelming economic problems it faces. There is
 encouraging evidence that President Zia is moving
 to implement economic policies designed to meet the
 basic needs of the vast bulk of the rural population --
 nearly all of whom can be defined as the "poorest of
 the poor". Zia recognizes that their needs can be met
 only through redressing the current serious imbalance
 between rapid population growth and lagging agricul-
 tural productivity. Accordingly, he has set population
 control and food production as the top priorities for
 his government.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The ban on political activities has restricted freedom
 of assembly but has been partially lifted to allow
 political parties banned by Mujib to hold indoor
 political meetings. The right of freedom of expres-
 sion, including freedom'of speech and of the press, has
 been curtailed by the state of emergency and the
 martial law regulations. Since the Zia government came
 to power, however, no newspapers have been forced to
 close. There is a good measure of press self-censor-
 ship, but some newspapers are often critical of the
 government. Strikes are banned under the martial law
 regulations, but other forms of trade union activity
 are permitted. Bangladeshis, including the substantial
 (16%) Hindu minority, enjoy freedom of religion.
 Most of the Hindus who fled their villages for India
 during the troubles of 1971 returned the following year
 and have remained in Bangladesh since then.
 In the traditional Muslim social milieu of Bangladesh
 women play a secondary role to men and are seldom seen
 in public. The 1972 Bangladesh constitution, however,
 provides for equal rights for women in all spheres of
 public'life, and women do hold a few senior government.
 positions, including one at the cabinet level. Presi-
 dent Zia's personal attention recently has been focused
 on addressing the needs of women.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,~
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Bangladeshis, including the "Bihari" (non-Bengali
 Muslim) minority, have freedom of movement within
 Bangladesh. All Bangladeshis who are regarded as
 citizens are entitled to receive passports and travel
 or emigrate abroad. Pakistan has recently agreed to
 let 25,000 "Biharis" travel to Pakistan. A much larger
 number of "Biharis" have applied for "repatriation" to
 Pakistan but Pakistan has not agreed to accept them.

 The Bangladesh Government regards these persons as
 having forfeited their citizenship.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The Zia government, which inherited a situation where
 political activity was banned, has permitted a number
 of political parties to engage in limited government-
 approved activities after government review of their
 backgrounds. The 20 parties which have received such
 permission represent a broad spectrum and include the
 Awami League of the late President Mujib. Three
 parties were declared illegal following an attempted
 coup in early October: the Communist Party of Bangla-
 desh, the radical JSD, and the Democratic League of
 former President Mushtaque. Statements by government
 officials have attempted to link at least the first two
 with involvement in the October, 1977 coup attempt. A
 referendum on President Zia's role was held in May,
 1977 in which he won an overwhelmingly positive vote.
 As part of President Zia's program to install popularly
 elected local government bodies, elections for union
 (groups of villages) councils and municipal councils
 were held in January, August, and September, 1977.
 This restoration of political activity is a prelude to
 general elections which are scheduled for the end of
 1978.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Bangladesh Government has been willing to allow
 independent outside investigation of alleged human
 rights violations. In the spring of 1977, officials of
 Amnesty International received considerable cooperation
 from government officials, in particular Zia. American
 Embassy personnel have discussed both specific and
 general human rights subjects with Bangladesh Govern-
 ment officials, including the President, and have found
 them responsive.
