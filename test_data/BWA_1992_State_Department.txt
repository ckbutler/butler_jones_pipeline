 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. The Constitution vests legislative power in
 the 38-seat National Assembly (Parliament), elected every 5 years, and executive
 power in the President currently Quett Masire, who was reelected in 1989 for a sec-
 ond 5-year term. The President selects his Cabinet from members of the National
 Assembly. While there are several active political parties in Botswana, in practice
 the country's politics are dominated by the governing Botswana Democratic Party
 (BDP). Botswana's courts operate independently of both the legislative and execu-
 tive branches. All citizens, regardless of race, are free to participate in the political
 and economic life of the country.
 The Botswana Defense Force (BDF) numbers about 7,000 soldiers, and the Bot-
 swana National Police (BNP) has about 3,000 members. Both the BDF and BNP are
 subordinate to civilian authority. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed
 analysis, were $62 million. Defense spending has increased as a result of the ongo-
 ing construction of a modern, military air base at Molepolole but is expected to de-
 cline once the base is completed in 1994.

 Botswana's economy is market oriented with strong encouragement for private en-
 terprise. Spurred by diamond revenues, the country's economy has expanded rap-
 idly, with growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) averaging about 9 percent
 annually since 1980. Since independence, per capita GDP has increased from $69
 to the current figure of $2,500. However, more than 50 percent of the population
 lives outside the formal sector, gaining its livelihood from subsistence farming and
 animal husbandry. Furthermore income distribution is heavily skewed, with the top
 20 percent of the population probably earning more than 60 percent of total income,
 while the bottom 40 percent earns as little as 10 percent of the total.
 Botswana's laws and legal system provide for a broad range of individual rights
 and freedoms which are widely observed in practice. However, women face legal and
 traditional discrimination, and public consciousness of these problems and of vio-
 lence against women has only recently been awakened. Remote area dwellers and
 groups not numbered among the eight "principal tribes" identified in the Constitu-
 tion do not enjoy full political rights or full access to social services. There were a
 few instances of game wardens beating suspects in their custody in 1992. Labor en-
 joys the right to organize freely, although trade unions continue to face certain legal
 restrictions. In 1992 the Government clashed with the independent press over the
 publication of leaked government documents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been. no reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were a few instances of game wardens beating suspects in 1992. Such inci.
 dents are condemned by government officials, and officers found to have abused sus-
 pects have been subjected to both internal disciplinary procedures and criminal
 prosecution. In 1992 one warden was prosecuted but subsequently acquitted for lack
 of sufficient evidence. The Government makes special efforts to protect women in
 custody from rape and other abuse. Arrested women are immediately placed in the
 charge of matrons, reducing the potential for mistreatment by male police officers.
 Caning is allowed for certain offenses for men below age 40. Strict conditions reg-
 ulate the size of the cane, require medical examinations of the prisoner before and
 after punishment, and prescribe strokes only across the buttocks. Corporal punish-
 ment for children below 14 is not allowed except under the rubric of "traditional
 punishment," meted out by parents or village headmen.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Faile.-Citizens are protected from arbitrary ar-
 rest under the Constitution. An arresting officer must explain the crime an arrestee
 is accused of and advise that the arrestee has the right to remain silent. An accused
 may contact anyone of his or her choosing. In most cases, a suspect must be charged
 before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. Bail is allowed, and detainees have
 the right to hire attorneys of their choice. Poor communications in rural villages,
 however, make it difficult for detainees to obtain legal assistance.
 Once a suspect has appeared before a magistrate, he or she may be detained only
 if the magistrate issues a writ of detention, valid for 14 days and renewable every
 14 days thereafter. There have been credible complaints, including in 1992, that po-
 lice and rangers from the Department of Wildlife have used the difficulty of commu-
 nications and transport as an excuse to hold suspects longer than the prescribed 48
 hours. In past years, offending police officers have been administratively punished
 or sued succesfuly in civil actions.
 These restrictions on detention do not appl to illegal immigrants (mostly
 Zimbabweans or Zambians). The number of such immigrants rose sharply in 1992
 due to severe drought in neighboring countries. Hundreds of such illegal immigrants
 are found in periodic sweeps by the police and deported, although many are de-
 tained for periods ranging from a few hours to over a year, pending deportation.
 Botswana's Constitution allows the President to declare a person a 'prohibited im-
 migrant" and order deportation, but this provision was not used in 1992. No expla-
 nation is required nor is any normally given, and the order is not subject to judicial
 review. A prohibited immigrant may reenter Botswana only with presidential au-
 thorization.
 Persons charged under the National Security Act (NSA) must be arraigned before
 a magistrate within 96 hours and suspects may be held indefinitely. However, this
 Act has rarely been invoked and was not used in 1992. Security cases are often tried
 under ordinary criminal procedures after an initial hearing.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Botswana's judiciary is independent of the execu-
 tive and legislative branches of government in both law and practice. There has
 never been any evidence of attempts to intimidate or apply undue pressure on
 courts or judges, nor have there ever been reports of the courts being used to intimi-
 date or silence political dissent.
 Botswana has two court systems, the regular courts and the customary (tradi-
 tional) courts. In the regular courts, a defendant's right to due process is provided
 for by law and largely honored in practice, although many defendants are not in.
 formed of their rights in pretrial or trial proceedings. Most trials are held in public,
 and court records are public. However, trials under the National Security Act may
 be held in secret. As a rule, courts appoint public defenders only for those charged
 with capital crimes (murder and treason); lawyers in these cases serve on a pro bono
 basis. Thus, those charged with noncapital crimes are often tried without legal rep-
 resentation if they cannot afford an attorney. However, defendants may in any case
 confront witnesses, present eyidence and are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty. There are clearly defined appeal procedures, which are often employed.
 Customary courts handle land, marital, and property disputes as well as minor
 crimes, but are open only to members of the given tribe. The tribal chief presides
 over the court, and there are no attorneys for either side. Maximum punishment for
 various crimes is limited by the Penal Code. There is a functional appeals process
 also for traditional courts, including the possibility of appeal all the way to the High
 Court.
 No political detainees or prisoners were reported in Botswana in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Privacy
 in family matters and correspondence is respected, and there is no evidence of arbi-
 trary surveillance of persons or their communications. These rights are safeguarded
 by law.
 Court-issued search warrants are required, but police officers of the rank of ser-
 geant and above may enter, search, and seize property provided they believe "on
 reasonable ground" that criminal activity is involved, that evidence would be lost
 or compromised by waiting for a warrant, and that the evidence is later brought be-
 fore a magistrate. In practice, this means that seizures of property are frequently
 made without resort to search warrants. Evidence gained without a warrant is ad-
 missible in court. Judges may and do disqualify such evidence if it can be shown
 that it probably would not have been compromised by taking the time and trouble
 to obtain a proper warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Libertis, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 in the Constitution and respected in practice. Opposition viewpoints and criticism
 of the Government are freely expressed, including in Parliament.
 Although the Botswana Ars Aency (BOPA) is part of the government Depart-
 ment of Information and Broadcasting, bth the Daily News and Radio Botswana
 are run with some degree of autonomy. The Daily News, made available free of
 charge, consists largely of reports of speeches of ministers and other high officials
 and international wire service stories. In addition, there are four independent
 weeklies which have become increasingly aggressive in criticizing senior officials.
 These papers were responsible for breaking the story of likely fraud and malfea-
 sane        dallocation and in the National Housing Authority. While opposition
 parties' activities receive press coverage, the Government media tend to give more
 space to ruling party viewpoints. The independent press gives far more space to op-
 position viewpoints and publishes a wide variety of features.
 In the past, the Government has clashed with the independent press over the re-
 porting and interpretation of national security issues. In mid-1992 the Government
 ordered the publisher of an independent paper to remove an issue from the racks
 because a front-page photo of the President carried an obviously (and humorously)
 incorrect caption. Individual ministers and Members of Parliament have threatened
 suit against another independent paper which had criticized them, and the most vo-
 ciferous of the independent papers is being sued in the courts by the Government
 for publishing what the Government insists is a secret document concerning policy
 toward the grievances of workers then out on strike.
 Books and publications are not censored. Academic reedom is fully respected, al-
 though a recent law severely restricts the right of university students to conduct
 certain kinds of protests on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Botswana has a long history
 of peaceful assembly which is integral to traditional village life and is exemplified
 in the village meeting, the Kgotla, and in frequentl hed political rallies called
 "freedom squares." During Kgotla meetings, men freely question leaders and voice
 
 
 opinions on local and national politics. Traditionally, women do not speak out at
 Kgotlas, but that seems to be changing slowly. Permits are required for public meet-
 ings and demonstrations and are usually granted as long as the police believe public
 order will not be threatened.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. There is no
 state religion, and, while the majority of the population is Christian, Hindus, Mus-
 lims, and Baha'is also practice their faiths freely. There are no restrictions on places
 of worship, the training of members of clergy, religious publishing, religious edu-
 cation, conversion, or participation in charitable activity. There are no restrictions
 against missionary or foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pat-iation.-Botswana has no restrictions on movement within the country, on for-
 eign travel, emigration, or the right of a citizen to return. Passports are easily ob-
 tamed by citizens and are valid for 10 years.
 Refugees documented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) are readily accepted in Botswana but are normally required to live in the
 refugee settlement at Dukwe, in northeastern Botswana, although the Government
 may authorize them to live elsewhere. After the large scale repatriation of South
 Africans in early 1992, the number of refugees in Botswana is down to about 300.
 South Africans continued to be processed as refugees in 1992, but dis p laced persons
 arriving from more distant east and central African countries are frequently de-
 tained as illegal immigrants and are not referred to the UNHCR for possible refugee
 status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Botswana have the right to peacefully change their government through demo-
 cratic means, although in practice one party, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP),
 has dominated Parliament and held the Presidency since independence. Members of
 Parliament are elected by secret ballot and universal suffrage of citizens 21 years
 of age and older, the President is elected by the Parliament.
 In the National Assembly 34 of the 38 members are elected every 5 years; the
 remaining 4 are appointed by the President. In the 1989 elections, the BDP won
 31 of the 34 elective seats. Parliamentary debate is vigorous, and government pli-
 cies are freely criticized as each proposed bill goes through three readings. Me rs
 of Parliament frequently demand that ministers openly define and defend their de-
 partments' policies and performance. New parties are freely formed. There are cur-
 rently eight active political parties, but only two, the BDP and the Botswana Na-
 tional Front (BNF), are represented in Parliament.
 Opposition parties have intensified their calls for electoral reforms to reduce what
 they see as built-in advantages of incumbency. Although the opposition won more
 than 25 percent of the national vote in 1989, it received only 3 seats in Parliament.
 Opposition parties complain that constituencies are gerrymandered, that parties
 other than the BDP must be given a role in the organization and conduct of elec-
 tions, and that the BDP uses appointed seats to district and town councils to undo
 hard-won opposition victories in those local elections.
 The political rights of women and minorities are not restricted by law, but tradi-
 tional patriarchal society has discouraged women from takingpart in politics. Yet,
 women vote in greater numbers than men, and the number of positions, including
 senior posts, held by women in various institutions is increasing. Women hold seats
 in local and district councils and there are two women in Parliament, one of whom
 is the Minister of External Affairs. There are several female senior lecturers atthe
 university, but as yet few women holding professor's rank. Groups living nomadic
 life-styles in remote areas have difficulty participating in the political process and
 are poorly represented in politics (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Government Attitude Toward International and Nongovernmental Inves-
 tigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate openly and independently. The Botswana As-
 sociation for Human Rights, organized in 1989, aims to focus national attention on
 laws needing reform, to heighten public awareness about human rights, and to pres-
 sure the Government to ratify more of the existing international human rights in-
 struments. Independent organizations dealing with the rights of women, the handi-
 capped, the well-being of homeless youths, and rural dwellers are also active.
 The Government also permits international organizations involved in human
 rights advocacy to operate in Botswana, including the International Committee of
 the Red Cross, the UNHCR, and the International Labor Organization. To date,
 there have been no international investigations of human rights violations in Bot-
 
 
 swans, but government representatives have stated that they would cooperate if
 there were such an investigation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Tswana majority, made up of the eight "principal" tribes, has a tradition of
 peacefully cexisting with "minor" tribes, chief among which are the Kalanga, who
 may constitute 25 percent of the pulation. Each of the Tawana tribes is rep
 resented in the House of Chiefs whie other groups are allowed only a subchief.rA
 though ethnic rivalries are not entirely absent, no ethnic group suffers from serious
 discrimination. The most prominent complaint concerns the Government's refusal to
 allow school instruction in minority languages, especially Ikalanga.
 Groups living in remote areas, including the IKpalagadi and the San (the
 Bushmen), do not have full access to government services and legal redress, partly
 because of their distance from settled areas and their nomadic lifestyle. They are
 poorly represented in politics, but some have settled in villages and are gaining bet-
 ter aceess to government services. Government policy on remote area dwellers was
 under review at year's end.
 The Constituti~on and Penal Code forbid discrimination based on color, race, na-
 tionality, or creed but do not mention discrimination based on sex. Moreover, some
 laws and customs have the effect of restricting social and economic opportunities for
 women. For example, women married in common property" become legal minrs
 and may not, without the husband's consent, purchse or sell property or make
 other legally binding agreements. While a woman may enter a binding transaction
 as a pubic trader, she may become a trader only with her husband's consent. Under
 customary law a husband may have additional wives after consulting with his first
 wife and the families, althoulh this practice is dying out.
 Marriage license applications are increasingly acmpanied by explanations of
 marriage "out of common propert"' under which a woman retains the property she
 brings to a marriage as wel as ful dult legal standing ,aftr marriage.
 A married woman is required to obtain her husbandds permission for the use of
 contraceptives or for operations to prevent conception. Abortion is allowed in cases
 of rape incest, when the physical or mental health of a mother is threatened, or
 when te child is likely to suffer grave physical or mental abnormalities. If the
 health of a married couple's child is at risk, or the mother is an unwed minor, abor-
 tion is a family decision. Otherwise, the law does not require consent of the husband
 or father for an abortion.
 The Attorney General maintains that, in general, women have no legal recourse
 in e cse   irian       es. However, a female attorney successfully challenged the
 Citizenship Act, arguing that the law discriminated again  t her by preventing her
 from transmitting Botswana citizenship to her children. The ruling, upheld by the
 High Court in 1992, means the citizenship law must now be rewritten, and many
 other laws may be affected.
 Inheritance laws and customs call for each child to receive a share of an estate
 regardless of sex. The oldest male child receives a larger share because he is respon-
 sib   nde for his widowed mother and minor siblings.
 Domestic violence against women, including rape, is on the increase as Botswana
 society becomes increasingly urbanized. Men have traditionally had the right to
 "chastise" their wives physically, although many now disapprove of the practice. The
 police are reluctant to intervene in marital problems because they are considered
 the famil "s business. Such prblems are still frequently settled by the extended
 family, with the majority of the cases of domestic violence brought to police atten-
 tion ultimately withdrawn at the family's request. While the maximum penalty for
 a convicted rapist is life imprisonment with mandatory corporal punrshment, the av-
 erage sentence is 4 years with corporal punishment.Female genital mutilation (cir-
 cumcision) is now rarely performed and only by a few traditional doctors.
 Concerted government action to improve the status of women has been limited,
 but there is no evidence of particular jobs being reserved for men. Women are in-
 creasingly visible in t urssions and commerce and as laborers. There is a grow-
 ing number of women's organizations. The most active rup is Emang Basadi,
 which seeks to educatewomen about their righ   a es or the enforcement of fa-
 thers' obligations to support their children, and advocates day care in institutions
 that employ large numbers of women, such as the national university and banks.
 In addition, numerous local women's groups are organized for self-help.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to establish or join
 trade unions with the exception of pensionable government employees. These gov-
 ernment workers may form associations which function as quasi-unions but lack the
 
 
 17
 right to negotiate wages. Unions are well developed in mining, railways, banking,
 and among government blue-collar workers. There is one major confederation of
 trade unions, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFFU). Trade unions in.
 Botswana are independent of government control or party affiliation and actively
 seek to represent their members' interests. Unions may employ administrative sta
 but Botswana law requires elected union officials to work full time in the industry
 the union represents. This severely limits union leaders' effectiveness and has been
 criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), with
 which the BFTU is affiliated.
 In addition, the law severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theo-
 retically possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but, in practice, none of
 the country's past strikes has been legal. There were no strikes in 1992-. The Gov-
 ernment Manual Workers Union, having unsuccessfully struck in late 1991 for a
 large wage increase, is now claiming in a law suit that the Government reneged on
 an areement to grant the raise.
 Unions freely ,join international organizat'ons, and labor representatives regularly
 attend international conferences. After extensive testimony from employers and
 trade unions, the 1992 session of Parliament amended the Trade Union and Em-
 ployers' Organizations Act, rescinding the right of the Minister of Labor to have a
 representative attend meetings of union decisionmaking bodies. The Minister must
 ate approve any afliation with an outside labor movement, but unions may now
 appealito the courts if an application to join or form an amalgamation is refused.
 Uniion officials and members can now receive foreign sholars *ips and travel ex-
 penses without government permission.
 b. The Right to _Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-Although employers are re-
 quired under the Trade Union Act to bargain with any trade union that organizes
 at et 25 percent of the work fore in a gven industry, in practice, a unions abil-
 ity to bring employers to the bargaining taxble depends on its overall strength. Col-
 lective bargaining is common in the mining sector, where trade unions are strong,
 but is virtually nonexistent in most others.
 Public sector salary levels set under the Government's incomes policy used to
 serve as a benchmark for private sector wages, but that policy was voided by Par-
 liament in 1990. Since then, private sector pay raises and inflation indexing have
 had to be negotiated directly with employers. Although the law prohibits employers
 from dismissing workers for union activities, enforcement is uneven. Dismissals may
 be appealed tol abor officers or civil courts, but labor officers rarely d much more
 than prescribe 2 months' severance pay.
 Labor law and practice in Botrwana's only export processing zone, in Selebi-
 Phikwe, is the same as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compsory Labor.-Neither forced nor compulsory
 labor is practiced in Botswana, and both are specifically forbidden by the Constitu-
 tion.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment fChidren.-.The employment of children under
 ag 13 by anyone except members of the child's immediate i   is strictly prohib-
 ited. No juvenile under the ag of 16 may be employed in any industry, and only
 those over 16 may be employed in night work. No persen 18 or younger is permitted
 to work in any haardusjob, including mini ng.naddition, young people may not
 be recruited for jobs outside the country. Scattered violations of ag standards occur
 in small family firms and in the informal sector as the Department of Labor is in-
 sufficiently staffed to enforce strict compliance by small enterprises. Although edu-
 cation is not compulsory, it is almost universally available, and most children attend
 school at least thrugh the seventh grade.The Government is rapidly making 9
 years of free public education universally available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum monthly wages are established by
 law for al but agricultural and domestic workers. The levels vary by industry and
 the type of joba an re enforced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The
 lowest minimum is barely adequate for one person to maintain a decent standard
 of living in an urban environment. In most cases, workers must supplement this
 with a second job or subsistence farming. Most families have more than one wage
 earner.
 The law mandates a maximum 48-hour workweek with prvisions for overtime
 pay (time and a halt) after 48 hours. Most major employers use the standard work-
 week, but some smaller firms do not pay overtime, and action is seldom taken
 against them.
 The Government establishes basic job health and safety standards to which most
 industries adhere, although compliance by construction firms is sometimes lax. Nev-
 ertheless, industrial accident rates are not high on the whole. Though the Govern-
 ment employs a corps of safety and health inspectors, enforcement of safety stand-
 
 
 ards, which is a shared responsibility of the Ministries of Labor, Mines, and Health,
 is hampered by inadequate stafling. While workers who complain about hazardous
 cnditions are legally protected from dismissal, enforcement of this protection has
 .   een uneven.
