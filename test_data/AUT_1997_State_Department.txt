 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional democracy with a federal parliamentary form of gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary. Citizens choose their representatives in peri-
 odic, free, and fair multiparty elections.
 The police are subordinated to the executive and judicial authorities. The national
 police maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external security.
 Austria's highly developed, market-based economy, with its mix of technologically
 advanced industry, modern agriculture, and tourism affords its citizens a high
 standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 There were occasional reports of abuse by police. Legislation went into effect to in-
 crease protection for women against domestic violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punlshment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, government statistics for 1996
 showed 235 complaints against federal police officials for illegal violations of per-
 sonal freedoms, such as intimidation, threats, abuse, and mistreatment. Comparable
 statistics for prior years are not available.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government is a
 arty to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fun-
 amental Freedoms, which includes a provision for human rights monitoring mis-
 sions. In individual cases, investigating judges or prison directors have jurisdiction
 over questions of access to the defendant.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours, except that in cases of charges of "aggressive behavior" an investigative
 
 
 964
 judge may within that period decide to grant a prosecution request for detention up
 to 2 years pending completion of an investigation. The grounds required for such
 investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for bail. The inves-
 tigative judge is required to evaluate an investigative detention at 2 weeks, 1
 month, and every 2 months afer the arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this prvision in practice. The judicary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famly, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice, although strin-
 gent slander lws tend to discourage reports of police brutality. Publcations may
 be removed from circulation if they violate legal prvisions concerning morality or
 public security, but such cases are extremely rare.
 The government monopoly in television and national radio is gradually being dis-
 mantled. A law passed in 1993 permitted licensing of regional private radio stations,
 but implementation of the law was delayed due to lega    enges by unsuccessful
 applicants for licenses. A private radio station, however, has now opened in Styria
 and another in Salzburg. R written radio frequency rules are schedledtogo into
 effect in October. Similar stps are expected for television in coming years.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, except for Nazi organizations and activities (an
 exception stipulated also in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955). The law on the for-
 mation of associations states that permission to form an organization may be denied
 if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal activities of a prohib-
 ited organization.
 c. Freedom of Relfgion.-The Constitution generally provides for freedom of reli-
 gion of individuals. The status of religious organizations, however, is governed by
 the 1874 "Law on Recognition" of churches. Officially, 75.3 percent of the populace
 is Roman Catholic, and there are 11 other recognized religious organizations.
 Religious recognition under the 1874 law has wide-ranging implications, e.g., the
 authority to participate in the stat-collected religious taxation program, engage f
 religious education, and import religious workers to act as ministers, missionaries,
 or teachers. Although in the past nonrec nized religious groups have had problems
 obtaining resident permits for foreign religious workers, administrative procedures
 adopted in 1997 partially have addressed this problem.
 Previously, some nonrecognized religious groups were able to organize as legal en-
 tities or associations, although this route has not been universally available. Some
 groups even have done so while applying for recognition as religious communities
 under the 1874 law. Many such applications for recognition have languished in the
 Education Ministry, in some cases for years. Following years of bureaucratic delay
 and an administrative court order instructing the Education Ministry to render a
 decision, the Ministry denied in July the request for recognition of Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses. Jehovah's Witnesses appealed this decision to the Administrative Court.
 In December Parliament passed a new law that allows nonrecognized religious
 gioups to seek official status as confessional communities without many of the bene-
 fits available to recognized religions. To apply groups must have 300 members and
 submit to the Government their written statutes, describing the goals, rights, and
 obligations of members, membership regulations, officials, and Financing. Groupa
 also must submit a written version of their religious doctrine, which must difer
 from that of any existing religion recognized under the 1874 law or registered under
 the new law, for a determination that their basic beliefs do not violate public secu-
 rity, public order, health and morals, or the rights and freedoms of citizens. The new
 law also sets out additional criteria for eventual recognition according to the 1874
 law, such as a 20 year observation period (at least 10 of which must be as a group
 organized a a   confessional community under the new law) and membership equal-
 ing at least two one-thousandths of the Austrian population. Many religious groups
 and independent congregations do not meet the 300-member threshold for registra-
 tion under the new law, and only Jehovah's Witnesses currently meet the higher
 membership requirement for recognition under the 1874 law.
 Proponents of the law describe it as an opportunity for religious groups to become
 officially registered as religious organizations, providing them with a government
 
 
 "quality seal." Numerous religious groups not recognized by the State, as well as
 some religious law experts, however, dismiss the purported benefits of obtaining sta-
 tus under the new law and have complained that the new law's additional criteria
 for recognition under the 1874 law obstruct claims to recognition and formalize a
 second-class status for nonrecognized groups. Experts have questioned the new law's
 constitutionality.
 In 1997 the Government continued its information campaign against religious
 sects considered potentially harmful to individuals and society. As part of this cam-
 paign, the Family Ministry published a widely distributed brochure describing the
 potential dangers of membership in various nontraditional religious groups. The
 Family Minister publicly declared his determination to combat dangerous religious
 groups.
 In August the Austrian People's Party (OeVP) decided that party membership is
 incompatible with membership in a sect. Understanding that he would be expelled
 as a consequence of this decision if he did not withdraw from either Scientology or
 the party, a local OeVP politician resigned from the party and abandoned plans for
 running on the OeVP ticket in October local elections. In July a national OeVP poli-
 tician was criticized heavily across the political spectrum for his friendship with the
 local politician.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement, including emigration.
 Citizens who leave the country have the right to return at any time.
 Austria has signed the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status
 of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, but subscribes to the "safe country" concept,
 which requires asylum seekers who have entered illegally to depart and seek refu-
 gee status from outside the country. In response to continuing criticism by the office
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other human-
 itarian organizations, the Government passed an amendment to the 1991 asylum
 law in July designed to bring some improvements to the "safe country" rule and the
 appellate procedure. The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other hu-
 manitarian organizations in assisting refugees and relies upon UNHCR information
 to determine safe countries." Individuals found to be true refugees by government
 authorities are not sent back to the countries from which they have fled.
 The Government provides "temporary protected status," similar to first asylum,
 to refugees who fled fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those who arrived between
 April 1992 and July 1993 were granted protected states and provided government
 assistance without having to file asylum applications. The government assistance
 program for Bosnian war refugees in temporary protected status has been extended
 until July 31, 1998 for certain categories of refugees. Under this program, those
 whose temporary protected status expires and who have not been integrated into
 the society maybe required to depart.
 Asylum applications rose in 1996 by 1,000 over the previous year to 6,991, while
 the approval rate declined, with 716 applications approved. This figure includes asy-
 lum seekers from Iraq (183), Iran (136), the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (92),
 Bosnia-Herzegovina (69), and Vietnam (55).
 There is no reported or observed pattern of abuse of refugees. Following criticism
 of conditions in detention centers in 1996, the Government promised to take steps
 to improve them; no new criticism was reported.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their Tev-
 ermient. Citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair e ec-
 tions held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Approximately 26 percent of the members of Parliament and 4 of 16 cabinet mem-
 bers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. In some cases, they
 have been dissatisfied with the information authorities have supplied in response
 to specific complaints.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for protection against any of these kinds of discrimination in
 employment, provision of welfare benefits, and other matters, and the Government
 generally enforces its provisions effectively.
 
 
 966
 Women.-Official data for 1996 show 11,932 reported cases of violence against
 women, of which 470 were rapes and 373 other sexual assaults. Police and judges
 enforce laws against violence- however, less than 10 percent of abused women are
 estimated to file complaints. 6n May 1, a law on the "Protection of the Family" went
 into force that empowers police officials to expel abusive family members from fam-
 ily homes and prohibit them from returning for a 7-day period. This period can be.
 extended to as long as 3 months by a court order.
 Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women are still
 prohibited by law from night work in most occupations. Although this ban is some-
 times used as a pretext for not hiring women, it is supported by the Women's Affairs
 Ministry and women's organizations. (Nurses, taxi drivers, and a few other occupa-
 tions are exempted from this ban.) According to a 1994 ruling by the European
 Court of Justice, a sex-based prohibition of nighttime work is not permissible. The
 Government has been granted a transition period until 2001 to adapt its legislation
 to gender-neutral European Union regulations, but at year's end, legislation revising
 this prohibition was still pending.
 An April petition drive to force discussion of women's rights in the Parliament
 drew 645,000 signatures. The exclusion of women from the culturally important Vi-
 enna philharmonic orchestra ended, although only one female member has been ac-
 cepted into the orchestra.
 In addition to the federal Women's Affairs Ministry, a federal Equality Commis-
 sion and a federal Commissioner for Equal Treatment oversee laws prescribing
 equal treatment of men and women. Sixty percent of women between the ages of
 15 and 60 are in the labor force. Despite substantial gains in women's incomes, they
 average 20 percent lower than those of men. Although women still are not allowed
 in the military, the Government made a policy decision to integrate women into the
 military as soon as implementing laws are passed. On December 11, Parliament
 passed a legislative packa e that cleared the way for the entry of women into the
 military. The target date lor entry of the first female volunteers is April 1, 1998.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service, they remain underrepresented there. To remedy this circumstance, a 1993
 law requires hiring women of equivalent qualifications ahead of men in civil service
 areas in which less than 40 percent of the employees are women; but there are no
 penalties for failure to attain the 40 percent target.
 Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their sex. The Labor Court can also award com-
 pensation fom employers to victims of sexual harassment.
 Women's rights organizations are partly politically affiliated, and partly autono-
 mous groups. n voicing their concerns, they receive wide public attention.
 Children.-Laws protect the vast majority of children's rights established in inter-
 national conventions and in some respects go beyond them. Each provincial govern-
 ment and the federal Ministry for Youth and Family Affairs has an "Ombudsperson
 for Children and Adolescents" whose main function is to resolve complaints about
 violations of rights of children.
 While 9 years of education are mandatory for all children, beginning at age 6, the
 Government also provides free education through the level of technical or vocational
 programs or university. Educational opportunity is equal for girls and boys. Com-
 prehensive, government-financed medical care is available for all children without
 regard to gender.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children, although heightened public
 awareness of abuse has led the Government to increase its efforts to monitor the
 issue and prosecute offenders. Reports of suspected sexual abuse of children in 1996
 increased by 13 percent over 1995"to 738; the number of related convictions rose
 from 260 to 339. This increase is generally held to be a result of increased aware-
 ness and reporting.
 Stricter regulations on child pornography went into effect on March 1. Under the
 new laws, any citizen engaging in child pornography in a foreign country becomes
 punishable under Austrian law even if his actions are not punishable in the country
 vhere he committed this violation. The new laws also entail more severe provisions
 for possession, trading, andprivate viewing of pornographic materials. For example,
 exchanging videos is now illegal even if done privately rather than as a business
 transaction. There was no prosecution of the suspected Austrian-Slovak child por-
 nography ring reported in 1996.
 People WithDisabilities.-Disabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education, and employment. In July the Parliament passed an
 amendment to the Constitution explicitly requiring the State to provide for equal
 rights for the disabled "in all areas of everyday life." The law requires all private
 enterprises and state and federal government offices to employ 1 disabled person for
 
 
 every 25 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work. Employers who do not
 meet this requirement must pay a fee to the Government, and the proceeds help
 finance services for the disabled such as training programs, wage subsidies, and
 workplace adaptations. No federal law mandates access for the physically disabled;
 some public buildings are virtually inaccessible for those unable to climb stairs.
 Mentally retarded females can be involuntarily sterilized at the request of par-
 ents, in the case of minors, or, in the case of adults, by request of the responsible
 family member or by court order. One political party called for more restrictive leg-
 islation to make it more difficult to sterilize mentally retarded women. In July Par-
 liament passed a constitutional amendment explicitly committing the state to secure
 equal rights for the disabled "in all areas of everyday life."
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to a government report on right-
 wing extremism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia, the number of complaints and inci-
 dents dropped by 40 percent, from 482 in 1995 to 290 in 1996. Thirty-two cases re-
 sulted in criminal sentences. The arrest and imprisonment in recent years of leading
 rightwing extremists is generally credited for the downward trend. In August the
 Anti-Defamation League opened an office for central and eastern Europe in Vienna.
 The European Union planned to open an office against racism and xenophobia in
 Vienna but by year's end, it had not done so.
 Legislation was passed in October to provide law enforcement agencies with ex-
 panded investigative tools, such as electronic eavesdropping, merging of data bases,
 and witness protection programs. Criminal investigations begun in 1995 against
 three Austrians for spreading fascist and extreme rightwing propaganda through
 the Internet were still pending at year's end.
 Religious Minorities.-In the cases of desecration of Jewish cemeteries in Rechnitz
 and Hollabrunn in May and November 1996, respectively, children and adolescents
 unaware of the gravity of their crime were found to be the perpetrators. The second
 suspect in the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Eisenstadt in 1993 has not
 been apprehended.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice trade unions have an important and independent voice in
 the political, social, and economic life of the country. Fifty-two percent of the work
 force was organized into 14 national unions, all belonging to the Austrian Trade
 Union Federation (0GB), which has a highly centralized leadership structure. Indi-
 vidual unions and the 0GB are independent of government or political party control,
 although formal factions within these organizations are closely allied with political
 parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided in the Constitution or in
 national legislation, it is universally recognized. Historically, strikes have been com-
 paratively few and usually of short duration. This year there was one strike by em-
 ployees of the Finance Ministry. A major reason for the record of labor peace is the
 unofficial system of "social partnership" among labor, management, and govern-
 ment. At the center of the system is the Joint Parity Commission for Wages and
 Prices, which has an important voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. Almost all large companies, private or state-owned,
 are organized. Worker councils operate at the enterprise level, and workers are enti-
 tled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory boards of major
 ompanies. Collective agrements overing wages, benefits, and working conditions
 are negotiated by the OGB with the National Chamber of Commerce and its associa-
 tions, which represent the employers. Wage and price policy guidelines are set by
 the Joint Parity Commission. A 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more
 than five employees to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employers found guilty of this offense are required to reinstate work-
 ers. Labor and business representatives remain in longstanding disagreement over
 how to comply with the obligation under the International Labor Organization's
 Convention 98 to provide legal protection to employees against arbitrary dismissals
 in firms with five employees or fewer.
 Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees regarding job-related
 matters are handled by a special arbitration court for social affairs. The OGB is ex-
 clusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leadership of the Chamber of
 Labor, the Chamber of Commerce, and the 0GB are elected democratically.
 There are no expert processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children
 and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Chid Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum legal working age is 15 years. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor
 Inspctorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Government has adopted laws
 and policies to protect children from exploitation in the work place. The law pro-
 hibits forced ana bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimums by job classi-
 fication for each industry. The generally accepted unofficial minimum gross income
 is $14,000 per year. Every worker is entitled to a variety of generous social benefits.
 The average citizen has a high standard of living, and even the minimum wages
 are sufficient to permit a decent living for workers and their families.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements
 that set the workweek at 38 or 38/2 hours.
 Extensive legislation, regularly enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, provides for mandatory occupational health and safety standards.
 Workers may file complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which may
 bring suit against the employer on behalf of the employee, but this option is rarely
 exercised, as workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which file
 suits on their behalf.
 The Labor Codeprovides that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 a job if they fear serious, immediate danger to life and health" without incurring
 any prejudice to their job or career.
