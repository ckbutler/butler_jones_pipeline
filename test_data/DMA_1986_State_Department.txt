 DOMINICA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Dominica has a system of
 parliamentary democracy dating back to British colonial rule
 before 1978. Prime Minister Eugenia Charles and the governing
 Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) won the July 1980 general
 elections and were reelected to a second term in July 1985.
 Both elections were free, fair and open; voter participation
 was heavy, which has become traditional in Dominica. The
 opposition Democratic Labour Party (DLP) formed a coalition
 with a number of smaller opposition groups before the 1985
 elections and won 43 percent of the popular vote.
 Since the Dominica Defence Force was disbanded in 1981
 following two violent coup attempts, the police are the only
 security force in Dominica. A small police Special Service
 Unit (SSU) has been organized and provided some light infantry
 training, and a Marine Wing has been organized within the
 police force to function as a coast guard. Both the SSU and
 the Marine Wing are supervised by the Commissioner of Police.
 Dominica is among the least developed nations in the Eastern
 Caribbean. Although it has largely recovered from hurricane
 damage sustained in 1979 and 1980, economic growth and
 development remain sluggish. With the assistance of foreign
 donors, the Government is encouraging foreign investment and
 rehabilitating critical economic infrastructure. Unemployment
 and underemployment are Dominica's major economic and social
 problems.
 Dominica's human rights record remained good during 1986 with
 no reports of significant violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports in 1986 of torture or cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. In August 1985, six
 Dominican policemen were charged with manslaughter in
 connection with the 1981 death of John Rose Lindsay. Lindsay,
 a Dominican national, was arrested by the police and found
 dead hours later at the bottom of a cliff. Three of the six
 policemen were acquitted and the remaining three were expected
 to be tried before the end of 1986. Six other policemen were
 suspended from duty and reprimanded for alleged misconduct in
 connection with Lindsay's death. Manslaughter charges in the
 Lindsay case were the result of an official government inquiry.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Dominican law requires that persons arrested or detained be
 charged with a crime within 24 hours or released from

 DOMINICA
 custody. This requirement is honored in practice. There were
 no reports of arbitrary arrest or exile in 1986.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not known to take place in
 Dominica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is provided before an independent, impartial
 court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the right of
 appeal on legal or procedural matters. Indigent criminal
 defendants are provided legal counsel only in capital cases.
 In November 1985, former Prime Minister Patrick John was
 convicted on charges of treason for his role in a 1981 coup
 attempt. John was represented by legal counsel, and was free
 on bail during the court proceedings. He was sentenced to 14
 years in prison and is now serving his sentence. Unable to
 take his case to the Privy Council in London for financial
 reasons, John appealed his conviction to the Eastern Caribbean
 Supreme Court, which denied the appeal. Having been elected
 to Dominica's Parliament in July 1985, John was required by
 law to resign the seat following his conviction.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 or Correspondence.
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. There were no reports in 1986 of arbitrary
 government intrusions into the private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution establishes the right of free expression,
 which is affirmed in practice. The political opposition
 freely criticizes the Government. Dominica's only radio
 station is state owned, and the principal newspaper is
 independent but generally favors the ruling DFP party.
 The opposition DLP staged a boycott of Parliament in August
 1985 to protest the Government's decision to end live
 broadcasts of parliamentary sessions. In May 1986, the DLP's
 elected representatives resumed attending parliamentary
 sessions, but continued to limit their participation. In
 response, the Government beginning in July 1986 withheld the
 salaries of DLP parliamentarians for failure to participate in
 debates. The opposition plans to take legal action to force
 the Government to pay the salaries. The Government has
 indicated that it will abide by a court ruling on the issue.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association and the freedom to assemble are honored
 without exception. Opposition groups hold rallies, meetings,
 and conventions without hindrance from the Government.
 Labor has the right to organize, to bargain collectively, and
 to strike. Labor unions are independent, but are not a
 significant political force owing to small membership.
 The Banana Growers Association and the Civil Service
 
 
 DOMINICA
 Association are strong organizations which play a significant
 political role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Dominicans are primarily Roman Catholics or Anglicans, but a
 small Muslim community also exists. There have been periodic
 allegations of police harassment of members of the Rastafarian
 cult, usually for narcotics-related offenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation.
 These rights are guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Dominica has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have clear political choices and opportunities
 through free elections to change their government. The
 governing DFP and opposition DLP represent a broad political
 spectrum. In the July 1985 general elections, the DFP won 15
 seats in the House of Assembly, while the remaining 6 seats
 were won by the DLP and a small affiliated party. The
 opposition has since lost two seats--one in a by-election
 following the resignation of Patrick John, and the second
 after the resignation of a DLP parliamentarian.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to complaints about human rights
 violations. No international human rights organizations have
 branch offices in Dominica. The Dominica National Workers
 Union's Human Rights Committee occasionally has published
 allegations of human rights violations in Dominica. The union
 is not affiliated with any recognized labor organization and
 has not negotiated or represented its members in any labor
 contracts or agreements. It charged that the June 1986
 execution of former Deputy Defence Force Commander Frederick
 Newton constituted a human rights violation. Newton and five
 Defence Force members were tried, convicted, and condemned to
 hang for their participation in a December 1981 attack on
 police headquarters in which a policeman was killed. A
 clemency board commuted the death sentences of the five
 Defence Force members to life imprisonment and left Newton's
 sentence unchanged. Newton was represented by defense counsel
 provided at government expense, and decided not to file a
 final appeal to the Privy Council in London.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Dominican law does not restrict the role of women in the
 nation's public or social life. The traditional role of
 women, once limited to the home and family, is changing
 rapidly, although a pattern of domestic violence and sexual
 harassment including rape remains common in the society.
 While statistics are unavailable, religious and other social
 welfare organizations estimate that over half the women in
 Dominica experience some form of domestic or sexual violence
 before age 20. Government efforts at public education and
 awareness appear to be reducing the incidence of such violence.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age is 14. The standard work week
 is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are given a minimum of 2 weeks
 annual vacation. An occupational health and safety law in
 keeping with ILO standards was passed in 1984. A minimum wage
 is established by law.
