 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is ruled by President Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, the former chairman of
 the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) that seized power in a mili-
 tary coup in 1994, deposing the democratically-elected government of Sir Dawda
 Jawara. Jammeh resigned his military commission and was elected president in
 controversial elections in September 1996, which observers considered neither free
 nor fair. Three of the 13 members of the Cabinet are retired army officers who were
 Jammeh's allies during or immediately following the coup, and the security forces
 continue to exert strong influence in the Government. In January 1997, the Con-
 stitution of the Second Republic came into effect, restoring formal constitutional
 government, and citizens chose a National Assembly in elections whose results gen-
 erally were accepted by the opposition. Jammeh's party, the Alliance for Patriotic
 Reorientation and Construction (APRC), won 33 of the 45 Assembly seats filled by
 election. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however, the judici-
 
 
 ary reportedly is subject at times to executive branch pressure, especially at lower
 levels, but the courts have demonstrated their independence on occasion.
 The Gambian National Army (GNA) reports to the Secretary of State for Defense
 (who is now the President). The police report to the Secretary of State for the Inte-
 rior. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA), established in 1995 by government de-
 "cree, reports directly to the President but is otherwise autonomous. Members of the
 security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 The Gambia's population of 1.3 million is divided between a rural majority and
 a rapidly growing urban minority. Much of the population is engaged in subsistence
 farming; the country's farmers, a majority of whom are women, grow rice, millet,
 corn, and groundnuts, the country's primary export crop. The private sector, led by
 tourism, trading, and fisheries, has rebounded from a number of external shocks
 and is experiencing modest growth. A high population growth rate dilutes the posi-
 tive effect of economic expansion. Per capita gross domestic product is estimated to
 be $360.
 There continued to be serious problems in the Government's human rights record;
 the human rights situation improved in a few areas but worsened in others. Presi-
 dent Jammeh's dominance and restrictions on opposition parties continued, and in
 practice citizens still do not have an effective right to change their government. Se-
 curity forces sometimes beat or otherwise mistreat detainees and prisoners. An
 agent of the State beat an opposition politician. Two individuals detained, but not
 charged, for participation in a November 1994 coup attempt were released; however,
 there were credible reports that these and other individuals accused of security of-
 fenses had been subjected to beatings and other harsh treatment while in prison.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Security forces at times arbitrarily arrested and
 detained citizens. The courts reportedly are responsive to executive branch pressure,
 particularly at lower levels, although they demonstrated their independence by rul-
 ing against the Government in some instances. However, in March police defied a
 High Court order to cease denying meeting permits to the leading opposition party
 (subsequently the police have obeyed the order). The Constitution declares illegal
 the prosecution of any member of the AFPRC for any official act or omission in the
 performance of official duties following the 1994 coup. The Government at times in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights; the right to transfer funds or assets remained re-
 stricted for some senior officials of the former Jawara government. The Government
 significantly limits freedom of speech and of the press. Government intimidation led
 journalists to practice self-censorship. The Government restricted freedom of assem-
 bly and association. The opposition United Democratic Party (UDP) frequently was
 denied permission to hold public rallies. Although opposition forces were active and
 vocal in the National Assembly, a standing order forbade parliamentarians from
 criticizing the Head of State in their debates or discussing any matter before the
 courts. Although formal constitutional rule was restored in 1997, some constitu-
 tional provisions have not been respected in practice and others have not been test-
 ed in the courts. An apparently unconstitutional ban on political activity by some
 politicians and political pdrties remains in effect and has not been subject to judicial
 review. The Government at times limited freedom of movement; the right to travel
 for some senior officials of the former Jawara government remained restricted. The
 Government also withheld passports from at least two current opposition politicians,
 and the Secretary of State for the Interior publicly defended these practices. Dis-
 crimination and violence against women persists. The practice of female genital mu-
 tilation (FGM) is widespread and entrenched. Child labor is common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMLAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 No action was taken against a group of soldiers who shot and killed a man on
 a beach in October 1997, despite assurances by the Department of State for Defense
 that the matter would be "judiciously and expeditiously addressed."
 The circumstances of the death of Yaya Drammeh, a rebel accused of treason, in
 May 1997 have not been explained publicly.
 On July 27, the Secretary of State for the Interior told the National Assembly
 that there had been no progress in his department's investigation of the 1995 death
 of former Finance Minister Ousman Koro Ceesay.
 There also were likewise no reported developments concerning the 1995 death of
 Sadibou Haidara, a member of the junta that seized power in 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 167
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or inhuman or degrading punishment; however, se-
 curity forces sometimes beat or otherwise mistreated detainees and prisoners. In
 May an agent of the State severely beat opposition politician Lamin Waa Juwara
 in the presence of police. There were also reports that security forces beat military
 and security detainees, and that security prisoners sometimes are threatened with
 summary execution. For example, on, of three former soldiers who staged an abor-
 tive raid on a military post in 1997 claimed that while in detention he was threat-
 ened with execution, tied and beaten, and burned with cigarettes by his interroga-
 tors. The court rejected these allegations. Two soldiers released in October after
 being held without charges since 1994 (see Section 1.d.) reportedly were beaten and
 treated harshly while in detention.
 There were no developments in the promised investigation of the detention and
 torture of eight United Democratic Party (UDP) officials in 1997. At the time of the
 incident, the Government promised a full investigation and appropriate action by
 the Attorney General. Since the incident, police investigators have interviewed some
 witnesses, but some victims say that they have not been contacted. No one has been
 arrested and no results of the investigation have been made public.
 There were no further developments in the case of the reported detention and se-
 vere beating of UDP member Yaya Sanneh in July 1997.
 Prison conditions at Mile 2 and Janjanbureh prisons remained poor. Mile 2 prison
 was reported to be austere, overcrowded, and lacking in medical facilities. Prisoners
 are locked in their cells for over 20 hours each day. There were credible reports of
 beatings, malnourishment, and other harsh treatment of political, military, and se-
 curity detainees. Women are housed separately.
 Conditions in one representative local jail were reportedly unsanitary and over-
 crowded. Inmates slept on cement benches or the floor with no blankets. There was
 one water tap in the cell area, but often no water.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross visited Mile 2 prison in 1998. Local
 NGO's also generally are permitted to visit prisons upon request, but by year's end
 there were no visits by the African Center for Democracy and Human Rights Stud-
 ies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes provisions to
 provide protections against arbitrary arrest and detention; however, on occasion, se-
 curity forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. Periods of detention ranged
 from a few hours to several days. Two soldiers held without charges since 1994 for
 suspected involvement in a coup attempt were released in October. However, there
 were credible reports that they had been subjected to beatings and other harsh
 treatment.
 The Government has not revoked formally military decrees enacted prior to the
 current Constitution, which give the NIA and the Secretary of State for Interior
 power to detain individuals indefinitely without charge. The Government has stated
 that it no longer enforces these decrees, and in general, the Government appears
 not to enforce them. However, the Constitution provides that such decrees remain
 in effect unless inconsistent with its provisions. The decrees appear to be inconsist-
 ent with constitutional guarantees, but have not yet been subject to judicial chal-
 lenge. In some instances, the Government did not respect the constitutional require-
 ment that detainees be brought before a court within 72 hours.
 In February the proprietor of the Independent Citizen FM radio station was held
 without charges for 4 days (see Section 2.a.). In May 10 persons, including UDP
 leader Lamin Waa Juwara and the imam of the largest mosque in Brikama, were
 arrested in a politically charged dispute over minor construction work at 'a mosque
 in Brikama. None of those arrested was charged within the constitutionally required
 72-hour period. Charges against five ofthose detained were dropped, although four
 still face charges of damaging public property. At ear's end, the four were not in
 detention, and their trial was ongoing. UDP party leader Ousainou Darboe was de-
 tained for several hours on May 20 while security agents searched his vehicle for
 illegal weapons. In August three journalists were detained for questioning about a
 newspaper story, but they were released without charges within 72 hours (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.). In November six members of the UDP were arrested and detained for
 holding a political meeting without a permit, but they were released within 24 hours
 (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government has made no progress in investigating the detention and torture
 of eight UDP activists in 1997 (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government did not exile opponents. However, former President Jawara re-
 mains outside the country under threat of arrest and detention on corruption
 charges if he returns. Other senior officials of the former government, for example.,
 Vice President Saihou Sabally, and Secretary General Abdou Sara Janha, also re-
 
 
 main outside the country but do not face official charges. A Nigerian journalist
 whose work appeared frequently in the independent observer newspaper was de-
 tained and deported in June (see Section 2.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public THal.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary is reportedly subject at times to executive branch pres-
 sure, especially at the lower levels. There was one instance in which the police de-
 fied a High Court order to permit a meeting by the opposition UDP. The courts nev-
 ertheless have demonstrated their independence on several occasions. In 1997 the
 Court of Appeal, the country's highest court, overturned the treason convictions and
 death sentences of four men who led an abortive coup in November 1996. The Gov-
 ernment is appealing this decision to- the Privy Council in London. In March the
 High Court ordered the Inspector General of Police to cease denying meeting per-
 mits to the leading opposition party because doing so violated constitutional provi-
 sions of free assembly and expression. Nevertheless, police prevented one rally from
 taking place after the court issued its order (see Section 2.b.); but subsequently the
 court's order was honored, and the UDP has held meetings without incident. The
 High Court also dismissed charges against some of the defendants in the politically-
 charged dispute concernig a mosque in Brikama (see Section 1.d.). The Court of
 Appeal also overturned several criminal convictions in less publicized cases.
 The judicial system comprises a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (based
 in London), the Court of Appeal, high courts, and the eight magistrate's courts. The
 Constitution provided for a reconfiguration of the courts in October in which a Su-
 preme Court would replace the Privy Council as the ultimate court of appeal. At
 year's end, the Government was establishing such a court. Village chiefs preside
 over local courts at the village level.
 The judicial system recognizes customary, Shari'a, and general law. Customary
 law covers marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure, tribal
 and clan leadership, and all other traditional and social relations. Shari'a law is ob-
 served primarily in Muslim marriage and divorce matters. General law, following
 the English model, applies to felonies, misdemeanors in urban areas, and the formal
 business sector. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney at
 their own cost.
 The trial of three men accused of complicity in a July 1997 coup attempt was
 closed to the public after the court accepted a prosecution motion that public presen-
 tation of certain evidence would lead to a "breach of peace and public order." One
 of the accused made detailed allegations of torture before the proceedings were
 closed. The three were convicted of treason in October and sentenced to death; they
 are appealing their convictions.
 The junta that took power in 1994 appointed four commissions to investigate indi-
 viduals and organizations suspected of corruption during the First Republic. These
 commissions had powers similar to a grand jury, with additional authority to rec-
 ommend the seizure of assets, to imprison and fine for contempt, and to imprison
 or demand bond from individuals considered likely to abscond. Three of the commis-
 sions completed their work in March. The fourth commission has completed its in-
 vestigation but has yet to submit a final report.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such abuses; although the Government generally respects
 these prohibitions in practice, apparently there were some exceptions. In addition
 the Government has not canceled Decree 45, which was enacted by the military
 prior to the current Constitution. Decree 45 abrogated constitutional safeguards
 against arbitrary search and permits search and seizure of property without due
 process. This decree remains formally in effect, pending a finding by a court that
 the decree is inconsistent with the Constitution. In practice the Government ap-
 pears not to enforce it, but no court case has been brought to test the decree's con-
 stitutionality.
 Observers assume that the Government monitors citizens engaged in activity that
 it deems objectionable. In the past, surveillance included monitoring of telephones
 and mail. Investigating commissions made findings this year resulting in the forfeit-
 ure of private property, principally that property held by former government and
 parastatal officials. The work of these commissions, which began under the AFPRC
 regime, is sanctioned under the Constitution with provisions for due process. How-
 ever, it is not clear that the full rights of due process were accorded to officials in-
 vestigated by the commissions before the Constitution took effect. The evidentiary
 standards applied by the commissions in ordering the forfeiture of money and prop-
 erty are not clear, and orders by the commissions have not yet been subject to effec-
 tive judicial review.
 
 
 169
 The Government restricted the right to transfer funds or assets of some senior of-
 ficials of the former Jawara government accused of corruption.
 There have been no credible reports of reprisals against family members of indi-
 viduals accused of involvement in countercoups or other forms of political opposition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, in practice the Government significantly limits the full exer-
 cise of these freedoms by using police pressure, regulatory scrutiny, and laws that
 inhibit the media. Journalists practice self-censorship.
 In February the NIA closed the country's leading independent radio station Citi-
 zen FM after the station broadcast reports that a senior NIA official had been dis-
 missed for involvement in a counterfeit money scheme. The station's owner and
 news editor were detained (in the owner's case for longer than the constitutionally
 permitted period of 72 hours) but later were released without charge. However, the
 station was charged with failure to pay its licensing fees. Despite the controversy
 over licensing fees, a government press release when the station was closed made
 it clear that the station's editorial policies were a principal reason for the govern-
 ment action. The press release called the station's reporting "deceptive and irrespon-
 sible" and warned other radio stations that there would be "disciplinary measures"
 for reporting "allegations and unconfirmed rumors." In July a magistrate's court or-
 dered that the station be forfeited to the Government for failure to pay the licensing
 fees, despite repeated offers by the station's ownership to pay past due accounts.
 The station is appealing this order, and at year's end, the case had not been re-
 solved.
 The country's leading independent newspaper, The Daily Observer, also experi-
 enced significant governmental interference. In April government officials raided the
 newspaper's offices and questioned those who could not show adequate documenta-
 tion. In June a Nigerian journalist whose work often appeared in the newspaper
 was detained and deported for alleged immigration irregularities. In August two edi-
 tors and a reporter for the newspaper were detained for questioning after publishing
 a story about the collapse of a wall on the grounds of State House. The three were
 released without charges within 72 hours. The Government posted immigration offi-
 cers at The Daily Observer's offices for several periods. The officers reportedly de-
 manded to see immigration documents for all non-Gambians entering the premises
 and also asked for identity documents from citizens. The newspaper complained that
 these activities interfered with its business operations, and by year's end the offi-
 cials had been withdrawn. Several Daily Observer journalists have been deported
 for alleged immigration irregularities in previous years.
 The Government employed arrest, detention, and interrogation to intimidate jour-
 nalists and newspapers that published articles that it considered inaccurate or sen-
 sitive (see Section 1.d.). Decrees 70 and 71, enacted in March 1996, remained in ef-
 fect and continued to inhibit free reporting. The decrees require all newspapers to
 post a $10,000 bond or cease publication. The bond is required to ensure payment
 of any penalties imposed by a court for the publication of blasphemous or seditious
 articles or other libel. These decrees and the fear of reprisals and government action
 have had a chilling effect. Although still independent, the nongovernment press
 practices a significant degree of self-censorship. However, strong criticism of the
 Government is nonetheless frequent, and opposition views appear in the independ-
 ent press. English, French, and other foreign newspapers and magazines are avail-
 able.
 Radio broadcasts from the government station and private stations normally
 reach listeners in the eastern part of the country. Private radio stations simulcast
 news provided by Radio Gambia, the government station. After the closure of Citi-
 zen FM, only one private radio station produced independent news broadcasts. How-
 ever, here were occasional public affairs broadcasts on at least two independent
 radio stations. The British Broadcasting Corporation, Voice of America, Radio
 France International, and other news reports sometimes are rebroadcast by Gam-
 bian stations, and all are available via short-wave radio. Senegalese television and
 radio are available in many parts of the country. Wealthy residents also use tele-
 vision satellite systems.
 Government radio and television give very limited coverage to opposition activi-
 ties, including statements by opposition parliamentarians in the National Assembly.
 In most other respects, the state media serve as propaganda instruments for the
 Government and its supporters.
 There were no reports of any government restrictions on academic freedoms.
 There is no university, but a university extension program completed its third aca-
 demic year in August.
 
 
 170
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government restricts this right in practice. The
 authorities interfered with efforts by the principal opposition party, the United
 Democratic Party (UDP), to organize public meetings. In several instances, the Gov-
 ernment denied UDP requests for permits to hold political rallies or sent security
 services to break up the rallies. In one well-publicized incident, the Government de-
 fied a court judgment ordering the police to permit the UDP to hold rallies and
 broke up a UDP gathering near the principal mosque in central Banjul. Despite
 these incidents, the UDP was able to hold several well-attended rallies at which
 leaders made statements highly critical of the Government.
 In another incident, members of the July 22nd Movement, a group allied with the
 ruling APRC, disrupted a workshop on local government reform held in Mansakonko
 in July. The movement members demanded the ejection of UDP politician Lamin
 Waa Juwara from the workshop. Police then escorted Juwara to a neighboring vil-
 lage where he was released unharmed. The Department of State for Local Govern-
 ment and Lands, the government ministry that sponsored the workshop, released
 a statement "dissociating" the Government from the acts of the July 22nd Move-
 ment. However, the office of the President effectively retracted this statement in Au-
 gust, when it accused Juwara of attempting to incite an ethnic rebellion and called
 the July 22nd Movement's actions "conscious and responsible."
 In November authorities arrested and detained six members of the UDP for hold-
 ing a political meeting without a permit; they were released within 24 hours.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government re-
 stricted this right in practice. Decree 89 banned three major opposition political par-
 ties, all former presidents, vice presidents, and ministers from political activity; the
 decree's penalty of life imprisonment for an individual or a $100,000 (1 million
 dalasi) fine for an organization considerably restricted political activity (see Section
 3). Despite the fact that the decree apparently conflicts with provisions of the Con-
 stitution, it has not been challenged in court. The severe penalties for violating the
 decree have inhibited challenge, as most cases would have to be brought by a person
 who violated the decree. The three banned major parties have not resumed activity
 nor have the various political figures done so.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Adherents of all faiths are free to wor-
 ship without government restriction. The expatriate leadership and expatriate staff
 members of the Ahmadi Islamic sect, who left the country in 1997 claiming fear of
 persecution after criticism by the imam of the mosque at Statehouse, have not re-
 turned. The Statehouse imam made no further criticism of the Ahmadi sect.
 In May the imam of the largest mosque in Brikama was arrested in a dispute
 over minor construction work at the mosque, which reportedly was financed by sup-
 porters of the ruling party. The imam, a largely apolitical figure who is nevertheless
 believed by many to oppose the ruling party, ordered a halt to the construction. Sub-
 sequently, he was arrested, together with a leading opposition party politician and
 eight others. After protracted legal proceedings, charges for destruction of property
 still are pending against the imam and three others, including the opposition politi-
 cian. The imam no longer leads prayers at the mosque, although it is not clear
 whether this is from personal choice or government pressure.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement but allows for "rea-
 sonable restrictions" and there were instances in which the Government restricted
 this right. Although freedom of movement for ordinary citizens was unimpeded, the
 authorities prohibited those under investigation for corruption or security matters
 from leaving the country. Two politicians associated with the opposition UDP also
 were denied passports, although they were not facing corruption or security charges.
 The leader of the opposition UDP and other opposition figures have traveled outside
 the country without incident.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government provided first asylum for approximately 3,000 persons from
 Senegal and Guinea-Bissau during the year. There were no reports of the forced ex-
 pulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The Government works with
 the UNHCR and local NGO's in processing refugee claims. The Gambia hosts ap-
 proximately 8,000 refugees from Sierra Leone, Senegal, Gulnea-Bissau, Liberia, and
 other countries. The Government continues to host approximately 3,500 Senegalese
 refugees from the Casamance region.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite a new Constitution and legislative elections in 1997, in practice citizens
 still do not have an effective right to change their government. Citizens attempted
 to exercise this right in presidential elections in 1996. However, the few inter-
 national observers who were present noted serious problems in the electoral process.
 Foreign governments criticized the election as not free and fair primarily because
 of government intimidation and restrictions imposed by the Government on opposi-
 tion campaign efforts and access to the government-owned media prior to the elec-
 tion.
 Government-owned media continued to deny news coverage and other access to
 opposition politicians, and engaged in a number of other practices that restricted po-
 litical activity (see Section 2.a.). The Government frequently refused to authorize op-
 position meetings (see Section 2.b.). Decree 89 bans three former political parties
 and all persons who held the offices of president, vice president, and minister since
 1965 from involvement in politics until 2024 (see Section 2.b.). Although Decree 89
 apparently is unconstitutional, it has not been challenged in the courts and re-
 mained in effect. The severe penalties for violating the decree have inhibited chal-
 lenge, as most cases would have to be brought by a person who violated the decree.
 During the year, the Government thwarted an opposition effort to have the National
 Assembly repeal Decree 89.
 In January 1997, the Constitution of the Second Republic came into effect, and
 citizens chose a new National Assembly in elections whose results were accepted by
 the opposition. President Jammeh's party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation
 and Construction (APRC) won 33 of 45 Assembly seats filled by election; 4 members
 are appointed by the President. Procedural methods are used to restrict debate
 within the National Assembly.
 President Jammeh and his associates frequently made threats against political
 opponents that significantly inhibited normal political activity. In a speech in July
 commemorating the 1994 coup, Jammeh stated that those who attempt to desta-
 bilize The Gambia would be denied court proceedings and "never see any face on
 earth" again. In May Jammeh threatened to "chop up" his opponents. He added that
 those who want The Gambia to go backward would be "buried like dogs" and that
 those who insult him would "never see the sun." In February he criticized those who
 "seek refuge behind the curtain of constitutionality." Opposition speakers also occa-
 sionally made personal attacks gn the President's religious beliefs, ethnic back-
 ground, and other matters.
 The Constitution provides for the democratic election of the President every 5
 years. National Assembly elections are held 3 months after the presidential elec-
 tions. Presidential elections are scheduled for 2001. Local elections originally sched-
 uled for 1998 were postponed until 1999.
 There are no obstacles to the participation of women in government; however,
 they are underrepresented. Only 1 of 45 members of the National Assembly is a
 woman; however, the Vice President (who is also Minister of Health) is a woman
 and 3 other ministers in the Cabinet are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several organizations whose mandates provide for human rights mon-
 itoring. The AFPRC's Decree 81 of 1996 requires nongovernmental organizations to
 register with a National Advisory Council, which has the authority to deny, sus-
 pend, or cancel any NGO's right to operate (including that of international NGO's).
 However, the Government did not take action against any NGO's during the year.
 There are three major organizations whose primary mandate is the promotion of
 human rights--the International Society for Human Rights (ISHRA), the African
 Center for Democracy and Human Rights Studies (ACDHRS), and the Institute for
 Human Rights and Development (IHRD). Both the ISHRA and the ACDHRS have
 conducted training in democratic rights and civic education. The IHRD is a new or-
 ganization and focuses principally on the operations of the African Commission on
 Human and Peoples' Rights, an organ of the Organization of African Unity based
 in Banjul.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. The Government generally respects these prohibitions.
 
 
 Women.-Domestic violence,, including abuse, occasionally is reported, and its oc-
 currence is believed to be fairly common. Police tend to consider these incidents to
 be domestic issues normally outside their ordinary jurisdiction.
 Shari'a law usually is applied in divorce and inheritance. Marriages often are ar-
 ranged, and polygyny is practiced. Women normally receive a lower proportion of
 assets distributed through inheritance than do male relatives.
 Employment in the formal sector is open to women at the same salary rates as
 men. No statutory discrimination exists in other kinds of employment, although
 women generally are employed in endeavors such as food vending or subsistence
 farming.
 Traditional views of women's roles result in extensive societal discrimination in
 education and employment. Families frequently educate male children before female
 children. Females constitute about 40 percent of primary school students and rough-
 ly one-third of high school students.
 Rape and assault are crimes. The law does not differentiate between married and
 unmarried women. Any person who has carnal knowledge of a girl under the age
 of 16 is guilty of a felony (except in the case of marriage); incest is also illegal.
 These laws generally are enforced.
 Depending on the ethnic group, some marriages are arranged. Women in polygy-
 nous unions have property and other rights arising from the marriage. They have
 the option to divorce, but not a legal right to approve or be notified in advance of
 subsequent marriages.
 Neither sexual harassment nor de facto sexual discrimination are believed to be
 widespread. Individual instances have been noted. Active women's rights groups
 exist, which are focused primarily on economic issues and the elimination of female
 genital mutilation (FGM).
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare. The Department
 of Education and the Department of Health, Social Welfare, and Women s Affairs
 are the two most generously funded of all departments. However, lack of resources
 limits state provision of both education and health services.
 The Constitution mandates free compulsory primary education, but given the cur-
 rent state of the educational infrastructure, this provision represents a goal and not
 an accomplishment. There is no effective compulsory education. However, in Feb-
 ruary the President announced an end to fees for the first 6 years of schooling and
 the Government has implemented the decision. Opportunities for secondary edu-
 cation are even more limited. The care and welfare of children in distress are con-
 sidered primarily a family responsibility. In case of divorce, the Department of So-
 cial'Welfare attempts to require periodic financial support by fathers; however,
 there is no criminal prosecution. Authorities intervene when cases of abuse or mis-
 treatment are brought to their attention. Serious cases of abuse and violence against
 children are subject to criminal penalties.
 There are a-few instances of child street begging. The tourist industry has stimu-
 lated a small amount of child prostitution, which is prosecuted vigorously.
 The practice of female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 widespread and entrenched. Reports place the number of women having been sub-
 jected to FGM anywhere from 60 to 90 percent. Seven of the nine major ethnic
 goups practice FGM at ages varying from shortly after birth until 18 years old. The
 Government in recent years publicly has supported the eradication of FGM and dis-
 courages FGM through health education. However, FGM carried out with parental
 consent is not considered a criminal act. The Government has not passed legislation
 against FGM and, in the absence of legislation, the judiciary is not prepared to ad-
 dress the problem.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no statutes or regulations requiring acces-
 sibility for the disabled. No legal discrimination against the physically disabled ex-
 ists in employment, education, or other state services. Severely disabled individuals
 subsist primarily through private charity. Less severely disabled individuals are
 fully accepted in society and encounter no discrimination in employment for which
 they are physically capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Act of 1990, which applies to all workers
 except civil servants, specifies that workers are free to form associations, including
 trade unions, and provides for their registration with the Government. It specifically
 prohibits police officers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employ-
 ees, from forming unions or striking. About 20 percent of the work force is employed
 in the modern wage sector, where unions are most active. Roughly 30,000 workers
 are union members, constituting about 10 percent of the work force.
 
 
 The Gambian Worker's Confederation and the Gambian Workers' Union are the
 two main independent and competing umbrella organizations. Both organizations
 are recognized by the Government.
 The Labor Act authorizes strikes but requires that unions give the Commissioner
 of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial action (28 days for
 essential services). It prohibits retribution against strikers who comply with the law
 regulating strikes. Upon application by an employer to a court, the court may pro-
 hibit industrial action that is ruled to be in pursuit of a political objective. The court
 also may forbid action judged to be in breach of a collectively agreed procedure for
 settlement of industrial disputes. Because of these provisions and the weakness of
 unions, few strikes occur.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions on union mem-
 bers' participation in international labor activities. The country applied in June
 1995 to join the International Labor Organization. It has been accepted in principle,
 but must make modifications to its labor and employment laws before gaining full
 membership. However, the Government took no action during the year to modify its
 labor and employment laws.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 allows
 workers to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and
 fragmented, collective bargaining takes place. Each recognized union has guidelines
 for its activities specified by the appropriate industrial council established and em-
 powered by the Labor Act. Union members' wages exceed legal minimums and are
 determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or agreements reached between
 unions and management after insuring that the agreements are in compliance with
 labor law. No denial of registration has been reported. The Act also sets minimum
 contract standards for hiring, training, terms of employment, and provides that con-
 tracts may not prohibit union membership. Employers may not fire or discriminate
 against members of registered unions engaged in legal union activities.
 The Government is attempting to establish an export processing zone at the port
 of Banjul, but as yet no manufacturer has begun operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not known to occur.
 Although the law does not specifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children,
 it is not known to occur. Most childrenperforming customary chores or who are en-
 gaged in petty trading do so as a part of an extended family.
 d.Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimnm Age for Employment.-The stat-
 utory minimum age for employment is 18 years. There is no effective compulsory
 education, and because of limited secondary school openings most children complete
 formal education by age 14 and then begin work. Employee labor cards, which in-
 clude a person's age, are registered with the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement
 inspections rarely take place. Child labor protection does not extend to youth per-
 forming customary chores on family farms or engaged in petty trading. In rural
 areas, most children assist their families in farm and housework. In urban areas,
 many children work as street vendors or taxi and bus assistants.
 Although the law does not specifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children,
 apart from the general prohibition against forced labor, it is not known to occur (see
 Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages and working hours are estab-
 lished by law through six joint Industrial Councils-Commerce, Artisans, Transport,
 Port Operations, Agriculture, and Fisheries.
 Labor, management, and the Government are represented on these councils. The
 lowest minimum wage is about $1.16 (12 dalasis) per day for unskilled labor. This
 minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. Only 20 percent of the labor force, essentially those workers in the for-
 mal economic sector, is covered by the minimum wage law. The majority of workers
 are privately or self-employed, often in agriculture. Most citizens do not live on a
 single worker's earnings but share resources within extended families.
 The basic legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecutive
 days. A 30-minute lunch break is mandated. Nationwide, the workweek includes 4
 8-hour workdays and 2 4-hour work days (Friday and Saturday). Government em-
 ployees are entitled to 1 month of paid annual leave after 1 year of service. Private
 sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depending
 on length of service.
 The Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide to em-
 ployees working in designated occupations. The Factory Act authorizes the Ministry
 of Labor to regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with safety standards. En-
 forcement is spotty due to insufficient and inadequately trained staff. Workers may
 
 
 refuse to work in dangerous situations without risking loss of employment. They
 may demand protective equipment and clothing for hazardous workplaces and have
 recourse to the Labor Department.
