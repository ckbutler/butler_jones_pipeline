 BELIZE
 Belize is a democracy with a parliamentary government organized
 under a Constitution formulated at the time of independence in
 1981. The People's United Party (PUP) dominated the campaign
 for independence, which began in the early 1950's, and
 controlled the Government from the beginning of self-rule in
 1964 until the first postindependence election in 1984. At
 that time, the United Democratic Party (UDP) won 54 percent of
 the popular vote, as well as 21 of 28 seats in the House of
 Representatives. The election was peaceful, open, and honest.
 The UDP currently controls seven of the eight municipal
 councils in the country, including the Belize City Council.
 The security apparatus consists of the Belize National Police
 (BNP), the Belize Defence Force (BDF), and the Security and
 Intelligence Service (SIS). The police force, which numbers
 approximately 500, has primary responsibility for law
 enforcement and maintenance of order. The BDF has 900 active
 duty and reserve personnel. Its primary responsibility is
 external defense, but it periodically assists the police in
 enforcement activities, usually antinarcotics operations. The
 SIS, which is closely modeled upon the British Special Branch,
 is responsible for intelligence-gathering and safeguarding
 Belize from both internal and external subversion. The
 security services operate under strict regulations governing
 the use of force; only the BNP possesses arrest powers.
 Belize is a developing nation with a population of under
 200,000. In 1986 estimated per capita gross national product
 was $1,200. The Government favors free enterprise and has
 adopted the strategy of achieving economic growth by
 encouraging increased investment, both domestic and foreign.
 By implementing recommendations of a December 1984
 International Monetary Fund standby agreement, and with U.S.
 Economic Support Fund assistance, the Government has
 successfully strengthened public finances.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual are upheld by an independent
 judicial system. Persons may associate freely with one
 another, hold private property, and pursue private interests.
 A free press buttresses these civil and political rights.
 There were no confirmed cases of political violence in 1987,
 and the country's overall human rights record remained good.
 There is no indication of any short- or long-term deterioration
 of human rights in Belize.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Constitution. There were
 some allegations in the press during 1987 of unnecessary use

 of force by the security forces. The most serious was a claim
 that three Salvadoran kidnapers were beaten by Belizean police
 shortly after the Salvadorans were arrested. A government
 investigation of this case concluded that the charge was
 unfounded, but the Attorney General conceded that the three
 prisoners had been held under less than acceptable standards
 in overcrowded conditions for too long a period. Prisons are
 antiquated, but prisoners are fed adequately and are accorded
 relatively generous social and recreational privileges. In
 1987 the National Assembly passed a law mandating longer
 prison sentences for the crimes of rape, kidnaping, robbery,
 and blackmail. Sentences for most other crimes are notably
 lenient.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced-Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary imprisonment. An
 arrestee must be informed of the reason for detention within
 48 hours of arrest and must be brought before a court within
 72 hours. Release on bail is routinely granted for all but
 the most-serious criminal offenses- Forced labor is forbidden
 by the Constitution and.does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution assures, the rights of accused persons to a
 presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, defense by counsel, public trial, and
 app.eal, Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases, except
 for those minor,offenses decided.by magistrate-courts. These
 consti.tutional provisions are carried out in practice. The
 judiciary is 3ndependent of the executive and is regarded as
 an effective guarantor of an equitable system of justice.
 However, a shortage of trained personnel exists due to the
 inability of the Government to provide adequate funding.
 There are no political prisoners in Belize.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, .Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides.for the protection of personal
 property, the privacy of the home, and the recognition of
 human dignity. .No~known violations of these provisions took
 place during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are protected under the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. A wide range of
 political opinion is presented in the country's written
 press. Both opposition and independent newspapers engage in
 open, lively debate, .which is frequently critical of the
 Government and its policies. There are 13 privately owned
 televisi6n stations in Belize, but the Government has not yet
 fully developed a regulatory framework for the medium. Under
 the broadcasting law of 1983, a six-member Belize Broadcasting
 Authority has issued licenses to existing stations. The
 Government controls Belize's only radio station.
 In 1987 there were two controversies concerning freedom of
 speech and the press. The Government introduced legislation
 which would have strengthened libel laws by allowing
 magistrates to rule upon cases of intentional libel. The
 
 
 388
 BELIZE
 Government withdrew the legislation in the face of strong
 opposition from a coalition of interests. In September the
 leader of the opposition accused the Government of denying the
 opposition equal access to television and demanded equal time
 for the broadcast of news coverage and news releases which
 present the opposition point of view. This accusation was
 provoked by a government proposal to require all television
 stations to broadcast triweekly news programs and editorial
 comments produced by the government broadcasting office.
 However, no legislation requiring commercial television
 broadcasters to carry the triweekly news program has been
 passed, and the editorial program is not yet in production.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is provided for in the
 Constitution. Permits are required for public meetings, but
 are rarely denied.
 The right to form and belong to trade unions is respected in
 practice. There are 15 registered labor unions in Belize
 representing approximately 15 percent of the labor force.
 Employees may establish and join organizations of their own
 choosing. They are empowered to draw up their own
 constitutions and to elect officials freely, but several
 unions which do not elect officials also act as ad hoc
 representatives of their respective memberships. All unions
 which require the annual elections of officials are free to
 join the National Trade Union Congress of Belize (TUC), which
 is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions through its regional group, the Inter-American
 Organization of Workers, and with the Caribbean Congress of
 Labor. Belizean unions have the right to bargain collectively
 and to strike. However, in practice, labor disputes unresolved
 by bargaining are normally settled through arbitration. The
 Government does not interfere with union activities. Although
 there are varying degrees of union cooperation with the
 political parties, no union is controlled by a political party.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. All religious groups may worship
 freely, and there is an active missionary presence. All
 groups and churches may establish places of worship, train
 clergy, and maintain contact with their coreligionists
 abroad. Church leaders have long had close ties to the
 political establishment, and churches play an active role in
 social and national development. With support from the
 Government, churches operate most of Belize's primary and
 secondary schools. No political party is affiliated with any
 particular church or religion.
 a. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on
 foreign travel or emigration. Emigration is motivated by
 economic need rather than political or'human rights
 considerations, and emigrants may return to Belize either to
 visit family or to resettle.
 As many as 20,000 aliens from nearby Central American
 countries have arrived in Belize since 1980, often entering
 illegally and residing in the country without documentation.
 More than 3,000 of these persons have been registered as
 
 
 389
 BELIZE
 refugees by the Office of Refugee.Affairs, which is part of
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and which is supported by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Originally, these arrivals were-welcomed by the Government of
 Belize. aa.valuab.le human assets.. -The 'Governmerit provided
 farmsteads for 105 Salvadoran families enrolled in a
 UNHCR-funded resettlement program, And a large number of
 undocuqrjtod aliens -wre registered in a 1984 program. Some
 have since legalized their status. However, many illegal
 aliens still remain in the country, and their presence is
 becoming controversial.                           '
 In January 1987, 117 illegal aliens were deported following a
 joint pQlice/Belize Defence Force sweep of the Orange Walk
 district.. This roundup and deportation was prompted by
 reported criminal activities on the part of certain illegal
 aliens. Those deported were liying or working illegally in-
 Belize. No registered refugees were among those deported, and
 there were no claims that they were forced to return to
 countries in which they feared persecution. The -common
 perception among many Belizeans that illegal aliens engage in
 criminal activityr-including drug smuggling--abd the concern
 of the-Government. that l-arge-scale immigration will adverSely
 affect the ethnic and political balance of :the country, have
 resulted in uncertainty about-Belizean willingness to accept
 future 4mmigrants. The-UNHCR maintains ari office in Belize.'
 The Government haso-t- -ratified-the United Nations Convention
 on Refugees.   -   .           0.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Belize is a functioning democracy. The government is elected
 by its people in general elections held at least every 5
 years. In the general election of 1984 and the Belize City
 and municipal council elections of 1985 and 1986, Belize
 experienced a peaceful transfer of power from the PUP to the
 UDP. Although the ruling party's parliamentary majority gives
 it broad freedom to decide government policy, its exercise of
 authority is limited by public opinion, a free press, an
 independent judiciary, and competitive electoral politics. A
 number of parties and candidates continue to vie for power at
 all levels of government. The majority parties have broad
 political bases encompassing the country's principal ethnic
 groups. All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is
 universal for citizens of Belize age 18 and older.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international entities have publicly asked to investigate
 the human rights situation in Belize* In 1987 rumor had it
 that a human rights group privately contacted the Belizean
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the alleged mistreatment of
 three-SalVadorans accused of kidnaping, as discussed in
 Section l.c. An official commission investigated this charge,
 and the Government frankly and publicly commented upon the
 findings of that commission. A private human rights council
 exists in Belize but is largely inactive.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While there is no official policy of discrimination, women
 face some prejudices rooted in social and economic practice.
 Nonetheless, women are active in the nation's political
 parties, private voluntary organizations, churches, and
 organizations dedicated to improving the lives of Belizean
 women. Women have access to education and are prominent in
 local and national government. They are well represented in
 the professions. Both the Governor General; who represents
 Queen Elizabeth II in her capacity as Belizean Head of State,
 and the president of the Senate are women. Women hold officer
 and enlisted positions in both the police and military forces.
 There is no discrimination because of religious preference,
 and there is no ethnic discrimination. Belizeans of all
 ethnic groups and linguistic groups have equal protection
 under the law.-
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minimum ages for employment of children have been established
 at 14 years for work in retail establishments and at 17 for
 any work near hazardous machinery. Minimum wages have been
 established for many occupations, but.because of the large
 number of self-employed agricultural and craft workers, there
 is no nationwide minimum wage. Occupational safety
 regulations exist, but a shortage of resources interferes with
 the Government's ability to enforce these codes fully.
