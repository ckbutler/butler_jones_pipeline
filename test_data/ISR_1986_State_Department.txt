 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees by law
 and respects in practice the civil, political, and religious
 rights of its citizens. It has free elections, a multiparty
 political system, an independent judiciary, and an elected
 legislature (the Knesset) which may limit the Government by
 legislation and can bring it down by a vote of no confidence.
 There is no constitution; a series of basic laws defines the
 responsibilities of government institutions. Emergency
 regulations, associated with the state of emergency in force
 since the founding of the State in 1948, are still in effect.
 In 1979, as provided in the Camp David Accords, Egypt and
 Israel signed a peace treaty ending the formal state of war
 which had existed between them since 1948. Israel and its
 other Arab neighbors continue to be in a formal state of war.
 Pursuant to the Egypt-Israel treaty, Israel returned the
 remainder of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1981. Israel
 continues to occupy other territories (the Golan Heights, Gaza
 Strip, the West Bank, and the eastern sector of Jerusalem)
 captured in the 1967 war. In early 1985, Israel withdrew the
 bulk of its troops from southern Lebanon, where they had been
 since the 1982 war, but it still maintains a residual presence
 and continues to support a local militia, the "Army of South
 Lebanon."
 Many Israelis doubt that other Arab states are prepared to
 accept Israel's right to exist on the basis of U.N. Security
 Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Terrorist incidents within
 Israel and the absence of peace treaties between Israel and
 its other Arab neighbors make security a dominant concern which
 affects many facets of Israel's national life.
 Approximately 16 percent of the population of Israel are Arabs
 who do not share the Zionist principles upon which the State
 was founded. Some Jewish groups in Israel also reject Zionism.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 predominantly market economy with substantial governmental
 participation and subsidized prices for basic commodities.
 Economic policy has a strong orientation toward social welfare.
 In recent years, Israel experienced increasing balance of
 payments deficits, rising foreign debt, triple-digit inflation,
 and declining foreign exchange reserves. A new economic
 program, initiated in 1985, has significantly reduced the level
 of inflation and improved Israel's international financial
 position.
 Israeli society is characterized by its openness and by its
 wide-ranging and lively public debate of all issues of popular
 concern. Police and internal security functions are under the
 control of Cabinet ministers who must answer to the Knesset
 concerning the actions of personnel for whom they are
 responsible and whose performance is subject to the scrutiny
 of a vigorous free press.
 *Because of the sharply differing sociopolitical environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories which Israel has occupied
 since the 1967 war, the respective human rights situations are
 treated in separate but parallel fashion. The report on the
 occupied territories follows the report for Israel.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 As in the past, the most significant human rights problems for
 Israel in 1986 derived from the strained relations between the
 Israeli authorities and some Israelis and the Arab inhabitants
 of the occupied territories. These problems were exacerbated
 by attacks against Israelis in those areas and by acts of
 provocation or violence by Jewish settlers. The number of
 attacks on Israelis and acts of violence by settlers declined
 somewhat in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no indication that political killing is sanctioned by
 Israeli authorities.
 In 1986 three former officials of the General Security Service
 (GSS, or Shin Bet) revealed that their agency had been
 responsible for the deaths of two Palestinian prisoners during
 interrogation after a bus hijacking in 1984. Several GSS
 officials were also implicated in efforts to cover up the
 circumstances of these killings in proceedings before two
 boards of inquiry which investigated the deaths. President
 Herzog subsequently pardoned 11 GSS officials who were involved
 in the deaths and the purported coverup, including the Director
 of the Service. These pardons precluded further prosecution
 of these individuals. After the Government decided against a
 judicial commission of inquiry, the Attorney General ordered a
 police investigation. The police investigators reported their
 findings to the Attorney General, who issued a report stating
 that there was no evidence that the Prime Minister at the time
 of the killings,. Yitzhak Shamir, knew of an attempted coverup
 nor that he had issued an order authorizing the killing of
 terrorists. Foreign Minister Peres and former Defense Minister
 Moshe Arens were also cleared of criminal wrongdoing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited. Evidence or confessions
 obtained under duress are inadmissible in court, and the
 administrative codes of conduct of the prison and police
 authorities contain stringent sanctions against the use of
 force or brutality. Police officers accused of brutality or
 violence against prisoners or suspects may be prosecuted
 either in administrative courts for violation of the code of
 conduct or in regular criminal courts for criminal assault.
 Acute overcrowding remains a problem in Israeli prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other
 procedural and substantive safeguards are available.
 Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention may be employed in security-related
 cases when it is determined to the satisfaction of a judge
 
 
 1177
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 that formally charging a person would compromise sensitive
 sources of evidence. Any individual under administrative
 detention is entitled to representation by counsel and must be
 brought before the president of the appropriate district court
 within 48 hours of being taken into custody. Upon application
 of the Defense Minister to a district court, the right to
 representation by counsel may be delayed from 48 hours to
 7 days in most instances and up to 15 days in terrorist-
 related cases. Each case of administrative detention must be
 submitted to judicial review at least every 3 months thereafter
 for the entire period of detention. The decision of the.
 president of the district court can be appealed to the Supreme
 Court.
 Israel does not accord prisoner-of-war status under the Third
 Geneva Convention to prisoners captured in Lebanon after the
 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon who were not members of the
 armed forces of another country.
 Again in 1986, Israeli military forces brought an unknown
 number of prisoners captured in southern Lebanon across the
 border to prisons in Israeli territory in violation of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 is independent and effectively insulated from political
 interference. With the exception of security cases, which may
 be tried by military courts, all trials are open. In security
 cases, Israeli law provides that part or all of a trial may be
 closed, with the burden of justifying nonpublic proceedings
 falling on the prosecution. Counsel is present during closed
 proceedings. In security cases, the law also provides for
 possible restriction on the choice of defense counsel, but
 there were no known cases in 1986 in which this provision was
 invoked.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of homelife and
 correspondence are fully protected. There are effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, limited by security-based
 censorship provisions, are basic rights in Israel. These
 rights are protected by law and the judiciary and are broadly
 exercised. An independent and vigorous press expresses a wide
 variety of political opinion.
 Media censorship is based on British Mandatory emergency
 regulations, according to which the censor may prohibit the
 publication of material which, in his opinion, will harm the
 defense of Israel, the public safety, or public order.
 Censorship decisions may be appealed through the judiciary.
 In practice, censorship of the media is usually limited to
 military security matters, and journalists generally know
 
 
 1178
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 which security-related areas are off-limits to publication.
 Licenses to publish newspapers are required and normally are
 routinely issued. All newspapers are privately owned and
 managed.
 Israeli radio and television are run by the independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority (IBA). The Government helps to fund the
 IBA and appoints its governing board but has almost no control
 over programing. The independence of the IBA is protected by
 law, subject to the censorship provisions. Radio and
 television programs are in Arabic as well as in Hebrew.
 Movies and theater are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic or otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores or likely to create a disturbance of public order.
 Censorship board actions, rarely imposed, can be appealed in
 the courts.
 Possession and distribution of literature considered hostile
 to the State and issued by illegal Palestinian organizations
 are punishable offenses.
 Israeli law forbids public manifestations of support for
 organizations defined by the State as terrorist in nature.
 Proscribed acts include flying the Palestinian flag or
 displaying its colors, displaying Palestinian nationalist
 slogans, and publicly expressing support for the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO).
 New legislation to prohibit the intentional fomenting of
 racism was passed in 1986.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These are basic rights in Israel, protected, along with the
 right to demonstrate, by law and rulings of the courts.
 Permits are required and routinely granted for political
 rallies and outdoor meetings beyond an established size. A
 law was passed in 1986 prohibiting and toughening penalties
 for any contact by Israelis with the PLO, its subdivisions,
 and non-PLO organizations classified as terrorist groups.
 Israel has a free, democratic labor movement, which plays an
 important role in social, economic, and political life.
 Israel's most powerful labor organization, the General
 Federation of Labor (Histadrut), and its affiliates operate
 the largest national health insurance program and seven
 retirement pension systems, as well as a number of large
 industrial enterprises. About 85 percent of all workers are
 Histadrut members. The membership includes 60 percent of the
 adult Israeli Arab population. Israeli workers, including
 those in the public sector, make frequent use of the right to
 strike. Histadrut has traditionally been active in the
 international field; it runs a large labor assistance program
 and is active in various international labor organizations.
 Israel's labor laws are modern and comprehensive; they reflect
 the social democratic values of Israel's founding fathers and
 the conditions of employment negotiated by Histadrut over many
 years. The Collective Agreements Law of 1957 governs trade
 union representation and collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish State in which all citizens are
 guaranteed freedom of religion by law. Muslims, Christians,
 
 
 1179
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Druze, and other minority religious groups make up about
 17 percent of the population. The prevailing interpretation
 of the Jewish nature of the State has been secular rather than
 religious. The Law of Return of 1950, which abolished all
 British Mandate restrictions on Jewish immigration, and the
 Citizenship Law of 1952, which granted every Jew the right to
 citizenship upon arrival in Israel, confer an advantage on Jews
 in matters of immigration and citizenship.
 All religious groups may maintain contacts with their
 coreligionists outside Israel. Foreign clergy are permitted
 to live in Israel to minister to their coreligionists. Several
 thousand Israeli Muslims make the pilgrimage to Mecca each
 year. There is no operating Islamic seminary in Israel.
 Muslims may obtain such training in institutions in East
 Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, or Egypt. The International
 Center of the Baha'i religion is located in Haifa, and a
 Mormon Study Center is under construction in Jerusalem.
 Under Israeli law each religious community is governed in
 matters of personal status by its own religious law and not by
 civil law. This system, however, sometimes fails to protect
 the rights of individuals who do not follow the dominant
 tradition within their religious community. Difficulties do
 not normally arise in religious worship but do occur in areas
 such as marriage, legitimacy, inheritance, or conversion. In
 some religious communities, the rights of women are limited.
 Some Jewish and Christian congregations have complained that
 local and regional authorities have used zoning regulations to
 prevent establishment or expansion of their congregations.
 An antiprogelytizing law enacted in 1977 prohibits the offering
 and receipt of material benefits as inducements to religious
 conversion. In 1979 the Justice Minister stated that the law
 is not intended to restrict the religious freedom of any
 community or to impede any community from the pursuit of normal
 educational or philanthropic activities. The Attorney General
 has ordered that no action be taken under the law without his
 express permission, and the law has not been employed. It
 nevertheless continues to cause uneasiness among some Christian
 groups. Persons considered missionaries and purporting to
 belong to missionary groups have been subjected to physical
 attacks by individuals and in some cases harassment by Jewish
 religious groups. The police have been active in protecting
 missionary groups. The Ministry of Religious Affairs
 cooperates with and gives financial support to various
 interfaith groups which seek to promote understanding between
 members of different religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country
 and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate, subject to
 government review to determine whether military service-
 related obligations have been satisfied. Emergency
 regulations, however, provide that Israeli citizens, by
 military order, may be confined to their neighborhoods or
 villages or barred from traveling to the occupied territories.
 Restrictions of this nature have been applied most often to
 Israeli Arabs. An Anglican priest and an attorney, both of
 whom are officials of the Progressive List for Peace, a small,
 mostly Arab political party, were prevented from traveling to
 the U.S. and Europe, and the Director of an Israeli-Arab
 cultural heritage group was ordered restricted to his town
 
 
 1180
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 just prior to his planned departure on a fund-raising tour. A
 number of Arab journalists are also under restrictions not to
 leave their towns or are affected by other travel restrictions.
 In all cases, the Israeli authorities maintain that the
 restrictions are based on reasons of state security.
 Since 1948 Israel has taken in over a million Jewish refugees,
 principally from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Soviet
 Union, and has worked toward integrating them into its society
 and economy. From 1983 through 1985, the Absorption Ministry
 settled some 7,000-8,000 Ethiopian Jewish immigrants. The
 flow of immigrants from other countries also continued in 1986.
 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11,
 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees who left their
 homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they are willing to
 live in peace, or to be compensated for their losses if they
 choose not to return. Israel has not recognized the validity
 of this resolution, pointing out the losses to its own citizens
 who fled Arab states at the same time; it did, however, take
 back some refugees under the principle of family reunification,
 and has, on occasion, indicated willingness to accept some
 refugees in the context of a final peace settlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system.
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to vote for
 candidates of their choice and to participate in the political
 process.
 The Israeli Arab community is proportionally underrepresented
 in the Knesset (Parliament); 16 percent of Israel's total
 population is Arab, but only 7 of 120 Knesset members are
 Arab. This may be due, in part, to poor political organization
 within the Arab community or to refusal by some Arabs to
 participate in Israeli polictics. Israeli Arabs are included
 in the parliamentary delegations of several of the Zionist
 parties, the non-Zionist Israeli Communist Party, and the
 Progressive List for Peace.
 Israeli Arabs actively participate in local (municipal)
 elections, and Israeli Arab municipal councils serve in Arab
 towns throughout Israel. These municipal councils freely
 participate in Israeli regional councils.
 Women participate freely in the political process and account
 for more than 40 percent of the political party membership.
 Ten members of the Knesset and two of the judges of the Supreme
 Court are women. The new 25-member Cabinet sworn in in
 October 1986 includes a woman for the first time since 1974.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an office of human rights in the
 Foreign Affairs Ministry, and several human rights groups in
 Israel work for the protection of individual liberties and
 women's rights. Private Israeli groups, such as the Israeli
 League for Human and Civil Rights, the Association for Civil
 Rights in Israel, and Peace Now, freely criticize Israeli
 government actions in Israel, the occupied territories, and
 Lebanon. They issue statements and reports, hold press
 
 
 1181
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 conferences, and organize demonstrations without government
 interference.
 The Government permits visits to Israel by representatives of
 private international human rights groups, as well as by the
 United Nations Economic and Social Council, the World Health
 Organization, and the International Labor Organization. The
 Government has generally permitted the International Committee
 for the Red Cross to visit Palestinian prisoners taken in
 Lebanon and the occupied territories. The Government also
 investigates and replies to most inquiries by organizations
 such as Amnesty International.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by law as well as by
 governmental and private organizations. The Equal Opportunity
 Law forbids discrimination on account of sex or marital or
 parental status, and employers are legally bound to pay female
 workers a wage equal to that paid male workers for the same or
 generally similar work. Laws and regulations also provide for
 protection of the rights of female employees with respect to
 pregnancy and childbirth. The Government includes a senior
 adviser on the status of women, and the Civil Service
 Commission and several government ministries have officers
 responsible for promoting fair treatment for women and
 ensuring that the rights of women are protected. A number of
 nongovernmental women's organizations also work to advance the
 status of women, ensure equal opportunity in all fields, and
 provide other family services such as child care for working
 mothers.   The senior adviser on the status of women has
 publicly criticized as discriminatory the provision in many
 labor agreements that women, but not men, must retire at age
 60. Legislation for sexual equality in retirement has been in
 legislative committees since March.
 Over 40 percent of university graduates are women, as are
 39 percent of the work force. Fifty-two percent of Israeli
 civil service employees are women, but they appear to be
 underrepresented at the higher levels of the Government.
 Women account for approximately two-thirds of the instructors
 employed in the educational system but they occupy only about
 one-fifth of the senior positions of the professional grade of
 the career civil service. Women are well represented in
 professional and technical jobs in the media, and work in a
 broad range of nongovernment professions and other occupations.
 Women are drafted into the army for service in noncombat units.
 The Israeli Arab minority has equal rights under the law in
 most respects, and Israeli Arabs have made substantial
 educational and material progress since the founding of the
 State. A few have risen to responsible positions in the civil
 service, generally in the Arab departments of government
 ministries.
 Israeli Arabs, however, have little political power or
 influence and tend to feel alienated. Despite some
 governmental and private efforts to bridge the gap, there is
 little social interaction with Israeli Jews. Israeli Arabs
 assert that they are denied equal access to education,
 housing, and other services, and that they are discriminated
 against in such areas as employment and appointment to
 government positions. Government grants to Arab local councils
 represent a smaller percentage of the budgets of these bodies
 
 
 1182
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 than is the case for government grants to Jewish
 municipalities. In 1986 Arab local councils withheld services
 for several weeks in protest over lack of budget parity.
 In October 1986, the Council of Arab Local Councils in Israel
 protested the continued existence of separate offices for Arab
 affairs in government ministries, and called for the abolition
 of the office of the Prime Minister's Advisor on Arab Affairs.
 While Arabs make up about 16 percent of the population of
 Israel, less than 2 percent of senior government positions are
 held by Arabs, less than 3 percent of Israeli judges are
 Arabs, and no large bank, industrial enterprise, or
 agricultural undertaking in Israel is headed by an Israeli
 Arab. Israeli Arabs make up 3 percent of university students
 and less than 1 percent of the academic positions in the
 universities.
 Druze and Circassians are subject to Israel's military draft,
 and some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special units. Most
 Israeli Arabs are not permitted to serve and therefore are
 disqualified from many economic and social benefits which
 require military service as a precondition. They are
 particularly disadvantaged in seeking housing and
 new-household subsidies and in applying for government
 employment.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Collective Agreements Law of 1957 empowers the Labor
 Minister to extend the provisions of collective agreements,
 including the minimum wage in the agreement between Histadrut
 and the Manufacturers Association, to workers not otherwise
 covered by collective agreements. The Labor Ministry
 frequently extends these provisions to workers not covered by
 other agreements. Maximum legal work hours are 8 hours per
 day, 47 hours per week. The Youth Labor Law of 1955 prohibits
 the employment of children under the age of 15 and regulates
 employment of youths under the age of 18. The Labor Inspection
 Law of 1954 provides a labor inspection service to enforce
 health and safety standards in the workplace.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 In the course of the war of June 1967, Israel occupied the
 West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip,
 and the Sinai Peninsula. As a result of the Peace Treaty
 between Egypt and Israel, the Sinai Peninsula was restored to
 Egypt. No peace treaty has, however, been concluded between
 Israel and its other neighboring countries. The West Bank and
 Gaza remain under military government. Israel regards East
 Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as subject to Israeli law,
 jurisdiction, and administration.
 The United States holds the view that Israel is an occupying
 power in these territories and, therefore, that its
 administration is subject to the Hague regulations of 1907 and
 the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection of
 civilian populations under military occupation.
 Israel denies the applicability of the Fourth Geneva
 Convention to the West Bank and Gaza, but states that it
 voluntarily observes most of the Convention's provisions in
 these areas. Major differences have arisen in regard to the
 applicability of these provisions in East Jerusalem and the
 Golan Heights, to the introduction of civilian settlers, and
 to collective punishment. Israel enforces Jordanian law in
 the West Bank and British Mandatory regulations in the Gaza
 Strip, although it has issued military orders significantly
 altering or overriding portions of these laws.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied territories
 reflects the fact that, in the absence of a peace settlement,
 the territories remain under military administration and there
 is friction between occupation authorities and the Palestinian
 population. Among the signs of friction are active resistance
 to the occupation, including episodes of violence, sometimes
 encouraged by outside extremist groups. Friction also arises
 from security measures taken by Israel to counter terrorism
 and other perceived threats to security. Other causes of
 friction are the introduction of civilian Israeli settlers,
 advocacy of annexation or permanent control of the territories
 by some Israeli political figures, as well as the refusal of
 the main Palestinian organizations to recognize Israel or to
 promote a negotiated peace. Limits on economic enterprise,
 especially that which would compete with Israeli products, are
 also a source of contention.
 Israel implements its policy in the territories through a Civil
 Administration created in 1981 under Defense Ministry control.
 It is staffed by military and civilian personnel. Israel's
 national police, border police, security service, and the
 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) all have a role in administration.
 The national police, which includes local Palestinians in its
 ranks, is seldom criticized. However, there are frequent
 complaints by West Bankers and Gazans about the actions of the
 other organizations.
 The Civil Administration has sought to reshape local politics,
 notably by trying to reduce the influence of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO) and other dissident Palestinian
 organizations. Israel has also discouraged political
 organizations beyond the municipal levels. It permitted
 municipal elections in 1972 and 1976, but after 1980, citing
 security concerns, postponed further elections and eventually
 removed many elected and appointed officials. Threats by
 extremists have also inhibited the development of moderate
 Palestinian leaders; even those who have expressed support
 
 
 1185
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 for the PLO have been intimidated for cooperating with Israel.
 Since 1985, Israel has supported the installation of non-PLO
 Palestinian mayors who have local and Jordanian support in
 place of Israeli military appointees.
 Israel has allowed the establishment of four universities in
 the West Bank and one in Gaza where none existed before 1967,
 but has restricted student and faculty activities which it
 sees as threatening security. Israel permits criticism of its
 policies by the East Jerusalem-based Arabic press but often
 censors articles and editorials and restricts circulation of
 Arabic publications in the West Bank and Gaza. One Arabic
 newspaper and one magazine were closed in 1986. Broad
 restrictions on speech and assembly apply in the occupied
 territories.
 Arab and Jewish residents continued to suffer from violent
 acts in 1986, although at a lower level than in 1985. PLO
 factions and various PLO dissident groups claimed
 responsibility for nearly all violent acts against the IDF,
 Israeli civilians, or Palestinians who disagreed with such
 groups. Much of the violence appears, however, to have been
 spontaneous and local.
 Arab complaints of settler violence continued throughout the
 year, including unauthorized armed patrols, physical
 harassment, and disruption of legally authorized political
 meetings. Two IDF officers were convicted in 1986 for violence
 against Arabs, and one member of a Jewish underground
 organization was extradited from the United States and
 sentenced to prison. In 1986 the President commuted sentences
 imposed on six members of this organization, who had been
 convicted in 1985 and had served in prison for one half to
 two thirds of 2- to 4-year sentences.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by Israel. However, there
 have been deaths and injuries as a result of both terrorist
 acts and IDF security measures.
 Attacks by Arabs took the lives of at least 1 IDF soldier,
 4 Israeli civilians in the West Bank and Gaza (in addition to
 4 who were killed in Israel) and 3 Arabs, while at least 9 IDF
 soldiers, 37 Jewish civilians, and 4 Arabs were wounded. In
 March the appointed mayor of Nablus was assassinated. The Abu
 Nidal group and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
 Palestine (PFLP) claimed responsibility, but no one had been
 arrested for the crime as of the end of 1986. In October,
 1 Israeli civilian was killed, 67 Israeli civilians and
 soldiers were injured, and 2 Arabs were injured by a
 handgrenade attack near the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The
 PLO claimed responsibility.
 In November an Israeli studEnt was knifed to death near a
 Jewish religious school in the Arab quarter of the old city of
 Jerusalem. Three Palestinians were arrested shortly after the
 incident and later sentenced to life imprisonment for
 committing the murder. They were linked to the PFLP. The
 killing sparked anti-Arab demonstrations and vandalism which
 
 
 1186
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 continued for several weeks. In December an elderly Israeli
 was stabbed and wounded in the same area.
 At least 7 unarmed Arabs were killed in 1986 and more than 29
 were wounded in incidents involving IDF soldiers enforcing
 security regulations. Two of the seven killed were students
 at Bir Zeit University where IDF soldiers opened fire on
 demonstrators. During the same week two Palestinian boys,
 14 and 12 years old, were shot and killed and others were
 wounded by gunfire in separate incidents near the Balata
 refugee camp. In October a Palestinian student was shot and
 wounded by security forces at Bethlehem University during an
 antioccupation demonstration. Israeli authorities stated that
 Palestinian demonstrators had been throwing rocks and bottles
 and that the IDF acted in self-defense in these incidents.
 However, it appears that the deaths could have been avoided by
 use of nonlethal crowd control measures. The IDF limited its
 use of lethal force in subsequent disturbances linked to the
 Bir Zeit and Balata incidents.
 In other incidents, two missing Palestinians were found dead
 at the sites of explosions. Palestinians claimed they were
 killed by Israeli settlers; the authorities said they died as
 a result of accidental explosions of their own bombs. One
 Palestinian woman was killed when, according to the IDF, she
 attacked a soldier. Palestinians claimed she accidentally
 fell on the soldier and was killed by another soldier, who
 panicked.
 b. Disappearance
 Israeli authorities neither sponsor nor condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law and Israeli authorities say
 they do-not condone torture. Israeli border and national
 policemen have been convicted of abusive force against Arab
 prisoners, and the Israeli Supreme Court has at times ordered
 the withdrawal from evidence of confessions found to have been
 coerced. Palestinians complain of widespread and systematic
 mistreatment. They assert that nearly all convictions in
 security cases are based on confessions, that attorneys are
 normally not allowed to see clients until they have confessed,
 and that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 is denied access to prisoners for a prescribed period. A 1986
 Amnesty International report alleged widespread physical
 mistreatment of security detainees, specifically citing the
 case of Adnan Mansour Ghanem, who was allegedly beaten severely
 before being deported. The Israeli judge at Ghanem's
 deportation trial noted physical evidence of beating.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories
 are usually provided the opportunity for bail, access to an
 attorney, and a clear statement of charges, although these
 rights are sometimes delayed. Individuals may be held in
 administrative detention without formal charges for up to 18
 days. The normal detention period after charges are filed is
 60 days before trial. This can be extended indefinitely by a
 Supreme Court judge for 3-month periods.
 
 
 1187
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Persons held for security reasons are not allowed bail and
 initially are denied access to counsel or other outside
 contact. Officials sometimes have declined to confirm
 detentions to consular officers. Under Israeli law, denial of
 notification of arrest to a third party can be extended for up
 to 15 days. Many who are released without charges claim
 ignorance of the reasons for their detention. Detainees are
 prevented from seeing their attorneys for 18 days, but access
 may be denied indefinitely for security reasons or because
 granting access may impede the investigation.
 Arabs are often detained, sometimes in sizable numbers, after
 terrorist incidents or demonstrations. Such detentions
 usually do not result in formal charges and are not prolonged.
 Persons arrested during demonstrations are tried in military
 courts on security grounds. Security forces can and do detain
 individuals without prompt notification of their relatives and
 apparently without the use of warrants.
 The use of 6-month administrative detention and deportation
 continued in 1986. The United States has indicated that these
 measures are inconsistent with the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 During 1986, at least 32 Palestinians were placed under
 administrative detention, which requires confirmation by a
 military judge. The hearing is confidential and the detainee
 and counsel can be denied access to evidence cited as grounds
 for the detention if the judge determines that confidentiality
 is required for security reasons. This can be challenged in
 the Supreme Court.
 At least one Palestinian who had been released in a 1985
 exchange of prisoners held in Israel for Israeli military
 personnel captured in Lebanon was deported by Israel, which
 claimed he was not entitled to residency status. The ICRC,
 which had helped negotiate the original exchange, objected.
 Israel maintained that those who had reentered Israel illegally
 had forfeited their residency rights; the ICRC disagreed.
 In November the Palestinian editor of the Jerusalem newspaper,
 Asha'ab, was ordered deported because of his alleged
 association with Fatah, the PLO's largest faction. Israel did
 not claim that he was personally involved in terrorism. The
 order initially was appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court,
 which directed the authorities to justify their action. The
 appeal was later withdrawn and the editor deported. At least
 eight other Palestinians were deported for alleged security
 offenses. Several individuals who appealed the deportation
 orders to the Supreme Court withdrew their appeals when the
 Court refused, on security grounds, their attorneys' request
 to review the evidence against them.
 In 1986 at least 62 Arabs were placed under new or renewed
 orders restricting them to their towns for 3 months or more.
 Such orders do not require formal charges and are made by
 regional military commanders without judicial review. Many of
 those affected are political activists, outspoken critics of
 Israeli policies, or PLO supporters.
 There is no forced labor in the occupied territories.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law, as modified by Israeli military orders, remains
 in force in the West Bank for most criminal and civil matters.
 British Mandatory law, as modified, prevails in Gaza. The
 
 
 1188
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 application of these laws, except in security cases, land
 acquisition, or where jurisdiction has been transferred by
 military order, has been left in the hands of an independent
 Arab judiciary. Residents of the occupied territories accused
 of nonsecurity offenses receive public trials in local courts.
 Israeli law applies in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
 Arabs suspected of security offenses, which are not precisely
 defined under Israeli law, are normally tried in Israeli
 military courts with a military judge presiding, and are
 defended by counsel. However, Israeli residents of the
 occupied territories accused of security offenses are tried by
 the Israeli district court closest to their residence or the
 scene of their crime.
 Most military trials are public, except for some cases
 involving serious security offenses, but many trials involve
 the use of secret evidence, which neither the accused nor his
 attorney can see. At the request of the defendent, the Supreme
 Court will review whether sufficient security grounds exist for
 keeping the evidence secret. Consular officers are normally
 able to attend court proceedings involving foreign citizens.
 Orders of the Civil Administration may be appealed to the
 Israeli Supreme Court. Nonjudicial administrative orders of
 the military government may be appealed to area military
 commanders and the Supreme Court. Military court verdicts
 are not appealable, except on procedural grounds to the
 Supreme Court, although the area commander may exercise the
 right of commutation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under occupation regulations, military authorities can and do
 enter private homes and institutions without prior judicial
 approval in pursuit of security objectives. A military order
 permits soldiers to search persons or premises on the West Bank
 without warrant on the suspicion that a person or organization
 may possess a proscribed publication.
 In 1986 at least 15 houses of West Bank and Gaza residents
 accused of involvement in security incidents were demolished
 and 21 were sealed. Ten individual rooms were also sealed.
 Such action is usually taken before a suspect is tried.
 Houses or rooms of Israeli suspects or convicts in security
 offenses in the occupied territories were not demolished or
 sealed.
 Commercial activity is often interrupted after violent
 incidents by sealing off areas for searches or by extended
 curfews. Nine shops in and adjacent to a building housing
 Jewish settlers in Hebron were cordoned off by the IDF after
 the owners refused to sell their shops. Patrons must be
 searched by soldiers before and after entering the area of the
 shops. The shopowners have filed an appeal with the Supreme
 Court.
 Most Palestinians believe that mail and telephone services in
 the West Bank and Gaza are monitored. Individuals can be and
 are questioned on their political views by security officials.
 Such inquiries have in some cases involved overnight detention.
 
 
 1189
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is generally respected, subject to
 restrictions which are deemed by Israeli authorities as
 necessary on security grounds. Proscribed acts include
 displaying the Palestinian flag, its colors, or Palestinian
 nationalist slogans, and publicly expressing support for the
 PLO. The Arabic press, most of which is located in East
 Jerusalem, is outspokenly critical of Israeli policies and
 actions. Arrests, prison sentences, land seizures, and other
 politically sensitive stories are generally reported, but
 editorials and articles are often censored in whole or in part.
 All items in Jerusalem's Arabic press must be submitted to the
 censor for prior review, and at least 56 editorials and
 commentaries were censored in 1986. Hebrew newspapers need
 submit only articles on military security matters to the
 censors. Censorship may be challenged by appeal to the chief
 censor.
 Materials licensed to be published in East Jerusalem are free
 to circulate throughout Jerusalem, but need a further license
 for distribution in the West Bank and Gaza. One Palestinian
 newspaper and one magazine have been denied such licenses.
 Military orders forbid the printing or publishing of
 politically significant material without a license. Political
 significance is not defined.
 A permit must be obtained for every publication imported into
 the occupied territories. Arabic educational materials,
 periodicals, and books originating outside Israel are censored
 or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content and for the
 encouragement of Palestinian nationalism. Since 1984 the
 number of books explicitly prohibited has been reduced from
 1,300 to 350. Possession of banned materials by West Bank or
 Gaza Arabs is a criminal offense. Usually, possession of
 illegal publications is one of a series of charges levied
 against individuals accused of security offenses. Restrictions
 of this kind are usually not applied to Israeli residents.
 In August the High Court of Justice upheld permanent closure
 of two Arab Jerusalem newspapers on the grounds that they were
 funded and operated by the PFLP, which has claimed
 responsibility for terrorist actions in Israel and the occupied
 territories. The court rejected arguments by the newspapers'
 attorney that freedom of expression should protect the
 newspapers. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists
 criticized the decision, as well as travel restrictions placed
 on several Jerusalem Arab journalists, one of whom was
 prevented from traveling to the U.S. to address an Amnesty
 International conference.
 In August the authorities closed the weekly newspaper
 Al-Mawqif for 3 months after its presses were used to print
 pamphlets deemed threatening to security. They closed the
 newspaper Al-Fajr for 3 days in June and 1 week in October,
 and held up the distribution of all Arabic newspapers for
 3 days in July and for several hours during one day in August.
 They also closed the Hakawati Theatre in East Jerusalem, a
 nationalist ensemble company, four times for periods of 12 to
 24 hours, citing security reasons.
 In November a teacher, who had been involved in a public
 opinion poll of Palestinians living in the occupied
 
 
 1190
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 territories which showed strong support for the PLO, was
 ordered by the Israeli authorities to cease teaching at
 An-Najah University because of his alleged association with
 PLO members.
 Arabic-language radio and television programs from Jordan,
 Syria, and other Arab countries, including broadcasts of the
 Voice of Palestine, are received in the occupied territories
 without jamming.
 Foreign journalists have not reported difficulties in meeting
 inhabitants of the occupied territories. As with reports by
 the local press, all reports filed by the foreign press are
 subject to military censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Israelis have permitted a wide range of labor,
 professional, and fraternal groups organized before 1967 to
 continue to function. Professional associations are active
 and often take public stands on political issues. No political
 parties or other groups viewed as primarily political are
 permitted. Public gatherings of more than 10 people require
 permission, which is often withheld from both Arab and Israeli
 groups on grounds of public order.
 There are approximately 40 labor unions in the occupied
 territories, grouped into 2 rival federations. Fifteen new
 labor unions have been permitted to register in the West Bank
 since the beginning of the occupation, but over 100
 applications have been turned down and several Arab unions have
 been disbanded by Israeli authorities for alleged security
 concerns.
 West Bank unions are generally small and confined to urban
 workers in skilled craft trades. Israeli authorities must
 approve all candidates for union elections but such elections
 are held without other interference. Membership in the
 Histadrut, the Israeli national labor organization, is open to
 Arab workers from East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
 In 1985 Israel first refused permission to form a union of
 Arab lawyers on the West Bank but then ordered the formation
 of such a group under the authority of the Civil
 Administration. Local lawyers have appealed to the Supreme
 Court to eliminate this order. Strikes are legal, except for
 political reasons. One union office in Nablus was closed for
 6 months on security grounds and the head of the office was
 placed under administrative detention. Some union activities,
 such as cultural exhibitions or May Day festivities, were
 prohibited on security grounds.
 Israel permitted several settler groups to hold political
 rallies in the occupied territories during 1986. The Israeli
 group Peace Now was also allowed to hold a rally in Hebron,
 and the Tehiya Party was permitted to hold its party conference
 in the Kiryat Arba settlement outside Hebron. Israeli settlers
 attempted unsuccessfully to stop the Peace Now rally by
 erecting illegal road blocks, physically and verbally harassing
 participants, and assaulting some members of the Israeli
 Knesset. Although several of those involved were arrested,
 none was brought to trial.
 Israeli authorities have closed universities and colleges at
 times on security grounds. The Hebron polytechnic was closed
 
 
 1191
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 for 1 month in April following a demonstration protesting the
 Tehiya party convention being held in Hebron. An-Najah
 University was closed temporarily in January because the
 authorities said that they were concerned that recently held
 student elections would lead to disturbances. The authorities
 also closed An-Najah twice in December on security grounds and
 Bethlehem University for 3 weeks in November on the same basis.
 One campus of Bir Zeit University was closed for most of
 December following violent clashes between students and
 security forces, and classes were disrupted by roadblocks on
 several other occasions in 1986. Roadblocks also hampered
 classes at Bethlehem University. These measures at times went
 beyond what might be reasonably justified on security grounds.
 At times university officials also called off classes because
 of concerns that student protests would occur.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious practice exists in the occupied
 territories. No group or sect is banned on religious grounds.
 Muslim and Christian holy days are observed without hindrance,
 and Muslims and Christians operate a variety of private schools
 and institutions. There has been no reported interference with
 the publication or distribution of religious publications.
 Israel protects Muslim and Christian holy places and usually
 assures freedom of access to them. On occasion, the
 authorities have denied both Arab and Jewish groups access to
 religious sites on religious or security grounds. In January
 and February 1986, some members of the Israeli Knesset created
 disturbances on the Temple Mount, which is the third holiest
 site in Islam and is the former site of the Jewish Temple.
 Israeli government spokesmen criticized the disturbances, and
 there were no changes in the system under which Islamic
 authorities administer the area.
 Israel facilitates travel into Jordan for Muslims making the
 pilgrimage (the hajj) to Mecca by expediting bridge clearance
 procedures and extending the hours of operation of the bridges.
 In 1986 several thousand pilgrims from the occupied territories
 made the hajj. At least 20 were refused permission on security
 grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted for Arabs within
 the occupied territories, but some restrictions exist.
 Approximately 80,000 Arabs travel daily to Israel to work.
 All residents over 16 must carry identity documents and show
 them to security officials whenever requested. Arab vehicles
 are often stopped for security checks, sometimes at
 unauthorized roadblocks by Israeli settlers. Palestinians
 resident in the territories need permits to remain overnight
 in Israel; West Bankers and Gazans are generally forbidden to
 remain in Jerusalem after midnight, but the rule is not always
 rigorously enforced.
 Following violent incidents, curfews lasting several hours to a
 day are often imposed in the surrounding area. At least four
 West Bank towns and five refugee camps were placed under curfew
 at least once during 1986.
 Most inhabitants of the occupied territories are permitted to
 travel abroad and many thousands do so each year. Exit visas
 
 
 1192
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 are required. Many residents of the West Bank are Jordanian
 citizens and use Jordanian passports for travel to or through
 Jordan. Israel issues laissez passers to residents of the
 occupied territories to facilitate foreign travel from ports
 and airports in Israel after a security check. In some cases,
 restrictions are imposed on reentry. Travel bans are also
 imposed on some persons suspected of, but not charged with,
 antioccupation activities. Bans on the travel of residents of
 particular areas have been used by Israeli security forces as
 a form of collective punishment. In October, following the
 hand-grenade attack in Jerusalem in which 1 Israeli was killed
 and 70 injured, a total travel ban was imposed on all West
 Bankers crossing the bridge. The ban was partially lifted
 after 1 week but remained in force for all residents under the
 age of 40 until mid-December. Despite the formal state of war
 between Israel and Jordan, two-way travel between the West Bank
 and Jordan is permitted. Palestinians returning from Jordan,
 as well as other Arabs and persons of Arab descent, regardless
 of citizenship, are all subject to search, and many complain of
 unnecessarily harsh or humiliating treatment and harassment.
 Israel permitted all members of the Jordanian Parliament
 resident in the West Bank to travel freely to attend
 parliamentary sessions during 1986.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew the laissez passers of West Bank residents
 who study or work abroad for a period of time on the ground
 that they have abandoned their residence, even though they
 have not acquired foreign citizenship. Such persons are
 permitted to return to the West Bank as tourists only, and are
 sometimes denied any right to return. Entry permits or
 residency rights are often denied to spouses and children
 solely because the head of the household has emigrated.
 Israel also has not permitted the return of many former West
 Bank residents who were not present in the territories, for
 whatever reason, at the time a census was taken in late 1967
 by Israeli authorities.
 Gazans normally do not require prior approval for travel to
 the West Bank. Under special arrangements concluded between
 Israel and Egypt, thousands of Gazans regularly cross into
 Egypt, particularly to work or visit relatives in the divided
 city of Rafah. Israel permits Golan Heights Druze to return
 after attending school in Syria; it has not, however, permitted
 the return of other Syrians who fled or were expelled from the
 area during and after the 1967 war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no regional self-government in the territories. At
 the municipal level, Arab civil servants, institutions, and
 municipal officials operate under the military government.
 Most villages retain their traditional leadership. No
 Palestinian political parties or overtly political
 organizations are permitted.
 Municipal elections were last held in 1976. A few elected
 mayors have continued to hold office. Others were dismissed
 and replaced by Israeli officials. In December 1985, a
 Palestinian, the last duly elected deputy mayor and elected
 head of the Chamber of Commerce, was appointed mayor of Nablus,
 but he was later assassinated, at which time his deputy took
 over as acting mayor. In October 1986, Arab mayors were
 appointed to replace Israeli officials in Ramallah, Al-Bireh,
 
 
 1193
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 and Hebron. With these appointments, all major West Bank
 municipalities now have Arab mayors. Bethlehem and Tulkarm
 are the only major towns governed by elected Arab mayors. Arab
 residents of East Jerusalem are permitted and encouraged to
 vote in municipal elections. Approximately 20 percent did so
 in the 1983 elections.
 Most Arab residents of the West Bank are Jordanian citizens
 and as such are represented by 2 senators and 30 members of
 the Jordanian Parliament. Although Jordan has held regular
 parliamentary elections, Israel has not permitted the holding
 of similar elections in the West Bank since 1967.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A variety of local groups, both Israeli and Palestinian, are
 concerned with human rights issues. Publications and
 statements from these groups are allowed to circulate in the
 occupied territories. Arab and Israeli human rights groups
 increased their coordination in 1986.
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories, and does not interfere with
 their investigations.   A Palestinian field investigator for
 Law in the Service of Man, the West Bank affiliate of the
 International Commission of Jurists, who was placed under
 administrative arrest in September 1985 on security grounds,
 was released in March 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza are subject to
 laws and regulations of the Israeli military government.
 However, Jewish settlers residing in these areas are subject
 to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration, as applied
 to Israeli nationals residing in Israel. Therefore, on a
 broad range of issues, including the right to due process,
 acquisition and loss of residency, freedom of movement, land
 use, and access to social services, Palestinians in the West
 Bank and Gaza are treated differently and usually less
 favorably than Jewish settlers in the same areas. Israel has
 declared that Israeli law applies to all inhabitants of East
 Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
 The use of land by Israeli authorities for Israeli settlements,
 military purposes, road projects, and other means by which
 access is restricted significantly affects the lives and
 economic activities of Palestinians. Palestinians are excluded
 from the Higher Planning Council which draws up plans for land
 use in the occupied territories. In 1971 the military
 government issued an order transferring authority from local
 municipal and village councils to the Higher Planning Council.
 Government planning bodies, military officials, and Israeli
 settlers are represented on the Council.
 The authorities have discriminated against the Palestinian
 population in the use of a substantial portion of the land in
 the occupied territories which is under government control.
 Approximately 5 percent of the land to which Palestinian access
 has been restricted has been turned over to Jewish Israeli
 settlers for residential, agricultural, or industrial use.
 
 
 1194
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Israeli settlements receive large annual subsidies in various
 forms from the Government of Israel and Israelis receive
 inducements to take up residence in the settlements.
 Indigenous Palestinians have not been offered the use of land
 under Israeli control on the same basis as Israeli settlers,
 nor have they received special assistance from the Israeli
 authorities to encourage them to remain in the territories.
 During the early and midsummer, approximately 100 American
 citizens of Palestinian origin arriving as visitors had their
 passports impounded at Israeli points of entry enroute to the
 occupied territories, were-given visas of shorter duration
 than normal, and several were made to post bonds of $2,000 to
 $3,000. Israeli authorities asserted that this was done only
 in cases in which entrants were expected to stay indefinitely
 and was not intended to be discriminatory. The practice
 appeared to end by late summer.
 The West Bank is served by four universities, one college, one
 community college, and a variety of other educational
 institutions, all established or upgraded since the beginning
 of the Israeli occupation. However, none of the universities
 receives financial support or other assistance from the
 occupation authorities. Palestinian teachers at educational
 institutions in the occupied territories must receive
 certificates from the Israeli authorities, the issuance of
 which is based on security and political criteria, as well as
 professional competence.
 The Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights consists
 of 1,295 square kilometers, and has an Arab population of
 about 15,000, mostly Druze and a small percentage of
 Alawites. Approximately 7,500 Israeli settlers live in some
 32 settlements in the Golan Heights. Druze village councils
 have complained that they do not receive sufficient funding to
 provide minimal municipal services, and a third of the
 estimated 4,000 school children are reported to be studying in
 substandard classrooms.
 Urban West Bankers are increasingly sophisticated in their
 social attitudes, including toward the role of women, but the
 rural majority continues to hold more traditional social
 values. There are no legal or administrative prohibitions on
 the employment of women in the occupied territories, although
 traditional cultural mores and family commitments limit most
 to homemaking. Most Palestinian women holding jobs outside
 their homes reside and work in urban areas. Employment of
 women is concentrated in service industries, education, and
 health services, with a small number working in journalism,
 law, and other professions.
 Although women legally have equal access to public education,
 custom and family pressures limit the number of women in West
 Bank schools. Even so, female school enrollment is quite high
 by Middle Eastern standards. A little over 45 percent of the
 primary and secondary school students are female. While female
 enrollment at the postsecondary level varies between roughly
 30 to 45 percent at coeducational West Bank colleges and
 universities, a number of teacher and vocational training
 centers are all male or all female.
 There is a wide range of women's cooperative groups for health
 care, child care, handicraft production, vocational training,
 
 
 1195
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 and other services. The West Bank-wide Society for the
 Preservation of the Family is active in supporting women's
 needs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions in the West Bank are governed by the
 Jordanian labor law of 1960 which provides for a maximum
 workweek of 48 hours, except for hotel, food service, and
 cinema employees whose workweek is 54 hours. There is no
 minimum wage. Child labor is not permitted. Histadrut, the
 Israeli national labor organization, has taken steps to assure
