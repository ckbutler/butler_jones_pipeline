 GUATEMALA
 Throughout its history, Guatemala has been plagued
 by military coups and political violence. Over the
 past two centuries, it has seldom enjoyed democratic
 rule. Most civil and political liberties continued
 to be officially respected during 1978, but a high
 level of political and personal violence has had
 a chilling effect on the exercise of some of those
 liberties. Kidnappings and assassinations of government
 personnel, conservative politicians and businessmen
 by leftist terrorists and politically-motivated murders
 by rightist groups continued at about the same level
 as during 1977. A leftist student leader and the
 Nicaraguan Ambassador were among the political murder
 victims. In this violence-prone society it is often
 impossible to differentiate politically-inspired
 from privately-inspired violence. Charges of violations
 such as degrading treatment and arbitrary arrest
 by security forces or by local authorities continued
 in several parts of the country, particularly in
 those rural areas subject to guerrilla activities.
 Overall, the level of both political violence and
 human rights violations remained lower than during
 the decade prior to 1976.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture of alleged subversives has occurred with
 frequency in Guatemalan history, despite the constitu-
 tional prohibition against physical abuse of the
 person. Incidents of torture, summary executions
 and anonymous death-squad activities, which were
 prevalent during the decade of 1966-1976, decreased
 after the substantial defeat of the insurgent movement
 which characterized that period. Some recent allega-
 tions of torture by security personnel appear credible.
 
 
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment and punishment are legally prohibited.
 Abuses nevertheless occur, especially during interroga-
 tion of those suspected of terrorism or of collaboration
 with terrorists. The unexplained deaths of criminal
 repeaters have given rise to credible reports of
 "death squad" activities; the Government has denied
 police involvement in such activities.
 In the rural areas, there are accusations of frequent
 political and personal violence committed by both
 private parties and local military and civil officials.
 There have been few prosecutions by the Government
 as a result of such charges, nor is it known to have
 disciplined those allegedly implicated. Deaths which
 appeared to have political overtones average fifteen
 to thirty each month; some of these are allegedly
 caused by members of the security forces acting either
 officially or unofficially, while others are allegedly
 caused by private political elements of both extreme
 right and extreme left. There is insufficient data
 to accurately determine who is responsible for most
 of the violence. In May at least 38 Indians died
 during a land tenure altercation in Panzos, Alta
 Verapaz, when a small group of soldiers fired into
 a massed gathering of campesinos. Although some
 soldiers were, in fact, wounded by machete blows,
 many commentators concluded that the soldiers had
 badly overreacted.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Article 46 of the Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 arrest. During 1978, some persons suspected of subver-
 sive activities were arrested and detained for several
 days, in at least some cases without due process.
 Accurate estimates of the number of such cases are
 not available. Most of those accused of subversion
 were detained and interrogated for short periods.
 No cases of lengthy detention without indictment
 or trial were reported in 1978.
 
 
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 53 provides for due process of accused persons
 before the courts. Accused persons brought before
 the court continued generally to receive fair public
 trials in accordance with constitutional provisions.
 There are occasional reports, some credible, of cruel,
 arbitrary and unjust treatment and/or disappearances;
 some of these reports refer to individuals allegedly
 suspected of guerrilla activity who have not been
 brought before the judicial system. The Government
 and others on occasion charge that pressure from
 terrorist groups on judges results in fewer convictions
 than might otherwise be the case.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Article 51 of the Constitution prohibits this practice.
 Nevertheless, there have been seemingly credible
 charges that homes have been invaded, particularly
 in rural areas in the course of anti-terrorist sweeps
 by security forces.
 2.    Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Areas as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Significant gains in living standards and middle
 class expansion have been made over the past twenty
 years, particularly among urban industrial and service
 workers. While annual population growth has been
 running at close to three percent in recent years,
 per capita Gross National Product growth in real
 terms has nevertheless averaged four percent. However,
 severe social and economic inequalities exist. Poverty
 is not confined to rural dwellers or to Indians who
 comprise upwards of forty percent of the population.
 Their situation, nevertheless, is typical of the
 primitive, small-scale agricultural practices which
 contribute to the low living standard of many Guatemalans.
 A growing urban middle class, export crops and increasing
 
 
 259
 industrialization boosted the per capita GNP in 1978
 to about one thousand dollars, but income and land
 distribution remained highly concentrated. According
 to the World Bank, in 1970 the upper quarter of the
 population received 67 percent of the country's income,
 against seven percent for the lowest quarter, proportions
 which probably still apply today. Such corruption
 as exists does not appear to divert significant resources
 from development.
 The Laugerud Government sought to increase invest-
 ments in rural areas, which are predominantly poor.
 It negotiated loans from international donors for
 expansion of rural health services, primary and secon-
 dary education facilities, agricultural credit and
 support of cooperatives. Literacy currently stands
 at about forty percent. The Lucas Administration
 is continuing these policies.
 The Government's handling of problems created by
 the 1976 earthquake was effective. With the assistance
 of the United States and other donor countries, the
 Guatemalan Government continues to work effectively
 to restore shelter and basic social services to the
 hardest hit highland areas.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 There is freedom of thought, speech, press and worship.
 Church-related groups and the Government clash occasion-
 ally when foreign missionaries are accused of meddling
 in domestic politics, or when the foreign clergy
 become active in organizing or counseling peasant
 groups in a way the Government believes challenges
 its authority. The Laugerud Government, in its final
 months, accused Catholic Church officials working
 in rural areas of agitating among campesinos. A
 
 
 260
 foreign nun was expelled. Newspapers and broadcasting
 media frequently criticize Government officials and
 policies without censorship or retaliation. In the
 Panzos incident, for example, several newspapers
 mounted strong attacks on the army's actions.
 Political protest demonstrations and parades are
 regulated by the Ministry of Interior, which issues
 permits. The new Government has enforced the permit
 policy rigorously, dispersing demonstrations which
 lack prior authorization. When requested, such permits
 have usually been issued. A protest strike opposing
 a bus fare increase in October led to serious riots
 in which as many as 25 persons were shot to death,
 some by the police, some by unknown persons.
 Labor unions are free to organize under the law but
 there are few strong independent unions. The Govern-
 ment has caricelled the legal status of public sector
 employee associations which participated in illegal
 strikes. Threats by right wing terrorist groups
 and the assassination of trade union figures by unknown
 parties have also affected the climate in which organized
 labor operates. High demand for jobs and the lack
 of skills of most workers make the economic climate
 for trade union organization difficult. Furthermore,
 the system of labor justice in Guatemala is viewed
 by unions as favoring business and is the source
 of much labor discontent. The Government has indicated
 it favors revision of the labor code.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are generally no restrictions on foreign or
 domestic travel or on emigration by Guatemalans.
 However, travel to and from some rural guerrilla
 areas has at times been controlled. Similarly, travel
 in the Panzos area was restricted for a day following
 confrontation with the Indian campesinos.
 
 
 261
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 For the past two decades, Guatemalan politics has
 been dominated by the military within a constitutional
 framework providing for regular elections and civilian
 control below the top level. Opposition parties
 contest elections, hold rallies, have access to the
 media and hold seats in the national and municipal
 assemblies. Open and hard-fought elections in 1978
 transferred power to a new administration, though
 the military retained its traditional primacy. While
 nominated by civilian political parties, two of the
 three candidates were military officers and the third
 was a retired officer. The new Government is committed
 to authorize additional parties, the first ones since
 1968, and has recently certified the first two on
 the list of applicants, in accordance with constitu-
 tional provisions pertaining to political parties
 (Chapter 5 of the Constitution). Others awaiting
 certification are permitted to function as parties
 in most respects other than formally presenting candi-
 dates in national elections. The Constitution bans
 the Communist party.
 The 1978 Presidential elections were marked by fraud
 charges on all sides. Since no candidate received
 the necessary majority, the Congress was required
 to choose the President, as the Constitution provides.
 The Congress chose the winner of the officially certified
 popular vote.
 Women in many instances do not enjoy equal political,
 economic and social rights. The persistence of tradi-
 tional social customs inhibits rapid change in this
 area.   The Government has no specific policy to
 promote women's rights.
 About 2.5 million Indians of Guatemala's total popula-
 tion of 6.5 million speak a language other than Spanish
 as their mother tongue. The great majority of these
 people are illiterate and many are unable even to
 converse in Spanish. They have been largely isolated
 from much of national life. The Indians have often
 been the objects of discrimination; for this reason,
 
 
 262
 among others, they confront a variety of social and
 political disabilities.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No reports have been received of any requests made
 to the Government of Guatemala for human rights investi-
 gations by international and non-governmental groups
 during 1978 or in recent years. Unofficial observers
 from the United States and Europe visited Guatemala
 for the national elections.
 Guatemala has ratified the American Convention on
 Human Rights. Guatemala abstained on permitting
 Amnesty International to attend the 1978 General
 Assembly of the Organization of American States as
 a "special invitee," but at the United Nations sup-
 ported creation of the Office of High Commissioner
 for Human Rights.
