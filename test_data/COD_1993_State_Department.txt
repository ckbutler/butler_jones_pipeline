 ZARE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko has dominated an authoritarian governmental sys-
 tem since 1965, when he took power in a military coup. Although forced by oppo-
 nents to announce in 1990 an end to the one-party state Mobutu has steadfastl
 refused to permit a transition to democracy. A National Conference was convene
 composed of 2,800 delegates and chaired by the Archbishop of Kisangani, Laurent
 Monsengwo Pasinya. The Conference, which closed under pressure from Mobutu in
 December 1992, investigated official wrongdoings, drafted a new constitution (in-
 
 
 316
 tended to be ratified by a referendum), extended President Mobutu's term of office
 for 2 years, to December 1993, and selected Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba,
 Mobutu's most implacable foe, as Prime Minister. In the Transitional Act the Con-
 ference also decided to establish a High Council of the Republic (HCR) to exercise
 legislative functions and to ensure the implementation of conference decisions. Arch-
 bishop Monsengwo was chosen as its President.
 However, since the end of the Conference, President Mobutu has contested Prime
 Minister Tshisekedi's authority and has also taken actions which challenged the au-
 thority and the decisions of the National Conference. On April 1, Mobutu announced
 Tshisekedi's dismissal as Prime Minister and appointed a defector from Tshisekedi's
 Union for Democro.cy and Social Progress (UDPS) party, Faustin Birindwa, to run
 a parallel government. Tshisekedi refused to recognize the President's authority to
 remove him from office, although Mobutu's control of the security apparatus per-
 mitted him easily to evict the Tshisekedi ministers from their offices and to main-
 tain de facto control of government operations. At year's end, negotiations to break
 the political deadlock between the "dual governments" were still in progress. The
 core questions, which the Zairian political class is unable to resolve, are Mobutu's
 role and who will lead the transition to democracy as Prime Minister.
 Control of the security forces continued to be of crucial importance in the ongoing
 struggle over the transition process. Mobutu has built up overlapping forces. The
 elite forces of the Civil Guard, headed by President Mobutu's brother-in-law, Gen-
 eral Baramoto Kpama Kpata, and the Special Presidential Division (DSP), under his
 ethnic kinsman General Nzimbi Ngbale, remained generally loyal to the Chief of
 State. The DSP, in particular, was implicated in many human rights abuses during
 the year, yet the President took no action against its commander. The 70,000-person
 regular armed forces became both perpetrator and victim of human rights abuses.
 Compensation for these forces continued to be at the center of incidents of military
 indiscipline and abuse of civilians. Looting by soldiers broke out at the end of Janu-
 ary in Kinshasa after President Mobutu ordered the troops paid with newly issued
 5,000,000 (then worth about $2) Zaire notes, which Prime Minister Tshisekedi had
 earlier proclaimed "demonetized," and which then were not accepted in commerce.
 Subsistence agriculture has long been the base of Zaire's economy, but its min-
 erals and mining output-especially copper-traditionally generated the hard cur-
 rency revenue. Throughout 1993, however, Zaire continued to suffer sharp economic
 contraction. Diamond exports, mainly outside regulated channels, became the main-
 stay of Zaire's hard currency revenues, while the output of the rest of the mining
 sector, hobbled by the lack of new investment, dwindled into insignificance.
 With public employees unpaid for months at a time, and with little investment
 or maintenance, Zaire's infrastructure has continued to deteriorate. At the same
 time, corruption, blackmail, extortion, and embezzlement remained endemic. Infla-
 tion slowed to an annualized rate of between 300 and 400 percent during the first
 9 months of the year, but accelerated at a hyperinflationary pace during the final
 3 months of 1993 in the wake of the Birindwa Government's so-called monetary re-
 form in late October. Average annual inflation for the year is estimated close to
 9,000 percent, compared with just over 3,000 percent in 1992. About 70 percent of
 the population is rural, mainly engaged in subsistence farming; this, along with a
 deeply rooted extended family system, has permitted people to survive the current
 economic crisis.
 Zaire is undergoing its worst human rights crisis since the end of the civil war
 in the early 1960's. There were massive human rights violations, especially by the
 Mobutu Government in blocking democratic reform. It used a variety of brutal tech-
 niques, including assassination and unlawful detention, to hit at opposition politi-
 cians, labor officials, journalists, and human rights monitors. It continued to incite
 ethnic violence to cause loss of life and massive internal displacement of thousands
 of persons in Shaba province. Although there was no hard evidence of direct govern-
 ment involvement, there was extensive additional ethnic violence in the province of
 North Kivu, with resulting heavy loss of life and property. Throughout the year, an
 atmosphere of insecurity plagued Zaire, with frequent nighttime violence by military
 elements, disrupting many aspects of government, including judicial operations.
 Prison conditions, already seriously health threatening, deteriorated further during
 the year.
 Hundreds of people lost their lives during the January armed forces uprising, both
 as a result of the rioting and during the suppression of the looting by loyal elements
 of the armed forces. No prosecutions resulted from the January mutiny.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudiial Killing.-There was a pattern of attacks by
 security forces in 1993, some of them lethal, against opposition party activists. Secu-
 rity forces killed the 28-year-old son of UDPS party leader Frederick Kibassa
 Maliba, and wounded two of his other children, in an attack on Maliba's home dur-
 ing the January riots.
 Thirteen gendarmes were implicated in the January 3 death of another politician,
 Nyamwisi Mwingi of the Federalist Christian Democratic Party, while he was inves-
 tigating reports of disturbances in the eastern town of Butembo. There were no re-
 ports of legal prosecution of the gendarmes arrested in this case.
 The most serious incident of extrajudicial killing stemmed from an armed forces
 mutiny that broke out in Kinshasa on January 28. Elements of the SARM (Military
 Intelligence Unit), the Civil Guard, and the DSP, who remained loyal to President
 Mobutu, summarily executed up to several hundred soldiers from the regular armed
 forces during the course of their efforts to suppress military looting. Bodies were ob-
 served unburied at roadsides in Kinshasa in the days following the uprising.
 The Zairian Association for the Defense of Human Rights (A      DHO) a local
 human rights group, estimated the number of dead at 259; other estimates ranged
 as high as 1,000. The dead were largely mutinous military personnel; however civil-
 ian deaths included the French Ambassador, who was shot while standing at the
 window of his office; a Zairian employee of the French Embassy killed at the same
 time; and several foreign businessmen killed while trying to protect their prperty.
 No one was prosecuted for the murders committed dumring the uprising. Press ac-
 counts reported, however, that a military council convicted 34 commandos in late
 November for their role in a 1992 uprising in Kisangani.
 Several people were reported killed in Kinshasa July 4 when police forces put
 down a rally by the opposition UDPS party; some eyewitnesses said police shot di-
 rectly into the crowd. A priest was killed in late November when security forces
 looted a Catholic center and a warehouse for relief supplies in the provincial town
 of Kananga.
 Poorly paid and undisciplined, the security forces are frequently accused of rob-
 bing and intimidating civilians, sometimes using lethal force. One example of vio-
 lence and retaliation between undisciplined troops and civilians occurred in Feb-
 ruary in the Kinshasa neighborhood of Kingasani, when soldiers reportedly killed
 a well-known sports trainer. Civilians killed a soldier in retaliation, and troops,
 probably DSP, responded by firing on the funeral procession and the surrounding
 neighborhood, leaving 20 to 50 people dead.
 Local human rights gups report several incidents per month in which uniformed
 personnel assumed to be security forces shoot or beat a civilian to death, often dur-
 ing the course of a robbery. It was not always possible to obtain independent ver-
 ification of these incidents or of armed forces participation in them. Given the re-
 moteness of much of Zaire's territory, many other incidents in the interior undoubt-
 edly went unreported. While it was impossible to determine with any precision how
 many deaths can be attributed to armed forces indiscipline, there is enough consist-
 ency in the reports to indicate that such deaths are a fairly regular occurrence.
 Few, if any, of these cases are ever legally prosecuted. The critically underfunded
 cia   system has nearly ground to a halt, hampering prosecutions. Furthermore,
 ocal hman rights groups and others suspect that a degree of Government complic-
 ity in the January pillage has caused even more than the usual footdragging in
 prosecutions of soldiers involved in pillage-related abuses.
 There are occasional allegations that extremist elements of the Holy Union Oppo-
 sition Coalition, which backs Tshisekedi, intimidate political opponents, although it
 was difficult to confirm these incidents. The pro-Mobutu MPR party and a human
 rights organization, Voice of the Voiceless (VSV), report that Makoba Bidimu, the
 MPR's Assistant Secretary General for Information died following a confrontation
 with a group of militants from the Holy Union's UDPS party.
 b. Disappearance.-Given the breakdown of administration throughout Zaire,
 some reports of disappearances may be attributable to common crimes. While secu-
 rity forces frequently held detainees incommunicado or in secret jails, (see Section
 1.d.), they typically have not attempted to conceal the fact of detention.
 While the number of disappearances may have declined in 1993, there are indica-
 tions the practice nonetheless persists. Amnesty International reported that at least
 one person, Emile Nkomb, disappeared in the aftermath of the UDPS demonstra-
 tion repressed by security forces on July 4. A second UDPS supporter, Rene Kanda,
 was seized by men in plainclothes in July; he has not been seen since. Occasionally,
 unidentified odies are reported floating in the Zaire River near Kinshasa.
 
 
 318
 Disappearances in 1993 and in previous years are widely attributed to secret spe-
 cial intervention forces (or "antiterrorist" units) composed of elements of the DSP
 or the Civil Guard. These forces, popularly called the "hiboux," or "owls," are be-
 lieved to have been given the mission of intimidating the political oppsition.
 Human rights monitors had no further information on the 62 Zairian Air Force
 personnel detained in 1992, allegedly for engaging in pillaging. The Government has
 ignored repeated requests to allow visits or to disclose these prisoners' whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture is forbidden by Zairian law, its use is widespread. Security person-
 nel routinely beat suspects during criminal interrogations, and there are credible re-
 ports of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment aimed at punishing and
 humiliating those suspected of supporting President Mobutu's opponents. Claims of
 torture are virtually never investigated by the authorities, including the judiciary.
 Throughout 1993 security forces subjected numerous politicians, armed forces per-
 sonnel, and journalists associated with the opposition to intimidation. Security
 forces ransacked their homes, subjected them to obvious surveillance or beat them.
 Uniformed men shot and wounded the Counselor for Security to the transitional
 Prime Minister during a late September attack in his home. Press sources and
 human rights groups reported that ordinary citizens were frequently subjected to
 random acts of violence- and intimidation as undisciplined and often unpaid security
 forces resorted to robbery and extortion.
 Appalling conditions in most of Zaire's 220 prisons are a serious threat to health.
 Conditions in Kinshasa's Makala Central Prison are typical: Inmates sleep on the
 floor and have no access to sanitation, potable water, or adequate health care. Meals
 are of poor quality, scanty, and sporadic. In September the prisoners went for over
 a week without being fedat all, except by visiting relatives or from the produce of
 small-scale gardening on the prison grounds. Malnutrition is rampant, as are tuber-
 culosis and other infectious diseases. The Zairian Prison Fellowship and the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) report that they have regular access
 to the prisons nationwide. Women and juveniles are housed in separate quarters in
 Makala, but human rights monitors report that controls are inadequate and rapes
 sometimes occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Zairian law for serious offenses,
 punishable by more than 6 months' imprisonment, a warrant is not required for the
 arrest of a suspect. Any law enforcement officer having the status of "judicial police
 officer" is empowered to authorize arrest. This status is also vested in senior officers
 of each of the security services. The law provides that detainees be brought before
 a magistrate for a hearing within the first 48 hours of arrest. If grounds for arrest
 are presented, the magistrate may order detention for an initial period of 15 days
 followed by renewable 30-day periods.
 In practice, the Mobutu Government continued to use arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion as a means to intimidate political opponents. In April Mobutu's security forces
 interrogated the transition Government's Foreign Minister, Pierre Lumbi, for 2
 days, then kept him under house arrest for several weeks, in connection with the
 President's contested attempt to replace the transitional Government and force its
 members to relinquish government documents and seals.
 According to Amnesty International, AZADHO, and other organizations, the
 Mobutu forces made over two dozen politically motivated arrests of journalists, labor
 activists, and opposition party leaders. Many of these arrests occurred in a sweep
 in late March. A second round of arrests, mostly involving midlevel opposition party
 officials, began in late October after the Birindwa Government introduced a new
 currency and decreed imprisonment for anyone who counseled against accepting the
 new notes. Typically, M.bitu security units held these detainees incommunicado for
 several weeks or months on accusations that their writings and political activities
 threatened national security, then granted them a conditional release. The SARM
 (military intelligence) kept a journalist, Kalala Mbenga Kaleo, in custody from his
 August 25 arrest through September 22, apparently in connection with an article
 he wrote for the newspaper La Tempete Des Tropiques, in which he listed the ethnic
 backgrounds and educational achievements of Zaire's generals and admirals. He was
 never charged with a crime.
 In February government troops surrounded the People's Palace. where the High
 Council of the Republic, the Parliament established under the Transitional Act, was
 in session. The troops detained HCR members and others in the building without
 food or potable water for a period of over 48 hours.
 According to AZADHO's September records, about 66 percent of the inmates of
 Makala Prison were awaiting trial. This figure represents some improvement over
 the previous year, when an estimated 85 percent of Makala's inmates were awaiting
 trial. However, human rights and religious groups report that approximately 80 per-
 
 
 319
 cent of inmates in Zaire's prisons are still awaiting trial. Many have been impris-
 oned without trial for several years, in some cases for periods of time longer than
 the maximum period for which they could have been sentenced if convicted.
 The number of political detainees and political prisoners held by Mobutu's secu-
 rity forces at year's end was unknown. In December there were 21 people in deten-
 tion as a result of recent Lumumbist party political demonstrations. There were no
 known detainees still in detention for opposition to the October "monetary reform."
 Persons detained in Zaire for political reasons have traditionally been held under
 administrative detention or house arrest. Many of them are held clandestinely or
 in military prisons. Human rights organizations estimate there are 40 such prisons
 in Kinshasa alone. The Government has never implemented the National Security
 Council guidelines issued in 1990 to end unlawful incommunicado detentions and
 the practice of internal exile. The law mandates judicial oversight of detention cen-
 ters, but such oversight rarely occurs, due to official indifference and to a lack of
 personnel, materiel, and transport.
 There were no known cases of internal or external exile in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the amended 1977 Constitution and the
 proposed new 1992 constitution provide for an independent judiciary, in practice the
 judiciary is not independent of the executive branch and has consistently been re-
 spnsive to priorities and objectives set by the President and his Government.
 Zaire's Civil and Criminal Codes are based on Belgian and customary law. Its legal
 system includes lower courts, appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and the Court
 of State Security. Most cases are initiated at the local level, and many disputes are
 adjudicated by local administrative officials or traditional authorities. Adherence to
 acceptable legal procedures varies in most instances. Charges of misconduct against
 senior government officials must be filed directly with the Supreme Court.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to a public trial and counsel.
 The right of appeal is provided in all cases except cases involving national security,
 armed robbery, and smuggling, which are adjudicated by the Court of State Secu-
 rity. When a defendant is unable to afford a lawyer, the law provides for court-ap-
 pointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in all proceedings before the Su-
 preme Court, and in other cases when requested by a court. In practice, these pro-
 tections are frequently ignored. Many defendants never meet their counsel or do so
 only after months of detention and interrogation.
 Tshisekedi's transitional Government had vowed to improve Zaire's judicial sys-
 tem and deliver fair and impartial justice. However, it has been powerless do so
 since Mobutu dismissed it and installed the rival Birindwa Government early in
 1993. The judicial system is hobbled by a continuing shortage of trained and moti-
 vated personnel, a scarcity of essential supplies, continued intimidation of justices,
 and other constraints. In particular, magistrates, like many other Zairians, suffer
 from inflation-ravaged wages and poor working conditions, a situation that gives
 rise to corruption. The maistrates were on stre for a substantial part of 1993 as
 a result of the Government s failure to pay them.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Security
 forces routinely ignored legal provisions that require a warrant before searching a
 home and entered and searched residences at will. The attack on UDPS party leader
 Kibassa Maliba's home is only one of the more blatant examples of a pattern of in-
 timidation carried out against opposition supporters in their homes. The homes of
 several of the political activists who were arrested in March were searched and ran-
 sacked, as was the home of transitional Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi. Undisci-
 plined security forces also continued to beat, rob, rape, and kill citizens in their own
 homes. Hundreds of such cases occurred during armed forces' looting in January.
 It is widely assumed that the Government monitors mail and telephone communica-
 tions.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Zaire's continuing political crisis greatly exacerbated ethnic tensions and re-
 gional disputes, resulting in many violations of humanitarian law. In particular,
 government officials continued to provoke ethnic clashes in Shaba province and to
 expel members of certain ethnic groups from that area. Provincial Governor Gabriel
 Kyungu Wa Kumwanza publicly blamed Shaba's economic problems on the inhab-
 itants originally from the neighboring provinces of eastern and western Kasai
 (Tshisekedi's region), many of whom have lived in Shaba for several generations.
 Kyungu proclaimed any Kasaians who had not left Shaba by the end of July would
 be killed or imprisoned. Militant members of Kyungu's Party of the Union of Inde-
 pendent Repu licans (UFERI), which had led several violent attacks against
 Kasaians in 1992, reinforced these statements by leading several additional clashes
 in 1993, including in Kolwezi in March, which left several people dead and many
 houses destroyed. As a result, Kasaians continued to leave Shaba province through-
 
 
 320
 out 1993. At year's end, credible sources estimated that about 600,000 people had
 been displaced since the conflict began in 1992.
 Throughout the year, tens of thousands of people waited for transportation to the
 Kasais at railroad stations in the Shaba towns of Kolwezi, Likasi, and Kamina
 often for weeks at a time. Conditions in the makeshift railway station camps and
 on the trains were extremely poor, leading to cases of malnutrition illness, and
 death from exposure. Deaths were recorded on every train taking Kasaians from
 Shaba. Many people, robbed or charged extortionate fees for transportation, arrived
 destitute in eastern and western Kasai.
 Interethnic violence in western Shaba province resulted in the reported burning
 alive of 25 people in Kalemie village on October 11 and the burning of 15 houses
 in Moba village on October 29. Human rights organizations called for an investiga-
 tion to determine the perpetrators of these abuses.
 Ethnic strife broke out in March between residents native to North Kivu province
 and "Banyarwandan" residents who have immigrated to Zaire from Rwanda in sev-
 eral successive waves beginning in the last century. Hostilities between the rival
 groups in Kivu had resulted in up to 6,000 dead and 230,000 displaced between the
 outbreak of violence in March and the end of July, when the violence mostly sub-
 sided. Opposition leaders' allegations of central (i.e. Mobutu) Government involve-
 ment in provoking ethnic conflict in North Kivu have not been verified, although
 it is generally assumed that local officials, including the vice governor, were imp i-
 cated. However, hostilities continued virtually unchecked for almost 4 months until
 the Government sent DSP troops to quell the disturbances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to
 express their opinions freely. Although there is no prior censorship of the media,
 there is a requirement that newspaper publishers deposit copies of each issue prior
 to publication with the Minister of Information and Broadcasting. The print media
 are also subject to an ambiguous ordinance on "press freedom" promulgated on April
 20, 1981, which fails to define "freedom of the press" and is intimidating to journal-
 ists.
 The Mobutu Government's control of the Zairian Radio and Television Office
 (OZRT), the only media organ capable of reaching audiences nationwide, and its in-
 creasing harassment and intimidation of journalists and other outspoken figures of
 the oppoion tended to repress free expression and encourage sel-censorship dur-
 ing the year. Twelve OZRT employees were suspended in 1993 in what was almost
 certainly a clampdown on excessive independence in reporting.
 Although numerous newpapers were published in Kinshasa in 1993, the impact
 of the press remained largely confined to Kinshasa as the lack of transport and
 other obstacles limited distribution of private newspapers to rural areas.
 The Mobutu Government continued to harass and intimidate the print media. It
 arrested journalists from the opposition- linked Le Potentiel, Le Phare, La Tempete
 Des Tropiques, Umoja, and the Kasai-based Les Petites Annonces De La Semaine
 in connection with articles they had published. All were granted conditional liberty
 after several weeks or months of imprisonment. In addition, the Government an-
 nounced a 3-month suspension of the Kinshasa newspaper Les Palmares on August
 4, apparently in connection with a special edition that was considered to have in-
 sulted President Mobutu. No law was cited in the order mandating the suspension.
 The authorities arrested at least one person for possession of the issue. They banned
 completely another newspaper, L'Interprete, and declared its possession a crime fol-
 lowing the publication of a single, highly scatological issue.
 Subsequent to the October 24 "monetary reform," a Government decree threat-
 ened suspension of all periodicals that advised against acceptance of the new cur-
 rency. The Birindwa Government suspended Umoja, its sister publication La Ren-
 aissance, Elima, and Salongo under this decree. All of these periodicals resumed
 publication within days, in defiance of the ban.
 As of the end of the year, those responsible for the 1992 destruction of printing
 equipment belonging to an opposition newspaper as well as the firebombing of a
 printing plant that published opposition newspapers had neither been charged nor
 brought to trial.
 Security forces also reportedly resorted to direct action against the distribution of
 opposition newspapers in Kinshasa and in the interior, particularly during the
 months of March and April, when several vendors were beaten and their news-
 papers confiscated. At the same time, the Government prevented six journalists se-
 lected to attend a seminar in Brazzaville from departing Zaire.
 The Government allowed many foreign journalists into Zaire to report on develop-
 ments throughout the year. However, the local human rights group, Voice of the
 
 
 321
 Voiceless, reported that several foreign journalists in possession of valid visas were
 either denied entry or had their visas revoked shortly after their arrival. Further.
 more, the Mobutu authorities arrested two American free lance journalists, forced
 them to leave Shaba province, and held them under house arrest in Kinshasa for
 several days after they made contact with Kasaian political figures in Shaba.
 Free discussion is generally respected within the university, although the right to
 publish is restricted. Public universities were in operation from January through the
 end of the academic year in September, even though professors were not paid during
 that time. At year's end, it appeared unlikely that the universities would reopen.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of the people to as-
 semble peacefully has never been firmly established in Zaire. Under previously ex-
 isting law the Government requires all organizers of public meetings to apply for
 a permit. Many opposition parties complained that the Mobutu Government contin-
 ued to deny themerission to hold demonstrations. In July security forces forcibly
 repressed a UD    party demonstration in Kinshasa, leaving between one and five
 persons dead (See Section l.a.). Government troops noted outside of the Catholic
 Interdiocesan Center February 26; they destroyed several vehicles parked there
 when several members of the   *gh Council of the Republic, released rom captivity
 at the People's Palace, had gathered to greet the Assembly's President Archbishop
 Monsengwo. Twenty-one people were arrested and several more were injured in
 early December when security forces broke up a series of demonstrations by the
 Lumumbist Palu Party.
 A wide range of private organizations concerned with civic and other affairs have
 been free to organize and conduct their affairs peacefully, without constraints being
 imposed upon them by the Government. However, leaders of political parties and
 other groups, most notably human rights organizations, are routinely subject to har-
 assment (see Section 4).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-About 50 percent of the population is Catholic, 40 percent
 Protestant and Kimbanguist (a Zairian Christian church) and 5 percent Muslim.
 The remainder profess indigenous or other religious beliefs. There is no legally fa-
 vored church or religion in Zaire, but the Constitution limits religious freedom by
 authorizing the Government to regulate religious sects by law.
 The 1971 law regulating religious organizations grants to civil servants the power
 to establish or dissolve religious groups. Under this law the process for becoming
 recognized is restrictive; however, officially recognized religions are free to establish
 places of worship and to train clergy. Most recognized churches have external ties,
 and foreign nationals are allowed to proselytize. In a remarkable decision in March,
 the Supreme Court overturned President Mobutu's 1986 order banning the Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses. While the Court acknowledged that the President had authority to
 ban the Church under the Constitution and laws in force, it held that he had not
 sufficiently specified the dangers to national interests that compelled him to ban the
 group. The Court ordered the Government to pay damages to the Church. At year's
 end, the Government had not paid the damages, but it had apparently ceased perse-
 cuting Witnesses. The Government does not generally interfere with foreign
 proselytizers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry identity
 cards. Police and soldiers erect checkpoints on major roads to inspect papers.
 Passports and exit permits are available, in principle, to all citizens (often at exor-
 bitant cost from corrupt officials), but the Government has regularly prevented indi-
 vidual travel by withholding such documents or by arbitrarily preventing depar-
 tures. In 1993 human rights groups also reported several incidents in which the
 Government blocked journalists, opposition politicians, and human rights monitors
 from leaving Zaire.
 Government treatment of refugees has been generally benign and asylum has
 been liberally granted. (However, disputes over the citizenship rights of Rwandan
 immigrants or their descendants appear to be at the root of ethnic disputes in Kivu.)
 Most refugees in Zaire do not live in camps. Many have settled in already existing
 Zairian villages and towns, and Angolan refugees, especially in Bas Zaire, live in
 villages they have settled. Two indigenous nongovernmental organizations, the
 Church of Christ of Zaire and the Committee for Intervention and Assistance to Ref-
 ugees, provide assistance in conjunction with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which maintains an office in Kinshasa. Doctors With-
 out Borders of Belgium serves Angolan refugees in western Shaba province. Doctors
 Without Borders of Holland is assisting Burundian and Rwandan refugees in the
 Kivu region. As of November, the UNHCR estimated there were about 465,000 refu-
 gees in Zaire, including about 200,000 Angolans, 125,000 Sudanese, and 50,000
 wandans. In October and November, Zaire received an influx of 40,000 Burundian
 
 
 322
 refugees following an attempted coup and ethnic conflict in Burundi. They are re-
 ceiving UNHCR assistance. There were no known instances of forced repatriation
 in 1993.
 Some 60,000 Zairians have sought asylum in neighboring countries. Prospective
 returnees are dealt with individually, and there is no evidence of discrimination
 against them. The continual and worsening economic, political, and social crises
 stimulated increasing numbers of asylum requests at Western embassies in
 Kinshasa and abroad. Most of these Zairians seeking asylum have been interviewed
 by UNHCR and have been found to be economic rather than political refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Mobutu regime has never permitted Zairian citizens to exercise their right
 to change their government. In 1993 President Mobutu maintained de facto author-
 ity over government operations through his control of key units of the military and
 the administration, including the central bank, and by co-opting as Prime Minister
 one of the well-known opposition members.
 He effectively blocked the 2-year program of transition to democracy adopted by
 the Sovereign National Conference in 1992 in a series of moves: In January he
 barred Tskisekedi's cabinet members from their offices and named senior civil serv-
 ants as an interim government- in February he prevented the functioning of the
 High Council of the Republic (1CR), the highest authority established by the Na-
 tional Conference, by having his security forces surround the Peoples' Palace (the
 High Council's seat), and virtually holding hostage the HCR members for over 48
 hours; in March he announced the formation of a new government, headed by Prime
 Minister Faustin Birindwa, a member of UDPS, and reconvened the old National
 Assembly, which was elected under the previous one-party system and whose elec-
 toral mandate had expired.
 Nevertheless, in the face of the President's moves, the Tshisekedi Government re-
 fused to step down, protesting that only the HCR had the authority to dismiss the
 transitional Government, and throughout the year continued to have backing from
 most of the democratic opposition (known as the Holy Union) and diplomatic sup-
 port from the international donor community.
 Several attempts to negotiate a compromise failed to end the impasse. In March
 HCR President Monsengwo called for a "conclave" to discuss potential resolutions,
 but he and the opposition leaders subsequently decided to boycott the conclave, ob-
 jecting to the lack of security guarantees. The conclave, dominated by Mobutu sup-
 porters, then selected Faustin Birindwa as Prime Minister. Negotiations between
 representatives of the conclave and the Holy Union began again on September 10,
 resulting in a draft agreement on the institutional framework of the transition. The
 accord remains unsigned, and on December 3, the Holy Union announced a unilat-
 eral rupture of its participation in the talks.
 There is no official discrimination against the participation of women or minori-
 ties in politics. However, the rival Tshisekedi and Birindwa Governments each in-
 clude only 1 woman in their 32-member Cabinets, and the indigenous Pygies liv-
 ing in remote areas take little part in the political process. The Pygmiesdi not par-
 ticipate in the National Conference, but their interests were represented and their
 plight was debated in plenary sessions. The Conference voted that all Pygmies
 should be considered Zairian citizens with full citizenship.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental Zairian human rights organizations have been active in
 the country since 1990. These include the Zairian League of Human Rights
 (LIZADHO), the Voice of the Voiceless (VSV), the Zairian Association for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (AZADHO), the Zairian Elector's League, the Amos Group,
 and the Zairian Prison Fellowship. All have reported and documented human rights
 abuses and issued reports on the Government's attitude regarding its responsibility
 to protect these rights and to meet the basic human needs of the population. Justice
 Ministry officials threatened AZADHO with closure in September on the grounds
 that some of its branch offices were not formally registered; for its part AZADHO
 notes that the organization's applications for legal standing have met with unex-
 plained delays. Representatives of LIZADHO and the Voice of the Voiceless, among
 others deemed politically sensitive, were prevented from leaving Zaire in the first
 half of the year. After several rebuffs, U.N. envoy Darko Silovic finally received per-
 mission August 22 to lead a 2-week mission to assess the need for humanitarian
 assistance.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Both the Constitution of the Second Republic and that drafted by the
 National Conference forbid discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, or religious affili-
 ation. Despite these constitutional provisions, women are in practice relegated to a
 secondary role in Zaire's traditional society. They are the primary farm laborers and
 small traders and are exclusively responsible for childrearing. In the nontraditional
 sector, women commonly receive less pay for equal work. Women in Zaire tend to
 receive less education than men; a recent U.N. study indicates that females in Zaire
 receive only one-third of the schooling given males. Although women are rep-
 resented in the professions and the civil service, only rarely do women occupy posi-
 tions that permit them to exercise authority over male professionals. Few have at-
 tained positions of high responsibilt    i s
 Women are required by law to attain their spouse's permission before engaging
 in routine legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank
 account, accepting employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987 revision of the
 Family Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's property, to control her own
 proerty, and to receive a property settlement in the event of divorce.
 The Government did not address the issues of discrimination and domestic vio-
 lence against women in 1993. The question of domestic violence has generally been
 ignored by the press and human rights groups despite acknowledgment that it oc-
 curs and may indeed be common.
 Children.-The sharp decline in public spending-the Government has not even
 published a budget for several years-has had a significant impact on programs ad-
 dressing children's welfare. Most schools, for example, only function in areas where
 parents have formed cooeratives to pay teacher salaries. There are no documented
 cases in which security forces or others target children for specific abuse, although
 children suffer from the same conditions of generalized social disorder and wide-
 spread disregard for human rights that affect society as a whole.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is not widlespread in Zaire, but it is prac-
 ticed on young females among isolated groups in northern Zaire.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against Zaire's Pygmy population, estimated
 at between 6,000 and 10,000, continues. There were conflicts over land between the
 nomadic Pygmies and the agrarian populations in the Kivu provinces, and such
 clashes may have resulted in some deaths in 1993. The 1992 National Conference
 proposed a census of the diminishing Pygmy population, with a view toward the
 eventual establishment of territorial reserves. Nofurther action was taken on this
 measure in 1993, as the political impasse blocked most National Conference initia-
 tives.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Zaire's population of about 40 million in-
 cludes over 200 separate ethnic groups. Four indignous languages have national
 status. French is the language of government, commerce, and education. Political of-
 ices have generally been proportionally allocated among the various ethnic groups,
 but members of President Mobutu's Ngbandi ethnic group are disproportionately
 represented at the highest levels of the security and intelligence services. Ngbandi
 predominate at all levels within the Special Presidential Division, the best equipped
 and trained unit of the armed forces.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated any law or expendi-
 tures to improve access for the disabled and has not passed legislation specifically
 forbidding discrimination against disabled persons. A network of privately and pub-
 licly funded specialty schools provide education and vocational training to blind and
 physically disabled students. These schools, however, suffer from the same critical
 runding shortfalls that have devastated the educational system as a whole. Contin-
 ued economic decline and a consequent dearth of investment in roads, sidewalks,
 public buildings, and tranportation has rendered public facilities increasingly inac-
 cessible to everyone, regardess of disability.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to form and join trade unions
 is provided for in the Constitution and in legislation, but there are two exceptions.
 Maistrates and other employees of the judicial system are governed by a statute
 which stipulates that they may not create their own union. In addition, all military
 personnelr(including gendes or the national police) are subject to a statute which
 states that they, too, cannot establish a union.
 Before April 1990, all trade unions were required by statute to affiliate with the
 National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZA),the single legally recognized labor con-
 federation which was an integral part of the only political party then allowed, Presi-
 dent Mobutu's the Popular Movement for the Revolution (MPH). After April 24,
 
 
 324
 1990, when political pluralism was permitted the UNTZA disaffiliated itself from
 the MPR and reorganized under new leadership chosen through elections deemed
 fair by outside observers. Other independent labor unions and nascent confed-
 erations emerged in the ensuing months, most of which organized along occupa-
 tional or party lines. Some of these have antecedents which existed in the earl
 years of Zaires independence. Between 80 to 85 such organizations are now of-
 cially registered with the Labor Ministry, although many exist only on paper.
 Among some of the more prominent union centrals are UNTZA, considered rel-
 atively independent of the MPR since its latest internal elections; Organization of
 United Zairian Workers (OTUZ), which is directed by the former pro-MPR leaders
 of UNTZA; the Democratic Confederation of Labor (CDT), which includes the two
 major public employees unions and is associated with the opposition UDPS party;
 and the pro-PDSC (Social Democrat) Union Central of Zaire (CZA).
 The rapid contraction of the Zairian economy in the last 3 years has decimated
 the formal (wage earning) sector of the economy. According to one nstimate, only 1
 million of Zaire's 40 million population held wage-paying jobs at the end of 1992;
 the figure was probably lower at the end of 1993. Although there are no reliable
 statistics, it is probably safe to assume that most of the rest of the population, with
 the exception of the very young or the very old, is engaged in productive but
 nonwage earning activity. Most of these nonwage workers are employed in subsist-
 ence agriculture; in urban areas, many are employed in small-scale retailing, serv-
 ices, or workshops. UNTZA, still the largest labor confederation in terms of member-
 ship, claims about 300,000 members. Traditionally, the bulk of unionized jobs have
 been clustered in urban or mineral-producing areas and are concentrated in key eco-
 nomic sectors such as ports and transportation, mining, large-scale manufacturing,
 and the public sector. These sectors, and their corresponding unions, have been
 among the hardest hit in the ongoing economic contraction.
 The right to strike is recognized in Zairian law; however, "legal" strikes rarely
 occur since the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and ap-
 peal procedures. Labor unions have not effectively defended the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. The wildcat strikes against the Matadi
 Port and the quasi-legal strike against the Onatra Transportation Company ended
 with negotiated wage increases; a legal strike against the Zaire SEP Petroleum
 Products Distribution Company, however, ended with the firing of several workers.
 Public employees, most of whom were unpaid for a period ranging from 9 to 12
 months, were on strike legally for most of the year. The Vice President of the
 Dinafet Public Employees Union was arrested and held for 2 months on charges of
 "inciting revolt" after he called on public employees to demonstrate to protest the
 nonpayment of their salaries.
 UNTZA participates actively in the Organization of African Trade Union Unity,
 and the Confederation of Zairian Syndicates (CSZ) is affiliated with the World Con-
 federation of Labor (WLC). Several other confederations have expressed an interest
 in an affiliation with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). The Konrad Adenaur and Fredrich Ebert Foundations administer trade
 union programs.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Leislation provides for the
 right to bargain collectively, and an agreement between the UNTZA and the Em-
 ployers Association (ANEZA) provided for wages and prices to be negotiated jointly
 each year under minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned
 until 1991, broke down as a result of the rapid depreciation of Zaire's national cur-
 rency and has not been replaced by an alternative system. Continuing
 hyperinflation has encouraged a return to pay rates individually arranged between
 employers and employees; collective bargaining still exists, at most, on the level of
 the individual enterprise. Economic deterioration has also resulted in a decline in
 the influence of unions, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buy-
 er's market for labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although
 this regulation is not strongly enforced. The Government has not yet promulgated
 modifications to the Labor Code that would strengthen provisions safeguarding the
 right to form unions and to bargain collectively. In the public sector, wages are es-
 tablished by decree, with public sector unions acting only in an informal advisory
 capacity.
 There are no export processing zones in Zaire.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 in Zaire and is not practiced. However, the International Labor Organization's (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) in 1993 continued to express concern about Zairian
 laws dating to 1971 and 1976 requiring able-bodied citizens not otherwise employed
 to perform agricultural and development work as determined by the Government
 
 
 and providing for imprisonment with compulsory labor for persons determined to be
 delinquent on tax payments. These laws have not been enforced in recent years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years. Minors 14 years and older may be employed legally with the
 consent of a parent or guardian. Employment of children of al ages is common in
 the informal economic sector and in subsistence agriculture. Neither the Ministry
 of Labor, which is responsible for enforcement, nor the labor unions make an effort
 to enforce child labor laws. Larger enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most Zairians are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by government decree in 1990, became totally irrelevant as high inflation
 continued throughout 1993. Most workers relied on the extended family and infor-
 mal economic activity to survive.
 The maximum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is 48 hours. One
 24-hour rest period is required every 7 days. The Labor Code specifies health and
 safety standards.
 The Ministry of Labor is officially charged with enforcement of these standards.
 However, in 1993 the COE expressed concern about the inadequacy of reporting
 during the previous 3 years, blaming this unsatisfactory performance on the dearth
 of human and material resources provided to the Ministry. There are no provisions
 in the Labor Code permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without penalty.
