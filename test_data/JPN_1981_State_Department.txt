 JAPAN
 
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Article 14 of the
 Japanese constitution states, "All of the people are
 equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination
 in political, economic or social relations because of
 race, creed, sex, social status or family origin." The
 human rights guaranteed by the constitution are secured
 by a just and efficient legal system, which includes a
 civil liberties bureau within the ministry of justice and
 approximately 11,000 civil liberties commissioners through-
 out the country who are charged with promoting wider recog-
 nition of and greater respect for human rights.
 Japan has evolved a unique culture embodying elements
 of both East and West. Buddhism and Confucianism continue
 to have a basic and pervasive influence on Japanese
 thought and social institutions. There is complete
 freedom of religion in Japan with most religions tending
 to be eclectic and non-exclusive. While Buddhism and
 Shinto remain the two major religions, others flourish,
 including 122 Christian denominations. Missionaries are
 welcome and receive special visa status.
 On March 13, 1981, Japan became the first Asian nation to
 sign the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating
 to the Status of Refugees. Accession to the convention
 and protocol was passed unanimously by both houses of the
 Diet in June, and Japan will accordingly become a formal
 party to the convention effective January 1, 1982.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by law and there are no known
 instances of torture committed in Japan.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by article 3 of the constitution
 and respected in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known cases in Japan in which people have
 been abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention by police or security forces, or by elements
 whose activities are condoned by the government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by article 31, 33 and 34 of the constitution and respected
 in practice. Japanese law provides for a writ of habeas
 corpus. Individuals cannot be arrested without charge
 
 (6ON)
 
 
 605
 and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate
 that sufficient evidence exists to detain the accused
 before trial. Length of time before a suspect is brought
 to trial depends on the nature of the crime, but rarely
 exceeds two months. The average is one to two months.
 Preventive detention does not exist, and no political
 prisoners are held in Japan.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Article 37 of the constitution guarantees the right to
 a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in
 all criminal cases, and this right is respected in
 practice. The defendant is made aware of charges upon
 arrest, and guaranteed a public trial by independent
 civilian courts with defense counsel and the right to
 cross examination. Defense counsels have free and private
 access to defendants without harassment by government
 authorities, and have the right of access to evidence
 before the trial after a formal indictment has been made.
 Defendants also are protected from self-incrimination and
 the application of ex-post-facto laws.
 A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of
 a trial court of first instance may, within the period
 prescribed by law, appeal to a high court as the review-
 ing court. The prosecution may also appeal a judgment
 of the trial court which it finds too lenient or too
 severe, or a Judgment pronouncing the defendant not guilty.
 The reviewing court examines the written record of trial
 court proceedings and considers the written and oral
 arguments of both the defense attorney and the public
 prosecutor. The court may, or sometimes must, hear addi-
 tional evidence in order to make a decision.
 After reviewing the trial court's decision with respect
 to both its factual and legal conclusions, the court
 renders a written decision and opinion either reversing
 or affirming the decision of the trial court. The court
 may affirm the trial court's decision by dismissing the
 appeal. When the reviewing court reverses the original
 decision, it may remand the case to the original or another
 trial court of first instance, or it may make a decision of
 its own.
 If a case has been remanded to a new court of first
 instance, that court will conduct a new trial and
 render a new decision. However, since the decision
 of the reviewing court binds the trial court to which
 the case has been remanded, the trial court cannot
 render a decision inconsistent with the decision of
 the reviewing court. A decision of a reviewing court
 reversing or affirming a decision may be appealed to
 the supreme court, if the judgment of the high court
 is alleged to violate the principles of the constitution
 or to be inconsistent with precedents established by
 the supreme court. A decision of the supreme court
 or that of a high court from which no appeal is made
 is the final disposition of a case.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under article 35 of the constitution, each search or
 seizure shall be made upon separate warrant issued
 by a competent judicial officer. Japanese authorities
 have been scrupulous in observing the legal requirement
 for warrants. The standards for issuing such warrants
 are adquate to guard against arbitrary searches.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by articles 20 and 21
 of the constitution and respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence,
 to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Japan is a densely populated, racially and culturally
 homogeneous country which lacks a significant immigrant
 tradition and which has historically not granted either
 asylum or resettlement to refugees. These factors
 present imposing barriers to the absorption of non-
 Japanese. Nevertheless, Japan has provided temporary
 asylum to Indochinese refugees since their exodus began.
 Over 700 Indochinese were allowed to stay in Japan on
 an indefinite basis when Saigon fell, and Vietnamese
 boat refugees" have been granted temporary asylum since
 1975. In 1979 the government announced it would allow
 up to 500 Indochinese refugees in temporary asylum in
 Southeast Asian camps to resettle permanently in Japan.
 In 1980 this target was raised to 1,000, and in April
 1981 it was raised again to 3,000. The government has
 established two refugee promotion centers to help train
 resettlers in the Japanese language and to prepare them
 for life in Japan. As of April 30, 1981, 641 refugees had
 been resettled permanently in Japan, and 1,339 were in
 temporary asylum status.
 On March 13, 1981, Japan became the first Asian nation
 to sign the United Nations Convention and Protocol
 Relating to the Status of Refugees. Accession to the
 convention and protocol was passed unanimously by both
 houses of the Diet in June, and Japan will accordingly
 become a party to the convention effective January 1,
 1982. The Diet also passed a number of bills amending
 current Japanese laws, bringing them into conformity
 with the requirements of the UN documents. The most
 significant changes effected by the new laws 1) allow
 aliens under the age of 35, including refugees, to par-
 ticipate in the national pension program and to receive
 health insurance benefits; and, 2) recognize the status
 of first asylum refugees.
 
 
 607
 Given the characteristics of Japanese society described
 above, Japan continues to pursue a refugee and asylum
 policy which places emphasis on financial assistance
 to refugees with a view toward third-country resettlement.
 For Indochinese refugees, that assistance amounted to
 approximately $110 million in 1980. In addition, Japan
 contributed some $10 million to Afghan refugee relief in
 1980, and in April of this year pledged $33 million to
 African refugee relief.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All adult citizens have the right to vote. Vote is by
 secret ballot. Political interest groups can organize
 and engage in nonviolent political activity regardless
 of their political hue. Six opposition parties are active,
 ranging from a communist party to a moderate conservative
 party. Elections are honest and open, and they are perceived
 as reflecting the public will. Well-organized labor unions
 play an active role, not only in bringing workers economic
 benefits but also in ensuring participation by workers in
 the political process. Japanese law grants unions the right
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, lobby and make
 political campaign contributions. Public corporation
 employees are not accorded the right to strike, however.
 The collective bargaining rights of government employees are
 limited in that members of the armed forces, police officers
 and firefighters are not permitted to organize.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In March 1981 the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 considered a communication from the Association Fight-
 ing for the Acquisition of Human Rights for Koreans
 in Japan alleging human rights violations against
 Koreans living in Japan. The association has charged
 that%
 --Koreans without permanent residence permits
 are subject to deportation if they are sentenced to
 one year in prison or if they receive welfare. Those
 with permanent residence permits are subject to de-
 portation if sentenced to eight years in prison;
 --They do not have the right to participate in
 the political process in Japan
 --They are discriminated against in the area of
 employmenti
 --They are denied certain social security and
 economic assistance benefits;
 --Public housing is unavailable to them in many
 cities.
 
 
 608
 A spokesman for the association stated that the govern-
 ment had responded to its representations by promising
 that:
 --Public housing would be opened to aliens;
 --Public loan funds for housing would be made
 available to aliens;
 --The ministry of finance would consider "histor-
 ical background" in its response to Koreans who apply
 for small business loans.
 The UNHRC, after considering the allegations, the Japanese
 government's statement, and responses to questions by the
 Japanese delegation, decided to close and dismiss the
 case.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Good quality food, shelter', health care and education
 are widely available to all inhabitants of Japan regard-
 less of race, religion, sex, ethnic background or politi-
 cal opinion.
 Some discrimination against women in the area of employ-
 ment continues despite its prohibition by article 14
 of the constitution and the various legislative measures
 adopted over the past 30 years to accord women the
 same legal status as men. Such discrimination as occurs,
 however, is the result of centuries of social custom
 rather than of present laws and regulations. Female
 employment is expected to be interrupted by marriage and
 child rearing. Occupations and skills which depend on
 continuity of employment find relatively fewer female
 applicants and openings. Although the principle of
 equal pay for equal work is accepted practice in Japan,
 the type of work which 80 percent of women workers perform
 (clerical, sales, services or machine operation) is at the
 lower end of the wage scale. The average female worker
 earns approximately three-fifths the annual wage of the
 average male employee. Protective legislation, which
 generally prohibits the employment of women at night or in
 certain occupations considered dangerous or harmful, further
 restricts the access of women to certain well-paying jobs.
 Since many women interrupt their careers for family reasons,
 the Japanese wage system, in which wages generally reflect
 seniority and age, serves to increase further the difference
 between male and female earnings.
 The government is cognizant of the problems faced by
 women in employment and has instituted numerous pro-
 grams for assisting women to attain greater equality.
 An expert group on equality of the sexes was esta-
 blished by the ministry of labor in December 1979.
 This group, along with the Women's and Young Worker's
 Bureau and the Tripartite Advisory Committee on women's
 
 
 609
 and young workers' problems (both in the ministry of
 labor) has been charged with identifying existing
 areas of employment discrimination and with proposing
 legislative and administration measures for achieving
 equality of opportunity and treatment in employment.
 The Women's and Young Workers' Bureau also provides
 counseling and vocational training services and allow-
 ances to women experiencing difficulties in entering
 or re-entering the labor market.
 Japan's industrial free market economy is the second
 largest in the world, after the United States, in
 gross national product. Distribution of income is
 among the most egalitarian in the world (per capita
 GNP was $8,810 in 1979 dollars). Japan's average life
 expectancy reached 76 years in 1979. Population growth
 has remained steady at 1.1 percent from 1970-79, and the
 in-fant mortality rate was 9 per 1000 live births in 1978.
 with a highly competitive education that provides nine
 years of free, compulsory schooling, Japan has long had
 nearly total adult literacy (99 percent in 1976).
