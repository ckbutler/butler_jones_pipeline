 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka has a constitutional, multiparty, parliamentary form
 of government. Since 1983, it has suffered from increasing
 tensions between its majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil
 communities and violent conflict between government forces and
 armed Tamil militants. On July 29, 1987, Sri Lankan President
 Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Gandhi signed a Peace
 Accord to end the Sri Lankan conflict. Radicals from both
 ethnic communities have refused to accept the Accord.
 Sri Lanka's 1978 Constitution provides for a strong President
 and a unicameral parliament elected by universal adult
 suffrage. Jayewardene, then Prime Minister and leader of the
 ruling United National Party (UNP), became President in 1978
 and was reelected in 1982. The term of the UNP-majority
 Parliament, elected in 1977, was extended 6 years by a 1982
 national referendum, the fairness of which was hotly disputed.
 Sri Lankan voters chose a successor to President Jayewardene
 on December 19. Prime Minister Premadasa, standard-bearer of
 the UNP, was declared winner with just over 50 percent of the
 vote. The leading opposition candidate challenged the results
 of the election, which was marked by high levels of violence
 during the campaign and low voter turnout. On December 20,
 outgoing President Jayewardene dissolved Parliament and set
 February 15 for general elections.
 Under the terms of the 1987 Peace Accord and its implementing
 legislation, powers held by the Central Government are to be
 devolved to new Provincial Councils in- Sri Lanka's eight
 provinces. In 1988 Provincial Councils were elected in seven
 southern provinces and in the newly merged Tamil-majority
 Northeast Province.
 Sri Lanka has 51,000 servicemen in its army, navy, and air
 force. Another 25,000 men serve in its police force,
 including 2,000 police commandos in the Special Task Force
 (STF). The Government also maintains a force of some 15,000
 paramilitary Home Guards. There are few Tamil and Tamil-
 speaking Muslims in the security forces. The overwhelming
 majority are Sinhalese-speaking. Since the Accord was signed,
 Sri Lankan forces have operated primarily in the southern
 seven provinces. A 50,000-strong Indian Peace-Keeping Force
 (IPKF), introduced under the Accord, fought Tamil separatists
 in the northern and eastern parts of the country throughout
 the year. Local and international human rights groups singled
 out the Home Guards and the STF as being responsible for
 numerous human rights abuses in the south in 1988 and
 individual members of the IPKF for violations in the north and
 east.
 Although the per capita gross domestic product is less than
 $400, the population enjoys a reasonably high quality of
 life. Tea and garment exports are the largest sources of
 foreign exchange. Approximately 60 percent of Sri Lanka's
 productive capacity is state owned or controlled.
 Since Sri Lanka's independence in 1948, the leaders of the
 island's two main ethnic groups have discussed ways to
 safeguard the interests of Tamils while addressing the
 grievances of the Sinhalese majority. By the mid-1970's, many
 Tamil leaders concluded that separation of the Tamil-majority
 areas and formation of an independent Tamil state, or "Eelam,"
 was the only solution. Some Tamils formed militant groups
 
 
 1494
 SRI LANKA
 which turned to armed struggle and terrorism to achieve such a
 state. Tension between the two communities came to a head in
 1983, leading to widespread violence and escalated military
 conflict which continued through 1988.
 Discussions involving the Government, Indian mediators, and
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) members began in June
 1986 and ultimately resulted in the July 1987 Accord. Tamil
 militants refused to join these talks. The strongest Tamil
 militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
 initially accepted the Accord and turned in a small number of
 its weapons, but later reneged. This led to armed clashes
 between the LTTE and the IPKF. On October 10, 1987, Indian
 forces launched an offensive against the LTTE in the Jaffna
 Peninsula. During a month of fighting, 2,000 Tamils, many of
 them civilians, and about 450 Indian soldiers were killed.
 Since then, there have been intermittent clashes between the
 IPKF and Tamil militants.
 The Government, in cooperation with the IPKF, sought to
 implement the terms of the Accord as a means of providing a
 lasting solution to the communal problem. It conducted
 Provincial Council elections throughout Sri Lanka, including
 the newly merged Northeast Province. The Government freed all
 but about 170 suspected Tamil militants held in detention
 before the Accord, according to nongovernmental sources.
 These actions, plus the absence of large-scale military
 offensives such as those that claimed more than 3,000 lives in
 1987, contributed to a relative improvement in the human
 rights situation in 1988.
 Nevertheless, serious human rights violations continue. More
 than 1,500 persons--civilians, IPKF soldiers, and militants--
 died in fighting in the north and east. Approximately 800
 more Sri Lankans, many of them government officials and
 supporters, died in political killings carried out by the
 radical revolutionary Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in
 Sinhalese areas. The Government resolved none of the
 estimated 685 cases of disappeared persons in the north and
 east recorded prior to the Accord. There were reports by
 eyewitnesses and human rights groups of new disappearances at
 the hands of Sri Lankan security forces in the south and the
 IPKF in the north and east. Efforts by the Government to
 negotiate an end to the JVP's assassination campaign failed.
 In November the Government enacted new laws aimed at quelling
 JVP agitation. While much of the legislation remained
 unimplemented at year's end, it raises serious human rights
 questions.
 According to a government estimate, 96,000 Sri Lankan
 citizens, driven from their homes by Tamil militants and as a
 result of the fighting, remained displaced. There continued
 to be reports of torture by Sri Lankan security personnel and
 the IPKF. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the
 Emergency Regulations (ER) remained in effect. The Government
 acknowledged that some 2,000 persons in the south were held
 without charge under these laws. Estimates by nongovernmental
 organizations of the number of detainees ranged up to 8,000.
 In the north and east, the IPKF detained an unknown number of
 militant suspects. In releasing a large number of suspects,
 the government dropped nearly 400 cases which were pending
 under the PTA and ER. There were about 14 convicted Tamil
 militants and an unknown number of Sinhalese radicals serving
 sentences under the PTA or ER.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Deaths from politically motivated violence remained a serious
 problem, but military activity, disruption of civil
 administration, and government secrecy made collection of
 accurate statistics difficult. The Government estimated that
 650 civilians were killed in the north and east. About 55
 percent of the deaths resulted from indiscriminate and
 accidental shooting during LTTE-IPKF clashes. The remainder,
 some 275 Sinhalese and Muslim residents, including women and
 children, of Tamil-majority areas, died at the hands of Tamil
 militant groups. Although Sri Lankan security forces were
 generally confined to barracks in the north and east under the
 Accord and took little part in the fighting there, the
 Government estimates that 75 members of its security forces
 were killed in Tamil areas.
 A June report by Amnesty International (AI) mentioned reprisal
 killings of Tamil civilians by the IPKF. Local nongovernmental
 organizations have also alleged that this occurred, especially
 during the October 1987 IPKF offensive in the Jaffna Peninsula.
 However, none of these reports could be confirmed, and th-
 Indian Government denied them.
 The Indian Government estimated that some 670 of its soldiers
 have died fighting Tamil militants since the 1987 Accord-
 Independent observers put IPKF dead at about 400 during 1988.
 Nongovernmental sources said that about 650 Tamil militants
 died in fighting with .the IPKF during the same period. There
 were also reports by eyewitnesses who spoke to human rights
 groups of at least three extrajudicial killings of Tamil
 militant detainees by IPKF personnel during the year. Another
 125 Tamil militants are believed to have been killed by
 members of rival separatist groups.
 In the south, Sinhalese radicals opposing both the Accord and
 the Government murdered more than 800 people, including about
 400 government officials. There were reports by human rights
 groups of extrajudicial killings by members of the government
 security forces, particularly in the south. Nongovernmental
 groups reported at least 25 such cases.
 In December there were reports of killings of suspected JVP
 members by enraged citizens. Some human rights workers and
 others alleged the vigilante groups in question were actually
 comprised of government security forces in civilian dress,
 agents of opposition parties, or disaffected members of the
 JVP itself. However, not enough was known at year's end to
 substantiate these allegations or establish the identity or
 purpose of the groups' members.
 Following a pattern set in 1983, no results of official
 inquiries into these incidents were published, nor was
 disciplinary or judicial action taken against the vast
 majority of the members of the security forces accused of
 human rights abuses. In the single case in which the
 government security forces' role received wide publicity, that
 of a lawyer and JVP activist who died in police custody
 September 3, the Government ordered a public inquiry and
 charged three police officers with murder and conspiracy to
 
 
 1496
 SRI LANKA
 commit murder. The inquiry found that the victim had received
 more than 100 internal injuries and had been taken to the home
 of one of the three officers for questioning. The three were
 due to go to trial in January 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 Frequent disappearance of both Tamils and Sinhalese, usually
 young men, remained a serious concern. AI, in a June report
 on disappearances in Sri Lanka, said that the Government had
 yet to resolve the cases of 685 persons reported to have
 disappeared in the 4 years prior to the Accord. In addition,
 AI said it had documented several new disappearances of
 Sinhalese at the hands of government security forces in the
 south and cited four cases of Tamils in the north and east
 whose whereabouts were unknown after they were taken into
 custody by the IPKF. AI's August report on human rights
 practices in India documented two more disappearances of
 Tamils at the hands of the IPKF in Sri Lanka. Nongovernmental
 sources reported that at least 20 persons had disappeared
 after arrest by the IPKF.
 A nongovernmental group reported eight disappearances of
 Tamils in 1988 after arrest by Sri Lankan security forces in
 Trincomalee. Other local sources reported at least 40
 disappearances of suspected JVP members in the south. These
 sources also reported several cases of Tamil civilians
 kidnaped by Tamil militant groups. In one case, that of a
 Tamil relief agency director taken from his home June 19, the
 weight of evidence indicates that he was killed by his
 abductors, members of the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of
 Students (EROS), because he resisted their demands for control
 of relief projects.
 Sri Lankan attorneys have brought nearly 500 lawsuits during
 the past 2 years asking the Government to produce these
 "disappeared" persons whom witnesses had observed being
 arrested by the security forces, but who were subsequently
 reported not to be in custody. Many of these cases have been
 dropped with the Government's release, over the same period,
 of more than 3,500 militants. Under normal circumstances,
 government authorities respond within days to such summonses.
 However, in PTA cases, the delay allowed while the Government
 prepared its response was lengthened to 12 months. As a
 result, no information has been provided in the majority of
 these cases.
 In many instances, released detainees have reported having
 seen a "disappeared" person in government custody--or, in the
 north and east, IPKF custody--and, in a few cases, later
 having seen the corpse. These reports, along with the
 knowledge that the PTA and ER permit security forces to
 dispose of bodies without inquest, have led local citizens to
 the justifiable conclusion that "disappeared" persons have
 been killed by the authorities in reprisal for attacks on
 security forces.
 AI stated in its June 1988 Report that under current
 procedures inquiry into "disappearance" cases could not be
 effective. In their "Review of the Department of State's
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1987," the Human
 Rights Watch and Lawyers Committee for Human Rights noted, in
 its treatment of disappearances, that for a significant share
 of the reported disappearances there were "scores of sworn
 affidavits" attesting to arrests of men who later disappeared,
 
 
 1497
 SRI LANKA
 and that the Government's response had been "a total denial
 that the security forces--whose activities were witnessed by
 entire villages--were even present in the area where the
 arrests took place."
 In November the Government passed legislation permitting
 police officials with the rank of assistant superintendent or
 above to dispose of dead bodies without inquest and to
 determine who may attend the burial or inquest. The
 legislation exempts these officials from any other laws
 relating to inquests into death or to burial or cremation.
 The Government claimed that several factors complicate the
 task of accounting for disappeared persons. These include
 false names given by arrested persons to conceal their
 identity and affiliation, and the fact that many detainees may
 have left the country after a short detention period and
 continue to live abroad.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment." However, there continued to be persistent
 reports by eyewitnesses and human rights organizations that
 Sri Lankan security forces and the IPKF tortured and
 mistreated persons in detention.
 In September the High Court opened inqairy into the death,
 while in police custody, of a lawyer and suspected JVP
 activist. Medical evidence submitted in public proceedings
 showed that the lawyer had sustained more than 100 internal
 injuries and had died as a result of beating. By the end of
 the year, three police officers had been charged with murder
 and conspiracy to commit murder. They were set to go to trial
 in January 1989.
 In a June 1988 report, covering 1987 and the first half of
 1988, Al reported credible allegations of torture at various
 Sri Lankan police stations and army camps. It said that
 former prisoners stated that they had been beaten, often on
 the soles of their feet, hung upside down, forced to inhale
 burning chili fumes, and burned with cigarettes. The report
 cited evidence in eight specific cases. Local human rights
 groups reported that the use of torture by Sri Lankan security
 forces, particularly the STF, Home Guards, and the paramilitary
 National Auxilary Force at its camp in Biyagama, was commonly
 employed to elicit information on the identity and activities
 of JVP members in the south.
 In its reports on Sri Lanka and India, Al cited three cases of
 torture by IPKF soldiers of suspected Tamil militants in the
 north and east. Local human rights organizations reported
 that torture by IPKF soldiers, while not systematic, was
 condoned by their officers. Methods of torture by IPKF
 personnel were said to be similar to those employed by Sri
 Lankan security forces: victias were reportedly hung by their
 thumbs, subjected to electric shocks, and whipped with cords
 and electric wires. The Indian Government denied these
 allegations.
 In addition to allowing prolonged incommunicado detention, the
 PTA and ER contain other provisions, including allowing
 confessions made to police officers to be used in court and
 
 
 1498
 SRI LANKA
 placing the burden of proof on defendants to show that a
 confession was coerced, that may actually encourage the
 mistreatmentof detainees. In November the Government enacted
 legislation making the distribution or posting of
 antigovernment leaflets threatening death or urging
 participation in illegal work stoppages a capital offense.
 This new provision of the ER was intended to stem the violent,
 antigovernment activity of the JVP. By year's end, no one had
 been charged under the new law.
 On December 17, Parliament enacted a law granting members of
 the security forces and others indemnity from prosecution for
 acts, "legal or otherwise," committed "in the enforcement of
 law and order or for the public safety" during the period from
 August 31, 1977 to December 16, 1988. The bill was criticized
 by human rights activists and the parliamentary opposition for
 its broad scope and its potential to abridge constitutionally
 guaranteed fundamental rights.
 Independent observers also reported that on June 12, following
 a landmine blast that killed two of their comrades, IPKF
 soldiers entered the village of Chempiyanapattu in the Jaffna
 Peninsula, rounded up male villagers, and beat 10 of them.
 Other observers, including AI, said that there had been a
 number of cases of rape of Tamil women by IPKF soldiers in the
 north and east. Indian authorities undertook investigations
 in a number of these cases and in January court-martialed four
 IPKF soldiers on rape charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his
 arrest. An arrested person must be brought within 24 hours
 before a magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious
 crimes, continued detention. A suspect may be detained up to
 3 months without bail, or longer if a court so rules.
 However, the PTA, first adopted in 1979 as a temporary measure
 and made permanent in 1982, and the ER, renewed monthly with
 the extension of the state of emergency in effect since May
 1983, give the security forces extraordinary powers in dealing
 with suspected criminals. These laws authorize preventive and
 incommunicado detention and allow the security forces to
 detain a suspect held under the ER for up to 3 months before
 he must be presented to a magistrate. They also include
 vaguely defined acts which can and have encompassed nonviolent
 expression of opposition to the Government. The potential for
 abuse is clear.
 Magistrates are not empowered to investigate the circumstances
 leading to a person's arrest and continued detention, but
 under the ER "shall" remand the detainee to a prison where he
 may be held indefinitely. A person held under the PTA may be
 detained without charges for up to 18 months, but there have
 been numerous cases of persons held longer. Bail may be
 granted for persons held under the ER but, once charged,
 persons held under the PTA are ineligible for bail. Visits by
 family, access to lawyers, food, and other conditions of
 incarceration are normally restricted under these
 extraordinary laws.
 Relatives can write to the Ministry of Defense and ask that
 the case of a family member detained under the PTA be
 
 
 1499
 SRI LANKA
 reviewed. The review is conducted by a three-man Advisory
 Board which considers the evidence, interviews the police and
 the detainee, and makes a nonbinding recommendation. Board
 reviews frequently take several months, and government
 authorities have refused or delayed carrying out the
 recommendation of the board in some cases.
 Persons may also challenge the legality of their detention
 either by filing a habeas corpus suit in the Courts of Appeal
 or by charging the Government before the Supreme Court with
 illegally violating fundamental rights under the
 Constitution. The Courts of Appeal are located only in
 Colombo, which necessitates costly travel to the capital for
 those seeking this remedy. Fundamental rights suits must be
 brought--complete with documentation--within 30 days of the
 alleged infringement. This 30-day limit makes it virtually
 impossible in practice for persons detained incommunicado for
 prolonged periods, or relatives of those alleged to have
 disappeared, to bring such suits.
 The PTA and ER were used extensively to detain large numbers
 of Sinhalese youths allegedly belonging to radical political
 groups. The Government acknowledged in mid-1988 that some
 2,000 such suspects were being held. Nongovernmental
 observers believed that as many as 8,000 Sinhalese suspects
 were in government custody. The Government said that a
 committee, headed by a retired High Court judge, had been set
 up to review individual cases and release those suspected of
 less serious infractions of the security laws. By early
 October, no more than 20 such releases had occurred.
 The release of suspected Tamil militants, begun after the
 signing of the Accord, continued. Since the Accord, 3,800
 suspects have been released. Local human rights organizations
 estimate that about 170 suspects remain in custody at the
 Boosa detention camp, New Magazine prison, and other places
 around the country. The Sinhalese prisoners detained for
 activities in the south are not subject to release under the
 terms of the Accord. This has led some Sri Lankans to accuse
 the Government of discrimination against Sinhalese.
 Local observers reported that the IPKF had detained in its
 camps in the north and east an estimated 500 alleged Tamil
 militants, as well as Tamil journalists and businessmen
 accused of sympathizing with the separatists. Indian
 authorities had not said on what legal basis these suspects
 were held. In July a Sri Lankan lawyer brought a habeas
 corpus suit in the Court of Appeal on behalf of the family of
 a suspected Tamil militant held by the IPKF. The responsible
 Indian authority failed to respond to a court summons. Indian
 Government officials indicated that they had not denied Sri
 Lankan court authority in the case, but had simply chosen not
 to respond to the summons.
 Also of concern was the condition of remand prisoners, those
 charged with nonpolitical crimes and imprisoned pending
 trial. In 1988, according to the Commissioner of Prisons,
 nearly 7,000 such persons were incarcerated along with
 convicted offenders. Of these remand prisoners, presumed
 innocent under the law, 22 percent had been awaiting trial for
 more than 6 months, 12.4 percent for more than a year, and 1
 percent, or about 70 persons, had been charged and held
 without trial for 4 or more years.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1500
 SRI LANKA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of criminal acts are generally entitled to a
 fair public trial, are informed of the charges and the
 evidence against them, and are represented by counsel of their
 choice. Persons tried in the High Court and Court of Appeals
 criminal cases are provided an attorney at government expense
 if necessary, but the Government does not provide attorneys in
 other cases. Although public trial by jury is the custom,
 juries are not provided in trials under the PTA on -he grounds
 that jury members could be intimidated.
 Confessions given by the accused are admissible in PTA and ER
 cases but not in nonpolitical criminal and civil cases. Those
 convicted under the PTA or the ER have the same right to
 appeal convictions to the Appeals and Supreme Courts as those
 sentenced in other cases. Most people held under these acts
 are never formally charged and therefore do not enter the
 appeals process.
 In November the Government enacted legislation for the
 creation of a special tribunal for the expeditious trial of
 suspected subversives. The tribunal would sit without jury
 and admit in evidence confessions and other statements made to
 any person in whatever circumstances. It would act on the
 basis of written complaint from the Inspector General of
 Police or any Deputy Inspector General. By early December,
 this body had not yet been set up.
 In Jaffna Peninsula in the north and in parts of the east, the
 judicial system did not function during much of 1988 due to
 intimidation by Tamil militants. All the judges of the Sri
 Lankan Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal, and High Courts are
 appointed by the President. The Chief Justice and two Supreme
 Court judges comprise a Judicial Service Commission which
 appoints, transfers, and dismisses all lower court judges.
 The Government brought indictments against more than 75
 persons detained under the PTA and ER. It released about 490
 suspected Tamil militants and alleged Sinhalese subversives
 held under the PTA and ER and indicted prior to the Accord,
 indicating that it would not pursue charges against them.
 According to Sri Lankan human rights activists, approximately
 14 suspected Tamil militants have been convicted of crimes
 under the PTA and ER and were serving prison terms by the end
 of the year. An unknown number of alleged Sinhalese
 subversives were convicted. It is impossible to know how many
 of the 2,000 persons the Government admits are under detention
 might be accurately termed political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects individual privacy and the
 sanctity of the family and the home. The judiciary has a good
 record of upholding rights to privacy in those cases which
 reach the High Court. Ordinarily, search and arrest warrants
 are required in order to enter private premises. Under the
 PTA, police officers above a certain rank and less senior
 officers authorized by them in writing may enter and search
 any premises without a warrant and seize "any document or
 thing" when there is a presumption or evidence of support for,
 or involvement with, unlawful activity.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1501
 SRI LANKA
 IPKF soldiers operating in the north and east manned
 checkpoints, stopped vehicles, and searched homes and persons
 at the direction of officers without warrant or other legal
 sanction. At one point in mid-1988, the IPKF ordered Jaffna
 residents to post family photographs in their homes so that
 search parties could quickly identify nonfamily members taking
 refuge.
 Monitoring of telephones or correspondence is not known to be
 a common practice, although a few allegations of wiretapping
 have been made by local politicians.
 Section-2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedont of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for "freedom of speech and
 expression including publication," but also permits these
 rights to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the
 interests of national security." Opposition groups have
 charged that the ER have been used directly and indirectly to
 restrict free speech. For example, persons wishin to post
 bills advertising meetings of any type are required under the
 ER to get police approval of the text. In May 1987, the
 Supreme Court ruled that this clause gave the police too broad
 an authority, and that the police would have to specify a
 reason for denying a person permission to post bills.
 Individuals continued to be prosecuted for distribution of
 "antigovernment" literature. In September 1 987, Parliament
 amended the Parliamentary Powers and Privileqes Act of 1978,
 which permits Parliament to impose a fine on anyone who
 criticizes a Member of Parliament. Under the 1978 act, fines
 imposed unddr this law were limited to $160. Under the 1987
 amendment, Parliament was empowered to impose unlimited fines
 and imprison violators for up to Z years.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain
 and owns the radio and television services. A variety of
 independent newspapers and journals provide a full range of
 viewpoints on foreign policy and most domestic matters. Many
 small circulation periodicals published by opposition
 political parties operate freely. Several government-owned
 papers have either censored or refused to run advertisements
 by the Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka which asked the
 Government to permit the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) to carry out prisoner protection activities.
 There were no instances of formal censorship of the private
 press. Some Sri Lankans have claimed that, even without
 formal censorship, the Government achieves the same result
 through intimidation of the press. It placed a "competent
 authority" on the board of the independent Island newspaper in
 July in an effort to influence its editorial policy. By
 threatening to take over private media which do not operate in
 the public interest, these observers believe, the Government
 has prevented the media from accepting advertisements from
 certain organizations. The IRKF also reportedly exerted
 pressure on Jaffna-based Tamil newspapers to report IPKF
 activities in a favorable light.
 Radicals in the north, east, and south also practiced forms of
 indirect censorship through intimidation in 1988. On February
 29, members of the LTTE blew up the building and printing
 equipment of a Tamil-language newspaper in Jaffna because it
 
 
 1502
 SRI LANKA
 had taken an unsympathetic line in its editorials and
 reporting. In the south, the JVP targeted vendors and
 distributors of government-owned newspapers, killing several
 of them, in a sometimes successful effort to prevent the
 newspapers' circulation in some areas of the country.
 Academic freedom is generally respected. There were no
 complaints of abuses of academic freedom during the year, but
 academics are subject to the same restrictive legislation
 (including the prohibition on criticizing Members of
 Parliament) as other citizens.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, there are significant restrictions. Sri Lanka
 has numerous private associations, which are free to maintain
 ties with international bodies.
 Under the ER, the President (or his designee) is empowered to
 prohibit public meetings which would be "likely to cause a
 disturbance to public order and promote disaffection." In
 practice, the police issue or deny permits, at the discretion
 of the police superintendent in each area, for outdoor public
 meetings or processions. There was no evidence in 1988 that
 permits to hold public meetings were denied to the opposition.
 In September police in central Badulla town, unable to quell a
 violent student demonstration, fired into the crowd, killing
 one participant. Incidents of this nature continued through
 year's end, resulting in 25 deaths. In November the
 Government ordered its security forces to shoot illegal
 antigovernmenL demonstrators on sight.
 Radicals too played a role in abridging Sri Lankans' freedom
 of assembly. JVP members attacked UNP and other political
 party meetings, spreading fear and keeping many away. In an
 August incident, suspected JVP members fired onto the stage of
 a leftist United Socialist Alliance (USA) party meeting,
 killing 1 and wounding 27.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official religion
 and requires the Government "to protect and foster" Buddhism,
 but it also guarantees the rights of all others, including
 Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, to practice their religions
 freely. Earlier complaints that Buddhists had an advantage
 over members of other religions in winning senior government
 positions are heard less frequently. Members of all religious
 groups can be found in influential positions in the Government
 and in the full spectrum of political parties.
 Members of all religious groups are free to maintain active
 ties with coreligionists in other countries. Many Sri Lankans
 perform religious travel each year. Religious publishing is
 freely allowed, as is proselytizing. Foreign clergy also are
 permitted to work in Sri Lanka.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movemeht and
 of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka." Exit visas are not required, and the
 constitutional provisions are generally honored.
 Believing that Tamil militants were frequently crossing from
 southern India to northern Sri Lanka via the Palk Straits, the
 Government adopted a series of measures, beginning in 1984,
 which progressively restricted free movement in the north.
 The effect of the maritime surveillance and establishment of
 prohibited zones has been to restrict free movement
 considerably and to make it virtually impossible for the large
 number of fishermen resident in that area to fish. These
 restrictions were strengthened significantly by the IPKF in
 the north and east but were not enforced consistently during
 1988.
 Movement in the north as well as in the southern parts of the
 country was also restricted by curfews imposed by the
 Government and by strikes ordered by militants and enforced
 with threats of retribution. Eleven consecutive days of
 curfew were imposed on residents of Mullaittivu during IPKF
 military operations there in August. A few southern districts
 were under curfew for short periods in September and October
 following student demonstrations and terrorist incidents. The
 Government imposed curfew regularly throughout the island in
 the last months of the year to combat JVP attempts to disrupt
 presidential elections.
 Refugees or displaced persons from other countries are
 generally d~nied entry to Sri Lanka. The Government does not
 try to help refugees who attempt to stay in the country while
 seeking permanent residence elsewhere.
 There were approximately 96,000 displaced persons in Sri Lanka
 by the end of the year, according to the Government. All but
 about 24,000 were living with relatives or friends. Government
 sources estimate that some 134,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees
 left the island for southern India during the 4 years of
 fighting prior to the Accord. These sources also reported
 that 25,075 of these refugees had returned to Sri Lanka with
 the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 and the Governments of India and Sri Lanka as of mid-October.
 Another 12,000 refugees are known to have returned without
 assistance and some independent observers believe that this
 number may be much larger. Tamil Nadu state government
 officials indicated in June that fewer than 5,000 Sri Lankan
 Tamil refugees remained in camps in southern India. The
 remaining 94,000 persons are believed still in southern India,
 living and working in the local economy. In addition, as many
 as 60,000 Sri Lankan Tamils have sought refuge in Western
 Europe and North America.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka has a multiparty, parliamentary form of government
 with universal suffrage and generally high (around 80 percent)
 voter turnout. The extent to which citizens can exercise the
 right to change their government through free and fair
 elections has been called into question by the opposition
 
 
 1504
 SRI LANKA
 which protested the results of the 1982 referendum that
 extended the life of the Parliament by 6 years.
 Although members of each ethnic community can be found in
 virtually all of the political parties, the most influential
 political parties generally draw their support from one ethnic
 community. The UNP and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP),
 which draw their support mainly from the Sinhalese majority
 community, historically have alternated rule.
 Tamils have been represented primarily by two parties. The
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) claims to speak for the
 Ceylon Tamils, who for hundreds of years have been the
 majority population in the north and parts of the east. In
 1983 all 16 TULF Members of Parliament vacated their seats
 after refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the unity of
 Sri Lanka as required by a new constitutional amendment.
 Byelections to fill these vacant seats continued to be
 postponed due to the unsettled security situation, and Sri
 Lankans in those constituencies have been without
 parliamentary representation since 1983.
 Indian Tamils, who make up about one-third of the country's
 Tamil population, live primarily in the central hill country
 and have not been involved in the ethnic conflict. They are
 represented by the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), which is
 also a trade union.
 Most opposition parties function freely. Several operate
 their own newspapers, and the activities of their leaders are
 covered by the media. The JVP was granted legal status as a
 political party in May. This step did not affect either the
 JVP's violent opposition to the Government or the Government's
 policy of arresting JVP members and suppressing JVP
 activities. The civic rights of the leader of the main
 opposition SLFP, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were suspended
 from 1980 to 1986 on the grounds that she exceeded her
 authority during her tenure as Prime Minister in 1970-77.
 The last general election in 1977 brought the UNP Government
 to power with 51 percent of the popular vote but an
 overwhelming parliamentary majority. The UNP Government
 formulated a new Constitution, adopted by Parliament in 1978,
 which established the office of a directly elected executive
 President. In the Presidential election of October 1982,
 President Jayewardene was elected with 53 percent of the
 popular vote.
 Two months later, in place of the national parliamentary
 elections which had been scheduled, the Government held a
 referendum to extend the life of the 1977 parliament from 6 to
 12 years. Restrictions were imposed on the activities of
 opposition parties during the referendum campaign, and
 numerous voting irregularities were reported by the elections
 commissioner. The referendum was approved by 54.5 percent of
 the voters.
 In April and June, the Government conducted Provincial Council
 elections in the seven southern provinces in conformity with
 provisions of the Accord. The JVP, in an attempt to prevent
 these elections and frustrate implementation of the Accord,
 assassinated UNP and USA candidates and threatened voters.
 The SLFP did not contest the elections, stating that the
 electorate had never assented to the Accord and its
 provisions. These factors accounted for a below-average
 
 
 1505 .
 
 SRI LANKA
 turnout of about 50 percent of the electorate. In parts of
 the south, where JVP strength is greatest, as little as 8
 percent of the electorate turned out.
 The President temporarily merged the former Northern and
 Eastern Provinces by proclamation in September, again in
 conformity with the Accord. Elections for a Provincial
 Council were held in the Northeast on November 19. Because of
 threats of reprisals against participants in the election,
 this time by the LTTE, there was only a single slate of
 candidates, representing two anti-LTTE Tamil groups, in the
 north. In the east, several parties--representing Tamil,
 Sinhalese, and Muslim communities--contested and won seats.
 On December 19, Sri Lanka held the country's second
 presidential election. Acts of violence and intimidation of
 voters and poll workers by extremists bent on halting the
 election is generally conceded to have kept turnout to 55
 percent of the electorate--low for Sri Lanka, where voter
 participation usually runs in the 80 to 85 percent range.
 Prime Minister and UNP candidate Premadasa was declared winner
 with just over So percent of the vote. His main opponent,
 Mrs. Bandaranaike, polled about 45 percent. The day following
 the election, Mrs. Bandaranaike said she had evidence of
 voting fraud and unfair use of government resources and
 promised to challenge the results in the Supreme Court.
 Women vote in large numbers, but otherwise play a more limited
 role than men in the political process. There are currently
 six female Members of Parliament, including two female
 ministers of cabinet rank. Sri'lanka had the world's first
 female Prime Minister--the current SLFP leader, Mrs.
 Bandaranaike.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to adverse reports on its human
 rights situation. Senior government officials have made
 themselves available to visitors looking into human rights
 issues. An ICRC delegation visited Sri Lanka in May, meeting
 with midlevel officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
 National Security, and Teaching Hospitals to work out details
 of ICRC programs for teaching human rights to security
 personnel and setting up an artificial limbs program at
 Colombo Central Hospital. Neither program had begun by the
 end of the year.
 In its June 1988 report, covering 1987 and early 1988, AI
 noted instances in which the Government had not replied to its
 requests for information on human rights concerns and reported
 that various requests it had made to the Government to visit
 Sri Lanka to discuss its concerns had also received no
 response. In March the Government denied AI official
 permission to enter the country.
 In 1987 the ICRC renewed its.previous offer to the Government
 to provide relief assistance. At its meeting in February,
 1987, the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution
 calling upon Sri Lanka to invite ICRC participation in
 protecting and assisting victims of all affected parties.
 However, by the end of the year, no decision had been taken on
 the ICRC's request to visit detention camps. In August IPKF
 officials said they were unwilling to assume responsibility
 
 
 1506
 
 SRI LANKA
 for the security of ICRC relief workers in the north and east,
 effectively preventing ICRC programs there.
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Movement
 for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality. They collect
 information from families of victims or members of citizens'
 committees near the site of alleged incidents. Their periodic
 reports and appeals for change are generally not addressed by
 the Government. Some attorneys represent defendants without
 charging a fee in those human rights cases which reach the
 courts. A new human rights organization, the National Amity
 Movement, with membership drawn from the country's Sinhalese
 elite, was formed in 1988.
 The Government established a Commission for the Elimination of
 Discrimination and the Monitoring of Fundamental Rights in
 late 1986. Charged with investigating individual complaints
 on the basis of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political
 opinion, or place of birth, the Commission received over 1,757
 complaints during 1987, its first full year of operation. Of
 these, 281 were judged to have merit and were settled after an
 initial investigation, and 188 were found to have been
 unjustified. For the period January 1 to November 31, 1988,
 complaints received numbered 667, with 107 found to have merit
 and 197 determined to be unjustified. A majority of the cases
 charged discrimination in the workplace on the basis of a
 person's political affiliation. The Commission has also
 addressed questions of systematic discrimination, killings,
 and torture but has neither issued reports nor shown it can
 effectively deal with these issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Under the British colonial administration prior to 1948,
 Ceylon Tamils held a larger percentage of influential
 positions in government service, the police, the professions,
 and commerce than the percentage of Tamils overall in the
 population. With independence, Sinhalese political leaders
 sought to redress what they regarded as an imbalance in favor
 of Ceylon Tamils. Typical of their efforts was the
 "Sinhala-Only" Act of 1956 which made Sinhalese the sole
 official language of the country. For Tamils, the Act stood
 for government-sanctioned discrimination against them.
 In the Constitution of 1978, Tamil was designated a "national"
 language and its use in government, education, and the courts
 was specifically protected. Nevertheless, Tamils have charged
 that these legal protections are not enforced. Members of the
 Tamil community complain that they suffer from systematic
 discrimination in competition for university entrance,
 employment opportunities, and other matters under government
 control. Government officials have denied charges of
 discrimination against Tamils, pointing out that a number of
 prominent Tamils occupy senior-level civil service positions.
 Many of these Tamils are approaching retirement age, and there
 are fewer Tamils in the lower ranks of the civil service and
 military to take their places. Under the Constitution's 13th
 amendment implementing the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace
 Accord, Tamil as well as Sinhilese will become official
 languages, while English is to be a "link" language.
 Parliament passed enabling legislation giving force to these
 constitutional provisions in November.
 
 
 1507
 SRI LANKA
 One ethnic group which has suffered particular discrimination
 are Indian Tamils, descendents of Tamils brought from India in
 the 19th century to work on tea plantations. No longer
 qualifying for citizenship under Indian law, they were also
 denied Sri Lankan citizenship by laws adopted after
 independence. Since then, the Sri Lankan and Indian
 Governments have reached several agreements aimed at resolving
 the problem of these stateless Tamils. Under a 1986
 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to grant
 citizenship to all remaining stateless Tamils. The Government
 began processing these cases during the second half of 1987
 but, due to processing delays, some 230,000 Indian Tamils
 seeking Sri Lankan citizenship remained stateless. In
 November the Government eliminated processing delays by
 passing a- law making extension of citizenship to these
 stateless individuals automatic upon simple request. The new
 legislation did not cover the 94,000 stateless Tamils who
 themselves or whose parents once applied for Indian
 citizenship but who now wish to stay in Sri Lanka. These will
 be compelled to depart from Sri Lanka.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. However, various
 ethnic and religious groups have their own strictures which
 place limitations on women Some Tamil families believe their
 women members should not be seen working in public. Some
 Muslim women are discouraged by members of their community
 from seeking higher education or employment. Women do fill
 important posts in the civil service, the professions, and
 business, but the majority are found either in manual and
 semiskilled jobs or in the home. In 1985 women employed in
 nonagricultural work were paid on average 71 percent of the
 hourly wage received by men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and join trade unions. Any
 seven workers may form a union, draw up their own procedures,
 elect their own representatives, and formulate programs.
 Workers' rights, including the right to choose
 representatives, publicize views, and determine programs, are
 protected by law. Public service employees have no right to
 strike and are not provided arbitration machinery. Other
 workers are free to strike and have done so frequently.
 Unions may and do affiliate internationally. Sri Lanka is a
 member of the International Labor Organization (ILO). It
 sends a tripartite labor, government, and employer team to
 participate in ILO meetings.
 Under the Essential Services Act, the President may declare
 any business to be an essential service, making a strike
 illegal. President Jayewardene used this power extensively
 during the last months of the year to cbunter the violent
 efforts of the JVP to shut down essential services and
 overthrow the Government.
 Although there are a few independent unions, most large worker
 organizations are affiliated with political parties and play a
 significant role in the political process. Despite
 constraints arising from their political affiliations, Sri
 Lankan unions generally have been vigorous in advocating
 improved conditions for workers.
 
 
 1508
 SRI LANKA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are expressly granted the right to bargain
 collectively by formation of workers' councils to promote
 voluntary worker-employer dialogue. Department of Labor
 officers may arbitrate when workers and employers are not able
 to resolve a dispute. These officers are stationed throughout
 the country to assure that employers fulfill their legal and
 contractual obligations to workers and to be available for
 mediation in minor local disputes. About 1,000 labor unions
 and federations together represent about 1/3 of the 5.5
 million-strong labor force.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zones, are not represented by unions. Unionization
 in the zones is not prohibited by law but is, according to
 union leaders, discouraged in practice. However, zone
 employees participate in labor-management company
 associations. Workers in the unorganized agricultural sector
 are not covered by labor laws, although the Government may
 investigate individual complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Sri Lanka.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under Sri Lankan laws, employment of children under age 12 is
 prohibited. Those between ages 12 and 14 are called child
 workers and may not be employed in industry or dangerous
 occupations. Employment of young persons between 15 and 18 is
 subject to certain restrictions. Employees under age 18
 cannot be required to work outside specified hours.  In
 addition, employers are required to provide annual leave, rest
 periods, and meal breaks. In practice, however, there is a
 work force of children, probably numbering at least several
 thousand, who work illegally, mostly at jobs in rice
 cultivation, as domestics, or as street peddlers. Efforts to
 address this problem have been hampered by the fact that in
 some cases child workers are a major source of family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage, but wage boards for 37
 different trades set minimum wages and working conditions.
 Actual wages and working conditions generally exceed these
 minimums, which many union leaders consider insufficient for
 maintaining a decent standard of living. Most permanent
 full-time workers are covered by laws which provide that they
 shall work no more than 45 hours per week, no more than 9
 hours per day, and no more than 5 1/2 days per week, and that
 they will receive a 14-day paid annual holiday. Minimum
 conditions for the protection of the safety and health of
 workers are set forth in legislation passed by Parliament and
 implemented by the Department of Labor, which employs a staff
 of engineers and inspectors for this purpose. The Department
 also educates workers about minimum standards for different
 workplaces and encourages the use of safety equipment such as
 earplugs, but union leaders allege that government enforcement
 of health and safety standards is poor.
