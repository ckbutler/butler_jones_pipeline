 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives has a parliamentary form of
 government with a strong president. In practice, government
 authority in this small, homogeneous society rests largely in
 the hands of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and a handful of
 powerful cabinet ministers from several influential families.
 There are no political parties. Candidates for the unicameral
 legislature, the Majlis, run as individuals. The Majlis
 selects a single nominee for president who is subsequently
 approved or rejected by the voters. In 1988 President Gayoom
 was reelected to a third term. This followed his unanimous
 nomination by the Majlis and subsequent approval in a public
 referendum by more than 95 percent of those voting.
 Until 1988 Maldivians saw no need for a large security and
 defense establishment, as their remote island nation had not
 been attacked or invaded for hundreds of years. In November
 1988, however, a few Maldivians and foreign mercenaries
 attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the Government. After
 the attempt, the Government moved to strengthen its security
 forces. The National Security Service (NSS), previously
 numbering fewer than 1,000, is now a force of about 1,800.
 The NSS is responsible for maintaining internal law and order
 and defending the country. The police division of the NSS
 investigates crimes, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 The Maldives is comprised of 1,190 islands in 26 atolls
 scattered across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in
 the Indian Ocean. The isolation of individual islands from
 each other, and of the Republic from the rest of the world, is
 a dominant feature of social and economic life. Nearly half
 the work force engages in traditional activities such as
 fishing and small-scale agriculture. Industry accounts for
 only 13 percent of the gross national product. Tourism is the
 largest foreign exchange earner.
 Human rights continue to be sharply restricted in several
 areas, including speech and press, religion, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and women's and workers'
 rights. Some of these restrictions, on religion and women's
 rights for example, are linked with tradition and the
 observance of the Shari'a (Islamic law). The Majlis appeared
 to show greater assertiveness in 1990, holding an open and
 lively debate over proposed constitutional and legal reforms.
 This was overshadowed though by the Government's tough
 crackdown on the independent press and the arrest of several
 political activists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 
 
 1541
 MALDIVES
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Maldivians follow Islamic law. Occasionally convicted
 criminals are flogged. There were credible reports that
 several persons, including a journalist arrested on political
 charges, were beaten while in police custody in 1990.
 Usually, however, punishment is confined to fines,
 compensatory payment, house arrest, imprisonment, or
 banishment to a remote and sparsely populated island.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that "no person shall be apprehended,
 except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civill law."
 There is no provision under Maldivian law for preventive
 detention. Incommunicado detention is rare.
 Police undertake investigations either on suspicion of
 criminal activity or in response to a formal written complaint
 alleging commission of a crime. Depending on the results of
 the police investigation, the Attorney General may refer the
 case to the appropriate court. Complainants may also petition
 the court's intervention. A suspect may, depending on the
 charges, be detained or placed under house arrest for 15 days
 while the case is being investigate-. In some cases,
 especially political ones, suspects have been detained without
 charge. In cases not brought to. trial within 1-5 days, the
 suspect is to be freed. Detention or house arrest may be
 extended after the- first 15 days by authority of the-
 President, though usually for les& than a month. There is no
 legal provision for bailr however, a defendant in detention
 who has valid reasons to travel may receive permission to do
 so from the Prisons- Division.
 A provision of the penal code makes actions that "arouse the
 people against the government" illegal. Ir November the
 Majlis passed an& the President signed into law legislation.
 amending this section of the penal code to define more
 precisely what constitutes antigovernment activity. At year's
 end, it was not yet clear what effect this change would have
 on the Government's broad authority to arrest political
 dissidents.
 Also in November,,the Government detained a dozen or more
 journalists and political opponents-shortly before the opening
 of the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
 Cooperation (SAARCY held in Male- the capital. Charges
 against the detainees were not made public. It was widely
 believed that they, were taken into custody- to prevent contact
 with foreign :journalists and other delegates attending the
 meeting. They were- still in custody as of early December.
 There were no cases of foreign exile in 1990. The practice of
 banishment to remote islands is a form of internal exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in Male. Each
 deals with specialized cases, such as debt, theft, or property
 claims. On other islands, there are all-purpose courts.
 There are no jury trials. Trials are open to the public and
 are'conducted by judges trained in Islamic law. All judges
 are appointed by the President and serve at his pleasure; thus
 they cannot be considered fully independent. Cases in island
 
 
 1542
 
 MALDIVES
 courts that present complex legal questions are referred to
 the appropriate specialized court at Male. The Male court can
 in turn refer the legal issue to four judges attached to the
 Justice Ministry. The High Court acts as a court of appeal
 and handles politically sensitive cases.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He aIso may be assisted by a lawyer. However.
 there are few lawyers in the Maldives, and. courts do not
 provide them to defendants. Generally, the length and type of
 sentence are established by law and custom.
 In May President Gayoom abolished the Police Court, which
 operated outside of the regular judicial system under the
 authority of the Ministry of Defense and National Security and
 had been the focus of many complaints of abuse of legal rights.
 A member of the Majlis, known as an outspoken critic of the
 Government, was arrested in September on charges that were not
 made public. It i& widely believed that his arrest was in
 connection with his opposition to the Government. He was
 still being held under house arrest, pending trial, at year's
 end.
 In early 1990, seven Maldivians were convicted of offenses
 related to alleged antigovernment activity, including the
 circulation of fliers advocating the overthrow of the
 Government. Some Maldivians believe that the charges against
 the seven were trumped up and that they are being punished for
 their political activism.- The seven were banished to remote
 islands to serve sentences of 4 to 6 years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits opening, intercepting, reading, or
 making public letters, telephone conversations, telegrams, and
 wireless messages exchanged between persons "except in
 accordance with the specific provisions of the law," There is
 no evidence that the Government monitors correspondence or
 telephone conversations or uses a regular system of
 informers. In August a cassette tape of a private telephone
 conversation between two officials accused in an alleged
 corruption scandal was distributed in Male; most indications
 point to the call having been intercepted, taped, and
 distributed by private citizens. The Constitution requires
 that private premises and dwellings be respected. There have
 been no reports of practices to the contrary.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." In practice, freedom of speech and press is
 sharply restricted. Under Maldivian law and custom, a citizen
 may criticize or. complain to the Government without fear if he
 does so through recognized channels. These include letters or
 oral complaints to the President, a Majlis member, a civil
 servant, or other person in authority. However, the law that
 forbids arousing opposition to the Government, together with a
 tradition of authoritarian rule, make Maldivians careful when
 expressing their opinions to foreigners or in the media.

 MALDIVES
 At least four privately owned newspapers were published in
 1990, two reportedly owned by government ministers. The other
 two, Sangu and Hukuru, discontinued publication at midyear
 under government pressure following several months during
 which they published articles sharply critical of the
 Government and key government officials. In May the
 Government revoked the official registration of Sangu for
 inciting antigQvernment activity, including-strikes. At about
 the same time, two journalists affiliated with Sangu were
 arrested and detained for several days-one apparently for
 writing an article-in a Sri-Lankan newspaper which alleged-
 vote-rigging and. other malpractices by government officials
 and the'other apparently for drawing a cartoon which parodied
 high-ranking- government officials. As of year's end, the
 Government's cases against the two were still pending.
 Hukuru ceased publication in August after its editor was
 arrested on charges that were not made- public but are believed
 related to the newspaper's sometimes sharp criticism of
 certain government officials. The editor was still in custody
 as of the end of the year. In addition, journalists writing
 for Sangu and Hukuru claimed to have been the target of death
 threats and harassment by goveriment supporters. Several
 journalists associated with the two newspapers were taken into
 custody shortly before the SAARC summit in November,
 apparently to prevent them from talking to foreign journalists
 attending the event.
 The Government publishes two news bulletins and also awns and
 operates the only television and radio station. There is no
 prior censorship of newspapers. However, because writers and
 editors are subject to prosecution if their articles
 contravene the law, very broadly construed, self-censorship is
 well ingrained.
 There are no prohibitions on the import of foreign
 publications, except those containing pornographic material.'
 However, in 1990 the Government impounded a shipment of
 newspapers printed in Sri Lanka and aimed at Maldivian
 readers; apparently because the publication contained'material
 critical of government officials. The 4aldivian. publisher was
 also detained. He was believed still to be in-custody, as of
 the end of the year. Foreign broadcasts are not jammed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly an? association,
 However. Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. Most rallies and meetings are sponsored or
 approved by the Government and are- usually addressed by
 government officials or religious leaders. The.only exception
 known-to'have occurred in 1990 was an abortive demonstration'
 that was to have been held on June 1 to protest the alleged
 involvement of government officials in a corruption scandal.
 The demonstration, announced in unsigned fliers, did not take
 place, though hundreds of Maldivians milled around in the
 streets at the appointed hour amid heavy security.
 Clubs and other private associations are permitted if they do
 not contravene Shari'a and civil law. They must be registered
 with the- Government.

 MALDIVES
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The
 Constitution affirms Islam as the official religion and
 defines all citizens as Muslims. There are no places of
 worship for the practice of any other religion. Missionaries
 of non-Muslim faiths may enter the Maldives but are forbidden
 to proselytize. Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a
 violation of Shari'a law and could result in loss of
 citizenship for the Maldivian convert, though-it is not known
 if this section of the law has ever been applied.' Those
 Maldivians who have converted to another faith, usually after
 having, lived abroad, do not advertise their conversion when in
 the Maldives.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The-Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most migrants move to Male, which
 is severely overcrowded. Government regulations limit
 migration to the capital island and its-surrounding atoll,
 permitting it for short periods only for work, education, or
 medical treatment.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 The Government does not require exit visas. It requires a
 Maldivian who has acquired another nationality to maintain
 Maldivian nationality concurrently. Such a dual national must
 enter and leave the N aldives on a Maldivian passport. The
 Government is not known to have revoked the citizenship of any
 Maldivian. There are no refugees or displaced persons in the
 Maldives. As far as is known, no Maldivians have been exiled
 abroad or are refugees or displaced persons elsewhere,
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Maldivians have only limited and indirect influence on the
 selection and organization of their government. The. President
 and several key members of the Cabinet wield the overwhelming
 preponderance of power. A single nominee for president, whor,
 under the. Constitution, must be male and a Sunni Muslim, is
 chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as many candidates
 as are proposed by members. His nomination is confirmed or
 rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot.
 President Gayoom was elected for a third- 5-year term by this
 process in 1988, receiving 95 percent of the vote.
 Members of the Majlis, a unicameral legislature, are chosen
 for 5-year terms by secret ballot. All Maldivians over 21
 years of age may vote. Of 48 members, 4U are elected--2 from
 each of the L9 inhabite: atolls and 2 from Male-and the
 President appoints S. Individuals or groups may freely
 approach members of the Majlis with grievances or opinions on
 proposed legislation. The most recent Majlis election was
 held in November 1989.
 While they are not forbidden by law, there are no political
 parties. President Gayoom has publicly discouraged their
 formation, declaring political parties inappropriate to the
 homogeneous nature of Maldivian society. In place of
 political parties, factions in the Majlis tend to form around
 individuals or points of view. Any member may introduce
 legislation. If seconded, it must be considered by the
 
 
 1545
 MALDIVES
 Majlis. The Majlis may question ministers and call for their
 removal. In practice, the Majlis generally supports the
 Government; however, in 1990 the Majlis demonstrated greater
 assertiveness than in the past, for example, by introducing
 and debating significant new legal reforms. The Majlis passed
 legislation defining more restrictively the circumstances
 under which persons may be arrested for "antigovernment
 activity". Legislation broadening the legal rights of
 detainees was still being debated at year's end.
 Women are not excluded by law from any governmental post
 except president, but, for reasons of tradition and culture,
 few women seek or are selected for public office. In 1990 2
 women served in the 48-member Majlis. There were no female
 members of the Cabinet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, there were no public requests for outside
 investigation of human rights violations in 1990. In 1989
 President Gayoom responded to an appeal from Amnesty
 International (AI) on behalf of 16 people sentenced to death
 after their conviction of involvement in the November 1988
 coup attempt, informing AI that he had commuted their
 sentences to life imprisonment.
 An association calling itself the Law Society of the Maldives,
 with the professed aim of protecting the legal and
 constitutional rights of Maldivians, was registered with the
 Government in mid-19g0, but it took no discernible actions
 toward that end during the year.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women by tradition play a subordinate role in Maldivian
 society, although they now participate in public life in
 growing numbers. Islamic practice is the basis for Maldivian
 civil law. It is therefore easier for husbands to divorce
 wives than vice versa. Islamic law also governs inheritance.
 Most women, like most men, are not part of the cash economy.
 Women who do work for wages--for the Government, in business,
 or in garment factories-generally receive wages similar to
 those of men in the same positions. Approximately 9 percent
 of uniformed NSS personnel are now female.
 Violence against women occurs in the Maldives, but little is
 known about its extent. Abuse within the family, such as wife
 beating, is seldom mentioned publicly owing to the value
 attached to personal privacy in this conservative society, and
 the Government does not acknowledge the existence of a
 problem. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives. While unions are
 not expressly prohibited, the Government recognizes neither
 the right to form them nor the right to strike, and strikes do
 not occur. Professional associations are permitted under the
 law. The Maldives is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization.
 
 
 1546
 MALDIVES
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively are
 neither recognized nor protected by law. There are no export
 processing zones in the Maldives, though the Government has
 granted certain tax concessions to investors who opened
 garment factories. As far as is known, the customary
 procedures governing conditions of labor are the same for
 garment factories as for other sectors of the economy. Wages
 are set by contract between employer and individual employees.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although no information is available on Maldivian law
 regarding forced or compulsory labor, there have been no
 reported instances of such labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no compulsory education law or minimum age for the
 employment of young people. With the exception of a law
 prohibiting government employment of children under the age of
 15, there are no regulations governing conditions under which
 children or young people may be employed. However, most
 employers do not hire young people for work at night or in
 what are considered hazardous conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Most working Maldivians are either self-employed or work for
 the Government, although a few large private sector employers,
 including three garment factories, have set up operations in
 the last 10 years. Agreements between the Government and
 foreign investors setting up these operations contained no
 provisions for workers' rights, including conditions of work.
 There are no statutory provisions for hours of work and length
 of annual leave. An 8-hour day, 6-day workweek is customary,
 though not enforced by law.
 There is no national minimum wage, although the Government has
 established wage floors for certain kinds of work. Overtime
 pay for those who work more than an 8-hour day is customary,
 though not required. Government workers receive 3 weeks'
 leave per year. There are no laws governing health and safety
 conditions.
