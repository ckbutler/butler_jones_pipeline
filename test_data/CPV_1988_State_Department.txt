 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence
 of Cape Verde (PAICV), the country's sole political party,
 under the leadership of President Aristides Pereira. Most
 government ministers are also senior members of the party, and
 many of them were leaders of the revolutionary movement to
 free Cape Verde from Portuguese rule. The PAICV is officially
 open to anyone wishing to join, but only about 4 percent of
 the voting population are members. The Constitution adopted
 in 1980 declares the party "the supreme expression of the
 interests of the popular masses." Members of the Popular
 National Assembly, which is formally the supreme organ of the
 State, are elected from a slate of candidates which is
 proposed to the electorate by the party. The Assembly selects
 the President, who, as Head of State, proposes the Prime
 Minister to the Assembly. The Assembly ratifies most party
 and government decisions, but it also serves as a forum for
 increasingly open debate.
 Security responsibilities, formerly divided between the
 military, the security, and police forces, were combined into
 a single government department in 1986. The reorganized
 Ministry of Defense and Security operates under guidelines and
 leadership approved by the party.
 Cape Verde has few natural resources, and for years Cape
 Verdeans have emigrated to improve their economic condition
 (over 500,000 live abroad). Cape Verde's development efforts
 for its population of 360,000 have been hindered by a 20-year
 drought which has severely affected employment for the rural
 population and seriously diminished water supplies. The
 Government has relied on foreign assistance and remittances
 from Cape Verdean emigrants to help feed its population.
 Heavy summer rains in 1987 and 1988 may have signaled the end
 of the drought and hold the promise of improvements in the
 agricultural sector. The Government is the largest
 nonagricultural employer. It controls banking, the
 importation of most basic commodities, airlines, the press,
 and schools. Private property rights are respected. There is
 a small but growing private sector which includes shops,
 hotels, farms, fishing, small industries (such as tuna
 canning), and the professions.
 Political rights are limited in the Constitution, and, in
 practice, the Government uses its authority, e.g., detention
 powers, to restrict the expression of opposing views. Outside
 the political sphere, human rights are generally respected in
 Cape Verde. Three policemen responsible for the 1987 death in
 custody of an arson suspect were convicted of murder and were
 given sentences of 8 to 15 years in prison.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of politically motivated
 deaths.

 CAPE VERDE
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of officially inspired
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In November 1987 a young man was beaten to death while in
 detention in a local jail on Brava Island. The government
 press made a full report of the incident. The responsible
 policeman and his superior officers were arrested and found
 guilty of murder by a special court during 1988. The police
 sergeant who had killed the victim while trying to coerce a
 confession was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Two other
 policemen responsible for leaving the sergeant alone in charge
 of the station received 8-year sentences. There was no new
 evidence of torture or other cruel and unusual punishment of
 prisoners and detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cape Verdean law requires that an accused person, unless
 caught in the act of committing a crime, be brought before a
 judge and charged within 48 hours of arrest. Additionally, a
 person may not be arrested without court order unless caught
 in the act of committing a felony. In exceptional cases, with
 the concurrence of a court official, the formal charge process
 may be delayed up to 5 days after arrest. For crimes against
 state security, however, persons may be detained for up to 5
 months without trial upon a judge's ruling. There is a
 functioning system of bail, and everyone is entitled to
 representation by an attorney in civil or criminal cases.
 Those unable to afford legal counsel are represented by
 lawyers named by the state-run Lawyers' Association.
 There were no known instances of forced exile for political or
 other reasons. With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see
 Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is composed of a Supreme Court, whose
 members are appointed by the President, regional courts, and
 local popular courts. Trials are conducted by one judge
 without a jury. The Autonomous Institute for Judiciary
 Support [AIJS], to which all private lawyers belong, provides
 counsel for needy defendants. Trials appear to be handled
 expeditiously, and most evidence suggests that the courts
 protect individual rights in criminal cases. Verdicts can be
 appealed.
 Popular tribunals adjudicate minor disputes on a local level
 in rural areas. The "judges," appointees of the Ministry of
 Justice, are usually prominent local citizens without legal
 training. Their decisions can be appealed within the regular
 court system.
 There were no known political prisoners at the end of 1988.
 Persons are occasionally convicted of misdemeanors such as
 disturbing the peace or demonstrating without permission when
 they express views different from the Government.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other means of
 communication. The law requires judicial warrants before
 searches of homes may be conducted. One outspoken critic of
 the party claimed in 1988 that he was subjected to constant
 police surveillance and harassed by threatening phone calls
 and letters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship, but it also
 stipulates that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exercised "contrary to national unity." While freedom of the
 press is not a specific constitutional guarantee, a law
 adopted in December 1985 assures citizens the right to express
 opinions in the press. At the same time, however, the party
 emphasized that this right should be exercised responsibly.
 The primary weekly newspaper, radio, and television media are
 government owned and follow government policies. Occasional
 stories critical of some aspects of policy are printed or
 broadcast, probably with prior authorization from the
 Government. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western
 agencies as well as from Communist countries, generally
 balancing coverage and identifying sources on controversial
 international issues.
 The Government tolerates antigovernment flyers which circulate
 from time to time. It also tolerates the Catholic Church's
 monthly newspaper Terra Nova, which sometimes criticizes
 aspects of life in Cape Verde, as long as its articles are not
 viewed as a threat to the Government. Terra Nova is
 considered by many people to be more reliable than the
 government-run Voz Di Povo and enjoys a wide following. On
 occasion, the editor and contributors have been summoned
 before party tribunals to explain their articles. In November
 1988, the court convicted the paper's editor, Father Antonio
 Fidalgo Barros, of abusing the power of the press for
 publishing a letter alleging financial improprieties by Cape
 Verdean diplomats abroad. Fidalgo was given a suspended
 sentence of 3 months in prison, fined the equivalent of $200,
 and put on 2 years' probation. Cape Verdean courts have
 delayed trial proceedings in the case of Jose Teofilo Santos
 Silva, who was charged with "defamation of the image of the
 state security agency" for his article in Terra Nova which
 alleged Government torture of political dissidents. Santos
 claims to have based his article on Amnesty International
 reports of 1983 and 1984.
 In November 1987, Joao Alfredo Fortes Dias was sentenced to 9
 months' imprisonment and fined for painting political slogans
 on walls in Mindelo. He was released on bail and appealed his
 case to the Supreme Court. His sentence was-subsequently
 upheld by the Supreme Court, and he was required to serve his
 prison term.
 Foreign periodicals generally circulate freely in Cape Verde
 even when they contain articles critical of or unflattering to
 the Government, as is sometimes the case with Portuguese
 
 
 54
 CAPE VERDE
 newspapers. International radio broadcasts are received
 clearly without interference. Almost all movies shown are
 apolitical in content, and some are occasionally censored on
 moral grounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate
 is provided for in the Constitution. As a practical matter,
 however, no organizations opposed to the Government or its
 policies are permitted. Private associations other than
 sports clubs or religious youth groups do not exist. The
 establishment of such associations is subject to government
 authorization, and a law is currently under consideration to
 authorize and regulate professional groups and independent
 organizations. Party-sponsored "popular organizations" of
 women and youth are prominent.
 The Constitution provides that every citizen has the right and
 the duty to participate in the political, economic, and
 cultural life of the country. This provision theoretically
 could be used to force a person's participation in activities
 against his or her will. In practice, there is no evidence to
 suggest thaE this provision has been so used.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship is respected by the Government, and members
 of all faiths practice their religion without harassment. At
 least two-thirds of the population, including most of the
 Government leadership, are nominally Catholic, but the
 dominance of Catholicism does not adversely affect other
 faiths. Evangelical Protestant and Seventh-Day Adventist are
 two major religious communities. The Baha'i and Jehovah's
 Witnesses have smaller congregations.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and "Christian Rationalism,"
 that were formally banned or suppressed under the Portuguese,
 have been permitted to reestablish themselves and operate
 freely since independence. There are no restrictions on
 religious practices, teaching, or contacts with coreligionists
 outside Cape Verde. The Catholic Church, for example, openly
 opposes birth control methods which are advocated and
 supported by the Government. A few foreign missionaries are
 active in Cape Verde, and more than half the Catholic clergy
 are non-Cape Verdean.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative
 restrictions on travel or residence within the country. All
 resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either
 temporarily or permanently, must obtain exit permission from
 the Government. Such permission has not been denied for
 political reasons. Emigration has long been an important and
 recognized escape valve from prevailing harsh economic
 conditions. The Government maintains close contact with
 emigrant communities and provides every opportunity for Cape
 Verdeans living abroad to maintain their ties with the
 homeland, including allowing them to vote in elections. A
 formal government organization exists to safeguard emigrant
 rights in foreign countries and assist immigrants with legal
 matters in Cape Verde. Repatriation is a constitutional
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 right, and the Government does not discourage intending
 repatriates. Indeed, two new bills designed to further
 facilitate repatriation are currently under debate in the
 National Assembly.
 Citizenship may be revoked on several grounds, including for
 activities contrary to the interest of the country. However,
 there are no known cases of the Government instituting
 proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship for political
 reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for- Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The party's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is enshrined in
 the Constitution. Opposition parties are illegal and do not
 exist. Therefore, citizens are unable to change the one-party
 political system through a multiparty political process. The
 small group of men who actually led the struggle for
 independence occupy positions of leadership in both the party
 and the Government. The Secretary General of the party is
 President of the Republic, the Deputy Secretary General is
 Prime Minister, and the third-ranking party official is
 President of the National Assembly. Five other members of the
 party's political commission are also Ministers. Not all
 ministers or secretaries of state are party members, but all
 clearly serve at the pleasure of the party. Current party
 membership is about 6,000--4 percent of the total adult
 population--which represents a doubling in size since
 independence in 1975. Within this essentially elitist party,
 there exists a modest opportunity for meaningful political
 activity. For example, the delegates to the Second Party
 Congress in 1983, and the leadership itself, were elected by
 secret ballot with some unexpected changes in the order of
 precedence for various ministers. The party leadership also
 made an effort to give women more prominent roles. However,
 women, who comprise 14 percent of the total party membership,
 remain underrepresented. The party membership is young (47
 percent under 30 years of age), disproportionately urban (50
 percent in a nation which is two-thirds rural), and heavily
 representative of the bureaucracy (25 percent of party members
 are civil servants or employees of state enterprises).
 National Assembly elections were last held in December 1985.
 A single slate of candidates, all of whom were either party
 members or nominees with party approval, was presented to
 voters. The final list of candidates was selected after three
 stages of local consultations, during which as many as four
 candidates--not necessarily party members--were considered for
 each seat. As a result of this winnowing process, several
 prominent nonparty candidates won party approval and election
 to the Assembly. Twice-yearly Assembly sessions serve to
 ratify earlier party and government decisions, but issues are
 debated openly with critical interventions reported in the
 media, and voting in such cases is usually not unanimous.
 Motions introduced by the Government are not always adopted.
 Deputies criticize government policies and decisions, but
 policy decisions already made by the Council of Ministers are
 not reversed by the Assembly.

 CAPE VERDE
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government in the past has permitted visits by private
 organizations to investigate conditions of persons convicted
 for political or related offenses. In 1987 and 1988, the
 Government did not officially respond to inquiries from
 Amnesty International about Joao Alfredo Fortes Dias and two
 others convicted for painting political slogans on walls.
 There are no known instances in which the Government has been
 the subject of investigations by official international
 organizations. There are no known official or nongovernmental
 human rights organizations in the country, although the
 Lawyers.' Association for the Provision of Judicial Support
 performs some of the functions of such an organization. The
 Catholic Church's monthly magazine published a series of
 articles on human rights abuses in 1987. The abuses
 specifically cited include the Dias and Santos cases, plus
 allegations of police brutality dating back more than 5 years.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Racial discrimination is not a significant problem in Cape
 Verde, where the vast majority of the population shares
 various proportions of Portuguese and African ancestry. Sex
 discrimination exists, although it is prohibited by the
 Constitution. Many traditional male-oriented values of the
 Portuguese and African ancestors of today's Cape Verdeans are
 still part of the country's culture. The code of the family,
 enacted in October 1981, prescribes the full equality of men
 and women, including equal pay for equal work, but in
 practice, wcmen have been customarily excluded from certain
 types of employment and are often paid less than men.
 Additionally, police and courts are often reluctant to assist
 in cases involving rape or wife beating, which are not
 uncommon in Cape Verde. Both the Government and the party are
 making efforts to bring women into economic and social
 activities where they have been traditionally absent. The
 Government has included women in the labor-intensive economic
 development projects financed by foreign grants. The
 Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with
 party encouragement, to sensitize the Government and Cape
 Verdeans in general to issues affecting women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers can associate in unions, but all unions must affiliate
 with the Workers' Union of Cape Verde (UNTC/CS). It is
 affiliated with the PAICV and headed by a high-ranking party
 member. About one-third of the active work force are nominal
 union members. Individual unions perform some traditional
 trade union functions and also act as party affiliates. There
 is no reference to the right to strike in the Constitution or
 in any legislation. In the absence of any legal prohibition
 against strikes, the UNTC/CS believes that the right to strike
 exists, but it has never been exercised. Workers sometimes
 take positions on specific issues in opposition to government
 policies in state enterprises. For example, there was a 3-day
 work stoppage by nonunion casual labor in September 1988 over
 the piecework rate for cement cargo being unloaded by the
 State Import Agency. The UNTC/CS participates in the
 
 
 CAPE VERDE
 International Labor Organization and is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, but has not taken
 positions independent of those officially sanctioned by the
 Government. It maintains contact with and receives assistance
 from both Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are by law the designated means by which yorkers are
 represented. The right for unions to function without
 hindrance is mandated. However, there is no true collective
 bargaining. As the largest employers, the Government and
 party are largely responsible for setting wages and other
 benefits, although the UNTC/CS and the unions have influence
 in the process.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, and children under 16
 are prohibited from working at night, more than 7 hours per
 day, or in establishments where toxic products are used. All
 enterprises submit a yearly report to the Director General of
 Labor with information on salary and ages of each employee.
 This provides the Government with a vehicle for controlling
 employment practices. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and
 Social Affairs is charged with monitoring and inspecting work
 conditions in major industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government for both civil
 servants and private enterprises. As of January 1, 1987, the
 minimum wage for civil servants was approximately $84 per
 month. Wages for unskilled workers are considerably lower,
 and in rural areas the daily, minimum for the least skilled
 types of labor is about $1.62 per day. The minimum wage is
 barely adequate for a decent standard of living, and workers
 must often supplement their income through second jobs, extra
 farming, or family assistance from overseas immigrants.
 According to an unofficial survey, the current average monthly
 wage for white collar workers is $170 per month while an
 unskilled rural worker earns $50 per month. An urban family
 with combined income over $300 per month can afford to rent an
 apartment with water and electricity and be wellfed and
 wellclothed. In contrast, most rural homes have neither water
 nor electricity but there are no reports of any widespread
 malnutrition. The workweek for adults is 44 hours over 5 1/2
 days. A worker is entitled to at least 1 free day per week.
 These regulations seem to be respected in practice.
