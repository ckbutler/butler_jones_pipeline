 KENYA
 President Daniel Arap Moi was reelected in. 1997 in Kenya's second general elec-
 tion since the restoration of multiparty politics in ,1991. President Moi's Kenya Afri-
 can National Union (KANU) again won a majority in. the 1997 parliamentary elec-
 tions, and has a slim majority of 113 of 222 seats in the unicameral National As-
 sembly. While observers considered- the 1997 elections imperfect, they concluded
 that the vote broadly reflected the popular will. In addition to his role as President,
 Moi also commands the military services and controls the security, university, civil
 service, judiciary, and provincial, district, and local governance systems. The judici-
 ary is subject to executive branch influence.
 The large internal security apparatus includes the police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), the Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI), the National
 Police, the Administration Police;-and the paramilitary General Services Unit. The
 CID and the DSI investigate criminal activity and monitor persons whom the State
 considers subversive. Members of the security forces continued to commit -serious
 human rights abuses.
 ,The economy includes a well-developed private sector in trade, light manufactur-
 ing, and -finance. The large agricultural sector provides food for local consumption,
 substantial exports of coffee, tea, cut flowers, and vegetables, and a pproximately 70
 percent of total employment Tourism remained the largest single foreign exchange
 earner, despite a major setback caused by ethnic violence along the coast in August
 and September 1997. Drought, followed by  floods, kept upward pressure on food
 pries. Aknnual per-capital gross domestic.product is $270 (16,200 shillings).
 The Government's overall human Tights rcord4 ,enerally was poor, although there
 was-some imprvement in a few areas,'serious,.problems remain. Police committed
 an-increased number-of etajudicial kilings-tand continued to torture and beat de-
 * tainees, use excessive force, rape, and otherwise abuse personsPrison conditions re-
 mained life threatening.- Police arbitrarily .arrested and detained-citizens, though
 they did so less frequently for political-easons. The Government arrested and pros-
 ecuted a number of.police-officers for abuses; however, most police who perpetrated
 abuses were-neither investigated nor punished. Lengthy pretrial detention is a prob-
 lem, and the judiciary is subject to executive branch- influence. The authorities in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government limited freedom of speech and
 of the press, and carried on a -campaign. of harassment against -the tabloid press,
 which is often critical of the Government. Police at times harassed, beat, and ar-
 rested journalists. The Government at times restricted freedom of assembly, and po-
 lice used force to disperse-demonstrators and- protestors. The-Government restricted
 freedom of association. Police disrupted fewer public-meetings- than in previous
 -years, .and -security force harassment of dissidents diminished. The-1997 general
 election- represented o step forward in citizens' ability -to change their-government
 peacefully, although their ability- to do.so- has not yet. been fully-demonstrated at
 .the presidential level. The Government deregistered severaLnongovernmental orga-
 nizations (NGO's). The Government's Standing Committee-on-Human-Rights, which
 got off to a slow start after its 1996 establishment, issued its first public report in
 December..Discrimination and .violence against women and abuse of children re-
 -mained serious problems. Female genital mutilation is widespread, and child pros-
 titution is a major problem. Muslims complain of government discrimination, and
 societal; discrimination against-certain ethnic groups is a problem. Animosity contin-
 ued against and among various ethnic groups, with a major outbreak of ethnic vio-
 lence in'Rift Valley causing more than 100 deaths. The Government limits some
 
 
 worker rights. Child labor is a problem, and there were instances of forced child
 labor. Mob violence also resulted in many deaths.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces continued to use le-
 thal force and committed a number of extrajudicial killings. According to govern-
 ment figures, police killed 69 suspected criminals during the year. However, the
 nongovernmental Kenyan Human Rights Commission (KHRC) reported that police
 killed 164 persons from January through September (compared to 123 persons dur-
 ing the same period in 1997), including at least 10 by torture. Human rights groups
 regularly criticize police lack of restraint in employing lethal force, as well as the
 Government's failure to take appropriate action against policemen accused of
 extrajudicial killings.
 Mast police killings occurred during the pursuit of criminal suspects; however, a
 number involved innocent bystanders. Family members of Joseph Ole Pirei, who
 was killed by police in Kitengela, insist that he was not a suspected carjacker, as
 claimed by the police, but was waiting by the roadside for a "matatu" (private bus)
 to take him to work. William Kiarie Ndonga was shot and killed by the Thika  lice
 in July for no apparent reason. In the same month, Nairobi police shot and Uilled
 James Ocholla Odhiambo in a case of mistaken identity. Two police officers were
 arrested and charged in Odhiambo's death.
 There are indications that some of the persons who died in police custody were
 victims of torture (see Section 1.c.). Vincent Nyumba Kiema was beaten by Kitui po-
 lice constable Charles Kiema in April and later died in the hospital from injuries
 suffered during the beating. According to the KHRC, Sheikh Mohammed Yahyah
 died in Bangale following torture in the course of a security operation by the army.
 In February Alfred Kang'ethe died after beatings by Uthiru police. In March Moses
 Muthoka Mukele died in police custody in Kitui after apparently being beaten. The
 same month, Ali Hussein Ali died in police custody in Garissa from severe trauma
 caused by heavy blows, according to the medical report. The Government denied po-
 ice had anything to do with these cases except that of Ali Hussein Ali, for which
 three policemen were arrested and charged, and Kang'ethe, for which hearings were
 scheduled to begin in late January 1999.
 Hundreds of prisoners died in custody due to life-threatening prison conditions,
 including inadequate food and medical treatment (see Section 1.c.).
 Police investigated some extrajudicial killings by security forces, and several po-
 lice officers faced prosecution. According to the Government, 15 police officers were
 charged with brutality, excessive force, and unlawful killing. The authorities
 charged Bungoma policeman Elly Owino with the murder of Eric Onyango Juma,
 and a Dagoretti policeman with the shooting murder of Nicholas Cheserek. Police
 launched an investigation into the police shooting death of Simon Githinji Kigera,
 also a policeman, in Nairobi, but there had been no reported progress in the inves-
 tigation at year's end. A police investigation into the shooting death of former Rwan-
 dan Minister Seth Sendashonga was ongoing at year's end. In separate cases, Kitui
 authorities charged Assistant Chief Simeon Mwandingga with inciting the mob kill-
 ing of Kamwila Kamungu, and another Assistant Chief, Josephine Matalu, with in-
 stigating the beating death of Kiema Mwisuve. (Chiefs are appointed by the Govern-
 ment and have limited police powers.) Police opened an investigation into the June
 shooting death of Pastor Simeon Kiti Mwangome (or Mwangalee) by Kilifi police. Po-
 lice claimed that he was the leader of a gang of thieves, but his relatives insisted
 that it was a case of mistaken identity. However, there were no effective police in-
 vestigations into many other cases of extrajudicial killing. The authorities usually
 attribute the absence of an investigation into an extrajudicial killing to the failure
 of citizens to file official complaints. However, the form required for filing com-
 plaints is available only at police stations, which often lack the forms or are not
 forthcoming in providing them. There also is considerable public skepticism of a
 process that assigns the investigation of police abuse to the police themselves.
 Hearings are ongoing in some of the cases from the previous year. Public inquests
 into the January 1997 deaths of Catholic lay brother Larry Timmons in Njoro and
 University of Nairobi student Solomon Muruli were scheduled to continue in Feb-
 ruary 1999. Inquests also were scheduled for early 1999 into the 1997 deaths in po-
 lice custody of Moses Macharia Gicheru, and Lomurodo Amodoi. No investigations
 into the 1997 deaths in police custody of Joseph Muangi Muiruri, Irungu Kimani,
 Noah Njunguna Ndung'u, Joseph Ndung'u Njoroge, James Gitau Kuanju, or Julius
 Mwangi Njoroge had been undertaken by year's end.

 KANU youthwingers perpetrated a number of violent attacks during the year,
 some involving fatalities. Human rights activists charge that youthwingers operate
 with tacit or explicit police approval. Police took no action against youthwingers in
 Kitui in January after they beat to death Kiema Mwisuve based on allegations that
 he robbed the local assistant chiefs home (see Section 1.c.). In 1997 President Moi
 and other KANU leaders had called upon youthwingers on a number of occasions
 to help police. No complaint had been filed and no action had been taken at year's
 end in the 1997 case in which KANU youthwingers beat to death Evan Baraza
 Doanyo.
 There was a major outbreak of ethnic violence in the Laikipia and Njoro districts
 of the Rift Valley province in January, which resulted in more than 100 deaths and
 the displacement of thousands of persons (see Section 2.d.). Numerous persons were
 raped; persons also were hacked with machetes, and homes were burned (see Sec-
 tion 5). In both areas, security forces failed to respond to early warning signs of ris-
 ing ethnic tension, and were slow to respond after the outbreak of violence, allowing
 it to continue unchecked -for several days. When security forces finally were de-
 ployed in large numbers, the violence quickly subsided, except for sporadic inci-
 dents.
 As in the ethnic violence in the Rift Valley in 1991-93 and on the coast in August
 1997, there were credible charges of involvement by local politicians belonging to
 both KANU and the opposition in the January ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley.
 There is no compelling evidence to support charges that the Government itself insti-
 gated the violence; however, the Government clearly did little to prevent the vio-
 lence and its response to the clashes was slow, inefficient, and insufficient to contain
 the violence once it started. The Akiwumi Ethnic Clash Investigation Commission,
 a government-appointed body composed of three judges, initiated hearings in August
 on the cause of ethnic clashes. The commission compiled evidence on coast and Rift
 Valley ethnic violence that implicated both government and opposition politicians in
 instigating ethnic clashes.
 Deadly attacks and revenge counterattacks, part of a longstanding pattern of cat-
 tle rustling, continued between Pokots and Marakwets in Trans Nzoia in the north-
 west. There were also sporadic incidents of ethnic-targeted violence and banditry in
 Isiolo, Meru/Nyambene, Garissa, Trans Mara, and on the coast. In October in Wajir
 district in the northeast, Boran tribesmen, reinforced by Oromo kinsmen from Ethi-
 opia, raided camps of the rival Degadia ethnic group. Approximately 150 persons
 were killed, many more were wounded and more than 50 persons, mostly teenage
 girls, were kidnaped.
 According to the KHRC, 139 persons were killed in mob violence during the year,
 compared with 132 such deaths in 1997. Human rights observers attribute mob vio-
 lence to a lack of public confidence in the police and the judicial process. The great
 majority of mob violence victims, who died by lynching, beating, or burning, were
 persons suspected of criminal activities, including robbery, cattle rustling, and mem-
 bership in terror gangs. However, the social acceptability of mob violence also pro-
 vided cover for personal vengeance under the guise of "mob justice." Occasionally,
 social misfits and strangers were the targets of mob violence, including at least 16
 persons killed on suspicion of practicing witchcraft. The most notable of these were
 the beating and burning deaths of 10 rumored "witches" one night in-September in
 a Kisii village. Some local Christian ministers praised the perpetrators for "saving"
 the villages from Satan. Villagers in Teso also beat Francis Mogaka to death when
 he stopped to help a young boy whom he had hit when the boy ran across the road
 in front of his car. The Government has criticized the practice of mob justice and
 arrested and charged a number of persons in court with participation in incidents
 of mob violence.
 In August a terrorist's car bomb exploded behind the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi,
 kilig more than 200 persons and injuring thousands.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Bandits kidnaped numerous persons during raids in the north and east. In Octo-
 ber more than 50 persons, mostiy teenage girls, were kidnaped following a raid in
 the Wajir district (see Section l.a.). There are reports that some of these girls had
 returned home by year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no one shall be subject to torture or degrading punish-
 ment or other treatment," however, security forces continued to use torture and
 physical violence as methods of interrogation and to punish both pretrial detainees
 and convicted prisoners. Although police authorities issued strong directives against
 the use of torture by police in 1997, the problem persists. The KHRC reported 98
 cases of torture, and several cases of indiscriminate beating of groups of persons by
 
 
 police in the period from January to September, with 10 of the individual cases re-
 sulting in death (see Section l.a.).
 There were numerous allegations of police use of excessive force and torture. De-
 tainees routinely claimed that they had been tortured, making it difficult to sepa-
 rate real from fabricated incidents. Among the more credible allegations of police
 torture reported by the KHRC were the cases of: Schoolteacher Gabriel Lokong, who
 was tortured in March by West Pokot police when he tried to prevent them from
 molesting female students; Patrick Kamende Mwakazi, who was tortured by
 Karatina police; Elizabeth Wairimu Rindiri, who was tortured by Nyeri police; Al-
 fred Nyakundi Moreri, who was tortured by the now-disbanded Muranga flying
 squad (a police unit); Juma Makoko, who was tortured by Mombasa police; and
 Jackson Kigunju and four others, who were tortured by Kerugoya police. According
 to organizations that work with street children, police also abuse street children (see
 Section 5). According to press reports, Meru police tortured a 10-year-old boy in De-
 cember for allegedly stealing a videotape cassette. Police used excessive force in
 breaking up demonstrations and strikes and beat citizens (see Sections 2.b. and
 6.a.). In February police beat demonstrators peacefully protesting the Government's
 slow response to ethnic violence in the Rift Valley, and in May police beat 10 Mem-
 bers of Parliament (M.P.'s) and several other persons taking part in a peaceful
 meeting to discuss the lack of security in the region (see Section 2.b.). Police used
 excessive force in December in rounding up illegal aliens, and there were
 unconfirmed reports that police raped female illegal aliens (see Section 2.d.).
 KANU youthwingers carried out a number of violent assaults, including an attack
 at a Lanet bus stop in Nakuru in January and an attack against striking teachers
 in Kisumu in October. The police failed to respond to these attacks.
 During the year the Government investigated some allegations of police use of ex-
 cessive force and torture, and prosecuted several police officers. According to the
 Government, 15 police officers were charged in court. Mombasa police launched an
 inquiry into the police shooting of Edward Kahindi Mwatua. The courts sentenced
 police officer George Araka Ochillo in January to 2-years' probation for shooting
 Rose Warigia in September 1995. However, apart from the torture case of Gabriel
 Lokong, there were no official investigations into cases involving police brutality.
 Caning is used as punishment in cases such as rape (see Section 5).
 Prison conditions are often life threatening, due both to a lack of resources and
 to the Governments unwillingness to address deficiencies in the penal system. Pris-
 oners are subjected to severe overcrowding, inadequate water, poor diet, sub-
 standard bedding, and deficient health care. Police subject prisoners to torture and
 inhuman treatment. Rape of both male and female inmates is a serious problem,
 as is the growing incidence of AIDS. Disease is widespread in prisons and the death
 rate is high. Prisons do not have resident doctors, and only one prison had a doctor
 permanently assigned. Prisoners are sometimes kept in solitary confinement far
 longer than the maximum 90 days allowed by law.
 According to the Government, 536 prisoners died in jails during the year, com-
 pared with 631 in 1997, due chiefly to anemia, heart attack, malaria, typhoid fever,
 dysentery, tuberculosis, and AIDS. The country's 83 prisons are severely over-
 crowded, averaging 30 percent above holding capacity with a daily average of 33,610
 inmates.
 Officially, men, women, and children are kept in separate cells. However, there
 are reports of men and women being placed in cells together, and youths (some
 young teenagers) are frequently kept in cells with adults in overcrowded prisons and
 remand centers. Prisoners and detainees report that they frequently are denied the
 right to contact relatives or lawyers.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional protections, police
 continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens. The Constitution provides that
 persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within 24 hours in non-
 capital offenses and 14 days in capital cases. The Penal Code specifically excludes
 weekends and holidays from this 14-day period. The law does not stipulate the pe-
 riod within which the trial of a charged suspect must begin. Suspects often are held
 for weeks, even months, before being brought to court. The Government has ac-
 knowledged cases in which persons have been held in pretrial detention for several
 years. In April the High Court ordered the release of murder suspect Josphat Tunga
 Nyambu, who had been held for 3 years in remand. Murder suspect Timothy Karani
 reportedly has been kept in custody in Embu for 11 years without being charged.
 The law provides that families and attorneys of persons arrested and charged are
 allowed access to them, although this right often is not honored. Family members
 and attorneys may visit prisoners only at the discretion of the State. This privilege
 
 
 212
 often is denied. For those who have been charged, it often is possible to be released
 on bail with a bond or other assurance of the suspect's return.
 The reforms passed in late 1997 repealed the detention without trial provisions
 of the Preservation of Public Security Act, the provision under which particularly
 troublesome political activists had been imprisoned in past years. Amendments to
 the Chiefs' Act reduced the powers of local officials. The authority of chiefs to re-
 strict movement of persons was repealed and, while they still have the power to de-
 tain persons, the detained must be taken immediately "to the nearest police sta-
 tion." The reforms also repealed the Vagrancy and Outlying Districts Acts, whose
 broad discretionary powers had been used to detain persons or restrict movement.
 The Task Force on the Reform of Penal Laws and Procedures, created by the At-
 torney General in 1993, submitted its final report to the Attorney General in De-
 cember 1997. The report recommended seven new bills to reform the criminaljustice
 system. One of these, the Community Service Order Act passed by Parliament in
 December, subjects those convicted and sentenced to less than 3 years to community
 service rather than custodial sentence, thus potentially reducing the prison popu-
 lation.
 Security forces occasionally made irregular arrests, such as the detention of news-
 paper photographer Raphael Munge in Nakuru in June for photographing police ar-
 resting street vendors (see Section 2.a.), and the arrest of Francis Tulel, Secretary
 of the Catholic Peace and Justice Commission for Eldoret Diocese for cattle rustling
 (see Section 2.c.). Security forces also arrested striking teachers in October (see Sec-
 tion 6.a.), and student demonstrators. However, police harassment and detention of
 opposition M.P.'s, NGO officials, clergy, and other government critics greatly de-
 creased during the year, a result of the late 1997 reforms. Overall, police behavior
 toward journalists also continued to improve, though a number of journalists were
 arrested on dubious charges of publishing information "likely to cause alarm to the
 public," and some were beaten (see Section 2.a.). In May a KHRC member and a
 journalist were arrested and held incommunicado for 4 days before being released
 on bail. A progovernment group called NGO Watch had accused them of theft. In
 December police arrested over 500 persons lacking proper documentation during a
 crackdown on illegal aliens (see Section 2.d.).    -
 The Government does not use formal exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7ial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, in practice the judiciary is subject to executive branch influence.
 The President has extensive powers over appointments, including those of the Chief
 Justice, the Attorney General, and Appeal and High Court judges. The President
 also can dismiss judges and the Attorney General upon the recommendation of a
 special presidentially appointed tribunal. Judges do not have life tenure and serve
 on a contract basis.
 President Moi has made statements on matters that were before the courts in
 years past, but did not do so during the year. However, there were other indications
 of executive interference. In April and May, for example, the High Court granted
 virtually automatic injunctions against tabloid publications at the request of senior
 government officials. Another problem-has been the Attorney General's constitu-
 tional power to discontinue proceedings in private prosecution cases. Arguing that
 citizens must first notify his office before initiating private prosecution, Attorney
 General Amos Wako has used this authority on a number of occasions to terminate
 cases agt government officials. However, on several occasions judges acted to as-
 sert judicial independence. In July a High Court judge overturned 'a government
 order closing four tabloid publications on the grounds that they were not registered
 (see Section2.a.). Tn September the High Court stayed a government order
 deregistering five Muslim NGO's pending judicial review. That same month, the
 High Court overturned a government order canceling the broadcast license of an
 independent media company (see Section 2.a.). In October the courts instructed the
 police to desist from blocking the offices of the Kenya National Union of Teachers,
 which was coordinating a nationwide strike. In December the courts lifted the ban
 on Kenneth Matiba's book , "Return to Reason." Judges who ruled against the Gov-
 ernment in the past sometimes were punished with transfer or nonrenewal of con-
 tracts, although during the year no retaliatory action against justices was observed.
 The court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and two levels of
 magistrate courts, where most criminal and civil cases originate. The Chief Justice
 is a member of both the Court of Appeals and the High Court, which undercuts the
 principle of judicial review. Military personnel are tried by military courts-martial,
 and verdicts may be appealed through military court channels. The Chief Justice
 appoints attor~neys for military personnel on a case-by-case basis.
 Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters affecting'ersons of the same
 ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with statutory law. Civilians are tried
 
 
 213
 publicly, although some testimony may be given in closed session. Judges hear all
 cases; there is no jury system. There is a presumption of innocence, and defendants
 have the right to attend their trial, to confront witnesses, and to present witnesses
 and evidence. Civilians also can appeal a verdict to the High Court and ultimately
 to the Court of Appeals.
 Defendants do not have the right to government-provided legal counsel, except in
 capital cases. For lesser charges, free legal aid is not usually available outside
 Nairobi. As a result, poor persons without an attorney may be convicted for lack of
 an articulate defense. Although defendants have access to an attorney in advance
 of trial, defense lawyers do not always have access to government-held evidence,
 since the Government can plead the state security secrets clause as a basis for with-
 holding evidence. Court fees for filing and hearing cases are high for ordinary citi-
 zens. The daily rate of at least $33 (2,000 shillings) for arguing a case before a judge
 is beyond the reach of most citizens.
 In the past, critics of the Governent--politicians, journalists, lawyers, stu-
 dents-have been harassed through abuse of the legal process. In a 1997 study of
 the judiciary, the International Bar Association found a persistent and deliberate
 misuse of the legal system for the purpose of harassing opponents and critics of the
 Government." During the year, the picture was mixed, but on balance improved, as
 the number of cases in which the Government apparently interfered decreased from
 previous years. However, a number of opposition M.P.'s, student leaders, and human
 rights activists still had one or more court cases pending, often for months or even
 years.
 The Government did not hold any political prisoners during the year. James
 Apiny Adhiambo, who was convicted of participating in a 1982 failed coup attempt,
 was released in December 1997. Of the 774 persons listed by the KHRC as political
 prisoners in 1997, most were released, although some were convicted of criminal
 charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides that "no person shall be subjected to the search
 of his person or his property or the entry by others on his premises," it permits
 searches without warrants "to promote the public benefit." The Police Act permits
 poice to enter a home forcibly if the time required to obtain a search warrant would
 rejudice" their investigation. Although security officers generally obtain search
 warrants, they occasionally conduct searches without warrants to apprehend sus-
 pected criminals or to seize property believed to be stolen. Nairobi police searched
 the offices of several tabloid publications and one NGO, the National Convention
 Executive Council, without warrants.
 Traditionally, security forces have monitored closely the activities of dissidents,
 following or otherwise harassing them. They employ various means of surveillance,
 including a network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians
 and human rights advocates. In years past, opposition leaders, students, and others
 reported that the Government. often targeted them with surveillance, telephone
 wiretaps, and interference with written correspondence. During the year, there were
 few such reports. The Nation newspaper complained to the Government that DSI
 agents followed some of its journalists after President Moi publicly criticized reports
 in the newspaper (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of S eech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, the Government broadly interprets several existing colo-
 nial-era laws to limit free expression. Reforms passed in late 1997 somewhat im-
 proved the degree of freedom of speech and the press, and there was a significant
 growth in the number of periodicals critical of the Government. Nonetheless, the
 Government systematically harassed elements of the press, and there were sporadic
 incidents of police harassment and beating of journalists. Police dispersed dem-
 onstrators to prevent criticism of the Government. Some independent periodicals re-
 port that the business community is under pressure from the Government to refrain
 om advertising in their magazines, pushing some to the edge of insolvency. In
 spite of these pressures, the press, civic organizations, and the opposition continued
 to present their views to the public, particularly in the print media. Government
 pressure led journalists to practice some self-censorship, although this problem was
 less serious than in previous years.
 On the whole, the print media remained candid and independent, despite contin-
 ued government pressure and harassment. There was a large increase in tabloid
 publications in late 1997 and early in the year, most of which were vehemently criti-
 cal of the Government. Reporting in these tabloids ran the gamut from revealing
 insider reports to irresponsible rumor mongering.
 
 
 214
 The mainstream print media include three daily newspapers that report on na-
 tional politics. The largest newspaper, the Nation, is independent and publishes ar-
 ticles critical of government policies. The second largest newspaper, the East African
 Standard, is controlled by an investment group with close ties to the Government
 and the ruling KANUJ party. It is generally), although not automatically, supportive
 of the Government. The third daily newspaper, the Kenya Times, reflects KANU
 party views.
 Relations between the press-and the Government have improved in recent years.
 Even when government officials have requested the independent press to suppress
 damaging articles, the final decision has been left to the editors. Most of the pre-
 vious taboos against discussion of the President and his family have fallen into dis-
 use, and there is open and often irreverent commentary on both in the tabloid press.
 Less-than-favorable stories on President Moi appear frequently in the independent
 press. Police harassment of journalists in the course of their duties continued to de-
 cline, but this improvement was not uniform.
 A pattern of systematic government harassment of the tabloid press emerged in
 the spring and summer. In March President Moi threatened tabloid publications,
 which he termed "gutter press," with unspecified action if they continued to tarnish
 his and his Government's name. In April and May, police made several raids on the
 offices of tabloid publications, confiscating documents and detaining some staffers.
 At the request-   e~n    ve       officials, the High Court issued a series of in-
 junctions enjoining these pubications from printg alegaions of corruption by gov-
 ernment officials and associates of President Mo. In July the Government effec-
 tively banned, by refusing registration, three tabloid publications--the Star, the
 Post on Sunday, and Finance. It also declared the Kenya Confidential illegal for fail-
 ing to register, while ignoring several unregistered pro-KANU publications. Nairobi
 policemen immediately confiscated copies of aU. four publications from street ven-
 dors. However, later that month the High Court stayed the government order pend-
 ing judicial review. The publications then continued publishing without apparent re-
 straint. In early September, police detained two journalists for several days for pub-
 lishing the "unregistered" Kenya Despatch.
 There were also sporadic incidents of police harassment of journalists, including
 the arrest in April of the editor of the Dispatch for publishing an article containing
 "alarming information," the arrest of East African Standard photographer Bill
 Kinuthia in May for taking pictures of a murder scene, and the beating and arrest
 in June of newspaper photographer Raphael Munge for photographing Nakuru po-
 lice arresting street vendors (see Section 1.d.). Also in May, poli e arrested and held
 incommunicado a journalist accused of theft by a progovernment group, NGO
 Watch. In October Nyeri police heat two journalists covering the nationwide teach-
 ers' strike. In June the Nation prtested that DSI agents were following its report-
 ers after President Moi publicly criticized some of the newspaper's reports. Two
 other incidents also suggested government harassment. Arsonists who burned the
 Colourprint press plant, which often prints opposition material, had ties to an indi-
 vidual close to the Government. In March the Kenya Revenue Authority, whose
 chairman publishes its leading competitor, froze the bank account of the highly re-
 spected and pro-opposition Economic Review, for nonpayment of taxes. As a result,
 the Economic Review ceased publishing.
 The Government maintains a near-monopoly over the electronic broadcast media
 through tight control of broadcasting-particularly radio, the principal news me-
 dium for most citizens. It controls the -Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC),
 which operates the country's premier radio, broadcast television, and cable tele-
 vision networks. KBC stations do not criticize the Government and give a large
 share of news time to government or KANU party functions and scant coverage to
 opposition activities. KANU supporters also own two other television networks-
 Kenya Television Network (KTN), which airs news programs with somewhat more
 balanced political coverage, and Stellavision. The KTN, which provides the only
 somewhat balanced television news coverage, is restricted to the Nairobi metropoli-
 tan area.
 The Government continued to delay action on a large number of radio and tele-
 vision license applications through most of the year, highlighting the arbitrariness
 of the broadcast licensing process. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ex-
 plains that it was waiting for the recommendations on media liberalization from the
 Attorney General's Task Force on Press Law. That Task Force made its initial re-
 port in December, but still has several outstanding issues to resolve. In 1997 the
 Government issued four broadcast licenses, three to friends of the ruling KANU and
 one to the British Broadcasting Corporation. In May after a delay of 7 years, the
 Government finally issued a broadcast license to the Nation Media Group, the coun-
 try's largest media organization. However, it restricted the license area to Nairobi,
 
 
 215
 and it delayed issuing broadcast frequencies until late in the year. In September the
 Ministry approved two radio and television broadcast licenses, one to a Muslim
 group and one to a Christian group with close ties to KANU. According to the Min-
 istry, 22 of the 100 broadcast license applications made to date have been approved.
 At the beginning of the year, the Naion attempted to circumvent the licensing
 blockade by purchasing the East African Television Network (EATN), which already
 possessed nationwide radio and television broadcast licenses. The Minister of Infor-
 mation and Broadcasting quickly stepped in and cancelled the EATN's broadcast li-
 cense. However, in September the High Court ruled that the Minister had no juris-
 diction to cancel a broadcast license and ordered the license reinstated to the EATN.
 The Nation Media Group anticipates inaugurating broadcast services in early 1999,
 using either the EATN nationwide licenses or its own restricted licenses.
 Government control of the broadcast media fosters unbalanced reporting. This mo-
 nopoly severely limited the opposition's ability to communicate with the electorate
 in the 1997 general elections, as the KBC is the only source of current information
 for most persons outside the Nairobi area.
 During the 1997 election campaign the Electoral Commission directed that the
 KBC accord equal treatment to all political parties but this directive was never im-
 plemented fully. KBC coverage remained heavily biased in favor of KANU and
 President Moi. Moreover, the KBC'S limited coverage of the opposition, was gen-
 erally negative, compared with uniformly positive coverage of KANU.
 Representatives of the international media are free to operate.
 A total of 79 publications are banned, includig such works as "The Quotations
 of Chairman Mao Zedong" and Salmon Rushdie's 'Satanic Verses." The courts lifted
 the ban on the Catholic periodical Inooro in 1997, and in December lifted the ban
 on Kenneth Matiba's "Return to Reason." The 1997 reforms eliminated sedition as
 a ground for censorship of publications, and directed that a board be established to
 review existing, and future, publication bans. This Board, the Prohibited Publica-
 tions Review Board, was established during the year.
 Despite constitutional provisions for free speech, school administrators and the se-
 curity forces limit academic freedom. They frequently take harsh action against
 even peaceful student demonstrations, whether over political or bread-and-butter
 issues, forcefully dispersing and sometimes arresting students. A number of student
 activists have been expelled from universities in recent years because of political ac-
 tivities, and most have been refused readmission. Student leaders report that they
 are sometimes followed by government security forces.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government at times restricts the right in prac-
 tice. For many years the Government used the Public Order Act to control public
 gatherings and to restrict this right. The 1997 reforms revised the act, replacing the
 requirement that public meetings be licensed with a requirement that organizers in-
 stead notify the local police of planned meetings. Under this new formulation, gov-
 ernment disruptions of public meetings declined significantly.
 Most police disruptions of public meetings involved potentially violent situations,
 including labor and other protest demonstrations. However, several incidents in-
 volved flagrant interference with freedom of assembly. In February Nairobi police
 beat and arrested demonstrators peacefully protesting the Government's slow re-
 sponse to ethnic violence in Rift Valley. In May Trans Nzoia police beat 10 M.P.'s
 and several members of the audience of a peaceful meeting to discuss the lack of
 security in the region. In October Kitui police forcibly disrupted a public meeting
 organized by opposition M.P. Charity Ngilu. Police also disrupted other public meet-
 ings, including a strike by nurses in Webuye in January; a meeting of striking bank
 workers and a rally of opposition supporters in Kamukunji Grounds in Nairobi in
 March; a strike by sugar factory workers in Kisumu in April; a protest by street
 vendors against demolition of their kiosks in Nairobi in May and again in July; sev-
 eral meetings of tea farmers and coffee farmers in the spring; a strike by teachers
 in October, and an opposition rally in Nakuru in November.
 The Government used the Societies Act to restrict freedom of association. The act
 requires every association to be registered or to be exempted from registration by
 the Registrar of Societies. For years the Government refused to act on a number
 of political party registration applications. However, following passage of the 1997
 reforms, the Government acted on pending and long overdue party applications, in-
 creasing the number of registered political parties from 12 to 26. However, the Gov-
 ernment refused to reverse its 1994 denial of registration of the Islamic Party of
 Kenya.
 The Government has long been at odds with NGO's, many of which it accuses of
 being "subversive" and of working with the opposition to overthrow the Government.
 NGO's are registered by the Government NGO Coordination Board under the NGO
 
 
 Act. The Government has used this structure to put pressure on the nongovern-
 mental National NGO Council. In 1997 the Board directed the Council to compile
 a list -of -political NGO's," presumably, to carry out President Moi's threat of
 dereistering all "political NGO's," but the Council refused. In March President Moi
 warned NGO's that they risked deregistration if they associated with the constitu-
 tional reform lobby group, the National Convention Executive Council (NCEC).
 From time to time, other government officials threatened that NGO's would be
 deregistered for "sedition." In September, I month after the terrorist bombing of the
 U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the NGO Board deregistered five Muslim NGO's without
 detailing the charges or giving them a chance to defend themselves. Many Muslims
 severely criticized the closures. The next week, the High Court stayed the Board's
 decision, then in December, reversed it and -reinstated three of the NGO's.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not infringe on religious activities, except to require registration
 by new churches.. However, the Government- periodically arrested and briefly de-
 tained some members of several small and controversial Kikuyatraditional religious
 sects, charging that they were coercing women-to undergo the practice of female
 genital mutilation and males to undergo circumcision rites.
 In April police arrestedeFrancis Tulel, Secretary of the Catholic Peace and Justice
 Commission for Eldoret Diocese, for cattle rustling. Soie observers believe that
 Tulel was arrestd re'his activities withl the Peace and Justice Commissiond.
 Muslim leaders charge that the Government is hostile toward Muslims. In Sep-
 tember the Government deregistered five Muslim NGO's for allegedly supporting
 terrorism (see Section 2.b.). '_-
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Count. y, Foreign Travel,-Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law,citizes may travel freely within the country. This right largely
 was respected during the year, in contrast to 1997, when opposition leaders on sev-
 eral occasions were blocked from vsiting, or forced to leave, certain locations.
 The .Government does not restrict emigration or foreign travel. However, the law
 requires a woman'to obtain her husband's or father's permission in order to obtain
 a passport (see Section 5). Civil servants andlM.P.s must get government permis-
 sion for international travel, which is granted Poutinely.
 ""Many of the rural r~sidents displaced 1y he violent ethnic clashes in Rift Valley
 in 1991-93 still have not returned to theirhomes and remain displaced in-urban
 areas. In 1997 the Government made soe sm efforts to regularize land ownership for
 some of the displaced persons in the Moboregion. Some of the several thousand per-
 sons displaced by ethnic clishes on the coastin August 1997, in Rift Valley in Janu-
 ary, and in the Pokot-Marakwetoregion throughout the year, likewise have not re-
 turned to their hon es due tofear-of renewed violence.  -    l
 The Government offers first asylum and provided it to the approximately 172,000
 refugees registered  by the United Natons   High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR), who live in official UNHR camps. An undetermined number of refugees
 live outside the camps in. cities andrural areas. Somalis account for-about 80 per-
 cent of the t  rtal refugee population, followed by-large numbers of Sudanese, and a
 scattered nuhber of other nationalities from across the region. Approximately 1,800
 refugees,mostly-of Ethidpian or Somali. ethnic background, were repatriated during
 the year.. -,..
 The law p-rohides for the gcn of asylum or refugee status in accordance with the
 1951U.N.C onvention Relating tohe Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Nev-
 ertheles, when over 400,000 rfugees fleeing civil strife and drought arrived from
 the neighboringcountries of Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda in 1991, the
 Government suspended the rcess by which it ruled on applications for refugee sta-
 tus or asylum. Since then, ahandful of affluent individuals have effectively pur-
 chased Convention Status but, for all practical purposes, an official asylum  or refu-
 gee application process ceased to exist. However, in September the Government
 agreed to meet with the UNHCR and work out a procedure for officially document-
 ing refugees and asy-f   seekers. The details of implementing this .agreement have
 yet tbe established.
 At the-direction of the Government, the luNHCR closed two of the three refugee
 camps near the coastal city of Mombasa in 197. At the time these two camps were
 closedc, e 7  ,000 , esidents were moved against their wishes to camps near
 the Somali and Sudenese borders. Nearly all of the roughly 1,500 refugees who re-
 -mained .in the third .Mombasa cam p have registered to return to Somalia rather
 than relocate to another camp. In December, after~trying to repatriate or relocate
 the residents of the remaining coasal camp, the Government ordered a halt to all
 assistance o .this camp and took steps to forcefully dismantle it. There were reports
 that the Government occasionally used harsh measures to close the camp.
 
 
 In August, as a result of a review in security procedures following the terrorist
 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the authorities instructed all refugees re-
 siding outside of a UNCHR camp to report to the nearest immigration office. All
 refugees who complied with this instruction were ordered to depart the country
 withiu 14 days. In September hundreds of refugees and other aliens in urban areas
 were rounded up and kept in harsh conditions. The police used excessive force in
 rounding up aliens, and there were unconfirmed reports that, in some instances, po-
 lice raped female aliens. As a result of UNHOR interventions those refugees ordered
 to depart the country were allowed to remain beyond the original 14 days while
 their cases are rerefugees outside of UNHCR camps and im-
 properly documented aliens is the topic of negotiations between the Government,
 which wants to move these refugees into camps, and the UNHOR, which wants to
 ensure that this is done in a humane way.
 Conditions in the camps vary and while some provide well for refugees, others
 lack adequate food, water, and medical care. Incidents of rape of women and young
 girls in refugee camps continued to occur (see Section 5). Following a slightly im-
 proved security climate in 1997 as a result of increased police attention, the situa-
 tion deteriorated. Acts of violence, including carjackings and banditry, occur regu-
 larly in the camps and the Dadaab area near the Somali border, and resulted in
 several injuries to refugees, and the death of one police officer. Despite the renewed
 hardening of the Government's policy toward refugees, there were no reports of ex-
 pulsions from the country ththose having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citirens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through free and fair multiparty elections, although their ability to do so has not
 yet been fully demonstrated at the presidential level. The December 1997 general
 elections, despite numerous logistical and other flaws, generally reflected the will
 of the electorate. They were marked by much less violence and intimidation than
 the 1992 polls, and by less fraud and other irregularities. Opposition candidates won
 60 percent of the vote, but these votes were split among four main and several
 fringe parties, thereby giving KANU a majority in Parliament and President Moi
 a mandate to rule for another 5 years. The overwhelming majority-95 percent--
 of the 210 parliamentary elections also apparently reflected the popular will, al-
 though there were credible reports of vote rigging in 10 to 12 constituencies. (The
 representatives who hold the remaining 12 seats in the 222-member Parliament are
 nominated by political parties, in proportion to the number of seats they hold in
 Parliament.)
 At the local level, the President exercises sweeping power over the administrative
 structure. The President appoints both the powerful provincial and district commis-
 sioners and a multitude of district and village officials. In past elections, many local
 officials actively assisted the ruling KANU. However, there was a real, if imperfect,
 effort in 1997 to delink provincial government officials from the campaign and poll-
 ing processes. Before the campaign began, the Government issued instructions en-
 joining provincial and local officials from partisan involvement; nearly all local gov-
 ernment and security officials adhered to these directives.
 At the national level, the Constitution authorizes the President to dissolve the
 legislature and prohibits debate on issues under consideration by the courts. This
 prohibition, in conjunction with a ruling by the Speaker of the Assembly that the
 President's conduct is inappropriate for parliamentary debate, has limited the scope
 of deliberation on controversial political issues. M.P.'s are entitled to introduce legis-
 lation, but in practice it is the Attorney General who does so. As the head of KANU,
 which controls a slim majority of parliamentary seats, the President also is able to
 influence significantly the legislative agenda.
 There was much less government harassment and intimidation of the political op-
 position than in 1997, following the late 1997 reforms that repealed the public meet-
 ing licensing provision of the Public Order Act. Nevertheless, in March police raided
 the offices of the NCEC and disrupted opposition rallies in Narobi in March and
 in Nakuru in November (see Section 2.b.). In January opposition Democratic Party
 leader Muai Kibaki and his lawyer, who are challenging legally the results of the
 1997 presidential election, received anonymous death threats.
 The 1997 reforms also improved the independence of the presidentially-appointed
 Electoral Commission, which oversees elections, by nearly doubling its size, with op-
 position-nominated members. Only one parliamentary election was held during the
 year, a September by-election in to replace the deceased M.P. in Kieni. International
 and domestic observers found that election to be both free and fair, and efficiently
 run, in contrast to the problems in the 1997 general election.
 
 
 218
 Although there are no legal restrictions, traditional attitudes circumscribe the role
 of women in politics. Women are seriously underrpresented at decision-making lev-
 els in the Government. The new Parliament included eight female M.P.'s (four elect-
 ed and four nominated), up slightly from seven in the last Parliament (six elected
 and one nominated). The Women's Political Caucus, formed in 1997, is continuing
 to lobby over issues of concern to women and to increase the influence of women
 on government policy. A parliamentary proposal that one-third of parliamentary
 seats be reserved for women was defeated in 1997. However, the growing role and
 activism of women in the political system was demonstrated by the new Constitu-
 tional Review Commission, in which- Parliament acceded to the demands of women
 for representation by reserving one-third of the 25 commission seats for women.
 Members of all ethnic groups participate in the political process. Many tribes-
 including the Kisii, Meru, Embu, Kamba, Kikuyu, Taita, Kalenjin, Luhya, Turkana,
 Maasai, Giriama, and Somali-have members in the President's Cabinet. However,
 the President reportedly relies on an inner circle of advisers, drawn mostly from his
 Kalenjin tribe. There is widespread anti-Asian sentiment, which some opposition po-
 litical leaders have sought to use for their own ends (see Section 5). There is one
 Asian member of Parliament.
 In October the Safina party nominated a blind woman to fill its single nominated
 parliamentary seat.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude-Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The number of human rights organizations is growing. These include the KHRC,
 the Kenya Antirape Organization, the Legal Advice Center, the Catholic Justice and
 Peace Commission, the Protestant National Council of Churches of Kenya, the Cen-
 ter for Governance and Development, and the Release Political Prisoners pressure
 group. An array of legal organizations, -including the International Commission of
 Jurists-Kenya, the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA)-Kenya, the
 Law Society of Kenya, and the Public Law Institute, also are concerned with human
 rights.
 NGO's and some opposition parties maintain comprehensive files on human rights
 abuses. A number of attorneys represent the poor and human rights defendants
 without compensation, although they can meet only a small percentage of the need,
 and are concentrated largely in urban areas.
 The KHRC produces a "Quarterly Repression Report?' that catalogs the human
 rights situation in the country, as well as a number of special reports on pressing
 human rights issues. During the year, it published reports on police brutality, pris-
 on conditions, and security force behavior in the remote Garissa area. The Institute
 for Education in Democracy (lED) and other NGO's monitor elections in cooperation
 wit'the Electral Commission. The TED, along with the Catholic Church and other
 organizations, closely monitored every step in the 1997 electoral process, a task they
 are continuing in subsequent by-elections.
 Prior to the late 1997 reforms, government relations with human rights groups,
 domestic and international, were poor. The Government regularly criticized human
 rights organizations and other NGO's and occasionally disrupted their meetings and
 workshops. During the year, government disruptions of human rights organizations
 were rare, reflecting the improved security force behavior following the reforms.
 Nevertheless, the Government deregistered five Muslim NGO's in September for al-
 leged terrorist connections (see Section 2.b.).
 While the Government often has criticized domestic and international human
 rights NGO's in the past, it also has made some effort to reach out and engage
 them. It allowed human rights organizations to witness some autopsies of persons
 who died in police custody. In 1997 it issued a formal response to Amnesty Inter-
 national's May Memorandum of Concern over the human rights situation. During
 the year, the Attorney General's Office responded in detail to foreign embassies'
 human rights inquiries.
 The 10-member Government Standing Committee on -Human Rights established
 in 1996 is empowered to "investigate alleged violations of constitutional freedoms,"
 including abuse of power-by public officials. It is tasked with drafting recommenda-
 tions on human rights problems and providing these to the government agencies
 under whose purview the problems fall. Since its establishment, the Committee has
 maintained a low profile and kept its distance from most contentious human rights
 problems. It issued its flrst public report in December. This was a general overview
 of human rights laws and definitions that made only a cursory reference to torture
 and other forms of official human rights abuses, and provided only very general rec-
 ommendations. The Committee's investigation into the August 1997 violence along
 the coast, which was published in the same report, was more comprehensive.
 
 
 In October the Parliament passed a resolution to create an Ombudsman's office
 that would be charged with addressing complaints about inefficiency, corruption,
 nepotism, and abuse of power by public servants.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's "race, tribe,
 place of origin or residence or other local connection, political opinions, color, or
 creed." However, the authorities did not effectively enforce all these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. According
 to the Government, 903 cases of rape were reported to the police during the year.
 However, the available statistics probably underreport the number of incidents since
 social mores deter women from going outside their families or ethnic groups to re-
 port sexual abuse.
 The law carries penalties of up to life imprisonment for rape. However, the rate
 of prosecution remains low because of cultural inhibitions against publicly discuss-
 ing sex, the fear of retribution, the disinclination of police to intervene in domestic
 disputes, and the unavailability of doctors who might otherwise provide the nec-
 essary evidence for conviction. Furthermore, wife beating is prevalent and largely
 condoned by much of Kenyan society. Traditional culture permits a man to dis-
 cipline his wife by physical means and is ambivalent about the seriousness of spous-
 al rape. There is no law specifically prohibiting spousal rape. Throughout the year,
 the media reported a steady stream of cases of violence against women, including
 widespread spousal abuse. The resulting publicity and public criticism often forced
 the police to take punitive action against the perpetrators of violence. There were
 continued incidents of rape of refugee Somali women at the Dadaab camps, where
 women were assaulted outside camp perimeters in the course of gathering firewood
 (see Section 2.d.).
 Women experience a wide range of discriminatory practices, limiting their politi-
 cal and economic rights and relegating them to second class citizenship. The Con-
 stitution extends equal protection of rights and freedoms to men and women, but
 long lacked a specific prohibition of discrimination on grounds of gender. This was
 corrected by the late 1997 reforms, which amended the Constitution to include dis-
 crimination on the grounds of gender as one of the constitutionally prohibited forms
 of discrimination. However, constitutional provisions on citizenship, continue to dis-
 criminate against women by allowing men, but not women, to bequeath citizenship
 to their children automatically. While the Government has ratified international
 conventions on women's rights, it has not passed domestic enabling legislation. The
 Task Force on Laws Relating to Women, established by the Attorney General in
 1993, has yet to make its report.
 Levels of education and literacy are widely different for men and women. The
 number of boys and girls in school is roughly equal at the primary level, and then
 becomes increasingly disproportionate until men outnumber women almost 2 to 1
 in higher education. Literate men significantly outnumber literate women. Seventy
 percent of illiterate persons in the country are female.
 Women continue to face both legal and actual discrimination in other areas. For
 example, a woman legally is required to obtain the consent of her husband or father
 before obtaining a national identity card or a passport. In practice, a woman also
 must have her husband's or father's approval to secure a bank loan. Women legally
 can work in industrial activities at night only in the export processing zones (EPZ's),
 although this restriction generally is not enforced. According to pension law, a
 widow loses her work pension upon remarriage, whereas a man does not.
 The Law of Succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal con-
 sideration of male and female children. In practice, most inheritance problems do
 not come before the courts. Women often are excluded from inheritance settlements,
 particularly if married, or given smaller shares than male claimants. Moreover, a
 widow cannot be the sole administrator of her husband's estate unless she has her
 children's consent.
 Women have long dominated agricultural work in terms of numbers of laborers,
 and they have become more active in urban small businesses. Nonetheless, the aver-
 age monthly income of women is about 37 percent lower than that of men, and
 women hold only about 5 percent of land titles. Not only do women have difficulty
 moving into nontraditional fields, they also are promoted more slowly than men and
 bear the brunt of layoffs. Societal discrimination is most apparent in rural areas,
 where women account for 75 percent of the agricultural work force. Rural families
 are more reluctant to invest in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at
 the higher levels.

 The nation's best known women's rights and welfare organization, Maendeleo Ya
 Wanawake ("Development of Women" in Kiswahili) was established as a nonpolitical
 NGO during the colonial era, but now operates under the close supervision of the
 Government. A growing number of women's organizations are active in the field of
 women's rights, including the FIDA, the National Council of-Women of Kenya, the
 National Commission on the Status of Women, the Education Center for Women in
 Democracy, and the League of Kenyan Women Voters.
 Children.-The system of free education in the early years of Kenya's independ-
 ence has -given way to a "cost-sharing" education system in which students pay both
 tuition and other costs. These are a heavy burden on most families. While there is
 schooling for all up to grade 12, there is a very high dropout rate in part because
 of the heavy educational expenses. There are an estimated 4 million children be-
 tween 6 and 14 years of age who are out of school. Moreover, legally mandated uni-
 versal schooling does not occur in practice because of a shortage of schools. The
 health care system for school children, which once provided periodic medical check-
 ups and free milk, is now defunct.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by certain ethnic groups and remains widespread, particularly in rural areas. The
 press reported the deaths of several girls from the practice of FGM. Health officials
 estimate that as many as 50 percent of females nationwide have suffered FGM. Ac-
 cording to Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, the percentage is as high as 80 to 90 percent
 in some districts of Eastern, Nyanza, and Rift Valley provinces. FGM usually is per-
 formed at an early age. President Moi has issued two presidential decrees banning
 FGM, and the Government prohibits government-controlled hospitals and clinics
 from practicing it; however, no law bans FGM.
 Economic displacement and population growth continued to fuel the problem of
 homeless street children. The Child Welfare Society of Kenya estimated that the
 number of Nairobi's street children has increased from 33,000 in 1990 to 50,000 dur-
 ing the year, while the Government estimates that their numbers grow at 10 per-
 cent- per year. These children often are involved in theft, drug trafficking, assault,
 trespass, and property damage. According to a 1997 Human Rights Watch report,
 these street children face harassment as well as physical and sexual abuse from the
 police and within the juvenile justice system simply because they are poor and
 homeless. They are held in extremely harsh conditions in crowded police station
 cells, often without toilets or bedding, with little food, and inadequate supplies.
 They often are incarcerated with adults and frequently beaten by police.
 The problem of child rape and molestation is growing rapidly. There are frequent
 press-reports of rape of young girls, -with rapists often middle-aged or older. Legally,
 a man does not "rape" a girl under age 14 if he has sexual intercourse with her
 against her will; he commits the lesser offense of "ement." The penalty for the felony
 of rape can be life imprisonment, while the penalty for defilement is up to 5 years'
 imprisonment. Men convicted of rape normally receive prison sentences of between
 5 and 20 years, plus several strokes of the cane.
 The press reported the deaths of two boys from .circumcision rites. Traditional cir-
 cumcision rites are performed on boys in many tribes throughout the country.
 Child prostitution is a major problem in Nairobi and Mombasa, often connected
 with the tourist trade. There have been numerous press reports regarding the rapid
 increase in child prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-Government policies do not discriminate against the
 disabled with regard to employment, education, or state services. However, disabled
 persons frequently are denied licenses to drive. There are no mandated provisions
 of accessibility for the disabled to public buildings or transportation.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-According to the 1989 government census,
 the Kikuyu are the largest ethnic community, constituting 21 percent of the almost
 29 million population. Luhya, Luo, Kamba, and Kalenjin (an amalgamation of 9
 small tribes) follow, each with more than 11 percent of the population.
 There was a major outbreak of ethnic violence in the Rift Valley province in Janu-
 ary, which resulted in more than 100 deaths and displaced thousands of persons
 (see Section l.a.).
 In past years, opposition politicians and local human rights groups reported that
 the Government discriminated against Rift Valley Kikuyus; however, there were no
 such reports during the year.
 In the summer, political leaders, including some accused of instigating or perpet-
 uating ethnic violence in their areas, took the initiative to launch peace and rec-
 onciliation talks between many of these warring communities. Initiatives in Isiolo,
 Kisii-Trans Mara, and Njoro-Laikipia appear to have reduced ethnic tensions and
 
 
 helped prevent recurrence of violence in those areas. However, similar efforts to deal
 with long-running ethnic violence in the Pokot-Marakwet areas were not successful.
 There is widespread resentment by African Kenyans toward Asians living in the
 country. The Asian community comprises between 0.5 and 1 percent of the total
 population and consists of second and third generation Asians with full citizenship
 and a smaller body of recent immigrants. Many African Kenyans resent persons of
 Asian descent for their affluence, and for their reluctance to assimilate African cul-
 ture and to employ blacks in management positions. They also see Asians as taking
 jobs and commercial opportunities away. The involvement of some Asians in corrupt
 activities with government officials further fuels popular resentment. Politicians,
 both opposition and ruling party, from time to time appeal to majority prejudices
 by attacking Asian Kenyans, accusing them of exploiting and usurping the natural
 inheritance of African Ken ans. In September opposition leader Kenneth Matiba ac-
 cused Asians of stealing the nation's wealth and promised to expel some Asians if
 he came to power. President Moi has led the response in rejecting racist diatribes;
 however, at times even he has resorted to racial attacks and slurs.
 The Government has singled out the overwhelmingly-Muslim ethnic Somalis as
 the only group whose members are re uired to carry an additional form of identi-
 fication to prove that they are citizens. They must produce upon demand their Ken-
 yan identification card  n  a second identification card verifing screening. Both
 cards also are required in order to apply for a passport. The continued presence of
 Somali refugees has exacerbated the problems faced by Kenyan Somalis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for central government civil servants, includ-
 ing medical personnel and university academic staff, all workers are in theory free
 to join unions of their choice. In practice, workers employed in export processing
 zone firms, and those working in many restaurants and small firms face dismissal
 if they join unions. Since 1982 when the Kenya Civil Servants Union was
 deregistered for political reasons, civil servants also have been denied union mem-
 bership. The law provides that as few as seven workers may establish a union, so
 long as the objectives of the union do not contravene the law, and that another
 union is not representing the employees in question already.
 Unions must apply to and be granted registration by the Government. The Gov-
 ernment also may deregister a union, but the Registrar of Trade Unions must give
 the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice. An appeal of the Reg-
 istrar's final decision may be brought before the High Court.
 There are at least 33 unions representing approximately 350,000 workers, less
 than 20 percent of the country's industrial work force. Except for the 260,000-mem-
 ber Kenya National Union of Teachers, all unions are affiliated with the one ap-
 proved central organ-the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU). The
 COTU leadership generally does not pursue worker's rights vigorously. As a result,
 most union activity takes place at the shop steward level and not at the industrial
 level where most labor-related decisions are made, thereby placing the average
 worker at a disadvantage in disputes with management.
 The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor to the Kenya Federation
 of Labor and the Kenya African Workers' Congress. The 1965 decree establishing
 COTU gives the President the power to remove COTU'S three senior leaders from
 office and grants nonvoting membership on the executive board to representatives
 of the Ministry of Labor and of KANU. A 1993 High Court decision nullified an at-
 tempt to install leaders more acceptable to the Government, but the plotters refused
 to vacate COTU headquarters. However, following a 1994 appellate court order the
 Registrar of Trade Unions agreed to recognize the old COTU leadership. Although
 the board is composed of the leadership of affiliated unions, it is common for politi-
 cal parties, especially KANU, to provide funding and other support for the election
 of senior union officials. For the past few years, trade union leaders from affiliated
 unions have sought to bring about democratic reforms in the election of union lead-
 ers, independence from the Government, and establishment of links with any politi-
 cal party that supports worker rights. The reelection of COTU leadership in 1996
 indicated that there would be no major changes in the near future. During the pe-
 riod prior to the 1997 national elections, some trade union leaders began pushing
 THE COTU to take part in the election reform dialogue. The COTU leadership too
 a progovernment position.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike, provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission of a written letter to the Minister of Labor. Mem-
 bers of the military services, police, prison guards, and members of the National
 Youth Service are precluded by law from striking. Other civil servants, like their
 private sector counterparts, can strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days
 
 
 if it is an essential service, such as water, health, education, or air traffic control).
 During this 21-day period, the Minister may either mediate the dispute, nominate
 an arbitrator, or refer the matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges ap-
 pointed by the President, for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either
 mediation, fact-finding, or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. Moreover,
 the act gives the Minister of Labor broad discretionary power to determine the legal-
 ity of any strike.
 The Minister used this power to declare strikes by bank workers and teachers ille-
 gal, although the required notice had been given. Nurses across the country went
 on strike in November 1997 and continued their action until early in the year. The
 strike ended after the Government dismissed all the striking nurses and required
 them to reapply for their jobs. Most did, and the bulk of those who reapplied eventu-
 ally regaine their jobs. In late 1997, the Kenya National Union of Teachers
 (KNUT) had called a nationwide strike, which the Government quickly settled with
 pay increases of over 200 percent spread over 5 years, rather than risk antagonizing
 the well-organized and influential teachers before the election. However, early in the
 year, with the country facing mounting economic crisis, the Government called for
 renegotiation of the agreement. When the Government failed to implement the sec-
 ond phase of the promised pay hikes in July, the KNUT launched a national strike
 on October 5, which the Government declared illegal. Security forces dispersed
 meetings of striking teachers, arrested many teachers and KNUT officials, and
 closed KNUT offices. The strike ended after 15 days when the Government refused
 to renegotiate. In another major strike action in early August, the 12,000-member
 Kenya Bank Workers Union struck over new taxes imposed on low-interest em-
 ployee loans. The banks dismissed striking workers and gave them an ultimatum
 to reapply for their positions. Most did reapply, but the banks used this as an oppor-
 tunity to downsize; approximately 800 workers were not rehired after the ailed
 strike.
 The Government's response to wildcat strikes is usually severe. On occasion, the
 Government has sent in police to forcibly break up wildcat strikes and arrest par-
 ticipants. Several unions, including municipal workers, held brief strikes for back
 or increased wages. Workers' rights groups continue to raise the general problem
 of the Government's harshness towards labor with the International Labor Organi-
 zation's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association.
 Internationally, COTU is affiliated with both the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many of its
 affiliates are linked to international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities. Both the Trade Disputes Act and the
 charter authorize collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in negotiations between unions and man-
 agement. In 1994 the Government relaxed wage policy guidelines to permit wage
 increases of up to 100 percent and renegotiation of collective agreements. Collective
 bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial Court in order to en-
 sure -adherence to these guidelines.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities generally are awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of export processing zones (EPZ's) was passed
 in 1990. The EPZ authority decided that local labor laws, including the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively would apply in the EPZ's, although it grants many
 exemptions in practice. For example, the Government waived aspects of the law that
 prevent -women from working in industrial activities at night. Labor and some gov-
 ernment officials continued to criticize health and safety conditions in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor, including forced and bonded labor-by children. How-
 ever, under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local authority can require persons to per-
 form community services in an emergency, although this did not occur during the
 year. The ILO Committee of Experts has found that these and other provisions of
 the law contravene ILO Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced labor. There are
 some cases, mostly in rural areas, of children being loaned as workers to pay off
 debts.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Em-
 ployment Act of 1976 makes the employment in industry of children under the age
 
 
 of 16 illegal. The act applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 per-
 cent of the labor force is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the
 terms of the Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce
 the minimum age statute, and the Government is making efforts to eliminate child
 labor, working closely with COTU and the ILO's International Program for the
 Elimination of Child Labor. The problem has received considerable media attention
 during the year.
 Children often work as domestic servants in private homes. Although forced or
 bonded labor is prohibited by law there were some instances in which it occurred
 (see Section 6.c.). There are many instances of children working in the informal sec-
 tor, mostly in family businesses. In commercial agriculture, children usually assist
 parents, who are small shareholders, rather than work as employees in their own
 right. However, deteriorating economic conditions have given rise to more child
 labor in the informal sector, which is difficult to monitor and control, and is a sig-
 nificant problem. Significant percentages of workers on coffee, sugar, and rice plan-
 tations are children. In addition, there has been an increasing number of underage
 girls employed in the sex industry. In view of the high levels of adult unemployment
 and underemployment, the employment of children in the formal industrial wage
 sector in violation of the Employment Act is less common but not unknown.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue-collar work-
 ers in the wage sector has 12 separate scales, varying by location, age, and skill
 level. The lowest minimum wages were $47 (2,697 shillings) per month in urban
 areas and $25 (1,439 shillings) in rural areas. These rates are exclusive of a 15 per-
 cent housing allowance. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The annual 2 percent wage increase had
 a limited impact on worker income. Most workers relied on second jobs, subsistence
 farming, informal sector opportunities, or the extended family for additional sup-
 port.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours, although nighttime employees may be employed for up to
 60 hours per week. Some categories of workers have a shorter workweek. As is the
 case with respect to minimum wage limitations, the act specifically excludes agricul-
 tural workers from its purview. An employee in the nonagricultural sector is enti-
 tled to 1 rest day per week. There are also provisions for 21 days of annual leave
 and sick leave. The law also provides that the total hours worked (i.e., regular time
 plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night workers may not exceed 144 hours;
 the limit is 120 hours for other workers. Workers in some enterprises claimed that
 employers forced them to work extra hours without overtime pay. The Ministry of
 Labor is tasked with enforcing these regulations, and there are few reports of viola-
 tions.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; it was
 amended in 1990 to include agricultural and other workers. The 65 health and safe-
 ty inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Directorate of Occupational Health
 and Safety Services have the authority to inspect factories and work sites. As a re-
 sult of the 1990 amendments, the Directorate's inspectors may now issue notices en-
 joining employers from practices or activities that involve a risk of serious personal
 injuries. Previously, only magistrates were vested with this authority. Such notices
 can be appealed to the Factories Appeals Court, a body of four members, one of
 whom must be a High Court judge. The number of factory inspections increased sig-
 nificantiy in 1993 and subsequently has continued at a high level. A new section
 stipulates that factories that employ at least 20 persons have a health and safety
 committee with representation from workers. However, according to the Govern-
 ment, at year's end only one-quarter of the very largest factories had instituted
 health and safety committees. The vast majority of factories have yet to comply with
 the new provision. Workers are not forced by law to remain in hazardous conditions;
 however, many would be reluctant to remove themselves because of the high unem-
 ployment problem.
