 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a longstanding stable, constitutional democracy with a unicameral
 Legislative Assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every 4 years. Jose
 Maria Figueres of the National Liberation Party won the presidency in the February
 1994 elections, in which approximately 80 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. The
 Government respects constitutional previsions for an indepndent judiciary.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished the military forces. The Ministry of Public Secu-
 rity-which includes specialized units such as the antidrug police-and the Ministry
 of the Presidency share responsibility for law enforcement and national security. In
 1996 the Government combined several police units within the Ministry of Public
 Security, including the Border Guard, the Rural Guard, and the Civil Guard, into
 a single "public force." Public security forces generally observe procedural safe-
 guards established by law and the Constitution.
 The market economy is based primarily on agriculture, light industry, and tour-
 ism. After a 1 percent decline in 1996, economic growth was projected at 1.5-2 per-
 cent. Government fiscal difficulties continued, with the public sector deficit projected
 to amount to 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The Constitution protects
 the right to private property; however, domestic and foreign property owners en-
 counter considerable difficulty gaining adequate, timely compensation for lands ex-
 propriated for national parks and other purposes. The law grants considerable
 rights to squatters who invade uncultivated land, regardiess of who may hold title
 to the property.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. The Government
 generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary pro-
 vide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Nonetheless, the
 judicial system moves very slowly in processing criminal cases, resulting in lengthy
 pretrial .detention for same suspects. Citizens reported 11 instances of-physical or
 verbal abuse by police to the Ombudsman of the Republic. The Government has
 identified domestic violence as a serious problem and sponsored a public awareness
 program to deter such abuse. Abuse of children also remains a problem. Traditional
 patterns of unequal opportunity for women and racial minorities remain, in spite
 of continuing government and media efforts to advocate change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a.Political and Other Extrajudiciul Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The judicial system resolved the 1993 Malcolm case, in which seven judicial police
 officers allegediy beat a presumed street gang member, William Lee Malcolm, who
 died shortly thereafter while in custody. In July a San Jose court found insufficient
 evidence to convict the seven former officers on charges of murder and aggravated
 deprivation of liberty. The same court, however, convicted all seven defendants of
 abuse of authority. Each former officer received a 4-year suspended sentence and
 was barred from public sector employment for 1 to 2 years.
 In September a criminal court found two of three former judicial police officers
 guilty of the 1994 murder of farmer Ciro Monge; the third officer awaited trial at
 year's end. The court sentenced the two men to 12 years in prison and $200,000
 in fines and costs.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits creel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. The authorities generally abide by these prohibi-
 tions. An effective mechanism for lodging and recording complaints of police mis-
 conduct exists. As of August, the Ombudsman's office had received 122 reports of
 police abuse of authority or misconduct. The Ombudsman's office investigates com-
 plaints and, where appropriate, initiates suits against officials. In June a man ac-
 cused judicial police officers of beating and illegally detaining him while the officers
 were pursuing alleged bank robbers. At year's end, the authorities were investigat-
 ing the case.
 A large percentage of police personnel owe their appointments to political patron-
 age. The Figueres administration continued implementation of the 1994 Police Code
 designed to depoliticize and professionalize the police force. The Government's long-
 term plan is to establish permanent, professional cadres, eventually resulting in a
 nonpelitically appointed career force. The basic course for new police recruits in-
 cludes training using a human rights manual developed by the Ministry of Public
 Security.
 
 
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment. Prisoners are separated by gender
 and by level of security, minimum, medium, and maximum. There are separate ju-
 venile detention centers. illegal narcotics are readily available in the prisons, and
 drug use is common. While guards rarely abuse prisoners physically, there are cred-
 ible reports that prisoners are sometimes subjected to other forms of abuse such as
 extortion. The Prison Rights Ombudsman investigates complaints and refers serious
 cases of ahuse to the Public Prosecutor.
 Penitentiary overcrowding remained a problem, with the prison population about
 50 percent above planned capacity. The Government is expanding five prisons to ad-
 dress this problem. In March 1996, the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber is-
 sued an order to the San Sebastianprison in San Jose, giving the institution 1 year
 to achieve minimally acceptable conditions or the prisoners. As of Auguat, that pris-
 on was still 121 percent above capacity, a slight decline reflecting the transfer of
 many long-term prisoners to other institutions.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally respects these prohi-
 bitions.
 The law requires issuance of judicial warrants before making arrests. The Con-
 stitution entitles a detainee to a judicial determination of the legality of the deten-
 tion during arraignment before a court officer within 24 hours of arrest. The au-
 thorities generally respect these rights.
 The law provides for the right to release on bail, and the authorities observe it
 in practice. Generally, the authorities do not hold detainees incommunicado. With
 judicial authorization, the authorities may hold suspects for 48 hours after arrest
 or, under special circumstances, for up to 10 days.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government respects this prvision in practice. The Constitu-
 tion provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously
 enforces this right.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 The Legislative Assembly elects the 22 Supreme Court magistrates to 8-year terms,
 subject to automatic renewal unless the Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds
 majority. Accused persons may select attorneys to represent them, and the law pro-
 vides for access to counsel at state expense for the indigent.
 Persons accused of serious offenses and held without bail, however, sometimes re-
 main in pretrial custody for long periods. Lengthy legal procedures, numerous ap-
 peals, and large numbers of detainees cause delays and case backlogs. There were
 933 accused persons, representing 19 percent of the prison population, jailed await-
 ingtrial as of August.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 ConsTition prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. The law re-
 quires judicial warrants to search private homes, Judges may approve use of wire-
 taps in limited circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.
 The law grants considerable rights to squatters who invade uncultivated land, re-
 gardess of who may hold title to the property. Landowners in Pavones, Golfito, have
 a 10-year history of conflict with squatters, which includes frequent violent inva-
 sions. In November squatter Alvare Aguilar and Max Dalton, a U.S. citizen land-
 owner, were killed during a confrontation with squatters who had invaded Dalton's
 property. Although the authorities charged a suspect in the case, he remains free
 at the judge's discretion. President Figueres appointed First Vice President Rodrigo
 Oreamuno to head a cabinet-level commission to investigate the case.
 Municipal officials in Pavones, including the municipal president, encouraged
 squatter invasions of private property. In October a municia order allowed squat-
 ters to enter Dalton's property. After the November confrontation during which
 Aguilar and Dalton were shot and killed, the municipal council revoked the order,
 saying that it had been improperly issued. There is evidence of complicity between
 the squatters and the authorities, which apparently gave tacit approval to the type
 of violent tactics that resulted in these deaths. The initial police investigation into
 these shooting deaths was not thorough and raised questions about the integrity of
 law enforcement in the Golfito region.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 an Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 an  the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 
 
 ent press, a generally effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political sys-
 tem combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic free-
 dom.
 There are 9 major privately owned newspapers, several periodicals, 6 privately
 owned television stations, and over 70 privately owned radio stations, all of which
 pursue independent editorial policies. While the media generally criticize the Gov-
 ernment freely, there were unconfirmed allegations that the Government withheld
 advertising from some publications i order to influence or limit reporting. In 1996
 t provitdespesn
 the Legislative Assembly passed a "right of response" law tha  provide  persons
 criticized in the media with an opportunity to reply with equal attention and at
 euallenhWhile the print andelectronicmediaontinuedtocriticize public fig-
 ures, the a   as rven difficult for media managers to administer. On occasion,
 some media outlets delayed printing responses because submissions were not clearly
 identified as replies to previously published items. In one case, a judge temporarily
 impounded the assets of the daily newspaper Diario Extra because the newspaper
 allegedly did not publish a response within the stipulated time frame.
 The Office of Control of Public Spectacles rates films and has the authority to re-
 strict or prohibit their showing;, it has similar powers over television programs and
 stage plays. Nonetheless, foreign and particularly American films spanning the U.S.
 rating system are offered to the public. A tribunal reviews appeals of the office's ac-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While the Constitution establishes
 Roman Catholicism as the state religion, people of all denominations freely practice
 their religion without government interference. Religious education teachers, includ-
 ing those in public schools, must be certified by the Roman Catholic episcopal con-
 ference. Foreign missionaries and clergy of all denominations work and proselytize
 freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. There are no restrictions on travel within the country, on
 emigration, or the right of return.
 There is a long tradition of providing refuge to people from other Latin American
 countries. In July the Government declined to grant asylum to 16 indigenous
 Hondurans who had peacefully occupied the Costa Rican embassy in Tegucigalpa,
 saying that the Hondurans had not demonstrated credible fears of persecution. The
 Government granted asylum to Venezuelan Luis Escobar Ugaz. Ugaz, a member of
 the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement, entered Costa Rica in June 1996, after
 seeking refuge in the Costa Rican embassy in Caracas.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment makes a distinction between political asylum and refugee status; the issue of
 the provision of first asylum did not arise. The Constitution specifically prohibits re-
 patriation of anyone subject to potential persecution, and there were no reports of
 forced expulsion of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The authori-
 ties regularly repatriated undocumented Nicaraguans, most of whom entered the
 country primarily for economic reasons.
 Allegations of abuse by Border Police periodically arise. Although instances of
 physical abuse appear to have declined, there were credible reports of extortion of
 migrants by border officials. In May President Figueres signed an accord with Nica-
 raguan President Miguel Aleman to normalize the status of some of the approxi-
 mately 400,000 Nicaraguans residing illegally in Costs Rica. The agreement permits
 Nicaraguans to obtain residency with a special worker passport and a valid employ-
 ment contract.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 eacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through free and fair elections
 geld on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot every 4 years. The inde-
 pendent Supreme Electoral Tribunal ensures the integrity of elections, and the au-
 thorities and citizens respect election results. The Constitution bars the President
 from seeking reelection, and Assembly members may seek reelection only after at
 least one term out of office. In the 1994 elections, President Figueres' National Lib-
 eration Party (PLN) gained a plurality in the Legislative Assembly, winning 28 of
 57 seats. The Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) won 25 seats, the Democratic
 
 
 478
 Force won 2 seats, and 2 provincial parties each garnered 1 seat. After an
 intraparty dispute, one of the Democratic Force legislators formed a new party in
 1966. As a result, the new party-the New Democratic Party-has one seat.
 Women encounter no legal impediments to their participation in politics. While
 they are underrepresenein eadership positions of the Government and political
 parties, this situation has begun to change. The Minister of Public Security, eight
 legilative assembly deputies, and five diretors of autonomous institutions are
 women. In February the Legislative Assembly selected assembly Deputy Sandra
 Piszk as Ombudsman, a key autonomous post created in 1993 to protect the rights
 and interests of citizens in their dealings with the Government. In May the Su-
 preme Court appointed Linette Sabrio as the Director General of the judicial inves-
 tigative organization. The opposition PUSC mandates that a minimum of 40 percent
 of posts in party councils be occupied by women. The ruling PLN adopted this same
 40 percent goal in May. In October the PUSC selected two women as its nominees
 for first and second vice president, marking the first time that a major political
 party nominated women for both vie p residencies. The PLN also chose two women
 as its vice presidential candidates for the February 1998 national elections.
 Indigenous people may participate freely in o   an  government. In practice,
 they have not played significant roles in these areas, except on issues directly affect-
 ing their welfare, largely because of their relatively small numbers and physical iso-
 lation. One of 57 members of the National Assembly identifies himself as part indig-
 enous. The country's 30,000 blacks, largely resident on the Caribbean coast, enjoy
 full rights of citizenship, including the protection of laws against racial discrimina-
 tion. The Legislative Assembly includes one black member; one vice minister is
 black.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Various human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigat-
 ing and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are
 cooperative and responsive to their views. The Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica monitor and report on
 human rights.
 Several international organizations concerned with human rights, including the
 Inter-American Institute for Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights, are located in San Jose.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution pronounces all persons equal before the law, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-The Government has identified domestic violence against women and
 children as a serious societal problem. The authorities have incorporated training
 on handling domestic violence cases in the basic training course for new police per-
 sonnel. The Law Against Domestic Violence classifies certain acts of domestic vio-
 lence as crimes and mandates their prosecution. An old law permits a judge to par-
 don a man accused of statutory rape if the perpetrator intends to marry the victim,
 she and her family acquiesce, and the National Institute for Children does not ob-
 ject. This law has not been applied in recent years, and it is expected to be over-
 turned by pending legislation. The domestic violence law requires public hospitals
 to report cases of female victims of domestic violence. It also denies the perpetrator
 possession of the family home in favor of the victim. Television coverage of this issue
 has increased in news reporting, public service announcements, and feature pro-
 grams. Reports of violence against women have increased, likely reflecting a greater
 willingness of victims to report abuses rather than an actual increase in instances
 of violence against women. The law against sexual harassment in the work place
 and educational institutions seeks to prevent and punish sexual harassment in
 those environments.
 Women constitute 49.5 percent of the population. The 1990 Law for the Promotion
 of the Social Equality of Women not only prohibits discrimination against women
 but obligates the Government to promote political, economic, social, and cultural
 Vquality. In March 1996, the Government's National Center for the Development of
 omen and the Family presented its 3-year National Plan for Equality of Oppor-
 tunity between Women and Men. The plan is based in great measure on the Plat-
 form for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.
 According to the 1995 census, women represent 30 percent of the labor force. Most
 women work in he services sector, with others working in industry and agriculture.
 
 
 479
 While laws require that women and men receive equal pay for equal work, average
 salaries for women remain somewhat below those of male counterparts. According
 to United Nations Development Program, women occupy 21 percent of executive and
 management positions and nearly 45 percent of professional and technical positions.
 The average life expectancy for women increased by 12 years since the early 1970's
 to 7Jears, hiher than the 72-year average for men.thh
 e Government is committed to children's rights and welfare through
 well-funded systems of public education and medical care.The Government spens
 over 5 percent of GDP on medical care. In June the Legislative Assembly passed
 a constitutional amendment increasing spending on education from 4 percent to 6
 percent of GDP. The country has a high rate of literacy (95 percent) and a low rate
 of infant mortality (13 persons per 1,000). The law requires 6 years of primary and
 3 years of secondary education for all children. There is no difference in the treat-
 ment of girls and boys in education or in health care services. The autonomous Na-
 tional Institute for Children (PANI) oversees implementation of the Government's
 programs for children. In December 1996, the Assembly passed a law strengthening
 PANI's role in rotecting and promoting the rights of children, in accordance with
 the precepts of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 In recent years, the PANI has increased public awareness of crimes against chil-
 dren. In 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Institute
 intervened in 3,161 cases of abandonment, 1,030 cases of physical abuse, 1,195 cases
 of sexual abuse, and 98 cases of psychological abuse of children. Abuses appear to
 be more prevalent among impoverished, less-educated families. Traditional attitudes
 and the inclination to treat such crimes as misdemeanors sometimes hamper legal
 proceedings against those who commit crimes against children.
 In February 1996, the PANT announced a comprehensive plan to improve the con-
 ditions of the poorest children. According to Institute estimates, 17 percent of chil-
 dren between the ages of 5 and 17 are involved in income-producing activities, and
 25,000 children work rather than attend school. The Government, police sources,
 and representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund acknowledge that child
 prostitution is a growing problem. Although no official statistics exist, the PAI has
 identified street children in the urban areas of San Jose, Limon, and Puntarenas
 as being at the greatest risk. The PANI estimates that as many as 3,000 children
 in metropolitan San Jose are involved in prostitution. In Aprl the Institute
 launched a campaign against child prostitution in cooperation with police, airport
 immigration authorities, and hotel operators.
 People With Disabilities.-The Equal Opportunity for Persons with Disabilities
 Law prohibits discrimination, provides for health care services, and mandates provi-
 sion of access to buildings for persons with disabilities. This law is not widely en-
 forced and many buildings remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Nonethe-
 less, a number of public and private institutions have made individual efforts to im-
 prove access. In March the Ministry of Public Education announced that students
 with disabilities may enroll in the school of their choice without impediment. The
 PANT and the Ministry published specific classroom guidelines for assisting children
 with hearing loss, motor difficulties, attention deficit, and mental retardation.
 Indigenous People.-The population of about 3.3 million includes nearly 29,000 in-
 digenous people among 8 ethnic groups. Most live in traditional communities on 22
 reserves which, because of their remote location, often lack access to schools, health
 care, electricity, and potable water. The Government, through the National Indige-
 nous Commission, completed distribution of identification cards to facilitate access
 to public medical facilities. The Government also built a medical clinic and several
 community health centers in indigenous areas. The Ombudsman has established an
 office to investigate violations of the rights of indigenous people.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association. The law specifies the right of workers to join unions
 of their choosing without prior authorization, although barriers exist in practice.
 About 15 percent of the work force is unionized, almost entirely in the public sector.
 Unions operate independently of government control.
 Some trade union leaders contend that "solidarity" associations, in which employ-
 ers provide access to credit unions and savings plans in return for ageement to
 avoidt strikes and other types of confrontation, infringe upon the right of association.
 After the International obor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion ruled that solidarity associations and their involvement in trade union activi-
 ties violated freedom of association, the Government amended the Labor Code in
 1993. The following year, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) ruled that these and
 other planned changes fostered greater freedom of association. In 1995 the COE en-
 couraged the Government to approve legislation to allow unions to administer com-
 
 
 pensation funds for dismissed workers and to repeal labor code provisions restrict-
 ing the right to strike in certain nonessential public, agricultural, and forestry sec-
 tors. This recommendation remained under government consideration at years end.
 There are no restrictions on the right of private sector workers to strike, but very
 few workers in this sector belong to unions. Accordingly, private sector strikes rare-
 ly occur. The Constitution and Labor Code restrict the right of public sector workers
 to strike. In May workers from the state-owned electric and telecommunications
 utility staged a brief work stoppage to call attention to proposals for restructuring
 the utility. Although workers demonstrated in several cities, the protests failed to
 attract significant worker support. Utility operations were not disrupted and the
 work stoppage concluded peacefully.
 Unions may form federations and confederations and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right to organize. Specific provisions of the 1993 labor code reforms provide protec-
 tion from dismissal for union organizers and members during union formation. The
 revised provisions require employers found guilty of discrimination to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Public sector workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the Public
 Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable in relations between the
 Government and its employees. Private sector unions have the legal right to engage
 in collective bargaining.
 All labor regulations apply fully to the country's nine export processing zones
 (EPZ's). The Labor Ministry oversees labor regulations within the EPZ's, but ac-
 knowledged that it has only 1 inspector for every 30,000 workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory- labor, and there were no known instances of such practices. Laws
 prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this pro-
 hibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution provides special employment protection for women and children and estab-
 lishes the minimum working age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for
 workers under the age of 15. Laws prohibit forced and bonded labor by children,
 and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. Children between 15 and
 18 years of age can work a maximum of 7 hours daily and 42 hours weekly, while
 children between the ages of 12 and 15 can work a maximum of 5 hours daily and
 30 hours weekly. The PANI, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, generally en-
 forces these regulations in the formal sector. Due to limited government resources
 for enforcement, some children work on the fringes of the formal economy in excess
 of these limits. After two adolescents died from chemical poisoning while working
 on banana plantations in 1993, the authorities prohibited employment of youths
 under the age of 18 in the banana industry. Nonetheless, child labor remains an
 integral part of the large informal economy. According to a PANI survey, about
 152,000 children worked during 1995, of whom nearly 93,000 had prior PANI ap-
 proval.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides for a minimum
 wage. A National Wage Council, composed of three members each from government,
 business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. Monthly
 minimum wages, last adjusted in July for the private sector, range from $128
 (30,179 colones) for domestic employees to $622 (146,274 colones) for some profes-
 sionals. Public sector negotiations, based on private sector minimum wages, nor-
 mally follow the settlement of private sector negotiations. The Ministry of Labor ef-
 fectively enforces minimum wages in the San Jose area, but less effectively in rural
 areas. Especially at the lower end of the wage scale, the minimum wage is insuffi-
 cient to provide a worker and family a decent standard of living.
 The Constitution sets workday hours, overtime remuneration, days of rest, and
 annual vacation rights. Although often circumvented in practice, it also requires
 compensation for discharge without due cause. Generally, workers may work a max-
 imum of 8 hours during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals of 48 and 36
 hours, respectively. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 per-
 cent of regular wages for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural work-
 ers do not receive ovrert e   h  r, if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours. Little evidence exists that employers coerce employees to perform such over-
 time.
 For several years, the ILO COE asked the Government to enact provisions regard-
 ing accident prevention for seafarers, as required by ILO Convention 134 on the
 "Prevention of Accidents (Seafarers)." The COE had not yet received the requested
 regulations at year's end.
 
 
 481
 A 1967 law on health and safety in the workplace requires industrial, agricul-
 tural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a joint manage-
 ment-labor committee on workplace conditions and allows the Government to in-
 spect workplaces and to fine employers for violations. Most firms subject to the law
 establish such committees but either do not use the committees or neglect to turn
 them into effective instruments for improving workplace conditions. While workers
 have the right to leave work if conditions become dangerous, workers who do so may
 find their jobs in jeopardy unless they file written complaints with the Labor Min-
 istry. Due partly to budgetary constraints, the Ministry has not fielded enough labor
 inspectors to ensure consistent maintenance of minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation, especially outside San Jose.
