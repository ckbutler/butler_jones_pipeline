 FIJI
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy, inherited when the country gained inde-
 pendence from Great Britain in 1970, was interrupted in 1987 with the installation
 of a military regime following two bloodless coups. Fiji returned to elected govern-
 ment in 1992. That government fell in November 1993 over failure to pass a udget
 for 1994. A new general election is scheduled for February 1994.
 Ethnicity plays a major role in Fiji's politics, economy, and society. Fiji's multira-
 cial society is about evenly divided between indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians.
 Indo-Fijians dominate the economy and professions and are well represented in the
 lower and middle levels of the public service, while ethnic Fijians make up the bulk
 of the nation's military forces and control the political structures.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and a separate police force
 report to and are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs and, ultimately,
 the President. In 1990 the Government also established the Fiji Intelligence Service,
 with limited powers to search people and property, tap telephones, and open mail.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for almost
 half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The economy has recovered from the
 effects of a severe decline following the 1987 coups. The Government is promoting
 light manufacturing for export, notably the garment industry, to diversify the econ-
 omy and lessen its dependence on sugar and tourism.
 The principal human rights probem in 1993 remained the constitutionally im-
 posed and ethnically basedpolitical discrimination. Labor rights disputes stemming
 from 1991 legislation greatly ameliorated during the year. Other human rights prob-
 lems include inhibitions on freedom of the press, continued delays in bringing crimi-
 nal and civil cases to trial, and violence and discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no deaths of persons in
 official custody from other than natural causes nor deaths by police or military ap-
 plication of force in Fiji in 1993. There were no reports of political killings by the
 Government or any political group.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; t e offending officers have been pun-
 ished in some instances, although punishments have been ight. The Internal Affairs
 Unit continues to expedite the investigation of such cases and to ensure that any
 complaints against the police are properly investigated. During 1992, 27 officers
 were charged with a variety of offenses. At year's end, the 15 cases which had been
 dealt with resulted in 4 convictions; 12 cases were pending. Internal police inves-
 tigation statistics from 1993 were not available for inclusion in this report. Corporal
 punishment is permitted by law as a penalty for criminal acts; strokes of the cane
 are administered under medical supervision, although this provision is rarely in-
 voked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In Fiji the Law of Arrest and Detention
 broadly follows the British model. Generally, a person may be arrested only if there
 is a reasonable belief that a breach of the criminal law has been or is about to be
 committed. Arrested persons must be brought before a court without "undue delay."
 This is taken to mean within 24 hours, with 48 hours as the exception (such as
 when an arrest is made over the weekend). Rules governing detention are designed
 to ensure fair questioning of suspects. Defendants have the right to a judicial review
 of the grounds for arrest; in urgent cases, application may be made to a judge at
 any time, whether he is sitting or not. Incommunicado and arbitrary detention are
 illegal, and none occurred in 1993.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial structure was reorganized under the
 1990 Constitution, but remains similar to the British system. The principal courts
 in Fiji are the Magistrate Courts, High Court, and the Court of Appeal. The 1990
 Constitution also provided for a Supreme Court as the court of final appeal, but to
 date it has not been established. The Court of Appeal is slowly reducing the enor-
 mous backlog of cases caused by the Government's failure to appoint a president for
 
 
 632
 the court until December 1991 and the court's consequent inability to convene before
 that time.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate Courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
 The judiciary is independent under the 1990 Constitution and in practice. There
 have been no credible reports in 1993 that a court was influenced by the executive
 - except by legal arguments in court. An example of the courts' independence was
 the decision in the Jim Ah Koy case (see Section 5.a.), in which the government lost
 a hotly debated ethnic registration decision.
 Rights of due process are similar to those found under English common law. The
 right to public trial is guaranteed, and defendants have the right to counsel. Trials
 in the High Court provide for the presence of assessors (akin to a jury); cases in
 the Magistrate Court do not. In litigation involving lesser complaints, a public legal
 advisor assists indigents in domestic or family law cases. The right of appeal exists
 but is hampered by continuing delays in the appeals process. Normal bail proce-
 dures mean that most defendants do not experience any pretrial detention.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, privacy of the home is respected. However, the Fiji Intelligence Service has
 powers to search people and property, open mail, and tap telephones within specific
 operational guide ines outlined in the government decree which created it. There is
 no evidence that these powers are being abused. Surveillance of persons believed to
 represent a security threat is carried out to some degree. Some political opponents
 of the Government believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but concrete
 evidence is lacking.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. Politi-
 cal figures and private citizens can and do speak out against the Government. Al.
 though the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit any actions which are likely
 to incite racial antagonism, no arrests for making any kind of public statement were
 reported or believed to have occurred in 1993.
 The Government does have broad discretionary powers to impose restrictions on
 press freedom, and it has sometimes done so. For example, in 1993 the Government
 anned television camera coverage of the controversial Kermode Commission of In-
 quiry into the wrongful arrest suit and out-of-court settlement in the so-called Ste-
 phens Affair. The investigation led to the resignation of the Attorney General and
 implicated the Prime Minister and his close advisors. The Government also tempo-
 rarily banned television from using actual footage of parliamentary proceedings.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA, all newspapers which
 are sold and published in Fiji must be registered with the Government before they
 can begin publishing. The PCA gives the Minister of Information sole discretionary
 power to order a newspaper to publish a "correcting statement" if, in his opinion,
 a false or distorted article has been published. Should the newspaper refuse to pub-
 lish the Minister's correction, it can be taken to court and, if found guilty, fined
 $700 (individual persons convicted under the Act may be fined $150 and/or impris-
 oned for 6 months). The PCA allows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes
 "malicious" material. This includes any false news which could create or foster pub-
 lic alarm or result in the "detriment of the public."
 Privately owned broadcast and print media operate without prior censorship but
 with considerable self-censorship. Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of
 the Government but rarely do investigative reporting. Statements about the political
 situation by opposition figures and foreign governments are widely reported. The
 letters columns of the two daily newspapers also frequently carry political state-
 ments from members of the deposed government and other persons and from groups
 which are highly critical of the Government, its programs, and the Constitution.
 Criticism-albeit muted-of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is begin-
 ning to appear. However, the Government still views comments about individual
 chiefs with disfavor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an affil-
 iate of the regional Pacific Islands News Association (PINA), which held its 1993
 convention in Fiji for the first time since the 1987 coups. Both FIMA and PINA are
 pressing for better training and establishment of codes of ethics for journalists. Con-
 cerned over possible moves by the Government to set up a tribunal for hearing pub-
 
 
 633
 lic complaints against the media, FIMA is working toward a self-regulatory press
 and media council instead.
 The advent of television has raised the specter of censorship, openly advocated by
 the head of the powerful Methodist church in Fiji and others. Moves to replace the
 temporary television service with a permanent arrangement have triggered a seri-
 ous look at television content regulation, heretofore nonexistent.
 While academic freedom is respected, the Government has effectively deterred
 university employees from participation in Fijian domestic politics. Since 1991 staff
 members of the University of the South Pacific must take leave if they run for pub-
 lic office and must resign from their posts if elected. Senior staff may not hold office
 in political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Assembly for political purposes
 is allowed but subject to restriction in the interest of public order. Public gatherings
 require permission from the Government's district officers, who may obtain prior as-
 sessment and advice from the police on the anticipated crowd size and the ability
 of the police to ensure public safety. Permits for large outdoor political meetings or
 demonstrations are not always granted.
 There was no government interference with political activities during the October
 1993 municipal elections. Permits were routinely issued for rallies organized by po-
 litical parties, religious groups, and groups opposed to the Government. All opposi-
 tion party headquarters remain open. Political organizations are allowed to operate
 and issue public statements. They did so repeatedly and openly throughout 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and honored in practice. The preamble to the Constitution declares the importance
 of Christianity to the Fijian people but guarantees protection for all religions. As
 p art of the ongoing constitutional review process, several parliamentarians and
 Methodist church leaders have called for Fiji's status as a "Christian nation" to be
 enshrined in the body of the Constitution.
 No significant restrictions affect foreign clergy and missionary activity or other
 typical activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country
 or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts do not hesitate
 to order redress where this is warranted. Fijian citizens are free to emigrate. Ac-
 cording to the best available estimates, over 35,000 have done so since May 1987.
 Most of the emigrants are Indo-Fijians, many of them professionals, but some eth-
 nic Fijians and others also have left. Several thousand have claimed refugee status,
 especially when applying for admission to Canada and after arrival in the United
 States as tourists, but neither the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees nor any
 government has recognized those claims. In 1992 and 1993, as the economic down-
 turn in Australia and New Zealand continued and Fiji moved toward restoration of
 accountable government, several hundred well-educated Indo-Fijians who had emi-
 grated in the postcoup period returned to Fiji. There are no refugees in Fiji, and
 no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government is abridged by the provision of
 the 1990 Constitution ensuring political dominance by ethnic Fijians, primarily
 through race-based voting rolls and representation in Parliament. Moreover, the
 Constitution was promulgated by a nonelected interim government and has not been
 approved by a national referendum.
 The Constitution guarantees ethnic Fijians dominance of the Government by pro-
 viding them with 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower house of Parliament. Indo-
 Fijians are accorded 27 seats, Rotumans (culturally distinct Polynesians) 1, and all
 other races 5. In the Senate (an appointed body with essentially review powers and
 the right to veto legislation), ethnic Fijians hold 24 of the 34 seats, Rotumans 1,
 and the other groups 9. Other constitutional features designed to ensure ethnic
 Fijian dominance include a requirement that the Prime Minister be an ethnic Fijian
 and selection procedures which virtually ensure that the President will also be an
 ethnic Fijian.
 The Constitution also incorporates a bill of rights, providing for freedom of speech,
 assembly, religion, and other internationally accepted rights and freedoms. The sec-
 tion setting forth these rights provides that they may not be altered by Parliament
 except with the approval of two-thirds of the lower house. However, elsewhere in
 the Constitution, Parliament is also given the authority to pass special acts to deal
 with certain specified emergency situations, notwithstanding human rights guaran-
 tees found in other sections of that document. The Attorney General's office has
 
 
 634
 taken the view that any legislation introduced under the emergency powers provi-
 sion would require two-thirds approval by the lower house, but critics of the Con-
 stitution maintain that only a simple majority would be needed. Critics claim that
 indigenous Fijians in the lower house thus would be able, solely on the strength of
 their own numbers, to abrogate constitutional human rights protection.
 The President is selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), a traditional
 Fjian leadership body. He appoints the Fijian members of the Senate on the advice
 of the CCC and the provincial councils, and on his own judgment with regard to
 the nine members of other races. He appoints the one Rotuman Senator on the ad-
 vice of the Rotuman Council. The Prime Minister, who along with the Cabinet holds
 most of the executive authority, is chosen by the President from among the Fijian
 members of the lower house on the basis of his ability to command majority support
 within that body.
 Elections are held by secret ballot, with voting only by communal constituencies.
 The 1990 Constitution calls for elections every 6 years, but the Government may
 call an election at any time. The Constitution (Article 161) provides for a formal re-
 view of its provisions within 7 years of its promulgation (1997) and every 10 years
 thereafter.
 In 1991 Major General Sitiveni Rabuka, the officer who led the 1987 coups, re-
 signed as commander of the Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and entered the free and
 fair May 1992 elections (in whih nearly 80 percent of Fiji's registered voters-both
 ethnic Fins and Indo-Fijians-participated). He was overwhelmingly elected to
 Parliament by his local constituency. The President selected him to be Prime Min-
 ister afer Rabuka demonstrated that he commanded majority support in the House
 of Representatives. When his 1994 budget was rejected by Parliament in November
 1993 Rabuka asked the Acting President to dissolve that body in accordance with
 the Constitution. Another general election is slated for February 1994. The 1993
 municipal elections were also free and fair. Two of Fiji's major parties are predomi-
 nantly ndo-Fiian. These parties, the National Federation Party (NFP) and the Fiji
 Labour Party (FLP), have pledged to continue their opposition of the 1990 Constitu-
 tion in the Parliament.
 The mandated constitutional review, expected to take until 1997 to complete, got
 under way in 1992 with the creation of an expanded subcabinet committee led by
 Deputy Prime Minister Bole. The committee includes representatives of the opposi-
 tion NFP. It formulated terms of reference, adopted by Parliament in September,
 for an independent review commission, including impartial foreign advisors. The
 FLP has refused to participate in the subeabinet committee, insisting on rapid con-
 vening of the promised parliamentary select committee whose proceedings would be
 more open and accountable to the Parliament. The FLP walked out of Parliament
 in June in protest, inter alia, of government footdragging in the review process, say-
 ing creation of the parliamentary select committee could bring them back. The FLP
 returned to the September parliamentary session to participate in the debate over
 the motion setting terms of reference for the parliamentary constitutional review
 commission.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups in Fiji which focus solely on human rights matters, but
 the women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political groups are
 involved in promoting a number of human rights causes. There are also several
 small foreign-based organizations which concentrate on human rights causes in Fiji.
 These include the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with offices in New Zealand and
 Australia) and two United Kingdom-based groups, the International Fiji Movement
 and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 The Government strongly opposes what it considers external interference in its
 domestic affairs and has invoked this principle in the past to inhibit certain inves-
 tigations of the political and human rights situation by external organizations. How-
 ever, in 1993 foreign representatives were allowed to attend both the NFP Annual
 General Meeting (July) and the Fiji Law Society Convention (August) where they
 roundly criticized the 1990 Constitution. Their opinions were fully and prominently
 covered in the press.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the new Constitution also provides specific affirmative action
 provisions to improve the conditions of those disadvantaged as a result of race, sex,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed, the Government practices
 sexual discrimination in the recognition of spousal and offspring rights. For exam-
 
 
 635
 ple, spouses of Fiji citizen women are not automatically granted residence, whereas
 spouses of Fiji citizen males are. Offspring of female ethnic Fijians married to
 nonethnic Fijians are not entitled to registry in the document governing who shares
 in income from communal ownership of native lands and who-has the right to vote
 as an ethnic Fijian and hold ethnic Fijian designated seats in Parliament. Men,
 however, pass on ethnic Fijian status to their offspring regardless of the wife's eth-
 nic background. In a high-profile 1992 court challenge to the registration restric-
 tions, the son of a Chinese father and ethnic Fijian mother won his appeal to be
 registered as an ethnic Fijian. The long-term effects of the decision on registration
 restrictions and thus a woman's right to pass on her ethnic status were not clear
 by year's end.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although some women rise to high places in the public service, pol-
 itics, and business. Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly
 system. The former Prime Minister's wife is, in her own right, Fiji's second highest
 ranking traditional chief. In general, women in the Fijian community are more like-
 ly to rise to prominence in their own right than are women in the Indian commu-
 nity. Womenhave full rights of propertyownership and inheritance, and a number
 have become successful entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a
 discrepancy that is especially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers,
 most of whom are female, are subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower
 than that in other sectors.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious treatment of rape in the courts. The crime tends to draw widely varying but
 usually short prison sentences (a few years). Within the same month, one case in-
 volving a 16-year-old victim resulted in a 6-year sentence and three strokes of the
 cane (allowed by law), while another convicted rapist was merely fined the equiva-
 lent of $200 and put on probation.
 Domestic violence is also a problem in Fiji and is a second major focus of the
 women's movement. The authorities are generally reluctant to intervene in cases of
 domestic violence unless it is necessary to save the woman's life. Few cases result
 in prosecution, as the victim generally does not press charges. The Government has
 not been active in dealing with domestic violence.
 Suva, the capital, and the regional center of Ba have privately funded women's
 crisis centers which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, do-
 mestic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is, over-
 all, a growing awareness of women's issues, with Fiji playing host to several wom-
 en's rights' conferences and workshops during the year.
 Children.-Changes centered around the undermining of the traditional village
 and extended family based society-and great improvements in record keeping-
 have revealed a major problem of child abuse in Fiji. Reported cases of abuse or ne-
 glect have jumped from 365 in 1990 to 619 by August of 1993. The Fijian legal sys-
 tem is inadequate to protect the rights of children with children's evidence being
 inadmissible unless corroborated by an adult. The G overnment created a child wel-
 fare committee this year to address these problems, but it is likely to remain reluc-
 tant to become involved in family matters.
 Children have not had an exalted place in Fiji, particularly in ethnic Fijian fami-
 lies. Children eat only after first fathers and then mothers have eaten their fill.
 Education is not mandatory in Fiji; most primary and secondary schools are man-
 aged and funded by the local community, socialorganizations, or church groups.
 Currently, the Government provides only some 5 percent of the schools--although
 it does support the salaries of the majority of teachers even in private schools.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of the 1987 military
 coups was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian eople and to
 protect their traditional wa  of life and communal control of land. o this end
 number of measures have been taken that favor the Fijian community over the
 other ethnic groups. The most obvious are the apportionment of seats in Parliament
 to guarantee a preponderance of ethnic Fijians and constitutional pro\v:sions ensur-
 ing selection of an ethnic Fijian President and Prime Minister. The Government is
 also committed to raising the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans in the pub-
 lic service to 50 percent or more at all levels. This is reflected in current promotion
 and hiringpolicies in the public service favorind ethnic Fijians. It has resulted in
 some Indo-Fijians complaining of a        f   whereby, despite their experience
 and higher educational ahievements, they are not promoted beyond middle man-
 agement.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue in Fiji. About 83 percent of the land
 is held communally by in igenous Fijians. Most cash crpfarmers are Indo-Fijians,
 who lease their land from the Fijian landowners through the Native Lands Trust
 
 
 636
 Board. The present land ownership arrangements were instituted by the British to
 protect the interests of the indigenous Fijians. Freehold land title is not an indige-
 nous concept; lands owned currently by the State (8 percent) and by individuals (9
 percent) were transferred from customary owners during the colonial period. Many
 Indo-Fijians, particularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land tenure
 discriminates against them. Between 1997 and 2000, the majority of the current
 leases will expire. A review of the current land tenure/leasing arrangements is
 under way.
 Indo-Fiians are subject to occasional harassment and crime based on race, which
 is compounded by inadequate police protection. There have been no credible allega-
 tions of government involvement in such incidents, and the police have investigated
 and, where possible, arrested lawbreakers.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no legal discrimination against physically dis-
 abled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state services in Fiji.
 Limited special education facilities are provided in the capital. The Fiji Disabled
 People's Association, a small voluntary organization based in Suva, is pushing for
 better health care and special education for the disabled. There are no mandated
 provisions of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers' rights to form and join unions, elect their
 own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters and determine their
 own policies are protected by law and observed in practice. however, the law per-
 mits restrictions to be applied on government employees in the interests of defense,
 public safety, public order, public morality, or public health, and to protect the
 rights and freedoms of other persons. About 19 percent of the labor force is union-
 ized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only national labor federation is the Fii Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was
 closely associated with the opposition FLP until mid-1992. The FTUC is free to as-
 sociate internationally and does so. The labor movement is led largely by Indo-
 Fijians. Persons with close ties to the Government have started rival unions pri-
 marily for ethnic Fijians; these unions are more amenable to political cooperation
 with the Government.
 Following several years in which labor-government relations were marred by
 confrontational tactics, the 1992 return to elected government marked the beginning
 of a more cooperative relationship.
 In November 1991, the interim government had created considerable antagonism
 when it passed, as part of its economic package, certain labor "reforms' (Decrees 42,
 43, and 44) which unilaterally altered the role of the labor unions and regulated in.
 ternal union matters. The Fiji trade unions rejected the decrees and sought support
 from the international labor movement to convince the Government to rescind the
 decrees. The Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) in November 1992 recommended specific changes to the Fijian .re-
 forms" to restore the rights Fijian workers and their unions had enjoyed previously.
 The Rabuka Government undertook to find ways to reestablish a dialog with the
 unions. In September 1992, the new Minister of Labour and Industrial Relations
 took concrete steps to address the unions' concerns, including formal recognition of
 the FTUC and a public pledge to review the interim Government's "reforms" and
 a further pledge to eliminate those aspects of the decrees considered objectionable
 by labor.
 In December 1992, the automatic dues checkoff system through which nearly all
 unions received their operating funds was reinstated (satisfying a pressing demand
 of the FTC). In July 1993, the Cabinet agreed in principle to remove the most of-
 fensive of the 1991 labor "reforms" which had been the subject of the ILO rec-
 ommendations and the GSP review process, but implementing legislation had not
 made its way through the system by year's end. One 1991 regulation, that prohib-
 ited union leaders from holding multiple union offices, has been eliminated by the
 July 1993 Cabinet decisions. This action canceled a court case pending against
 former FTUC union head and Indo-Fijian political leader, Mahendra Chaudhry.
 Strikes are legal in Fiji. However, the 1991 right-to-strike decrees are still in ef-
 fect. Strikes are banned in connection with union recognition disputes. Once a recog-
 nized union votes to strike, that vote is valid for 6 weeks. If the union has not gone
 out on strike before the 6 week deadline, another vote must be taken. There is no
 current limit on the length of a strike. The Government is involved in certifying
 union balloting, which can be an elaborate process given the distance between some
 of the island locations in the country. The largest strike (involving some 500 work-
 ers) of 1993 took place at the Pafco fish-canning facility in Levuka over working con-
 
 
 637
 ditions and leadership. Local chiefs, the Ministry of Labor, and the company nego-
 tiated a settlement after 10 days. The most noteworthy strike was the September
 6 walkout by dock workers in Suva, in protest of the Port Authority's contracting
 out of stevedoring at the Lautoka Wharf. Once the authority chairman was re placed
 by the Government, work resumed. The strike by the Fiji Mine Workers' Union
 (FMWU) at the Vatukoula gold mine which began in 1991 continued. A rival union,
 the Mine Workers' Council (MWC), was organized and recognized by both the new
 management and the Government when it garnered membership from more than
 half the work force. After considerable legal action and appeals by the FMWU and
 mine management the courts decided that the MWC was the valid representative
 of the workers. The FTUC has decried the MWC as an "in-house" union; fired
 FMWU members continued to occupy mine company housin
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-The law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is deter-
 mined by union membership numbers rather than by an election. The Government
 has the power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so.
 Key sectors of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Fol-
 lowing the May 1992 elections, the Government lifted wage guidelines and unre-
 stricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 Wage negotiations are conducted on an individual company or enterprise basis
 rather than on an industrywide basis. A Government proposal to introduce such in-
 dustry-wide negotiations has been opposed by employers and unions. Union leaders
 fear that straight market-based wage bargaining would open unacceptably large
 wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers. Until 1984 a tripartite forum of
 employers, unions, and government oversaw labor negotiations. In that year, how-
 ever, labor withdrew from the forum and it was abolished. The body was restored
 in June 1993 as the Economic Strategies Committee, but the FTUC has refused to
 participate.
 Antiunion discrimination is specifically prohibited by Fijian law. In practice, the
 unions are generally sucessful in preventing discrimination against workers for
 union activities, but the law does not mandate that such workers e reinstated.
 Fiji's export processing zones are subject to the same laws as the rest of the coun-
 try, and many of their firms have unions which have negotiated collective bargain-
 ing agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there is no indication that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children underage 12 may not be
 employed in any capacity. "Childrenf(under age 15) and "young persons" (ages 15
 to 17) may not be employed in industry or work with machinery. Enforcement by
 the Ministry of Labour and Industrial Relations generally is effective, except in the
 case of family members working on family farms or businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No national minimum wage has been estab-
 lished. Certain sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labour and In-
 dustrial Relations. For example, garment workers' hourly wages are at $0.49
 ($F0.72) for learners and $0.62 ($1F0.94) for all others. In the tourism sector, the
 minimum hourly wage starts at $0.91 ($F1.37). Office workers may earn as much
 as $1.12 ($F1.68) as a starting hourly salary. Skilled heavy machinery operators
 earn in the range of over $1.49 ($F2.21) per hour. These minimum wages are effec-
 tively enforced and generally support a barely adequate standard of living in all sec-
 tors except the garment industry, in which the starting wage is based on the as-
 sumption that workers are young adults or married women living at home and not
 supporting a household.
 Fiji has no re lation specifying maximum hours of work for adult males. Women
 are prohibited from night work in factories (other than overtime work in the gar-
 ment industry) and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably trans-
 portation and shipping, have problems with excessive hours of work. Indo-Fijians,
 who generally require a cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to
 work long hours than ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians can and do return to a
 noncash economy way of life in their villages rather than work what they consider
 to be excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a Workmen's Compensation Act, and an Ac-
 cident Compensation Plan. Awards for workers injured on the tob are set by a tribu-
 nal. Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the Labour
 Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, but the unions do a
 reasonable job of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. The ILO's
 November 1992 recommendations cited the need to improve working conditions.
 Problems are particularly widespread in the garment industry.
