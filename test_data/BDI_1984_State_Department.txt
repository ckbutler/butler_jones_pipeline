 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, an Army Colonel who came to power in 1976
 through a bloodless military coup. The President is assisted
 in governing by the party's Central Committee and a Council of
 Ministers. The once dominant role of the military in
 government has been steadily reduced as Bagaza has steered the
 country toward essentially civilian governing institutions and
 appointed civilians to most key government positions.
 The National Party for Unity and Progress is the most important
 political institution in Burundi. As President of the party
 and as head of government, Bagaza has a dominant policy role.
 He also exercises broad decree powers and appoints and
 dismisses judges. The armed forces maintain law and order, and
 the Government monitors dissent through the state security
 police. During sessions over the last two years, the National
 Assembly has actively debated government policy with occasional
 pointed criticism.
 The party's second National Congress, held in 1984, confirmed
 President Bagaza as the party President for a five-year term.
 Bagaza was subsequently confirmed by the voting population of
 Burundi as President of the Republic. The electorate could
 vote only for or against him as the sole candidate.
 The people of Burundi share a common language and cultural
 heritage but are divided into two ethnic groups. The minority
 Tutsi have historically dominated the majority Hutu through a
 quasi-feudal system of chieftainships and land ownership. The
 dominance continues today through control of emerging modern
 social, economic, and political institutions. The second
 republic has opened party institutions to all Burundians and
 appointed Hutus to all levels of government, including
 ministerial positions. There is no evidence of government-
 sanctioned discrimination against Hutus and they are not
 persecuted. Many Hutus who fled during the 1972 massacres are
 returning from their refuge in neighboring countries and
 reintegrating into national life.
 Burundi is a very poor country with a primarily agricultural
 economic base and one of the highest population densities in
 Africa. Most Burundians earn their livelihood as subsistence
 farmers working small, privately owned plots. Recent gains
 made in food production and economic development have been
 largely offset by a high population growth rate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no allegations of killings for political motives or
 of summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearance have been reported.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law. Cruel treatment of suspects or
 detainees has occurred in the form of beatings at the time of
 arrest or interrogation. Such treatment is rare and occurs
 only in cases of violent crimes or resisting arrest. The
 Government admits that isolated instances of abuse of prisoners
 by prison guards or officials do occur but insists that those
 responsible for such abuses are punished.
 Prison conditions are severe due to lack of adequate hygiene,
 medical care, and food. Prisoners are segregated according to
 the nature of their crimes, are allowed regular family visits,
 and participate in rehabilitative work programs. Families are
 permitted and expected to provide supplemental food and other
 personal items to their relatives in prison. The Government is
 making efforts to improve conditions and has cooperated with
 the International Committee for the Red Cross, whose
 contribution enabled the Government to upgrade the sanitary
 facilities of the central prison during 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects but must
 submit a written report to the public prosecutorts office
 within 24 hours. The public prosecutor examines the report and
 can either order the detainee's release or issue an arrest
 warrant valid for five days. Within the allotted period, the
 public prosecutor must formally state the charges in the
 presence of the detainee before a magistrate, who can release
 the detainee or issue orders confirming the detention,
 initially for 15 days and then subsequently for 30-day periods
 as necessary to prepare the case for trial. Bail is set only
 in cases of embezzlement or similar crimes involving financial
 wrongdoings.
 The standards of arrest and imprisonment are not always
 upheld. The elapsed time between an arrest and the
 notification of the public prosecutor often extends to several
 days. Also, detainees do not always appear before a magistrate
 within the alloted five days. However, a judicial review of
 the arrest does take place in all cases, and arrests are made
 openly. Relatives or consular representatives are made aware
 of arrests or detentions, generally when they occur. The
 general practice is to permit detainees to go to their homes
 prior to being brought to the place of detention.
 In addition to a police force responsible for civil and
 criminal offenses, a separate force of security police, which
 has primary responsibility for policing internal state
 security, has the same powers of arrest as the regular police
 and is subject to the same procedures for judicial review of
 detentions. During 1984 the security police detained and
 questioned an unknown number of persons for expression of views
 hostile to the Government or critical of individual members of
 the Government or for other activities deemed dangerous to the
 internal security of the nation. At least five university
 students were detained during 1984 for protesting a government
 decision to rescind scholarships. Five or six other persons,
 either government officials or influential private citizens,
 were also detained for expression of hostile views. These
 detainees were released within one or two months or, in one or
 two cases, charged with and convicted of violations of civil
 law.
 
 
 BURUNDI.
 The Government does not exile its nationals. There are cases
 of individuals preferring to reside outside Burundi after
 leaving as refugees or political opponents of the Government.
 Citizens of neighboring countries suspected of criminal
 activity and lacking proper residency documents are expelled.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is not entirely independent. In addition to
 appointing judges, the President has the power to dismiss
 them. The judiciary is expected to adhere to the guidance and'
 recommendations of the party, the Government and the
 President. Nevertheless, there is a high degree of autonomy in
 the day-to-day administration of justice through the courts,
 and due process is largely observed. Court decisions cannot be
 overturned by the executive branch. The President has the
 power to pardon or reduce sentences.
 Burundi has three separate court systems to deal with
 civil/criminal, military, and state security cases. Military
 tribunals have jurisdiction only over military personnel. The
 state security court has jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel and its proceedings need not be made
 public. To date, this court has not been used. Burundi law
 provides a right to counsel, and indigents are defended by the
 state.
 Pretrial proceedings may involve lengthy investigations during
 which the question of guilt is virtually resolved. At the
 pretrial stage, the public prosecutor's office generally
 dismisses cases where the evidence in support of the charges is
 weak or unsubstantiated and only proceeds to trial when it
 believes guilt has been established. However, two well-known
 instances of not-guilty verdicts in 1984 involved a murder case
 and a case of high government officials accused of
 embezzlement.
 During the past four years, the Government has taken steps to
 improve the judicial system. The number of local courts has
 almost doubled. New provincial courts have been created, the
 number of magistrates has tripled, and training seminars and
 conferences have been held. The functioning of the system is
 still hampered by the lack of trained legal personnel and the
 heavy case loads. The 1984 party congress recommended
 additional reforms in the judicial system, which include giving
 priority to cases where the accused is in preventive detention.
 There are no verified cases of purely political prisoners,
 although one or two such cases have been alleged. Defamation
 of a public figure is a civil offense and several persons are
 serving short sentences (under 12 months) after convictions for
 this offense. There are also two or three prisoners who were
 initially detained for political activities hostile to the
 Government but who were subsequently charged with and convicted
 of corrupt practices or embezzlement of public funds. The ICRC
 does not consider a program of visitation to such prisoners
 necessary in Burundi.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of correspondence and the inviolability of
 the home are guaranteed in the Constitution. A judicial
 
 
 43
 BURUNDI
 warrant is required for a law enforcement official to enter and
 search a private residence. There are no reports of
 violations.
 Citizens are not coerced to become members of any
 organization. Membership in the political party and its
 affiliated organizations is open to all but not required.
 However, the Government requires that all citizens perform
 community work on Saturday morning and this has created a
 conflict with at least one religious group. The state security
 office does monitor dissent through officers of the state
 security police and paid informers who report on discontent and
 dissension as well as criminal activity. The security system
 is concerned primarily with potential violence against the
 Government.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media. The French language daily and Kirundi language weekly
 are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 operates the domestic radio stations. The media are required
 to support the fundamental policies of the party and
 Government. Some criticism of government mismanagement and
 secondary aspects of policies is permitted in the printed press
 but not on radio. Journalists are state employees and as such
 would be subject to disciplinary action if their criticism went
 beyond what is considered tolerable. The Government does not
 interfere with the distribution of foreign news publications
 nor with radio reception from foreign sources.
 Freedom of speech is limited by statute. Criticism of the
 party and government policies or leadership is permitted only
 within party meetings. Academic freedom is also limited. At
 the primary and secondary school level, teachers are expected
 to support government policies. At the university, professors
 come from several different countries and are permitted to
 lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct research, and
 draw independent conclusions. Censorship occurs only in the
 case of sexually explicit foreign film material or publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The express authorization of the Government is required for all
 political meetings or speakers. This effectively guarantees
 government control of all public fora and limits association
 for political purposes to participation in the party or its
 affiliated youth, labor, or women's movements.
 The party controls the trade union confederation called the
 National Labor Union or UTB. The principal roles of the UTB,
 to which virtually the entire salaried work force belongs, are
 to educate its rank and file regarding their legal protections
 and serve as a mediator between workers and employers. The
 right to strike is denied in practice, and individual advocacy
 of a strike or lock-out is a criminal offense. The UTB
 maintains links with international labor bodies. The UTB
 participates in the International Labor Organization (ILO) and
 is a member of the continent-wide Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU) based in Accra.
 In 1983, Burundi was cited by the ILO in Geneva for violations
 of ILO conventions 20 and 105 pertaining to forced labor,
 
 
 44
 BURUNDI
 because of legislation imposing compulsory cultivation on
 Burundi farmers under the threat of penal sanctions. The
 Burundi Government, however, maintains that the legislation
 referred to by the ILO citation is no longer in use and that it
 is initiating a general study to remove from the books similar
 laws which are no longer relevant under the Burundi
 Constitution.
 The Government permits nonpolitical private associations, but
 requires that they be registered and accorded legal recognition
 before they may function.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Burundi is a secular state, religious freedoms are
 restricted by the Government. All religious associations must
 receive approval from the Government, and government
 authorities must be informed in advance of religious
 gatherings. Such gatherings are strictly limited to recognized
 places of worship (i.e., churches, mosques, and temples), and
 religious services are authorized only after midday on Saturday
 and on Sundays. (In spite of this order, the Government does
 not interfere with Muslim worship on Fridays.)
 The Jehovah's Witnesses sect is banned because its doctrine
 challenges certain precepts of civil authority. The sect does
 not have legal status in Burundi and consequently cannot openly
 carry out activities within the faith or aimed at conversion.
 Terms of imprisonment for Jehovah's Witnesses activists are
 generally less than the maximum six-month penalty. There are
 no reports of persons imprisoned for merely adhering to the
 sect. The Seventh Day Adventists' activities in Burundi were
 curtailed during 1984. The Adventists, who regard Saturday as
 the Sabbath, came into conflict with the Government over the
 issue of community work, which is normally required of all
 citizens on Saturday, and the right to hold services on
 Saturday morning. The Adventists' refusal to perform work of
 any kind on their Sabbath led to the closing of Adventist
 churches and loss of their legal status. Other churches have
 suffered various harassments. The Government has made it clear
 that churches are to confine their activities to religion and
 social works and stay out of political matters, which include
 Hutu/Tutsi relations. The churches have been forbidden to hold
 weekday services; religious symbols not actually on church
 buildings have been removed by local authorities; and 15-20
 missionaries have been expelled over the past year. No reasons
 were given by the Government for the expulsions.
 Church access to the media is curtailed with the longstanding
 suspension of a Catholic newspaper and of religious radio
 broadcasts. There are, however, no barriers to the training of
 the clergy or to maintenance of links with religious
 hierarchies or groups in other countries. Also, the Government
 does not prevent the arrival of new missionaries. Religious
 beliefs do not exclude individuals from political participation
 or social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although government
 policies discourage urban migration. There is no system of
 internal pass controls or curfew. Foreign travel and
 emigration are relatively free. However, the Government
 
 
 45
 BURUNDI
 requires exit visas as well as passports. The Government has
 occasionally withheld these documents without explanation but
 apparently for political motivations. Burundi's refugee and
 asylum practices are humane and cooperation with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is close. The country's
 estimated 70,000 refugees, primarily Tutsis of Rwandan origin
 who fled to Burundi in the 1960's, have mostly been settled,
 although they are not very often granted citizenship. Refugees
 who fled Burundi in the early 1970's and before continue to
 return in increasing numbers and have full rights as citizens.
 Amnesty International has been concerned about the situation of
 refugees and asylum seekers from Zaire. Several were allegedly
 forcibly repatriated in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Burundi do not have the right under the
 existing political system to change their Government. Political
 participation can take place only within the one-party
 structure, and voters can express dissatisfaction only by
 sending incumbents down to defeat. The President of the party
 is the sole candidate for President of the Republic. Power
 rests with the President, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, and with the
 party Central Committee. The party is open to all Burundians
 who profess allegiance to its principles and claims membership
 of about 1.4 million, about three-quarters of the adult
 population. The party regularly holds congresses at the local
 and regional levels, during which members can discuss issues
 and make recommendations. While there are multiple candidates
 for party positions, balloting is not secret. The party's
 National Congress met during July 1984 and was attended by
 approximately 900 delegates, including pre-selected delegates
 from the party's affiliated youth, labor, and women's
 movements, and from the armed forces.
 The National Congress selected a new Central Committee and
 reelected Bagaza as president. He was subsequently confirmed
 as President of Burundi on August 31, 1984, for a five-year
 term, receiving 99.6 percent of the votes. Although the
 process cannot be considered an election, it did mark the first
 time that the population of Burundi has had any role whatsoever
 to play in the approval of their Chief of State.
 The Constitution provides for a national assembly, which came
 into being in 1982 with a five-year mandate. Fifty-two of the
 65 representatives are voted for by secret ballot under
 universal adult suffrage and the remainder are appointed by the
 President. All candidates are drawn from a list preselected
 by provincial electoral colleges composed of party and
 government officials. Two candidates for each elective seat
 were permitted. The balloting was evidently free, as several
 high party and government officials failed to win seats. The
 Assembly is not intended to be a separate and independent power
 but is expected to cooperate with and complement the other
 institutions. Nevertheless, its recent proceedings in enacting
 legislation and approving budgets indicate that it has the
 potential to evolve into an active institutional participant in
 the process of government.
 Although the military remains influential and is still
 represented in all the party organs and in the Government, its
 role in government administration had declined markedly since
 1979 when the military Supreme Revolutionary Council, which had
 
 
 46
 BURUNDI
 ruled the country since 1976, was dissolved. Only 3 military
 officers are currently cabinet members, and military officers
 hold 12 of the 69 Central Committee seats.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations instruments on
 human rights and its Constitution provides for the protection
 of such rights. There were no reports during 1984 of requests
 for outside investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 The last visit of the ICRC took place in late 1983. The
 Government complied with the ICRC's standard conditions for
 visits to prisoners or detainees. In 1984, in addition to the
 status of Zairian refugees, Amnesty International was concerned
 by the restrictions imposed on religious activities and the
 detentions of members of religious groups. Freedom House terms
 Burundi *not free.-
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burundi is among the poorest countries of the world, with a
 1982 per capita gross national product of $280. Fifty-five
 percent of the urban population and 85 percent of the rural
 population is below the absolute poverty level (1978).
 Population density is one of the highest in Africa, with a
 population of 4.663 million (1984) inhabiting a land area of
 only 27,834 square kilometers. The population growth rate for
 1984 is estimated at 2.6 percent. Nearly 95 percent of
 Burundians earn their livelihood from agriculture. The
 traditional feudal land tenure system has been abolished, and
 most individual farmers own the land they cultivate. Food
 production has not increased as rapidly as the population.
 Calorie supply as a percentage of requirements was estimated at
 96.74 (1977). The Government has adopted a voluntary
 comprehensive family planning policy and emphasized agriculture
 in its most recent five-year plan (1983-87).
 Burundi's relatively small monetary economy is based on the
 export of coffee, which accounts for 90 percent of foreign
 exchange earnings. The economy has been hit hard by the
 decline in world coffee prices since 1979, sharply rising
 energy costs, and high transportation costs. Real economic
 growth over the past five years has stayed only slightly ahead
 of population growth.
 Health care is inadequate as Burundi suffers from a shortage of
 personnel, facilities, and budgetary resources. Life
 expectancy at birth is only 47.43 years (1984), and the rate of
 infant mortality is 116.8 per 1,000 live births (1984).
 Although most urban dwellers have access to potable water
 supplies, the percentage of the rural population with access to
 safe year-round water is very low. Educational opportunities,
 despite considerable government efforts supported by donor
 assistance, remain below the needs of the population. Only
 26.8 percent of adults are literate according to 1980 figures
 (38.9 male, 15.4 female). World Bank statistics for 1981 show
 primary school enrollment of 31.12 percent of the primary
 school age population (38.71 percent for males, 23.69 percent
 for females.) Only a small fraction of those completing
 primary school can obtain places in the nation's 35 secondary
 schools. An even smaller percentage of students win places in
 the nation's sole university.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 The minority Tutsi, traditionally a pastoral people, have for
 centuries dominated the majority Hutu, traditionally a farming
 people. The government-sanctioned massacres in 1972 led to
 nearly 200,000 Hutus fleeing to neighboring Rwanda and
 Tanzania. Since 1976, with the advent of the second republic,
 the degree of ethnic tension has been markedly reduced.
 Thousands of Hutu refugees have returned to Burundi.
 Intermarriage has also contributed to a blurring of ethnic
 distinctions. The low level of economic development in rural
 areas affects both Tutsi and Hutu, with differences in economic
 status between the two groups generally not discernible in the
 countryside. However, because of their longstanding dominance
 of the Government and access to education, the Tutsi
 predominate in the modern sector. The military remains under
 Tutsi control. While there is social and cultural
 discrimination, there is no evidence that Hutus are denied
 equal protection of the law.
 Women in society hold a secondary position, although their
 status is undergoing considerable change from traditional
 patterns. The Constitution provides for legal equality, and
 significant improvement in the legal status of women came in
 1980 with the issuance of a new legal code on families. This
 code prohibits polygamy and use of dowry, and allows women
 control of family matters in the absence of the husband.
 Women, however, still cannot inherit land and cannot work if
 forbidden to by their husbands. Although fewer women than men
 attain an education, once it is attained women can generally
 find suitable employment. The Government does not discriminate
 against women in hiring or in respect to the jobs which are
 open to them. Women are represented at all levels in the
 political life of the country. However, their main vehicle of
 political expression is the women's movement affiliated with
 the party. The party remains dominated by males.
