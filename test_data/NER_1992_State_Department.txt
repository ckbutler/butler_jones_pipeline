 NIGER
 In 1992 Niger was ruled by a transition government, headed by Prime Minister
 Amadou Cheiffou, who was elected at the 1991 National Conference. The Conference
 also put in place a quasi-legislative body, the High Council of the Republic (HCR),
 and kept Ali Saibou as ceremonial President. The transition Government and the
 HCR prepared for a democratic "Third Republic," holding a referendum on the
 newly drafted constitution on December 26, 1992, and organizing for national elec-
 tions in early 1993. The Government also made some progress on the political, eco-
 nomic, and social action plan elaborated by the National Conference. At the same
 time, the transition Government faced an armed rebellion by Tuareg militants and
 increasing indiscipline by military troops.
 During the year, the civilian transition Government gradually lost control over
 the security services, some of whose members became increasingly dissatisfied with
 government policies, especially toward the Tuareg rebellion. Soldiers mutinied twice
 in 1992, and at year's end neither the transition leadership nor the senior military
 leadership exercised effective command over the troops. In February elements of the
 military rank and file, known as "La Troupe," protesting unpaid salaries and other
 issues, abducted senior government officials and intimidated civilians by ring
 weapons into the air. In March the Government decreed a security precaution zone
 in the Agadez, Tahoua, and Tillaberi Departments, invoking state security as a rea-
 son to broaden the powers of the armed forces. In August members of Niger's other
 security services (gendarmerie, police, and customs) joined elements of the military
 forces in staging a series of extrajudicial arrests of over 180 persons (mostly Tuareg)
 allegedly connected with the rebellion. Among other things, the troops demanded
 the release of the several dozen hostages heldthe he rebels. Although some of the
 troops' detainees were released, including 29 in late December, most were still being
 held by "La Troupe" at the end of 1992. The Government did not condemn the
 troops' actions, and it did not take credible action to gain control of those arrested.
 Nonetheless, the Government announced in late December, presumably with "La
 Troupe's" consent, that 28 more detainees would be released, 64 cases would go to
 trial, and investigations would continue regarding other detainees. The armed forces
 did not otherwise involve themselves in government affairs. Total military expendi-
 tures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $27 million. Falling revenues barely cov-
 ered military salaries and prevented the Government from meeting defense spend-
 ing required to counter instability and the rebellion.
 Niyger is an extremely poor ountry with an eonomy based largely on cultivating
 subsistene crops, raising ivestock, and exploiting some of the world's largest ura-
 nium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 3.3-percent population growth rate
 and the declining world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal
 economy. The transition Government failed to implement an effective economic re-
 form program. Donor contributions remained low due to the Government's inability-
 to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
 Bank over a structural adjustment program.
 Progress in respecting and safeguarding human rights was mixed. Some of the ad-
 vances of 1991 were maintained: human rights  o ups continued to operate without
 hindrance, and the independent press remained autonomous. Political parties pr-
 liferated, and a new Constitution was adopted by popular vote. However, human
 rto rabuses occurred as well. In attempting to put downarbellion byd Tuareg
 Bels, the security forces sometimes resorted to extrajudia k gs  dphys
 abuse of civilians and persons suspected of being part of or sympathetic to the rebel-
 lion. The Government failed to condemn, much less try, to convict and punish mem-
 bers of the security forces who committed such abuses. The rebels also attacked
 maimed, and killed innocent civilians and committed other abuses, includin armed
 attacks on food shipments to the civilian population. For a 3-day period the Govern-
 
 
 190
 ment tightened controls over media reporting of the rebellion. The HCR passed laws
 of questionable constitutionality, such as a vaguely defined illicit enrichment law.
 The Government stretched legal arguments to fill gaps in the judicial bases for some
 transition actions. Justice was dispensed slowly; important trials never took place.
 Many laws were published behind schedule due to lack of funds. Proposed improve-
 ments in protection of women's rights were not realized. Despite the campagn to
 popularize the Constitution, ignorance of individual rights remained widespread
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The civilian transition Government
 did not engage in political or other extrajudicial killings in 1992. However, the con-
 flict between military forces and Tuareg rebels in northern Niger led to deaths of
 some noncombatant civilians.
 In January the military killed three civilian Tuaregs in a noncombat situation.
 There were credible reports of similar killings throughout the year, including a re-
 port by the government-controlled media that military personnel had killed two
 Tuareg civilians. In another instance, soldiers wounded European tourists mistaken
 for rebels. The August 26 rebel assassination of an Agadez police inspector moti-
 vated a wave of extrajudicial military arrests, mainly of Tuaregs.
 Tuareg rebels were responsible for a series of extrajudicial killings of noncombat-
 ants, including two traditional leaders (one a Tuareg) and four other Nigeriens.
 These killings sometimes entailed brutalities such as dismemberment.
 Neither civilian nor military authorities' investigations of extrajudicial killings by
 the military resulted in any charges or trials. The transition Government failed to
 complete an investigation into, or begin adjudication of, two 1990 incidents of
 extrajudicial killings by the armed forces raised at the 1991 National Conference.
 The primary suspect in one case, a military officer who confessed to executing a
 Tuareg (a confession he later retracted), was released due to pressure by soldiers
 during the February mutiny.
 b. Disappearance.-Some of those held by La Troupe must be considered as hav-
 ing disappeared, since no list officially was made available of those held after the
 August arrests, and no numbers are available. Tuareg rebels abducted an estimated
 50 individuals (soldiers and civil servants) whose fate remains unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both army units involved in the northern conflict and rebels inflicted cruel and in-
 human treatment by beating civilians. There were credible reports that military
 units committed abusive acts against innocent civilians, including beating elderly
 detainees and children in Arlit during search operations for Tuareg rebels in May.
 There were also reports that the armed forces subjected some of those persons ar-
 rested for complicity with the Tuareg rebellion to whippings in August and Septem-
 ber. Other reports indicated the army buried prisoners up to their necks in sand
 and left them in the sun. Others were said to have been forced to run in a circle
 while keeping two fingers on the ground. Afterwards, if they lost their balance while
 squatting in an awkward position, the prisoners allegedly were beaten. The Nigerien
 Government televised interviews in September with hospitalized civilian victims of
 rebel beatings. Random instances of abuse by individual law enforcement or prison
 officers continued to occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional prohibitions against arbi-
 trary detention have been in effect for several years in Niger but have not been fully
 respected. The law requires that an arrested person be either charged or released
 within 48 hours. In special cases, the public prosecutor, who is also the head of the
 judicial police, may authorize one renewal of the 48-hour detention period. In prac-
 tice, unauthorized delays beyond the established 48-hour period frequently occurred,
 and prisoners often spent months in jail awaiting trial. The failure of the police or
 public prosecutor to respect the 48-hour rule does not result in the dismissal of the
 case against a suspect.   "1
 Once charged, a suspect may be further detained by order of the examining mag-
 istrate. In practice, charged suspects were often held beyond the legal time limits
 prescribed. Human rights groups protested this practice to Niamey police and re-
 ported that the frequency of violations had decreased. Defendants are allowed a law-
 yer of their choice, and bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than
 10 years' imprisonment. In practice, widespread ignorance and lack of financial
 means prevented these rights from being exercised fully.
 As far as known, the civilian Government did not arrest persons for their views
 or opinions in 1992. Acting independently from the Government, however, elements
 of the security forces (gendarmerie, police, and customs) detained at length and
 
 
 191
 without formal charge at least 180 citizens including senior government officials
 and children. Most of the detentions occurrea in August and September and contin-
 ued in small numbers thereafter. Persons detained, mostly Tuareg, were suspected
 of complicity with the Tuareq rebellion and held for months in military camps. Ap-
 proximately 69 of these detainees reportedly were released, but most were still de-
 tained by"La Troupe" at year's end.
 The Government announced in late December, presumably with the security
 forces' consent, that an additional 28 would be released and that most of the re-
 maining detainees would be tried while investigations of others would continue. The
 civilian authorities did not provide an official list of detainees. The military units
 usually permitted family visits to the detainees, though these were occasionally de-
 layed or denied. In the early days of the August/September arrests, there were alle-
 gations of physical abuse (see Section 1.c.). During the February mutiny, army units
 legally detained overnight several senior-level government officials, who stated
 that they were treated well.
 The new Constitution forbids the use of exile as a means of political control, and
 no instances of exile occurred in Niger in 1992. Several Tuareg leaders fled Niger
 to avoid arrest; groups of Nigerien Tuaregs fled to Algeria in 1992 as the Tuareg
 rebellion led to violent clashes with the Nigerien army.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Nigrs civil legal system is an amalgam of
 French, Islamic, and customary law. Traditional courts often handle village property
 disputes, which are brought to the civil courts when not resolved. Civil and criminal
 cases not involving security-related acts are tried publicly. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trials to confront witnesses, and to present evidence.
 Niger's new Constitution affirms the judicial principle of presumption of innocence.
 However, in 1992 the Government adopted an ordinance against illicit enrichment,"
 which, among other defects, presumed guilt. The ordinance, which many jurists con-
 sidered unconstitutional, was not invoked. All defendants who are minors or those
 charged with a crime carrying a sentence of 10 years or more have the right to coun-
 sel at public expense. In practice, lawyers comply with government orders to provide
 counsel in these cases but generally are not paid for their services. Both the defend-
 ant and the prosecutor may appeal the verdict, first to the Court of Appeals and
 then to the highest court, the Supreme Court. Both courts are obligated to hear ap-
 teals. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law while the Supreme
 ou   reviews only the application o the law. Nigrien law prevents executions
 from occurring until the executive privilege of pardon is explicitly rejected.
 Both the new and former constitutions stipulate judicial independence, but in
 practice, government officials and others commonly use political pressure and family
 influence to affect judicial proceedings.
 The Crimes and Abuses Commission, created by the 1991 National Conferencet
 continued its investigations into political, economic, and social crimes committed
 during previous regimes. The Commission passed its findings to the HCR, which,
 in turn, was to transfer cases to the High Court of Justice (HJ) for trial, as estab-
 lished by the National Conference. However, by year's end, the HCJ had tried only
 one of these cases, in which two former high-ranking military defendants were sen-
 tenced to 10 years' imprisonment for comitting an assassination under orders from
 former president Kountche. The Prime Minister subsequently pardoned them. Two
 important human rights cases investigated by the Commission (see Section l.a.)
 were not tried. The H CR released without charge one person suspected of crimes
 against the State after several months of house arrest.
 The HCR expanded the powers of the Crimes and Abuses Commission in July,
 strengthening its police powers and granting it the power to seize property, which
 it has done. Seizures may be appealed.
 Applying a 1975 law which established the State Security Court, the Prime Min-
 ister reinstated the Court early in the year and appointed members, whose names
 had not been revealed publicly by years end. The Court, having jurisdiction over
 crimes affecting the security of the St ate (e.g., treason), will try several persons ar-
 rested bythe Government for complicity with the Tuareg rebellion. In principle, its
 powers do not exceed those of other Nigerien Courts, and defendants have the same
 right to due process. Nevertheless, the Court does have the right to decide whether
 proceedings are to e open or closed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 the police are required to have a search warrant to enter homes, and then may do
 so only between the hours of 6 n.m. and 9 p.m. When police are in hot pursuit of
 a suspected criminal, these limits on searches are often lifted. In practice, however,
 routine searches are frequently conducted without warrants and at all hours. In ad-
 dition, the military reportedly conducted illegal searches on numerous occasions,
 articularlv durina the Februarv mutiny and the August and September wave of ar-
 
 
 192
 rests. There were no reports in 1992 of other violations of privacy, such as inter-
 ference with correspondence.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-As noted above, the security forces committed various abuses against Tuareg
 civilians in dealing with the Tuareg rebellion. Tuareg rebels attacked innocent civil-
 ian vehicles randomly on the major road arteries in the north, cutting off northern
 trade routes and strangling the regional population's access to basic necessities such
 as food and fuel. At times, the rebels specifically targeted food shipments. The secu-
 rity forces were unable to provide sufficient protection to allow the safe passage of
 vehicles and persons until October, when armed convoy escorts were established
 along major mutes in the north. A special fund was announced to compensate vic-
 tims of rebel attacks; there was no equivalent fund for victims of military reprisal.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech was enhanced in 1992, al-
 though there were setbacks. The media provided a forum for wider debate, for exam-
 ple, through television and radio phone-in debates on important issues. The Supe-
 rior Council of Communication (CSC), created by the 1991 National Conference to
 protect media freedoms and regulate access to the media, was made a permanent
 institution by the new Constitution. During 1992 the CSC held a conference to com-
 plete new media laws and organized a series of seminars on the role of the media
 in a democracy. The CSC persuaded the Justice Ministry to drop its defamation of
 character suit against a television journalist.
 The independent press criticized the Government freely. Two new newspapers,
 The Democrat and The Paon, were created, making five French-language papers
 and one Hausa-language paper. In addition, by yea-s end, one political partyhad
 begun publishing its own paper. An association of editors of the private press and
 an association of women communications professionals were formed.
 The Government did, however, impose some restrictions on press and media free-
 doms because of the rebellion. When the August wave of military arrests of Tuaregs
 and others first began the Government prohibited its media services from reporting
 on the actions of La Troupe. Journalists protested, and the interdiction was lifted
 after 3 days. Nevertheless, the Government tightened controls on its own media,
 which led to slanted reporting. Academic freedom was respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-By law, Nigeriens may form
 groups of any kind, except those that are ethnically or regionally based. In 1992
 freedom of assembly and association was exercised without hindrance, but the Gov-
 ernment retains the authority to deny permission for demonstrations under tense
 social conditions or if notices are submitted late. The Government authorized most
 protests and demonstrations but denied permission for a few marches that were to
 take place during periods of social tension. Riot police used force to break up a
 peaceful student march on October 1. A number of new civic and religious associa-
 tions and unions were formed. Eighteen political parties formally registered with
 the Interior Ministry to participate in elections. The new Constitution prohibits po-
 litical parties based on religious, ethnic, or regional affiliations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Niger's population is over 90 percent Muslim. Islam is
 freely and widely practiced, and several new Islamic associations were formed in
 1992. The practice of other religious beliefs is permitted. Foreign missionaries may
 live, work, and travel in Niger but must obtain authorization which is routinely
 granted. Although delegates to the 1991 National Conference afirmed Niger's status
 as a secular state, during the campaign to popularize the draft constitution certain
 Islamic groups objected to Article 4 which specifically established Niger's secular
 status. Nevertheless, a majority of the population approved a modified constitution
 that effectively establishes Niger as a secular state and prohibits religiously based
 political parties. Religiously inspired violence occurred in 1992, especially between
 mainstream Tidjaniya Muslims and a more purist sect known as Izala. Religious-
 based violence also occurred against women and women's organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Security personnel at checkpoints continued to monitor travel of per-
 sons and the circulation of goods within Niger, particularly in and around major
 cities. Attacks by Tuareg rebels on vehicles travelin on major access routes to and
 from Agadez put severe restrictions on movement in northern Niger. In addition,
 the Government closed the border with Algeria to tourists as a security measure.
 In August the military imposed curfews in Agadez, Tahoua, and Zinder, although
 at the time, a military security zone was not decreed for Zinder.
 Cloistering still exists among Hausa and Fulani in eastern Niger, where some
 women can leave their homes only if escorted by a male, and usually only after
 dark. Neither emigration nor repatriation is restricted. Niger is a party to the Proto-
 
 
 193
 col Relating to the Status of Refugees and has cooperated with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (who does not maintain a presence in Niger) in
 providing emergency relief to Chadian refugees. There are about 3,600 Chadian ref-
 ugees in Niger. Approximately 3,000 Malian Tuaregs fled strife in Mali to seek ref-
 uge in Niger and Burkina Faso.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the ability of citizens to change their government by democratic means
 has not yet been tested, the transition Government largely fulfilled its mandate to
 establish the basis for a democratically elected, semipresidential system of govern-
 ment, with an independent parliament and judiciary. The Government organized a
 campaign to popularize the Constitution, revised the proposed draft based on cri-
 tiques received, and after several postponements, conducted a referendum by which
 the new Constitution was approved on December 26. However, only 2 percent of
 Niger's women possessed the identification documents required to vote in the ref-
 erendum. The Constitution lists some 30 public liberties, including the right to civil
 disobedience and the right of government employees to refuse an order that violates
 human rights. It also lowered the voting age from 21 to 18. By year's end, munici-
 pal, legislative, and presidential elections had been postponed three times.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental, independent human rights groups, as well as several civic asso-
 ciations, addressed human rights concerns without hindrance. Human rights organi-
 zations acted primarily through public declarations and private demarches to au-
 thorities, both of which were effective means of raising public awareness of, and
 sometimes reducing, human rights abuses.
 Amnesty International met with government officials in Niger in April 1992. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), present in Nier or almost half
 of 1992, for the most part freely investigated abuses resulting from the rebellion.
 It failed, however, to obtain access to detainees held by the security services, despite
 government support (announced at year's end) for such visits. The ICRC was also
 unable to obtain access to rebel-held hostages. The ICRC held training programs on
 international human rights conventions for military personnel in February and Sep-
 tember. The Ouagadougou-based Inter-African Union of Human Rights also con-
 ducted investigations freely during its September visit.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 In 1992 the process of democratization ended the traditional domination by the
 Djerma ethnic group (21 percent of the population) in government and military serv-
 ice. The Hausa (over 50 percent of the population) as well as the Fulani (Peulh) and
 Tuareg (together forming 21 percent of the population) were given equal consider-
 ation in forming the transition Government. However, the Fulani and Tuareg con-
 tinued to have less access to government services, and some Tuareg militants were
 in armed revolt against the central government. In December the HCR voted to es-
 tablish eight additional electoral districts, allowing a seat in the National Assembly
 for each of a number of minority ethnic groups (Arabs, Toubou, Fulani and slave-
 caste Tuareg) which would otherwise be outvoted in their departments.
 Deep-seated social and religious beliefs continued to result in discrimination
 against females. Males have considerable advantages in terms of education, employ-
 ment, and property rights. Male attendance heavily outweighs female attendance at
 all educational levels. Only 25 percent of Nigerien children of primary school age
 actually attend schools, with progressively smaller percentages continuing into, or
 through, elementary and secondary school. Approximately 60 percent of the children
 finishing primary school are male; consequently, male literacy (18 percent) far ex-
 ceeds female literacy (7 percent). Child labor practices outside the formal sector also
 inhibit education for young girls. Niger's traditions incline employers to favor men
 as employees. Prevailing Islamic laws of inheritance, marriage, anda divorce discrimi-
 nate against women.
 Certain discriminatory social practices persist. For example, girls as young as age
 10 may be contracted into marriage despite legal prohibitions against marage or
 girls younger than 14. (The minimum legal marrying age for men is 18.) Domestic
 violence occurs against women and children and includes wife beating, but the ex-
 tent of this problem is unknown. While in principle women have recourse to tradi-
 tional and moder judicial authorities, women are reluctant to make any formal al-
 legations because of the stia attached to domestic violence. Female genital muti-
 lation (circumcision) occurs but is limited to a few small ethnic groups. The Govern-
 
 
 ment has participated in an international conference on this subject but does not
 regard it as a major domestic problem and has not addressed the issue publicly.
 A small number of women participate in the professions. About one-third of
 Nigerien doctors and less than one-tenth of Niger's magistrates are women. Women
 constitute only 24 percent of the civil service the largest formal sector employer
 and are underrepresented at senior levels. 'hough few in number, professional
 women receive wages equivalent to those earned by males.
 Two new nonprofessional organizations for women, the Democratic Assembly of
 Nigerien Women (RDFN) and the Union for the Promotion of the Nigerien Woman
 (UPFN), were created in 1992 as alternatives to the government-supported Nigerien
 Women's Association (AFN) created in 1975. The RDFN took the lead in promoting
 women's rights. Niger also has several active women's associations of traders, edu-
 cators, bankers, jurists, and media professionals.
 In November over 100 women staged a sit-in at the High Council of the Republic
 to protest their lack of representation in the process of democratization, and in par-
 ticular to press the transition government to accept both a rural code and a family
 code which had been mandated-by the National Conference. These codes, if adopted,
 would establish inheritance rights to land for women in rural areas, raise the legal
 marriage age for women from 14 to 16, improve the child custody rights of divorced
 women, and end the practice of repudiation by which a man could divorce his wife
 free of any subsequent responsibility. The Government did adopt a population policy
 which called for improved juridical and social status for women, setting such objec-
 tives as increased access to education and reduced maternal mortality.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Approximately 90 percent of Niger's work force is
 employed in the largely subsistence rural sector, which is not unionized. The right
 of workers to establish and join trade unions has been practiced since the 1940's
 and is guaranteed by the new Constitution, which also guarantees the right to
 strike. The onlr existing labor federation, the National Union of Nigerien Workers
 (USTN), comprses over 30 unions, or about 30 percent of the approximately 60,000
 salary and wage earners in Niger. Civil servants and employees in state-owned cor-
 porations make up the vast majority of its membership. There are several other un-
 affiliated unions. The USTN and the Primary and Secondary Schoolteachers' Union
 (SNEN) have stated policies of autonomy via-a-via Niger's political parties, but infor-
 mal ties to parties are believed to exist in all unions. Labor challenges the Govern-
 ment on a wide range of issues.
 The USTN in February organized a nationwide work stoppage which ended the
 military mutiny. Until the end of the year when it hardened its opposition to future
 salary freezes and civil servant dismissals, the USTN did not take a public position
 with respect to frequent wildcat strikes by individual member and nonmember
 unions. For the most part, these unions protested without much success the Govern-
 ment's inability to pay salaries, address personnel matters, and take action on Na-
 tional Conference decsions regarding their professions. The Government did not try
 to suppress or act against the strikers.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions. Indi-
 vidual unions, such as the Teachers' Union, are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Or anize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is le-
 gally authorized, but in practice it is circumscribed by government participation in
 the negotiating process. A Government representative is present at most negotia-
 tions and acts as binding arbitrator in certain circumstances defined by law, such
 as reductions in force and firing of a union delegate. A basic framework agreement,
 negotiated by the USTN's predecessor, the employers, and the Government, has
 been in force since 1972. The agreement covers basic work conditions, work contract
 elements, and union activities but not wages. Individual unions may bargain for
 more favorable work conditions. There is freedom to bargain over wages and hours
 in both the private and public sectors.
 The Labor Code, which is based on International Labor Organization principles,
 protects the right to organize, and prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers.
 The USTN reported no such discrimination in 1992.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Some fair-skinned Tuaregs continue to employ "black" Tuaregs
 as slaves. In 1992 one economic development and humanitarian association exposed
 a few such cases in the media, forcing termination of the practice in those cases.
 
 
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Child labor laws are enforced by
 the Labor Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Labor. Child labor in nonindustrial
 enterprises is permitted by law under certain conditions. Children under 14 must
 obtain special authorization to work from local labor inspectors. Those aged 14 to
 18 are subject to limitations on hours (4.5 hours maximum per day) and types of
 employment (no industrial work). Employers are reuired by law to ensure mini-
 mum sanitary conditions for working children (and women). However, child labor
 is practically nonexistent in the formal sector. Children of all ages work under
 Niger's harsh environmental conditions in the unregulated agricultural, commercial,
 and artisanal sectors, often for immediate relatives or mere distant kin. Economic
 necessity often obliges children to beg in the streets or turn to prostitution.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is a legal minimum wage for salaried
 workers. According to union officials, this wage is not sufficient to provide a decent
 living for workers and their families. The legal workweek is 40 hours. However, cer-
 tain occupations requiring irregular hours are authorized longer workweeks, with
 a maximum of 72 hours. The Labor Code also prescribes occupational safety and
 health regulations that are enforced by the labor inspectors in the Ministry of Civil
 Service, Labor, and Professional Trainin. Because of staff shortages, however, the
 office focuses mainly on safety violations in the mining, building, and industrial sec-
 tors. Although generally satisfied with the safety equipment provided by employers,
 citing in particular adequate protection from radiation in the uranium mines, the
 unions concede that more could be done to inform workers of the safety risks posed
 by their jobs and to encourage workers to take precautions, especially in mining and
 construction.
