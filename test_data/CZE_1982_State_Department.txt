 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is governed by an
 Orthodox communist regime, which .determines the extent to
 -which individual human.rights are enjoyed.in the country.
 Czechoslovak citizens are in fact se.er.ely:-restricted in
 their practice of basic civil andspolitical freedoms.
 Overt opposition to the laws and guidelines approved by
 the Communist Party in any field, including creative
 activity in the arts, is punished. The mere threat of
 punishment and the attendant denial of economic or
 educational, opportunity -- along with a capricious
 application of such penalties -- are much more common
 methods of control than punishment by actual arrest and
 imprisonment. The Czechoslovak people do not actively
 participate in political and economic decision-
 making either within the party or the Government.
 Attempts to enlarge the area of popular debate on
 national policies in recent years have not been
 successful.
 The'most well-known human rights activist group is
 Charter 77, an unofficial movement of intellectuals,
 joined by some students and workers, which has been
 seeking to persuade the Czechoslovak Government to abide
 by its own laws and international commitments on human
 and civil rights. Another group, the Committee for the
 Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted, publicizes abuses of
 the judicial system. The Government has attempted to
 suppress 'dissident' activity by both groups through a
 fluctuating mixture of policies ranging from coercive
 measures of arrest and harassment to forced emigration
 and exile.
 The latest group of Charter 77 spokesmen, appointed in
 January 1982 (three new spokesmen are normally appointed
 every January), have been more active than their
 predecessors in issuing statements on a wide range of
 issues, including the situation in Poland, the peace
 movement, the domestic economic situation, and religious
 discrimination. For example, during the first half of
 1982 more Charter 77 documents were issued than in the
 whole of 1981. In spite of increased activity, there has
 been little of significance to mark the efforts of
 Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the
 Unjustly Persecuted to eliminate or moderate the
 pervasive injustices of the Czechoslovak governmental
 system.
 Over the past year, overt governmental activity against
 human rights activists (excluding religious activists)
 appears to have decreased somewhat, perhaps because the
 authorities judge that these persons have become
 relatively quiet. It could also be that the authorities
 perceive a lessening of the threat of liberal contagion
 from Poland following the declaration of martial law
 there in December 1981. The system exerts enough control
 over its citizens through threats of retaliation and
 
 
 875
 reprisal and the uncertainty of possible punishment so
 that only a brave few are willing to ally themselves
 publicly with opposition. Moreover, the regime wished to
 mute Western condemnation of its human rights policies
 during the year when the Madrid Conference on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe resumed its meetings and while
 preparations were under way for President Husak's
 November visit to Austria. The Husak visit had been
 earlier postponed because of the regime's actions against
 dissidents.
 The outlook for improvement in the realm of human rights
 in Czechoslovakia appears poor.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Killing
 There is no indication that the Czechoslovak Government
 kills persons for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearance in Czechoslovakia have been
 reported.
 c. Torture
 The integrity of the person is guaranteed by the Constitu-
 tion, which states, "inviolability of the person shall be
 guaranteed ... offenders can be punished only by due
 process of law.* There is no indication that torture is
 used by the Czechoslovak Government.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Despite the provisions of the Constitution, there are
 reports that the police employ harsh methods, such as
 beatings, in interrogations of suspected criminals.
 These practices appear especially evident in political
 cases, including those of Charter 77 activists. Beatings
 have been reported in police stations as well as on the
 street, often committed by persons not in police uniform
 but under circumstances which led the victims to conclude
 that the actions had been performed by police officials
 or accomplices. There have been no reports that the
 perpetrators of these actions have been either arrested
 or tried. To discredit human right activists, the
 Government has compelled some of them to be examined and
 treated at psychiatric institutions. According to the
 West German magazine Stern, Czechoslovak prison
 conditions are substandard. In August 1982 Stern
 published a highly critical article, including
 photographs smuggled out of prison, focussing on the
 treatment of political prisoners in Czechoslovak jails.
 The article reported that prison cells were small and
 unheated, and that prisoners complained that they
 received administrative punishments, such as reductions
 in pay and limitations on free time, bathing, and
 
 
 876
 exercise periods, for failing to meet unrealistically
 high work norms. The diet in Czechoslovak prisons is
 reliably reported to be so deficient that prisoners often
 require special medical treatment upon release. Amnesty
 International has also reported inadequate medical care
 in the cases of several political prisoners. In a letter
 to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, dated June 21,
 1982, the Charter 77 spokesmen complained about the
 situation in Czechoslovak prisons.
 There are three categories of imprisonment, with corres-
 pondingly harsher regimes of incarceration for more
 serious crimes and recidivists. Visits to prisoners by
 family members are limited, and the frequency with which
 visits are allowed varies according to the category of
 imprisonment. Political prisoners have reported that
 they are subjected to harsher treatment, not only by
 guards, but by fellow inmates. There are no reports that
 treatment accorded prisoners varies according to social
 class, race, sex, or religion. In practice, effective
 redress for cruel and degrading treatment does not appear
 to exist. There are no summary executions, however, and
 the death penalty is imposed only for particularly
 heinous crimes, after mandatory judicial review and
 consideration of executive clemency.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 estimated at approximately 100. This figure is imprecise
 because the Government does not recognize persons who are
 imprisoned because of their political or religious
 beliefs as a special category of prisoner. Political
 defendants have been tried and convicted on the basis of
 sweeping charges, such as *damaging the interests of the
 Republic.' In one case, political activist Ivan Jirous
 and three other defendants were sentenced to varying
 terms for drug possession.  It appears, however, that
 the drug "possession" was arranged by security police,
 who wanted to see the defendants convicted on a more
 obviously criminal charge. It appears that Jirous, for
 whom this was a fourth conviction, is being incarcerated
 as a "third-class," or harshest-regime, prisoner.
 Detained persons can be held up to 48 hours without
 charges, although in practice this period is often
 exceeded. It is common for human rights activists, such
 as signers of Charter 77, to be picked up repeatedly and
 held for the statutory 48-hour period as a form of
 harassment. Under Czechoslovak law, a person can be held
 in jail for up to two months while being interrogated,
 and this two-month limit on pre-trial detention can be
 extended by the prosecutor at will.  There have been
 cases, such as those of seven human rights activists held
 varyingly from May 1981 to the March/May period of 1982,
 which did not go to trial, but in which neither charges
 were dropped nor the cases closed. Under Czechoslovak
 law, which is patterned on the Napoleonic code, the right
 of habeas corpus does not exist.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 
 877
 Czechoslovak law requires that all trials be public and
 that the accused be given the right to counsel, be
 informed of the charges, and be given an opportunity to
 present a defense. In practice, however, there are
 significant restrictions on these legal guarantees for
 those charged with political crimes. Public access to
 trials of persons charged with political offenses is
 denied; only selected supporters of the regime and a
 limited number of relatives are admitted to the
 courtroom. Efforts by diplomatic representatives and
 other interested persons to attend such trials have been
 unsuccessful. Although counsel may visit the accused,
 both before and after the trial, a police officer is
 often present to monitor the meetings. Lawyers are known
 to have been disbarred after too vigorous a defense of
 human rights activists. Defendants may exercise the
 right to defend themselves in court and are occasionally
 successful in having charges dismissed or downgraded at
 the original trial or on appeal. For example, in March
 1982, Drahomira Sinoglova received a Presidental
 amnesty. This was the first time that such an amnesty
 had been granted to a human rights activist in
 Czechoslovakia.
 The courts have only limited independence and are effec-
 tively under the regime's control. Judges can be removed
 by either the Federal Assembly or the National Councils
 of the Czech or Slovak Republics. Civilians are tried by
 military courts only in special circumstances, including
 cases of espionage. All verdicts and sentences can be
 appealed to at least one higher court by either the
 defendant or the prosecutor, or both.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home. A search warrant is required from the prosecutor
 unless there is insufficient time to obtain one. There
 are widespread reports of house searches without
 warrants, however. Evidence obtained in such
 unauthorized searches is, in practice, routinely
 admissible in court. The homes of human rights activists
 are often closely watched by the police in order to
 curtail access by Western newsmen or others. There
 appears to be widespread use of wiretapping and
 'bugging*, particularly of the residences and telephones
 of persons who are politically suspect.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press ar,@ guaranteed in the Consti-
 tution, provided that the exercise of these freedoms is
 "consistent with the interests of the working people.*
 In practice, however, these freedoms are not respected.
 Czechoslovak citizens may not publicly express views
 contrary to the "principles of a socialist state" or
 sharply criticize the Czechoslovak Communist Party or
 
 
 878
 their Government in an open fashion. It is impossible to
 determine the extent of the use of police informers,
 electronic surveillance, and violations of the mail,
 means by which freedom of speech is curtailed in
 Czechoslovakia. The population assumes that these
 measures are employed constantly and pervasively and
 tailors its behavior accordingly.
 The mass media are completely controlled by the state and
 operate under the direct supervision of the party.
 Consequently, few people look to Czechoslovak mass media
 as a source of reliable information, except for sports or
 weather news. Many prominent journalists, writers, and
 other intellectuals who supported liberalization in 1968
 are no longer allowed to practice their profession or
 have gone into either voluntary or involuntary exile.
 Only a few Western periodicals are allowed into the
 country, and these are unobtainable by the man in the
 street. Printing and reproduction devices, other than
 typewriters, are controlled by the Interior Ministry, and
 it is illegal for citizens to possess one. Reproduction
 of authorized printed material is limited to eleven
 typewritten copies, and reproduction of 'subversive'
 materials is a criminal offense.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution in
 order for citizens "to take an active part in the
 administration of the state and in the economic and
 cultural development of the country." In practice,
 freedom of assembly and association is severely limited.
 No public meeting can be held without the permission of
 the police. All professional groups and all labor union
 organizations are completely controlled by the state, and
 no independent groups are allowed to exist. Professional
 and union groups exist to further the directives and
 philosophy of the Communist Party. Such groups are
 merely organs of the state and party. Persecution of
 individuals can occur through expulsion from a
 professional organization, which is tantamount to
 withdrawal of permission to practice the profession.
 The trade union movement is organized "under the
 guidance" of the Communist Party, as provided for in the
 Constitution. Worker membership is virtually
 obligatory. Strikes, collective bargaining, and lobbying
 are not permitted. Workers are expected to carry oht
 directives to fulfill the centrally promulgated economic
 plan and have little influence over production policy.
 In some cases, however, workers have been able to bring
 about changes in their working conditions. The right and
 duty to work are guaranteed in the Constitution. In
 practice, persons who hold political views at variance
 with those of the regime have found it difficult to
 retain the positions for which they were trained and have
 been forced into menial jobs, such as window-washers,
 stokers, and street cleaners. The International Labor
 Organization has faulted the Czechoslovak Government for
 this unjust practice. The threat of economic deprivation
 
 
 879
 is also used as an effective method of political control.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice
 religion are guaranteed in the Constitution. In
 practice, however, the state rigorously regulates and
 limits religious activity and employs anti-religious
 propaganda. Clergy are paid by the state and require a
 state license to be assigned to a parish or congregation
 where they may work. Their activities and public
 statements, including sermons and homilies, are closely
 monitored by government authorities. The state must
 authorize the printing and distribution of religious
 literature. At least three Czechoslovaks were arrested
 in 1982 for alleged conspiracy in the distribution of
 Bibles. Conviction for this offense could result in up
 to five years' imprisonment.
 Religious education, proselytizing, and education of new
 clergy are carefully limited, and only those religious
 groups recognized by the state are permitted to operate.
 Male religious orders are not permitted in Czechoslovakia
 and members of female orders (which are not allowed to
 accept new members) are restricted to nursing and the
 care of the elderly in outlying areas. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses and Mormons are explicitly outlawed.
 Overt religious activity usually results in effective
 disqualification for advancement in most fields. The
 limits on such activity may be slightly looser in
 Slovakia, a more openly Catholic area, than in the Czech
 lands. However, young Catholics in the Bratislava area
 appear to have become the target of a government drive to
 stop the spread of evangelism. In August 1982,
 approximately 150 young Catholics were reported to have
 been interrogated for 8-11 hours each, and some were
 detained, without being charged, for the entire allowable
 48 hours.
 Nominally, about 11 million Czechoslovaks are Catholics
 and just over one million are Protestants. Very few
 persons, however, regularly attend church services.
 Various priests and senior Catholic clergy have been
 co-opted into a pro-government organization of Catholics,
 known as "Pacem in Terris'. It appears that affiliation
 of Czecholovak priests with this organization falls under
 the proscription of the Vatican decree of March 8, 1982,
 circumscribing political activity by priests. However,
 the regime has evidenced a vehement determination to
 oppose implementation of this decree in Czechoslovakia.
 The state religious authorities have published a number
 of articles criticizing the position of the church on
 this matter in an effort to maintain the Pacem in Terris
 organization in being as a politically useful
 instrument. All Protestant churches (except the Seventh
 Day Adventists) are institutional members of the
 Czechoslovak branch of the Christian Peace Conference,
 also an organization which adheres in to the official
 
 
 880
 "peace" policies of the Czechoslovak regime. Claiming
 exemption from militaryservice on the basis of
 conscientious objection can lead to jail penalties of
 several years, as can individual organization of peace
 activities.
 The Jewish Community, numbering several thousand, has a
 central religious organization financially supported and
 controlled by the government. There are synagogues and
 prayer houses. In addition, there is a Jewish Museum,
 operated by the state. There are no Jewish schools or
 rabbinical seminaries, but one Czech Jew is attending a
 rabbinical seminary abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although freedom of movement within Czechosolvakia is not
 restricted, travel in some areas near the borders or in
 the-vicinity of-military installations is proscribed.
 Travel by-Czechs and Slovaks to other East European
 -communist',countries is coming under increasing
 restrictlrons. Travel to Poland was severely curtailed
 immediately after martial law was declared, but this has
 been-re-taced a bit.recently to allow those who have
 personal invitations to travel to Poland. These
 restrictions:were likely introduced to try to control
 insofar as possible any spread to'Czechoslovakia of the
 contagion which saw workers in Poland defying their
 government. 'Through requirements to change a fairly
 large amount of currency,.and also possibly through a
 limit on the number of trips per year, cross-border
 shopping trips to Hungary have effectively been stopped.
 A special passport has been introduced, valid only for
 trips to Yugoslavia, in an attempt to limit the growing
 practice of Czechoslovak citizens traveling permanently
 to the West via Yugoslavia. Travel to Western countries
 is difficult since travelers must obtain permission and,
 unless visiting close relatives, a hard currency
 allocation. Travelers to the West usually must leave
 some member of the immediate family at home to ensure the
 travelers' return. These restrictions are relaxed,
 however, for retirees.
 Obtaining permission to emigrate is a long and arduous
 process, especially for persons in political opposition
 to the Government. Applicants must endure long waits and
 may suffer such reprisals as demotion or loss of job
 after applying. There are no special barriers, however,
 .to-a person's emigrating to join his or her foreign
 spouse. Czechoslovakia denies the right of repatriation
 by divesting of their citizenship certain emigres whom it
 does not wish to see return. Such.harsh measures are
 generally used only in political cases involving
 prominent human rights activists. Emigration passports
 are not valid for return to Czechoslovakia without
 special-endorsement. Voluntary expatriation is
 frequently a condition for permission to emigrate, parti-
 cularly in cases where the emigrant does not have close
 relatives abroad. Not uncommonly, prominent human rights
 
 
 881
 activists are offered release from prison solely on condi-
 tion that they agree to emigrate and renounce their
 citizenship.
 The only significant refugee group within the country is
 comprised of communists who have fled from non-communist
 countries. The largest such group are Greek communists,
 but others, including Spaniards, Indonesians, and
 Americans, are also known to reside in Czechoslovakia.
 There are no known instances of forced repatriations of
 members of these groups to their countries of origin.
 There is a significant outflow of refugees from
 Czechoslovakia, however, comprised primarily of persons
 who leave the country legally on vacation to non-Warsaw
 Pact European countries and choose not to return. The
 number of such refugees may be as high as ten to fifteen
 thousand annually, but precise figures are unavailable.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All significant decisions regarding the Government, the
 economy, and society are made exclusively by the leader-
 ship of the Communist Party. Meaningful participation in
 the political process is enjoyed only by members of the
 party, and, within the party, only by a very limited
 number of top officials. Ordinary citizens, especially
 those who are not party members, have no role in the
 process of selecting their leaders or in making important
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political
 parties are permitted to organize and to publish their
 own newspapers, but they must conform their activities to
 the line of the ruling Communist Party.
 There is little evidence of meaningful public discussion
 of social, political, or economic issues. In general,
 the people are informed, not consulted, about decisions
 of the party and the Government. It is exceedingly rare
 for differences of opinion, let alone dissenting votes,
 in the federal assembly or in the party central committee
 to receive any publicity. Where such differences become
 known, it is almost always the result of a painstaking
 process of reading between the lines of newspaper or
 other reports of meetings rather than through a public
 airing.
 Women are equal under the law, and small, token numbers
 of women in fact appear in the professions and
 higher-ranking party, government, and management
 positions. Perhaps as a reflection of generally poor
 representation of women in positions of authority in
 Czechoslovak society, women seem to be strongly
 represented in "dissident" circles. There is usually one
 woman among the three Charter 77 spokesmen, for example.
 About 600,000 Hungarians live in Czechoslovakia,
 primarily in Slovakia along the border with Hungary.
 Primary education in Hungarian is provided for children
 in these areas, as well as Hungarian language radio and
 television programs, newspapers, and magazines for the
 adult populace. Hungarians are proportionately
 
 
 882
 represented in federal and local legislative bodies, but
 are under-represented in prestigious jobs in the economy
 and the state apparatus. The only other sizable minority
 group in Czechoslovakia are Gypsies, who number about
 250,000 persons and are generally viewed by Czechs and
 Slovaks as occupying a lower social stratum.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 Czechoslovakia signed the Final Act of the Conference on
 Security and Cooperation in Europe at Helsinki in 1975.
 .Nonetheless, the Czechoslovak Government has since
 reacted strongly to expressions of concern about human
 rights violations in Czechoslovakia by governmental and
 non-governmental institutions in other countries. In the
 past it has delayed or refused visas to members of
 international human rights organizations.
 There are two unofficial groups within Czechoslovakia
 that concern themselves with human rights. One is
 'Charter 77; the other the Committee for the Defense of
 the Unjustly Persecuted. Charter 77 has issued several
 studies on topics such as the standard of living, the
 plight of pensioners, and the right to travel abroad, and
 has issued two statements concerning martial law in
 Poland. The Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted concentrates on abuses of the judicial system
 and relies on public records and reports from friends and
 relatives of accused persons in issuing communiques on
 cases where it believes the police, the courts, or the
 prisons have abused citizens' civil or human rights.
 These communiques are regularly distributed to
 Czechoslovak authorities.
 As a result of their activities, members of both these
 groups have suffered considerable persection, including
 loss of jobs, detentions, loss of educational
 opportunities for their children, imprisonment, and minor
 harassment, such as suspension of driving licenses and
 police surveillance.  Because of this treatment, a
 significant number of members of both groups have
 emigrated from Czechoslovakia. Thus, while they continue
 to provide a moral witness to the illegalities of the
 regime, their effectiveness is strictly limited by
 harassment, imprisonment of their members, and
 emigration. A letter from the Charter 77 spokesmen to
 the Czechoslovak President on May 3, 1982 documents
 charges of blackmail and intimidation of relatives and
 friends of Charter 77 activists.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Czechoslovakia has.an advanced, centrally-planned economy
 'and-a sophi-sticated and well-educated populace which has
 long been in contact,-with the main currents of Western
 European thought, and-tradition. The two main ethnic
 groups -- the*Czechs.rmnd the Slovaks, however, have had
 different historical-eixpvriences and development. The
 
 
 883
 accommodation of the interests and aspirations of both
 ethnic groups within a single country has not always been
 a smooth process. Slovak resentment of the longstanding
 domination of the central Government by the more numerous
 Czechs led to the adoption in 1968 of the present federal
 system, in which some functions are delegated to separate
 Czech and Slovak Governments, and in which Slovaks are
 more heavily represented than previously in federal
 institutions. Gustav Husak, the current party leader, is
 a Slovak.
 Although both the Czechs and the Slovaks were long under
 the domination of outsiders, they had a remarkably
 successful experience with democracy under Tomas Masaryk
 from the founding of the modern Czechoslovak state in
 1918 until the Nazi takeover in 1938. Since the
 imposition of communist rule in 1948, the people of
 Czechoslovakia have been subjected to a tightly
 authoritarian system of government under the control of
 the Czechoslovak Communist Party. For a brief period in
 1968 -- known as the 'Prague Spring' -- the party under
 Dubcek flirted briefly with liberalization to bring
 "socialism with a human face' to Czechoslovakia. This
 historic period demonstrated that the desire for
 participatory democracy still strongly existed among the
 people and even within the Communist Party. The
 experiment ended in August 1968 with the invasion of
 Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and four other members
 of the Warsaw Pact. An estimated 80,000 Soviet troops
 were stationed permanently in the country from that time
 on. Soviet influence over Czechoslovak internal (and
 foreign) policies continues.
 The basic needs of the Czechoslovak people for adequate
 food and health care are met, and the stable, largely
 urbanized population enjoys a reasonably confortable
 material existence. Health care is universally available
 and is administered and financed by the Government,
 although there are reports that prompt treatment is
 sometimes secured only through bribes. Average life
 expectancy at birth is 71.2 years (1980 figures) and the
 infant mortality rate is 16.6 per 1000 live births (1981
 figures). There are occasional deficiencies of supplies
 and services, but these are attributable more to economic
 constraints or management deficiencies than to deliberate
 neglect. The average diet is more than adequate, with
 139 percent of calorie supply available for consumption
 as a percentage of the normal nutritional requirement
 (1977). Past consumption of meat has been at a level of
 approximately 85 kilos per capita annually. This level
 was to have been reduced to 80 kilos per capita in 1982,
 however, in a move linked to the limitation of hard
 currency feed grain imports. The Czechoslovak diet is
 relatively heavy in fats and carbohydrates, which is
 primarily a reflection of the preferences of the populace.
 Education is compulsory to 15 years of age. Literacy is
 nearly universal. The adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio (1979 figures) is 92 percent for the total
 population. Secondary and university education are free
 
 
 884
 of charge, but there are many reports that the selection
 of students for courses and schools, in particular those
 leading to more desirable careers, is based on their
 parents' political standing and reliability. Charter 77
 documented instances of this pratice in a June 1, 1982
 document on the education of children. Access to higher
 education thus serves as an instrument of control over a
 large segment of the population. Opportunities also
 exist for evening study at the advanced secondary and
 technical level.
 Czechoslovakia has had a rising standard of living since
 the end of World War II, but recent figures show a
 tapering off. GNP per capita is $5,290 (1979 figures).
 Czechoslovak society was relatively egalitarian during
 the years of the Republic (1918-1938). The result of
 more than 30 years of communist rule has been a
 comprehensive leveling of the economic life of the
 population, with neither great wealth nor great poverty
 remaining. There is also a pension system which provides
 a minimum income. In addition, some retirees are allowed
 to supplement their pension payments by working. Nonethe-
 less, access to goods and services varies significantly,
 with elites among Communist Party members, artists, and
 athletes having living standards far above the norm.
 About 90 percent of Czechoslovak women of working age are
 employed. Most have lower paying and less skilled jobs
 than their male counterparts, but equal pay for equal
 work is practiced in almost all cases. There are
 inconsistencies in the responsibilities many women are
 asked to assume, however. They are encouraged to join
 the work force but at the same time are offered
 incentives to have children. These incentives have been
 relatively ineffective, as shown by a population growth
 rate of only 0.7 percent (1980), perhaps because women
 generally are expected to do all the housework and child
 care in addition to their full-time employment outside
 the home.
