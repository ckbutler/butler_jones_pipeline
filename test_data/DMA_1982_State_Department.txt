 DOMINICA
 Like other former British colonies in the West Indies, Dominica
 has inherited a Westminster-style system of parliamentary
 democracy. But since it achieved independence from the United
 Kingdom in 1978, the small island nation has suffered almost
 continuously from a combination of natural disasters and
 political unrest. Prime Minister Eugenia Charles' election in
 May 1979 followed a year of gross mismanagement marked by a
 general strike and the resignation of her predecessor, whose
 corrupt and inefficient caretaker government provoked
 widespread protest.
 Dominica's tradition of political unrest have not abated during
 Miss Charles' administration. She has had to contend with an
 insurrection and kidnapping by armed Rastafarian cultists, the
 disaffection of the Dominican Defense Force, and two armed
 attempts to overthrow her government. In an effort to defuse
 the potentially volatile situation, the Prime Minister has
 disbanded the Defense Force and absorbed the responsibility of
 managing the police force herself. Likewise, the Prime
 Minister runs the Government almost single-handedly. She has
 twice declared a state of emergency, the latest of which ended
 on March 31, 1982.
 Dominica's conservative, democratic government continues to
 enjoy widespread support and the Prime Minister's personal
 popularity and political base are well established. Much of
 the opposition has been thoroughly discredited by scandals and
 involvement in coup plotting.
 Though Dominica remains the least developed of the Eastern
 Caribbean states, its economy is regaining forward momentum as
 a result Of careful financial management. Timely infusions of
 disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance have enabled
 Dominica to show significant recovery in the production of
 bananas, the country's principal money-earning crop. Despite
 the economic improvement, however, Dominica will have to
 continue to rely heavily on external assistance for the
 foreseeable future.
 Despite these recent difficulties, Dominica has had a good
 human rights record. The longer term situation may depend on
 strengthening the country's institutions and economy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports in 1982 of killing for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearances in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is expressly prohibited by the Constitution. There
 have been no reports that it was practiced in 1982.

 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is expressly prohibited by the Constitution, and
 there have been no reports of its occurrence.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that anyone arrested shall be brought
 before a court within 72 hours. Arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment are constitutionally prohibited and the Dominican
 Government abides by these provisions. In April 1981, former
 Prime Minister Patrick John and a small band of followers,
 primarily made up of unemployed members of the disbanded
 Defense Force, ineptly staged the first of two attempted coups
 to overthrow Prime Minister Charles' Government and install
 John in her stead. The US citizens who were enlisted to
 support the coup were tried and convicted in New Orleans in
 August 1981. A second unsuccessful coup in December 1981
 sought John's release from prison prior to his trial.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominica provides for public trials before an independent and
 impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence, and
 defendants are allowed legal counsel. Whenever it is believed
 that any of these conditions of judicial rights have been
 violated, an appeal can be registered.
 Such action has been taken in the case of the coup/plot trial.
 Former Prime Minister Patrick John and three other officials
 were finally brought to trial in May 1982 after a series of
 postponements. The court's decision was in favor of the
 defense whose no-case motion was accepted by the judge.
 Subsequent press reports indicated that the jury returned a
 verdict of guilty twice before the judge dismissed the verdict
 as unacceptable and directed the jury to release John. The
 Dominican Government appealed the decision based on legal
 errors arising from the judge's alleged bias in favor of the
 defense. On December 7, 1982, the West Indies Associated
 States Court of Appeal, meeting in St. Vincent, handed down a
 decision upholding the appeal lodged by the Dominican
 Government. The court's decision ordered the rearrest and
 trial of three of the original four defendents (one was
 acquitted) on charges of plotting to overthrow the Eugenia
 Charles Government.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search, and none
 have been reported.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The constitutional guarantees in these areas were upheld before
 and during the 1980 elections and have been fully observed
 since then, except during the state of emergency, which has now
 expired. Dominica's small press community has taken an
 independent and sometimes critical view of the Government
 without suffering any interference or suppression. Newspapers
 are published by independent publishers, the Catholic Church,
 unions, and a leftist political party.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is scrupulously observed and
 opposition groups are free to rally. Trade unions are
 permitted to organize and enjoy the right to strike. Labor
 unions are small in number and do not constitute a viable
 political force. Women enjoy full access to all these
 freedoms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion, except for the Rastafarian cult.
 Membership in the cult is forbidden by the 1975 'Dread Act"
 passed after members were found to have engaged in criminal
 activities. The act, while still on the books, is "suspended,'
 according to the Government, and there is no evidence that it
 is enforced, despite continued involvement of Rastafarians in
 criminal activities, including a kidnapping-murder in 1981 and
 a drug-related murder in 1982. Religious groups, including
 Rastafarians, have been politically active in the recent past
 and have been allowed full scope for their activities. The
 predominant Christian denominations in Dominica are Anglican
 and Roman Catholic. There is a small but growing Muslim
 community on the island.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Dominica is a parliamentary democracy patterned after the
 British model. Four political parties covering the ideological
 spectrum participated in the 1980 elections. They have
 continued to operate at levels consistent with their actual
 degree of public support and internal cohesiveness. Political
 rights, except for assembly and association, continued
 unhindered during the recent state of emergency, when even
 supporters of the detained former prime minister were permitted
 to be politically active. Women have full rights under the law
 and are active in the political system; the Prime Minister and
 a Junior Minister are women, as are several other government
 officials.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government's strict attention to legal procedure and
 openness to judicial review in its conduct of the state of
 emergency of early 1981 elicited uniformly favorable regional
 comment. It was responsive to inquiries from the press, other
 governments and Amnesty International concerning the treatment
 of individual detainees. There are no branches of
 international human rights organizations in Dominica, nor is
 there any local body active in monitoring human rights
 violations. Freedom House's 1982 report classified Dominica as
 "free.'

 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Dominica is a small and poor country with a population of
 80,000 people. Starting from a 1970 per capita income of about
 $300, generated largely from its single cash crop of bananas,
 slow progress is being made in improving social services and
 raising overall wealth. The 1979 per capita income was
 estimated at $400, while the infant mortality rate, one of the
 few measured indicators of social welfare, fell from 58.3 per
 thousand live births to 19.6. Other indicators, such as
 literacy as the percent of calorie supply available relative to
 nutritional requirements, were constant at adequate if
 sometimes minimal levels. Dominica has had a low population
 growth rate, constant at about 1.7 percent, resulting from a
 moderately high birth rate and increasing life expectancy
 counterbalanced by emigration of a high proportion of the
 population, with the loss of human capital this implies.
 Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 to 14, and
 literacy is estimated to be above 80 percent.
 Much of the inadequate infrastructure left by the colonial
 Government was destroyed by hurricanes in 1979 and 1980, as was
 the entire banana crop. Exports recently expanded (although
 into a fairly competitive market), and the Government has taken
 steps urgently to improve its revenues for the maintenance of
 vital services and infrastructure and to generate new funds for
 capital development. Inheriting a virtually bankrupt treasury,
 the Dominica Freedom Party Government has imposed fiscal
 responsibility and secured a three-year extended fund facility
 from the International Monetary Fund. Initiatives to obtain
 capital development aid and private investment have been
 pursued vigorously. The Dominican economy is now slowly
 looking up. Although much remains to be done, there is a
 tentative but emerging domestic consensus that with discipline
 and austerity as national requirements for all sectors,
 continued improvement can be registered.
