 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala's 1985 Constitution calls for election by universal suffrage of a one-
 term President, a unicameral Congress, and municipal officers; it mandates an inde-
 pendent judiciary and a Human Rights Ombudsman, who is elected by and reports
 to Congress. In 1992 President Jorge Serrano served his second year of a 5-year
 term. In January Congress elected new presidents of Congress and the Supreme
 Court. In August Congress reelected Ramiro de Leon Carpio as Human Rights Om-
 budsman.
 The armed forces operate with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, par-
 ticularly in security and military matters. The 43,000-man army, which has respon-
 sibility for national security, has been fighting a leftist insurgency for more than
 three. dcade,,s. The arm.s Mobile Military ,Plic (PMA)guards key facilities and
 traditionally has an anticrime role. Totl military expenditures or 1989, according
 to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, were $131 million. Although
 the defense budget for 1992 decreased in real terms, the 1993 budget will increase
 in real terms by approxmately 8 percent.
 The National Police (12,000 strong) and Treasury Police (2,000) report to the Inte-
 rior Minister. On March 4, the Interior Minister created the "Hunahpu" task force
 patrols composed of National Police, Treasury Police, and Mobile Military Lolice to
 combat rising commn crime. President Serrano broke with tradition in 19A1 and
 appointed a civilian as National Police Chief, as well as other civilians to senior po-
 sitions in the police and Ministry of Interior. In a May 1992 reshuffling, civilians
 were appointed Interior Minister and Police Chief, and seven military personnel
 were assigned to key advisory positions. Some 500,000 men serve in voluntary civil
 self-defense ommittees, commonly called Civil Defense Patrols (PAC's), some of
 which conduct counterinsurgency patrols in rural areas. The Human Rights Om-
 budsman and the Catholic Archbishop's Human Rights Office report that some PAC
 members were compelled tojo   in violation of the Constitution. Security forces and
 PAC's were reported to have committed numerous serious human rights violations
 in 1992.
 The agriculture-based, private sector-oriented Guatemalan economy grew approxi-
 mately 4.6 percent in 1992, producing an increase in per capita income of more than
 1.5 percent. Inflation stood at approximately 14 percent. During the fourth quarter,
 Guatemala entered into a standby agreement with the International Monetary
 Fund, requiring the central Government to balance its budget in 1993 for the third
 straight year, and signed a $120 million economic restructuring loan with the World
 Bank.
 Although there were some improvements in the human rights situation in 1992,
 serious human rights abuses occurred frequently. Statistics prepared by the Human
 Rights Ombudsman's office and the Archbishop's Human Rights Office showed a
 substantial drop during 1992 in reported human rights violations, particularly
 extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances. There was some progress in re-
 solving certain key cases, and none in others. While guerrilla groups are responsible
 for human rights abuses, human rights groups reported that the military, civil pa-
 trols, and police continued to commit a majority of the major violations, including
 extrajudicial killing and disappearances.
 Among positive developments, the Presidential Human Rights Commission issued
 its first report updating leading human rights cases, the army continued human
 rights training programs, and the Attorney General's office dedicated increased re-
 sources to preventing abuses against street children. President Serrano became the
 f-Irst Guatemalan chief executive to meet with Committee of Peasant Unity leaders,
 and he, as well as other Guatemalan officials and military officers, opened a dialog
 with Guatemalan and international human rights groups.
 By year's end, however, that dialog had deteriorated. President Serrano and mem-
 bers of his Cabinet strongly criticized both local and international human rights
 groups, claiming they distort Guatemala's human rights record for political pur-
 pses. Officials criticized the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Archbishop's Human
 Rights Office, and the US. Government or the protection they offered to kidnap vic-
 tim Maritza Urrutia. Senior officials denounced as improper interference in internal
 affairs expressions of U.S. Government concern over the court's verdict of "innocent
 in the case of an army officer implicated in the murder of American citizen Michael
 Devine (see Section la.). The Government showed intolerance for press criticism.
 Local human rights groups continued to be threatened and were victims of violent
 attacks. Although propss was made in investigating and prosecuting some past
 and present human rights abuses, the overall record was poor. Charges were dis-
 
 
 408
 missed against soldiers responsible for the August 1991 "railere  murders in
 Taxiscoa case which is still m the appeal process.
 Guerri las also committed numerous and serious human rights violations, includ.
 io extrmjudicial killings, kidnapmigs, forced labor- recruitment widespread use of
 mines and explosives, anda the use oT children in combat. Guerrilla attacks on infra-
 structure targets continued throughout the year.
 RESPECr FOR HUMAN RGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Induding reedon from
 a. Political and other Rrtrajudicial Killing.--Politically motivated killings contin-
 ued in 1992, although there were far fewer than in past years. The Human Rights
 Ombudsman confirmed 40 extrajudicial killi.s during the first 6 months of 1992,
 while another 209 complaints remained pending investigation. Of the 40 confirmed
 extrjudicial killings, 20  litical motivated murders were attributed to state secu-
 rity forces, 8 murders of criminal suspects were attributed to state security forces,
 and 12 politically motivated murders were attributed to guerrillas. The Ombuds-
 man's 1991 annual statistics reported 228 confirmed extrajudicial killings, with an-
 other 203 complaints pending investigation at year's end. Of the 228 confirmed
 extrajudicial killings, 130 politically motivated murders were attributed to state se-
 curity forces, 27 murders of criminal suspects were attributed to state security
 forces, and 71 politically motivated murders were attributed to guerrillas. The Arch-
 bishop's Human Rights Office reported 190 extrajudicial killings durn the first 6
 months of 1992, as compared to 575 for all of 1991, but did not break down the fig-
 ureas according to the responsible organizations.
 The security forces and persons associated with or protected by the army, such
 as the civil defense patrols or military commissioners, committed many of these
 killings, most of which took place in areas of guerrilla conflict. The security forces
 were reported to be involved in many vigilante killings. The Ombudsman, the Attor-
 ney General, and human rights groups have found evidence of killings by PAC's.
 PAC leaders are feared in many rural communities because they enjoy army back-
 ing and de facto immunity from prosecution. Security forces are rarely held account-
 able for human rights violations. With few exceptions, the Government failed to in-
 vestigate, detain, and prosecute perpetrators of extrajudicial killings. In 1992 an
 international team of forensic anthropologists worked to locate corpses of victims
 killed and buried in the early 1980's at clandestine rural cemeteries.
 The armed forces and civil patrols frequently threatened and sometimes killed
 human rights activists. The Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Communities (CERJ)
 is a rural-based human rights organization dedicated mainly to oppon involun-
 tary service in PAC's. Various CERJ members disappeared, were killed, or were
 threatened in 1992. CERJ member Esteban Tojm* disappeared on March 13 after re-
 ceiving threats dating back to 1990. A grenade exploded on May 10 at the Santa
 Cruz del Quiche home of CERJ leader Amilcar Mendez, who was in Guatemala City
 at the time. Mendez reported receiving numerous anonymous telephone threats. In
 October Mendez was charged with providing explosives to guerrillas, and a warrant
 was issued for his arrest. Mendez and the Human Rights Ombudsman alleged mili-
 tary personnel coerced a CERJ member into issuing a false confession implicating
 Mendez. Mendez returned to Quiche to face the charges on November 22 accom-
 panied by a U.S. Congressman, the U.S Charge d'Affaires, and a group of human
 rights monitors. After turning himself in to a Guatemalan judge,  endz was freed
 on his own recognizance, a decision appealed by the Guatemalan Attorney General's
 office.
 On January 17, drunken soldiers killed four people in Ciudad Peronia, a Guate-
 mala City suburb. The army arrested two suspects on January 21, both of whom
 were sentenced to death in a military appeals court on April 8. The soldiers escaped
 from jail on May 9. One was recaptured on July 6 and is appealing his death sen-
 tence; the other remains at large.
 On February 10, unidentified gunmen murdered 27-year-old San Carlos Univer-
 sity (USAC) professor Manuel Estuardo Pena, who was active in a variety of politi-
 cal organizations and social causes. The killing followed the January 30 bombing of
 USAG student union offices and coincided with numerous threats to USAC profes-
 sors and students, some of whom fled into exile. On April 10, members of a
 Hunahpu security unit fired on a group of USAC students after a confrontation dur-
 ing preparations for a parade, killing one and wounding seven others. Members of
 the unit were arrested. In November a court convicted six Hunahpu personnel for
 their role in the shooting and sentenced them to 12's years in prison.
 . There was some progress in certain other high-profile cases. The trial of'former
 government security agent Noel de Jesus Beteta Alvarez for the 1990 murder of
 
 
 409
 Guatemalan anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang trial began in August and was con-
 tinuing at year's end. On September 30, a military court sentenced six enlisted mili-
 tary men to 30 years for the 1990 murder of American citizen Michael Devine; a
 captain accused of involvement was found innocent, a decision appealed by the At-
 torney General. Two other charges against the captain are still pending. Senior offi-
 cers involved in covering up the case for 2 years have not been brought to trial. On
 July 19, an appellate court sentenced four policemen to 12 years in prison and a
 collective fine of approximately $1,000 for the March 1990 murder of treet child
 Nahamon Carmona Lopez.
 There was no progress in resolving the 1989 disappearances and murders of uni.
 versity students, the 1990 Hector Oqueli Colindres and Gilda Flores killings, the
 1990 disappearance of Maria Tiu Tojin and her daughter, the 1991 murder of police
 detective Jose Luis Merida Escobar, the 1991 "Traileres" killings in Taxisco, the
 1991 disappearance of Diego Domingo Martin, or past kidnapings and murders of
 various CERJ members. The Government's inability to controlor sanction those re-
 oponsible for human rights offenses is a major impediment to human rights
 Progress.
 b. Disappearane.-The Ombudsman's office received 65 complaints of forced dis-
 appearances during the first 6 months of 1992. Its investigations attributed respon-
 sibility to state security forces in three cases and to the guerrillas in six cases. Of
 the remaining cases, 14 victims reappeared alive, 3 victims were found dead, and
 39 complaints remained under investigation. Statistics for 1991 showed 112 com-
 laints of forced disappearances, of which 31 were attributed to the State and 14
 the guerrillas. The Archbishop's Human Rights Office reported 3 forced dis-
 appearances for the first 6 months of 1992, as compared to 144 in all of 1991. Credi-
 ble reports linked most political disappearances to persons connected with the
 armed forces. The Government did not identify or prosecute the perpetrators of any
 of the above disappearances.
 In June the remains of free-lance American journalists Nicholas Blake and Grif-
 fith Davis were located and identified with the assistance of the Guatemalan army,
 the Blake family, and the U.S. Embassy. They had disappeared in western Guate-
 mala in March 1985 while seeking to interview Guatemalan rebels. There are indi-
 cations that local civil patrol members killed the Americans for unknown reasons.
 On the morning of July 23, Maritza Urrutia, the former commonlaw wife of a
 guerrilla commander who had spent several years in exile in Mexico, was kidnaped.
 She was released on July 30, the day after local television broadcast a videotaped
 statement in which Urrutia acknowledged past links to the URNG, an umbrella
 group for guerrilla forces (a statement confirmed by the URNG). Urrutla sought ref-
 uge in the Guatemalan Archbishop's residence and met with the Human Rights Om-
 budsman. The U.. Embassy issued Urruiia a visa enabling her to visit the United
 States. The Guatemalan Government severely criticized the roles of the Ombuds-
 man, the Archbishop, and the U                 Urrutia case. According to press
 reports, Urrutia testified on September 30 before the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights that she believes Guatemalan military personnel abducted her
 and that she was mistreated during captivity. Her captors were well trained and
 had significant institutional resources, including a safe house, vehicles, video equip-
 ment and disciplined personnel.
 cTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Archbishop's Human Rights Office stated publicly that it did not document any
 cases of torture in 1992. Nevertheless, as in past years, many bodie were found
 throughout Guatemala bearing signs ofsever disigurement or post mortem mutila-
 tion. There were credible reports of torture and mistreatment by security forces, in-
 cluding use of excessive force by police at the time of arrest and of abusive treat-
 ment of persons in rural areas b the army, civil defense patrols, military commis-
 sioners, and police. Gangs and ot  criminals, as well as guerrillas, all use torture.
 The Government, especially the Attorney General's office, dedicated additional
 personnel and undertook increased efforts to end police abuse of street children in
 coordination with Casa Alianza, an organization dedicated to protecting the human
 rihts of street children. CaNs Alianza reported no extrajudicial killings of street
 children in 1992. There were however, numerous reports of policemen beating or
 illegally detaining street children. Case Alianza's staff also reported receiving nu-
 merous anonymous threats, and the brother of one staff member was kidnaped and
 held briefly, apparently in an attempt to intimidate staff members.
 d. Arbitra-y Arrest, Detention, or Ex.-A court-issued arrest warrant is required
 unless a person is caught in the act of committinga crime. Police may not detain
 a suspect for over 6 hours without bringing him before a judge. The law provides
 for bail, access to lawyers, and limits to 20 days the time anyone may be held, after
 
 
 410
 which he must be charged or freed. Authorities must produce detainees on request.
 Exile is prohibited under the Constitution.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there are frequent credible "reprs of arbitrary-ar-
 rest and incommunicado detention by security forces. Persons detained illegally and
 released subsecquently reported havin, been held at security force safe houses. Those
 responsible for.illejal detentions routinely ignore writs of habeas corpus.
 There was also increasing concern over apparent misuse of the 'udicial process to
 intimidate political opponents. Bail for Attorney General Aciscl Valiadares, a cru-
 sader against  mnity for human rights violators, who faces charges of covering up
 his brothe's afleged fraudulent transfer of real estate deeds, was fixed at an un-
 precedented amount. The Human Rights Ombudsman accused military personnel of
 coercing peasants into testifying against CERJ leader Amilcar Mendez. Investiga-
 tion into the activities of former Izabal Department Governor Lilian Vasquez de
 Guzman and alleged corruption by former Health Minister Miguel Montepeque ap-
 peared politically motivated.
 On September 25, three agents from the Department of Criminal Investigations'
 minors' unit arrested an American citizen for allegedly kidnaping a Guatemalan in-
 fant. In fact, the American was in the final stages of lepaly adopting the child and
 had legal custody until completion of that process. Polce arrested and imprisoned
 her without an arrest order and destroyed or hid documents confirming her legal
 custody of the child. She was released after the U.S. Embassy pretested-her illegal
 detention. The three police officers involved in the affair were dismissed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary composed of a Court of Constitutionality, a Supreme Court, appeals courts,
 and several courts of special jurisdiction, such as labor courts. Military courts have
 jurisdiction over militazy personnel, including military commissioners, but not civil-
 ian PAC members, thus limiting the ability of civil courts to prosecute persons
 under military control in human rights abuse cases. Civilian trials are public after
 the first 15 days, dedicated to an initial investigative phase that is closed to the
 public;, defendants have the right to be present at trials and to legal representation.
 An appeals court automatically reviews convictions.
 The judicial system is ineffective. Most human rights violations are not inves-
 tigated; security force personnel are reluctant to investigate cases involving col-
 leagues. Judges are susceptible to intimidation and corruption and suffer low pay
 bad working conditions, and low morale. Some judges succeeded in being excused
 from hearing prominent cases after alleging death threats. A total of 12 different
 judges were excused from the Myrna Mack Chang case, for example. In September
 the former judge in the Sister Diana Ortiz case publicly charged that the Supreme
 Court pressured lower court judges to decide cases in line with its wishes.
 Widespread recognition of defects led to congressional passage in late September
 of new criminal procedures and antinarcotics codes. The narcotics legislation went
 into effec in 1992, and the criminal procedure code will become effective after com-
 pletion of fundamental retraining o lawers and judges.The crinal procedures
 law will introduce oral proceedings (in bth Spanish and indigenous languages) open
 to the public, and a public defender program. The narcotics l!w criminalizes narcot-
 ics conspiracies, enacts stiff penalties for violators, and imposes civil damages on
 narcotics violators.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Priuacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home correspondence, and private doc-
 uments, provisions that are not always respected. Elements of the security forces
 continue to monitor private communications. Many human rights monitors reported
 receiving threats in the form of surveillance, telephone calls, and anonymous letters.
 Officials enforcing the military draft traditionally enter homes and places of busi-
 ness without legally required court orders. In Februar the army attempted to end
 such abuses in Quiche when it established the nations first draft board consisting
 of the zone military commander, the local representative of the Human Rights Orm-
 budsman's Office, and other civilian leaders. Under new recruitment practices also
 adopted in several other departments, potential recruits receive three induction no-
 tices, after which they are arrested if they do not report for enlistment. Under Gua-
 temalan law, such arrests must be effected pursant to a court order. Activists criti-
 cize the new procedures for not addressing the fact that indigenous men are re-
 quired to serve in the armed forces more frequently than nonindigenous men.
 The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary. However, army oMcers,
 military commissioners and PAC leaders often pressure men in conflict areas to be.
 come PAC members. There are credible reports that some who refuse to serve have
 been killed or suffered other abuses.
 
 
 g. Use of Exessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Guatemala's armed internal conflict entered its 32nd year in 1992 and con-
 tinued to be a cause of major human rights violations by both government and guer-
 rilla forces. Peace negotiations between the Government and the URNG guerrilla
 umbrella group continued inconclusively in 1992. Human rights issues were the pri-
 mary area of disagreement. On August 6, negotiators reached an accord on the PAC
 issue whereby the Government agreed to establish no new PAC's if the URNG re-
 frained from extending operations into new areas. No new PAC's have been estab-
 lished since the agreement was reached.
 A wave of bombings occurred throughout the capital in April and May. The per-
 petrators were never apprehended, but several rightwing and leftwing groups were
 thought to be responsible. Targets included government and private offices, busi-
 nesses, and schools.
 Communities in Resistance (CPR) claimed army aircraft bombed their civilian set-
 tlements on numerous occasions. In mid-July, for example, CPR representatives ac-
 cused the army of bombing a CPR near Ixcan, Quiche. The Defense Minister, who
 once commanded forces in that area, denied there had been any bombing and
 claimed guerrillas forced civilians to flee the region many years ago. CPR represent-
 atives produced unexploded bombs to support their allegations. The origin of the
 bombs has not been established.
 Guerrilla forces recruited children into their ranks. Government troops found
 Mario Catuj Salvador, a 12-year-old child guerrilla, after an armed engagement at
 Patulul, Suchitepequez. He had reportedly been forcibly recruited by guerrillas
 while working on a farm in Escuintla. Shortly thereafter, he died in a medical facil-
 ity of malnutrition, dehydration, diarrhea, and pneumonia.
 Guerrillas also hindered international relief efforts. On Februar  4 proximately
 40 "Guerrilla Army of the Poor" (EGP) troops intercepted and ki ape two United
 Nations refugee relief workers on a road between Nebai and Chajul, Quiche. The
 U.N. personnel were forced to walk to a nearby rebel stronghold altr their pickup
 truck was burned on the highway. They were released on February 6.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. A number of local human rights organizations, including the Human Rights
 Ombudsman's office and the Archbishop's Human Rights Office, regularly produce
 and distribute publications. These circulate freely, and their conclusions and asser-
 tions are widely reported in other publications and in the broadcast media. News-
 papers in particular have complained, however, about government interference and
 pressure to silence criticism of the actions of the President and his family and al-
 leged wrongdoing by the security forces.
 No journalists or media figures disappeared or were killed in 1992, but several
 reported receiving death threats. Two of the more prominent cases involved journal-
 ists from Prensa Libre; one of whom eventually requested and received political asy-
 lum in another country. In late August, a group of journalists claimed that armed
 judicial branch security guards threatened to kill them if coverage did not cease re-
 Warding the mysterious murder of the mother of Supreme Court President Juan Jose
 Rodil's personal secretary. In October the offices of Tinamit, a left-of-center maga-
 zine that is frequently critical of government and other public figures, was the object
 of a bombing that resulted in no injuries and little physical damage to the building.
 In December Siglo Veintiuno journalist Omar Cano was beaten, along with Treasury
 Police agents and representatives of government environmental agencies, in the
 presence of military personnel. Cano was investigating alleged illegal timber cutting
 in national parks and protected reserves. The nations media were outraged by the
 incident and directly accused members of the Guatemalan army of responsibility. To
 date there have been no prosecutions of those responsible for these crimes.
 Despite the alleged threats, the news media reported all major human rights sto-
 ries and publicized communiques from the URNG, leftist groups, and others opposed
 to the Government or its policies. Both major press organizations denounced inci-
 dents restricting freedom of the press and vowed to continue coverage of sensitive
 topics. Journalists themselves admit that significant self-censorship continues to im-
 pede full reporting on a variety of topics, including government human rights viola-
 tions, corruption of government officials and influential politicians, aspects of
 narcotrafficking, and issues affecting the economic interests of powerful individuals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution guarantees
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association: parades, rallies, marches, forums,
 debates, and seminars on various topics, including human rights, took place openly
 and freely. On October 12, for example, numerous protest rallies and parades
 marked the 500th anniversary of Columbus' arrival in the Americas without inci-
 
 
 412
 dent. Riot police used excessive force on some occasions in breaking up peaceful
 demonstrations. On July 21, riot police forcibly expelled from the Guatemala City
 central plaza protest marchers from the Quetzaltenango town of Cajola. That inci-
 dent and evictions of squatters prompted widespread criticism and condemnation.
 Freedom of political association is guaranteed under the Constitution, although
 organizations nominally require legal status, a cumbersome and expensive proce-
 dure. The Peace Briades, an international human rights monitoring organization,
 has been unable to obtain recognition despite persistent efforts. The absence of legal
 status does not, however, prevent Peace Brigades and other human rights organiza-
 tions from operating openly.
 c. Freedom of Rea]gon.-No state religion exists. Religious freedom is constitu-
 tionally guaranteed and is respected in practice.
 Religious personnel are sometimes threatened for political reasons. About 70 per
 cent of the population is nominally Catholic, but many other faiths operate freely.
 The President is an Evangelical Protestant.
 d. Freedom of Movement WithJin the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government did not restrict foreign travel, nor did it revoke citi-
 zenship for political reasons. Movement inside Guatemala was unrestricted except
 in some conflict areas. Guerrillas continued to establish road blocks, assault private
 citizens to demand "war taxes," attack petroleum trucks, and limit travel in certain
 rural areas. The army, military commissioners, and PAC's also limited travel in
 some areas.
 Nobel laureate and indigenous leader Rigoberta Menchu visited Guatemala twice
 in 1992 and traveled to rural areas. Other politically active Guatemalans who had
 gone into exile returned. On February 28, political activist and former Socialist
 Party vice presidential candidate Luis Zurita returned to Guatemala from exile. On
 March 19, former Rebel Armed Forces political leader Gonzalo Danilo Rodriguez re-
 ceived official amnesty, established a political party, and began publishing political
 articles frequently in the local press.
 Repatriation of refugees continued. An estimated 1,600 refugees returned to Gua-
 temala in the first 8 months of 1992 under the sponsorship of international groups
 and the Government's committee on refugee affairs. The Government and represent-
 atives of the Guatemalan refugee communities in Mexico signed an agreement on
 October 8 allowing the orderly, voluntary, large-scale return of refugees to their
 homeland.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&" The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guatemalans have the right to change their government by peaceful and demo-
 cratic means. Universal suffrage by secret ballot exists for those 18 years of age and
 older;, there are no property or literacy requirements. Voting is not mandatory. The
 last national elections, which international observers found free and fair, were held
 in January 1991. Members of the armed forces may not vote.
 Indigenous people enjoy equal rights under the Constitution. There are some in-
 digenous Congressmen, army officers (including one eneral), government officials,
 and judges. Neverteless, pervasive discrimination limits opportunities for indige-
 nous people to assume prominent roles in Guatemalan politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups and organizations are permitted to operate in Guate-
 mala but members suffered threats and violence from securit, forces and PAC's. As
 noted in Section 1.a., members of the human rights organization CERJ disappeared,
 were killed, and were threatened in 1992. The Office of the Human Rights Ombuds-
 man remained the most reliable source of objective information on human rights
 practices, issuing many reports critical of both the Government and the guerrillas.
 ongress reelected Ramiro do Leon Carpio Human Rights Ombudsman, and his of-
 fice moved into a new building in downtown Guatemala City with improved facili-
 ties. Relations between the executive branch and the Ombudsman's office were
 tense at times, and high-ranking government officials working in the fields of
 human rights and jurisprudence have complained publicly and privately of receiving
 death threats stemming from their interest in resolving cases related to human
 rights violations, official corruption, and narcotraflicking. The Ombudsman contin-
 ued to enjoy widespread public support and respect.
 The Government officially welcomed, but at times criticized, international human
 rights groups. Senior Guatemalan officials met representatives of numerous foreign
 and international officials and activists. United Nations human rights expert Chris-
 tian Tomuschat received the cooperation of the Guatemalan Government, and his
 
 
 413
 critical comments received widespread press coverage. Foreign forensic anthropolo-
 sts and human rights groups took part in the location and exhumation of clandes-
 tine cemeteries. Nevertheless, the Defense Minister threatened to prosecute forensic
 anthropologist Clyde Snow for defamation after Snow attributed certain past human
 rights abuses to the Guatemalan military. Both local and international human
 rights groups were criticized by President Serrano and members of his Cabinet, who
 accused them of intentionally distorting Guatemala's human rights record for politi-
 cal purposes.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race Se:, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 One-half of the population is culturally indigenous and the rest Hispanic. Indige-
 nous people remain largely outside the country's political, economic, social, and cul-
 tural mainstream. Indigenous people suffered most of the serious human rights
 abuses described above. Rural indigenous men were more likely than urban counter-
 parts to be drafted by the army or recruited forcibly by guerrilla .group.
 Rural indigenous people have limited educational opportunites and thus have
 limited employment opportunities, iliteracy is prevalent n indigenous communities.
 Many Guatemalans d not speak Spanish. Linguistic barriers hinder interaction
 with the Government and limit access to public services, including the judiciary, be-
 cause few officials speak indigenous languages.
 Women are active in the labor force, especally in the textile industry, agriculture,
 retail business, and in lower-paying public sector jobs. Several women hold promi-
 nent political positions, including Cabinet posts. Despite legal protection, women
 face job discrimination and receive lower pay than men. CONAVIGUA, an indige-
 nous widows' organization prominent in the advocacy of women's and human rights
 issues, reports that violence against women, including domestic violence, remains
 common but receives little attention. Criminal sexual violence often gwes unreported
 by victims, and relatively few rape cases came to court. The Deputy Human Rights
 Ombudsman, a woman, monitors violations of women's rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1947 Labor Code provide
 workers freedom of association and the right to form and join trade unions. As a
 result of a tripartite negotiating prcess including labor, management, and govern-
 ment, the Labor Code was amended in late 1992 to facilitate freedom of association,
 to strengthen the rights of working women to increase penalties for violations of
 labor laws and to enhance the role of the Laor Ministry and labor courts in enforc-
 ing the Labor Code. These amendments entered into force in 1992. All workers have
 the right to form or join unions, including public sector employees. Between 5 and
 8 percent of the work force is organized. The 890 unions in the country are inde-
 pendent of government and political party domination.
 The Labor Code amendments simplify the process for unions seeking legal status,
 which has long been criticized by U.S. labor organizations as excessively cam-
 bersome, by ei'minating a number of previsions, including one that required the
 President of the country to sign the final papers. Workers have the right to strike,
 but Labor Code procedures make legal strikes cumbersome, for example by requir
 ing a two-thirds vote. Most strikes occur without legal authorization, and in practice
 the Government makes no effort to intervene on the basis of illegality. However, the
 lack of legal sanction for a strike can be used as a threat against strikers. For exam-
 ple, during a series of work stoppages by civil servants in July, some government
 officials threatened to take legal acton against union leaders for pursuing an illegal
 strike. Organized labor's structural weaknesses, a paucity of membership funds, and
 a poor overall economic situation with high unemployment an und eremployment
 limit the duration of virtually all strikes.
 By law, union leaders may serve only one term in a particular union office, but,
 by rotating union positions, the same persons can stay on union executive bards
 for extended periods of time. The Constitution and the 1992 law protect the right
 of political participation for individuals, including trade union leaders. Unions may
 andde form federations and confederations and join international organizations.
 With very few exceptions, trade unions depend on assistance received from inter-
 national contacts.
 A "solidarity" movement is active, claiming approximately 100,000 members in
 over 350 companies. Unions may legally continue to operate in workplaces which
 have solidarity associations, and workers have the right to choose between the two
 or belong to both. The Government views these associations as civic organizations
 which need not interfere with the functioning of trade unions. Article 214 of the
 amended Labor Code stipulates that trade unions have the exclusive right to bar-
 gain collectively over work conditions on behalf of workers. Critics charge that soli-

 darity associations are promoted by management to rival labor unions. There are
 credible reports that, at times, democratic principles are not adhered to in the for-
 mation and management of some of these associations, and workers are unable to
 participate fully and freely in decision making. Similar credible charges are made
 against some trade union organizations.
 There were credible reports during the year of threats of violence against union
 leaders or members, including in the high-profile "maquila* (drawback, or in-bond
 export) sector. Public sector union leaders also reported receiving threats against
 themselves and their families, coinciding with union demands for improved benefits.
 At the re   st of trade union leaders the independent Human Rights Ombuds-
 man, through his office for economic and social issues follows complaints related to
 trade union activities. Union leaders and workers filed a number of complaints with
 the Ombudsman during the year, and the Ombudsman spoke out publicly to con-
 demn the use of violence or threats against those seeking social justice. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association regretted
 in November that the Government had failed to reply to new allegations regarding
 15 murders, as well as physical attacks, abductions, death threats, and 58 arrests
 of trade unionists in 1991. There were no reports of murders of union leaders in
 1992.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, but often face discriminatory antiunion actions by
 employers. The new labor amendments provide that workers cannot be dismissed
 for participating in the formation of a trade union. Article 78 of the Labor Code,
 one of th.k more hotly contested changes, establishes the right of employers to fie
 workers for cause and prmits workers to appeal their dismissal to the labor courts,
 but does not require the reinstatement of any worker fired without cause. Labor
 courts responsible for enforcing labor laws continued generally to be ineffective. In
 an effort to relieve the overwhelming workload of the labor courts, seven new courts
 were created in 1992. For budget reasons, they are not yet functioning. Restructur-
 ing and modernizing the labor court system thus made little headway, and a heavy
 baclog of cases continues to clog the courts.
 Enforcement of the Labor Code is spotty, due in part to the scarcity of labor in-
 spectors and a lack of adequate training. Plans are pending to hire and train addi-
 tional labor inspetors. The salary of al labor inspectors was doubled in 1992, along
 with all other tecnical employees in the central Government.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout Guatemala, including in the few ex-
 port processing zones under development in the country. Umon leaders often blame
 employer pressures and restricted access to the zones for their virtual inability to
 organize there. Credible reports have been received about these zones, alleging low
 wages, long hours without [egally required overtime pay, employment of minors, and
 poor working conditions. Labor Ministry inspectors filed numerous complaints be-
 fore the labor courts on these charges. Few of these cases were resolved, however,
 due to inefficiencies within the court system and to legal maneuvering which em-
 ployers can use to prolong the hearing process.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution bars forced labor
 and the practice generally does not exist. However, some groups charge that coerced
 participation of indigenous peoples in the PAC's violates prohibitions against forced
 labor. There were credible reports of isolated instances of unpaid PAC members
 being used to provide free manual labor, but no systematic pattern of such abuse
 was established.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.-Although the Constitution
 bars employment of minors under the age of 14, the Government's National Insti-
 tute of Statistics reports that some 50,000 children below this minimum age are reg-
 ularly employed in the formal sector; an untold number reportedly work in the in-
 formal sector. Only 5,000 of these minors have legal permission from the Labor Min-
 istry to work.
 Those working without legal permission are open to exploitation, generally receiv-
 ing no social benefits, no sQcial insurance, no pension or vacations, no severance
 pay, and are paid at below the minimum wage level. The Labor Ministry has a pro-
 am to educate minors, their parents, and employers on the rights of minors in the
 fabor market. Economic necessity, however forces most families to have their chil-
 dren seek some type of employment to supplement the family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set by law. Due to a vari-
 ety of factors, most importantly the sharp variance between the oversupply of labor
 and the very limited demand for it, the minimum wage becomes the prevaing wage
 ceiling, and not te more commonly accepted waive floor, for most unskilled and
 semiskilled workers. Widespread, credible reports indicated the minimum wage is
 commonly, if illegally, not paid to significant numbers of rural and urban workers.
 
 
 The current minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living, govern-
 ment statistics indicate that an estimated 80 percent of the population lives below
 the Guatemalan poverty line, including approximately 70 percent of those employed.
 A bilateral committee representing labor and management is named each year to
 make recommendations for increases in the minimum wage. In the event that agree-
 ment is not possible, the Government may decree such increases. The minimum
 wage was increased in late 1991 by 78.5 percent. Although the minimum wage was
 not increased in 1992, when inflation was approximately 12 percent the Govern-
 ment did augment worker incomes by 8.3 percent when it passed a law requiring
 payment of an additional annual 1-month bonus in July of each year. Orgamzed
 labor opposed this decision since bonus payments are not onsidered in calculating
 other benefit payments based on wages.
 The legal workday is 8 hours and the workweek is 44 hours, but a tradition of
 much longer hours remains in p lace due to economic onditions. The newly amended
 Labor Code ontinues the tradition of providing all workers a required weekly rest
 period of at least 24 hours. Trade union leaders and human rights groups charge
 that workers are commonly forced to work overtime, often without overtime pay, to
 meet work requirements. Labor inspectors report that numerous instances were un-
 covered of such abuses, but inefficiencies in the labor court system inhibit adequate
 enforcement of the law.
 Occupational health and safety standards are inadequate. As with other aspects
 of the labor law, enforcement of the standards that do exist is also generally mad-
 equate. Training courses for labor inspectors in health and safety standards were
 provided, but this area is not perceived as a high priority for the resource-poor Min-
 istry. In 1991 legislation was enacted requiring companies with more than 50 em-
 ployees to provide on-site medical facilities for their workers. According to trade
 umon representatives, the decree was not effectively enforced, even though many
 large employers do provide such facilities.
