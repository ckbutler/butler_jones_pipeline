 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain has been ruled since the late 12th century by the
 Al-Khalifa extended family, which dominates society and
 government. Bahrain's Constitution of 1973 remains in effect,
 but some of its provisions have been suspended by decree,
 including those relating to the National Assembly, which was
 disbanded in 1975. In practice, there are few judicial checks
 on the authorities. The Constitution confirms the Amir as
 hereditary ruler.
 Bahrain's leadership seeks to foster the open social and
 commercial environment needed to attract international
 business, while protecting the ruling family's preeminence,
 preventing potential sectarian violence, and thwarting
 externally inspired subversion. Bahrainis are divided between
 Shi'a and Sunni Muslim religious communities. Precise figures
 are not available, but estimates are that over two-thirds of
 the population is Shi'a. The ruling family is Sunni, and the
 Sunni community generally tends to be more wealthy and
 influential than the Shi'a, although there are conspicuous
 exceptions. While extreme poverty is rare, and the Government
 makes great efforts to assure full employment, the Shi'a are
 disadvantaged as a group, a situation which adds to the
 potential for externally inspired subversion. Some of the
 more militant Shi'a have been drawn into two clandestine
 political groups with links to Iran. Political activity
 remains strictly controlled.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 1985. There were, however, a number of arrests for political
 activities. The Islamic Enlightenment Society, a Shi'a group,
 was banned in 1984, and the trial in December 1984 and
 sentencing of its leaders closed what had been an avenue for
 Shi'a political and religious expression. In January, worker
 representatives to joint worker/management committees were
 elected, but they have limited scope for representation of
 worker interests, and cannot be considered trade unions in the
 full sense.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of political killing in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance at-the hands
 of the security forces. Some persons detained by the security
 forces for investigation of suspected illegal political
 activity have not been accounted for until some time later.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is evidence that persons suspected of security offenses
 are sometimes physically abused during arrest and
 interrogation. It is not known what happens during detention
 in security prisons (where questioning may continue after
 sentencing) since visits by nongovernment persons are not
 
 
 1184
 BAHRAIN
 allowed. Medical examinations by nonprison doctors have also
 been denied. There is no evidence of a systematic policy of
 physical mistreatment of criminal offenders.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Political activity is severely controlled by the security
 forces, and individuals are sometimes detained on suspicion of
 antiregime political activity. Periods of incommunicado
 detention can be lengthy, but relatives are usually able to
 find out if and where the detainee is being held. Activities
 of a political nature which can bring arrest include suspected
 membership in "subversive organizations" or expressions of
 antiregime opinion in a public setting. Examples of acts that
 could lead to arrest or questioning include painting
 antiregime slogans on the walls, joining antiregime
 demonstrations, possessing or circulating antiregime writings,
 or harboring persons committing such acts. Reliable estimates
 indicate that between 50 and 100 persons are now being held
 for antiregime political activity, including 19 who were
 arrested in connection with the banning in 1984 of the Islamic
 Enlightenment Society.
 The Government in recent years has expelled Bahraini residents
 of Iranian origin, some of whom were from families that had
 lived in Bahrain for generations. It is believed such
 expulsions numbered under 25 Bahrainis in 1985.
 The use of any form of forced or compulsory labor is
 prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person arrested may be tried in either a civil court or the
 security court. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees,
 including open trial, the right to counsel (including legal
 aid for indigents), and the right of appeal. Security cases,
 however, are tried directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal
 sitting as the Security Court. Trials are held in camera,
 there is no right of habeas corpus, and the court is exempted
 from adhering to the procedural guarantees of the penal code.
 Sentences imposed by the security court can, at the discretion
 of that court, be referred to the Amir for clemency, a
 procedure not customarily allowed in civil court cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Interior Ministry can authorize entry of private premises
 and places of employment in security cases without reference
 to judicial authorities. Telephone calls are subject to
 monitoring, and the police sometimes open mail. Police
 informer networks exist.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Bahrainis are not free to challenge the legitimacy of the
 regime in speech or in writing, but criticism of government
 policies and programs in such areas as municipal services and
 education is tolerated and commonly seen in the press.
 
 
 1185
 BAHRAIN
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. In the past, minor deviations have brought closure
 of the offending newspapers but there have been no closures
 since 1980, primarily because editors fully understand the
 rules and abide by them. In 1985 there was one expulsion of a
 foreign journalist, the AP-Dow Jones correspondent. The
 British newspaper Financial Times was banned for several weeks
 as a result of articles that displeased the Government. Many
 other foreign publications continue to be sold without being
 subject to censorship.
 All radio and television stations are state-owned, although
 newspapers are privately owned. The editor of the largest
 paper is a former Information Ministry official, and his
 publication is regarded as semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are prohibited in Bahrain.
 While the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, trade unions are illegal. However, the Government
 has encouraged the formation of elected workers' committees in
 12 major companies. Worker representatives are empowered to
 discuss wages and working conditions with management, but not
 to engage in collective bargaining, and there is no right to
 strike. Ten percent of the work force is now represented by
 these committees, which in turn choose members of a national
 committee.. This body represents Bahrain in international
 labor organizations. Expatriate workers, about 60 percent of
 the work force, are effectively denied even these limited
 trade union rights.
 A number of professional organizations exist, including groups
 of lawyers, physicians, engineers, and businessmen. There are
 also a number of social and sports clubs that traditionally
 have been significant for political discussion. These
 organizations are generally small and limited in scope and the
 Government monitors their activities closely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although there are notable exceptions, membership in the Sunni
 sect tends to confer a more favored status on Bahraini
 nationals. Sunnis are given preference for employment in the
 security services, the police, and the army. Shi'a religious
 assemblies are subject to government control and monitoring,
 but there is no interference with Shi'a worship as such. The
 leaders of the Islamic Enlightenment Society, a Shi'a group
 with about 1,500 members, were arrested, tried, and sentenced
 in December 1984 for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years on
 charges of antiregime activity. Public religious events,
 particularly marches by members of the Shi'a community, are
 closely watched by the police to prevent their becoming
 antiregime demonstrations.
 The population is overwhelmingly Muslim and Islam is the state
 religion, but several Christian denominations maintain places
 of worship and enjoy considerable freedom to practice their
 religion. Christian publications are readily available in
 book stores, but proselytizing is not permitted.

 BAHRAIN
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country. There are
 restrictions on the number of Bahrainis permitted to make
 pilgrimages to Shi'a holy sites in Iran. Refugees are not
 repatriated to countries they have fled, but are obliged to
 depart Bahrain immediately. Passports can be denied on
 political grounds, but there were few instances of this in
 1985. Some persons living abroad and suspected of political
 offenses upon return to Bahrain may face imprisonment by
 security courts without public trial.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Bahrain is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, headed by the
 Amir. There are no elections for government positions.  The
 average Bahraini is able to influence government decisions
 only by means of informal contact with senior officials and by
 attending the Amir's public audiences. No political parties
 are permitted.
 There are two clandestine political groups with ties to Iran
 which attract younger militant Shi'a: the Islamic Front for
 the Liberation of Bahrain, the group responsible for a 1981
 coup attempt, and the Islamic Call party. Both advocate
 overthrow of the Government and the establishment of an
 Independent Islamic Republic. There are also two underground
 leftist groups, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
 Bahrain and the National Front for the Liberation of Bahrain,
 which have ties with revolutionary Arab regimes in the area
 and some Soviet support. The groups also call for violent
 revolution and probably have several hundred members each.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights.
 Bahrain has not been the subject of resolutions or
 investigations by official international human rights
 organizations. No private human rights group is known to have
 visited Bahrain in 1985. The last indication of the
 Government's attitude toward such investigations was in 1982,
 when Amnesty International sent a team to observe the trial of
 those accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the
 regime. The team was able to meet with government officials
 and defense counsel, but was not allowed to attend the closed
 trial. There are no nongovernmental organizations established
 to protect individual liberties.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International expressed concern about the detention of
 political prisoners as well as allegations of torture and
 ill-treatment of political detainees. Freedom House rated
 Bahrain "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Bahrain's population is 427,000, of which about 32 percent is
 non-Bahraini. The population growth rate for the native
 population is 3.5 percent. According to the World Bank, per
 capita gross national product was estimated to be $10,510 in
 1983 but distribution is unequal.
 
 
 1187
 BAHRAIN
 There is no significant domestic taxation. Although
 statistical data are not available, it is generally recognized
 that there is some poverty at the village level and among some
 foreign temporary workers. The Government, faced with
 declining oil revenues, receives financial assistance from
 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. From the
 1984-85 budget, 10 percent was allocated to education, 6
 percent to health, 10 percent to housing, and 35 percent to
 social services.
 The right to private property is protected. While foreigners
 other than citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council countries are
 not normally permitted to own real estate in Bahrain, their
 rights to possess other personal property are protected under
 law.
 The Government continues to emphasize Bahrainization of most
 sectors of the economy, but currently both menial and
 high-skilled positions tend to be held by expatriates. The
 Government plans to train 10,000 Bahrainis in the present
 decade in order to replace foreign workers holding skilled
 jobs, but this effort is undermined by employers who prefer
 foreign workers who can be paid less and are more docile than
 Bahrainis.
 Life expectancy is about 69 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is 34 per 1,000 live births. Food and safe drinking
 water are available in adequate supply to the entire
 population, and an ongoing sewerage project promises to
 improve public sanitation. The prices of basic food items are
 subsidized by the Government. Approximately 73 percent of
 Bahrainis between the ages of 4 and 19 attend primary or
 secondary schools; 48 percent are female. The adult
 illiteracy rate is estimated at 36 percent. The Government
 has begun a campaign to eradicate illiteracy.
 Free public health care is available to all residents. Free
 education and subsidized housing are available only to
 Bahrainis. The Government's social insurance plans and
 protection against unfair labor practices primarily benefit
 Bahrainis.
 The minimum age for employment in Bahrain is 14 years.
 Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 receive special
 protection under the labor laws. They may not be employed in
 hazardous conditions or at night and may not work over 6 hours
 a day or on a piecework basis.
 Bahrain's labor law provides for acceptable conditions of work
 for all adult workers. In practice, however, expatriate
 workers, who account for about 60 percent of Bahrain's total
 work force, are seriously disadvantaged by the requirement
 that all foreign workers must be sponsored in order to work.
 Under this system, sponsors can cancel the residence permit of
 any person under their sponsorship and blacklist individuals
 so that they cannot obtain entry or residence visas from
 another sponsor. Such power contains the inherent potential
 for exploitation, and foreign workers are often unwilling to
 report abuses for fear of enforced repatriation. Bahrain's
 labor law does not recognize the concept of equal pay for
 equal work. Asian workers are often paid less than Bahraini
 or Western expatriates with the same qualifications, and women
 are generally paid less than men.

 BAHRAIN
 Many legal rights of concern to women are subject to Islamic
 law. Women have rights to their own property, but daughters
 receive less inheritance than sons, and widows must share
 their husband's estate with their own children. Although a
 wife may divorce, she must specify grounds. Women must obtain
 the permission of the male head of the household in order to
 obtain a passport. Nevertheless, with the development of the
 Bahrain economy, women have increasingly tiken on job roles
 previously reserved for men. Women now constitute over 12
 percent of all Bahraini workers. The Government has
 encouraged the trend toward equality, has enacted special laws
 to encourage female entry into the work force, and is itself a
 leading employer of women. Most of these positions are
 clerical, but a small number of senior positions are held by
 women. Labor law grants women 60 days paid maternity leave
 and nursing periods during the working day. The status of
 women is a continuing subject of debate. Many women
 voluntarily adopt socially conservative roles under the
 influence of traditionalist interpretations of Islam.
