 NIGER
 Under growing public pressures, the authoritarian
 military-civilian regime, headed by General Ali Saibou,
 peacefully turned over power to a National Conference which met
 from July 29 to November 3. The Conference involved 1,200
 conferees from a comprehensive array of nationally
 representative groups. During its deliberations, it declared
 itself the nation's authoritative governing body, suspended the
 1989 constitution, dissolved other institutions (the National
 Assembly and the National Council of Development) and dismissed
 all ministers and turned over day-to-day government operations
 to secretaries general. It also debated a wide range of
 political, economic, and social reform policies and planned
 presidential, legislative, and municipal elections for late
 1992 or early 1993. In November the Conference chose Prime
 Minister Amadou Cheiffou to head a 15-month Transitional
 Government and also elected a 15-member High Council of the
 Republic (HCR) to assure execution of conference decisions.
 General Saibou was retained as ceremonial Head of State. At
 year's end, Niger awaited a new constitution, to be submitted
 to a national referendum in 1992.
 The military, which had been in power since 1974, made no
 effort to intervene in the reform process but remained a force
 behind the scenes. In addition to the military, Nigerien
 security organizations include the gendarmerie and the national
 police. There were occasional reports of human rights abuses
 by these organizations, although fewer than in previous years.
 The National Conference directed the Directorate of State
 Security, a political investigative organ which formerly
 reported to the Presidency, to report to the Prime Minister
 during the transition. Civilians headed the ministries charged
 with supervision of the security services.
 Niger is an extremely poor country with an economy based
 largely on cultivating subsistence crops, raising livestock,
 and exploiting some of the world's largest uranium deposits.
 Drought cycles, desertification, a 3.4 percent population
 growth rate, and the declining world demand for uranium have
 undercut an already marginal economy. Due in part to the
 nation's focus on major political changes, the economy and
 World Bank reform programs reached a virtual standstill.
 Respect for, and protection of, human rights expanded
 significantly in Niger throughout 1991. In early 1991, human
 rights organizations were formed, were fully recognized, and
 operated without hindrance for the first time. Prior to the
 July opening of the National Conference, and as pressure for
 democratization increased, President Saibou instituted new laws
 which widened freedoms of the press and of association and
 fully legalized the multiparty system, first announced in
 November 1990. At the National Conference, citizens from all
 social strata had the opportunity to state their opinions,
 become involved in politics, and criticize government policies
 and officials, including the Head of State. The National
 Conference held public hearings to explore the Government's
 role in two 1990 incidents of human rights abuses. These
 hearings revealed allegations of large-scale killings and
 torture. Despite the steady improvement in human rights
 policies, individual law enforcement officials continued to
 commit human rights abuses.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political and extrajudicial killings
 in i991. The National Conference conducted a public hearing
 into two 1990 incidents. One occurred on February 9, 1990,
 when security forces fired on violent student protesters,
 killing three. The other occurred in May 1990 when military
 forces in Tchintabaraden and nearby villages responded to
 antigovernment Tuareg assailants with excessive force, killing
 many of the Tuareg. The Government claimed 63 were killed,
 while others claimed there were upward of 300 deaths. The
 conference also heard evidence that Tuareg insurgents in
 Tchintabaraden had caused nine deaths and determined the need
 to investigate those incidents more fully. The National
 Conference suspended senior military, police, and civilian
 officials implicated in both incidents, pending completion of
 the investigations and possible trials. The investigations had
 not been completed by year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The National Conference denounced the authorities' use'of
 torture revealed during the public hearing of the 1990
 Tchintabaraden case. There were no reports of systematic
 torture of political prisoners or detainees during the year,
 but random instances of abuse by individual law enforcement or
 prison officers occurred. Specifically, they inflicted
 physical pain on detainees to extract confessions. In one
 instance in 1991, military personnel severely beat several
 townspeople in retaliation against civilians who had attacked
 an unarmed soldier.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the suspended constitution, still considered partly in
 effect, contains-legal prohibitions against arbitrary
 detention, this prohibition was rarely respected in 1991. In
 theory, the law requires that an arrested person be either
 charged or released within 48 hours. In special cases, the
 public prosecutor, who is also the head of the judicial police,
 may authorize one renewal of the 48-hour detention period. In
 practice, unauthorized delays beyond the established 48-hour
 period frequently occurred, and prisoners often spent months in
 jail awaiting trial. Failure of the police or public
 prosecutor to respect the 48-hour rule does not require
 dismissal of the case against a suspect.
 Once charged, a suspect may be further detained by order of the
 examining magistrate. In practice, however, charged suspects
 are often held beyond the legal time limits prescribed
 according to the nature of the crime and may be in jail as long
 as a year awaiting completion of the magistrate's
 investigation. Defendants are allowed access to a lawyer of
 their own choice. Bail is available for crimes carrying a
 
 
 280
 NIGER
 penalty of less than 10 years' imprisonment. In practice,
 widespread ignorance and lack of financial means prevent these
 rights from being exercised fully. There were no new reports
 of political detainees or prisoners in 1991.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control in Niger, but
 persons have exiled themselves voluntarily in the past. Many
 exiles returned to Niger in 1991 to form parties and
 associations and to participate in the National Conference.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Niger's civil legal system is an amalgam of French, Islamic,
 and customary law. Traditional courts often handle village
 property disputes, which are brought to the civil courts when
 not resolved. Civil and criminal cases not involving security-
 related acts are tried publicly. Defendants have the right to
 be present at their trials, to confront witnesses, and to
 present evidence. Niger's penal code affirms the judiciaI
 principle of presumption of innocence. Defendants have the
 right to counsel at public expense if they are minors or if
 they are indigent and face the prospect of a sentence of 10
 years or more. Both the defendant and the prosecutor may
 appeal the verdict, first to the Court of Appeals and then to
 the highest court, the Supreme Court. Both Courts are
 obligated to hear appeals. The Court of Appeals reviews
 questions of fact and law while the Supreme Court reviews only
 the application of the law.
 The suspended constitution calls for an independent judiciary.
 In practice, however, it has been common for government
 officials and others to use their influence to affect judicial
 proceedings through political pressure and family influence.
 The State Security Court and the Special Court for Embezzled
 Funds, the two courts which formerly functioned outside the
 normal criminal framework and sometimes in secret, ceased to
 function in 1991. The mandate of the State Security Court
 expired when no new judges were named. The Embezzlement Court
 was abolished by the National Conference. The executive
 privilege of pardon for convicted criminals was not exercised
 in 1991.
 In April the Government tried before the State Security Court
 44 Tuareg prisoners accused of introducing arms illegally into
 Niger, undermining state security, and conspiring against the
 State in Tchintabaraden in May 1990. The trial was held in
 public, and all defendants were acquitted and freed due to lack
 of evidence.
 The National Conference created a commission on crimes to
 investigate over 180 political, economic, and social "crimes
 and abuses" committed since independence. The Conference
 conducted public hearings on a selection of these crimes, which
 at times began to resemble extrajudicial proceedings. The
 Conference never passed final judgment on any crime, although
 it suspended a few senior officials and placed others under
 house arrest, pending the outcome of the investigations. The
 crimes commission was charged with completing its work by
 January 1993, with possible extension, and submitting dossiers
 ready for trial to the High Court of Justice, a special court
 created by the National Conference exclusively for this purpose.

 NIGER
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The police are required to have a'search warrant to enter homes
 and then may do so only between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.
 However, when in hot pursuit of a suspected criminal, the
 police are permitted to conduct searches in homes and buildings
 without a warrant, at any time. In practice, searches are
 conducted- at all hours. There were no reports in 1991 of other
 violations of privacy, such as interference with correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press increased dramatically in
 1991, with free speech being most in evidence during the
 National Conference. Buttressed by a national labor federation
 strike, the Association of Nigerien Journalists declared
 complete autonomy from the Government at the end of March
 1991. This change led to a relaxation of many of the
 restrictions on the government-controlled media prior to the
 National Conference. Le Republicain, an independent weekly,
 and several smaller- private publications were launched in
 1991. The National Conference was covered openly by the press,
 including the government media. On October 29, the National
 Conference issued Act 26, declaring full liberty for the media
 and creating a Superior Council of Communication to guarantee
 this freedom. Students and faculty at the university and
 secondary-school levels and at professional institutions
 continued to play a prominent role in the democratization
 process. Academic freedom wastrespected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the 1989 constitution authorized freedom of assembly
 and association, these rights were fully exercised for the
 first time only in 1991. Throughout the first half of 1991,
 students, labor unions, and independent associations held
 demonstrations, some of them violent, to protest government
 policies.
 In May the law governing associations was amended to permit all
 kinds of groups, except those that are ethnically or regionally
 based. The law previously limited the right of association to
 six groups: youth, students, sports and culture, foreign,
 religious, and charity. In 1991 the number of opposition
 parties and associations mushroomed to include 3 human rights
 organizations and some 25 political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger reaffirmed its status as a secular state at the National
 Conference. While the population is nominally over 90 percent
 Muslim, the practice of other religious beliefs is permitted.
 Foreign missionaries may live, work, and travel in Niger but
 must obtain permission to do so. On December 3, the Baha'i-
 faith was granted full legal status. Until then, it was
 practiced despite a 1984 law prohibiting it.
 * d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger continued to be monitored. Police
 checkpoints outside major cities and towns were kept in place,
 
 
 282
 NIGER
 though checks were less systematic in 1991. Some women are
 cloistered and must be escorted outside the home by male family
 members, usually only after dark. Neither emigration nor
 repatriation is restricted.  Niger is a party to the Protocol
 Relating to the Status of Refugees and has cooperated with the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in assisting the
 3,700 Chadian refugees registered in Niger as of May 1991. In
 October about 1,500 Chadian refugees left Niger voluntarily,
 primarily to go to Chad, Nigeria, or Cameroon. Approximately
 2,000 refugees remained in Niger, most of them women and
 children.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Although the right of citizens to change their government was
 not exercised through the electoral process, in 1991 citizens
 changed their government through peaceful means. The National
 Conference, composed of delegations representative of various
 groups in Nigerien society, declared itself the nation's
 authoritative governing body and proceeded peacefully to
 consider multiple reforms in the executive, legislative, and
 judicial areas. Neither President Saibou nor the military
 resisted the transfer of authority. The conference continued
 in operation for over 3 months, finally electing a Transitional
 Government, headed by Prime Minister Amadou Cheiffou, to govern
 Niger pending secret, universal, and multiparty elections,
 projected for late 1992 or early 1993. President Saibou
 continued as Head of State, but his office became strictly
 ceremonial. A High Council of the Republic, composed of 15
 civilians elected by the National Conference, was formed to
 assure the implementation of the Conference's decisions
 throughout the transition. It also was to share unspecified
 legislative powers with the Prime Minister in the absence of an
 elected national assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental, independent human rights groups were created
 for the first time in Niger in 1991. Three such groups
 investigated allegations of human rights abuses reported to
 them by volunteer sources. After verifying the reports, the
 human rights groups protested to local authorities. Where no
 action was taken, human rights groups contacted higher
 authorities and, in some instances, issued public announcements
 to promote corrective action. Throughout 1991 the three groups
 operated freely and judged these procedures to be effective in
 countering human rights abuses. In March, prior to the
 expansion of the law governing associations, the Committee for
 the Defense of Victims of the Tchintabaraden Repression was
 formed to press for an investigation of the events of May 1990,
 with a view toward eventual prosecution of implicated security
 forces. Although it never acquired legal status, the Committee
 was not constrained by the Government and was still operating
 at the end of 1991.
 Amnesty International (AI) visited Niger three times in 1991
 prior to the National Conference. In February the Government,
 citing safety concerns, refused AI permission to travel to
 Tchintabaraden to investigate the killings in May 1990. With
 this exception, there was no interference with AI visits,
 including AI's attendance at the trial of 44 Tuareg prisoners.

 NIGER
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In 1991 the process of democratization ended the traditional
 domination by the Djerma ethnic group (21 percent of the
 population) in government and military service.  The Hausa
 (over 50 percent of the population), Tuareg, and Fulani (Peul)
 ethnic groups participated fully in the National Conference and
 received equal consideration for transition government
 candidacies and positions. However, the Tuareg and Fulani
 (together 21 percent of the population), two historically
 nomadic groups in transition still have less access to
 government services. Toward the end of the National
 Conference, Tuareg members expressed increasing dissatisfaction
 with continued government inattention to their problems. At
 year's end, there were increasing numbers of Tuareg attacks on
 government installations.
 By tradition and practice, and through specific aspects of
 Islam, women occupy a subordinate place in Nigerien society.
 Males have considerable advantages in terms of education,
 employment, and property rights. Male attendance heavily
 outweighs female attendance at all educational levels. only 25
 percent of Nigerien children of primary school age actually
 attend schools, with progressively smaller percentages
 continuing into or through elementary ,and secondary school.
 Approximately 60 percent of the children finishing primary
 school are male. Consequently, male literacy (15 percent) far
 exceeds female literacy (6 percent). Child labor practices
 outside the formal sector also inhibit education for young
 girls-and were sharply criticized at the National Conference.
 Niger's traditions incline employers to favor men as
 employees. Prevailing Islamic laws of inheritance, marriage,
 and divorce discriminate against women.
 Certain discriminatory social practices persist. For example,
 girls as young as age 10 may be contracted into marriage,
 despite legal prohibitions against marriage for girls younger
 than 14. Violenceoccurs against women and. children and
 includes wife beating, but the extent of this problem is
 unknown. Such violence is considered antisocial behavior in
 Nigerien society, and women often turn to both traditional and
 modern judicial authorities in cases of abuse. Female genital
 mutilation (circumcisionY occurs but is limited to a few small
 ethnic groups. Niger has participated in international
 conferences on this subject but does not regard it as a major
 domestic problem and has not addressed the issue publicly.
 A small number of women participate in the professions. About
 one-third of Nigerien doctors and less than one-tenth of
 Niger's magistrates are women. Women in the civil service, the
 largest formal sector employer, represent only 24 percent of
 all civil servants and are confined to lower level positions.
 Though few in number, professional women receive wages
 equivalent to those paid males.
 The government-supported Nigerien Women's Association, with a
 network which has developed commercial cooperatives and social
 programs for village women, was criticized at the National
 Conference for misrepresenting women's concerns and for its
 affiliation with the former ruling party. Since 1988, several
 women's associations have emerged, including associations of
 female traders, educators, bankers, and, in 1991, jurists.
 
 
 284
 NIGER
 In May thousands of women, including members of the Nigerien
 Women's Association, publicly protested the absence of women in
 the preparatory committee for the National Conference. As a
 result, 5 women were placed on the 72-member committee. Women
 were also included in subsequent delegations to the Conference
 and headed two conference committees.  Three women were
 elected to the 15-member High Council of the Republic.
 Among the first complaintslf'toithe National Conference were
 complaints about the poor status of women. A subcommittee on
 improving the condition of women and children proposed a number
 of measures to reduce discrimination against women. The
 conference discussed in depth measures to alleviate the heavy
 physical labor required of rural women, to widen women's access
 to credit, and to provide equal opportunity in the
 administration, including at the ministerial level. The
 Conference also recommended a wider mandate for family
 planning, especially with respect to the use of contraception.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately 90 percent of Niger's work force is employed in
 the largely subsistence rural sector, which is not unionized.
 In the small modern economy, all workers have the legal right
 to establish and join trade unions. The only existing labor
 federation, the National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN),
 represents 27 unions, or 30 percent of the approximately 60,000
 salaried workers in Niger. Another five unions are
 nonaffiliated. All union organizations are independent of
 Niger's new political parties and participated in the National
 Conference as representatives of their constituencies.
 In 1990 and 1991, prior to the National Conference, the USTN
 used strikes, including the threat of a general strike, to
 induce political and economic policy changes with an ultimate
 view to democratization. Union intervention helped maintain
 opposition control over the National Conference and also
 widened freedom of the press. Workers also struck on the eve
 of the National Conference as a tactic to obtain pay increases
 and improvement of benefits before the Conference addressed
 overall pay levels. Between 1990 and 1991, according to union
 officials, 75 percent of unionized workers had participated in
 a strike. In 1991 there were strikes by taxi and truck
 drivers, industrial workers, water and electricity workers, and
 diplomats. A strike at the public utilities company caused the
 removal of its government-appointed executive managers.
 Despite the frequency of politically motivated strikes in 1991,
 the Government provided compensation for time lost during work
 stoppages.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and abides by that organization's policy of having no
 formal affiliations outside the African continent. Individual
 unions, however, such as the Teachers' Union of Niger, are
 affiliated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is legally authorized, but, in practice,
 it is circumscribed by government participation in the
 negotiating process. A government representative is present at
 most negotiations and in certain circumstances acts as binding
 arbitrator. A basic framework agreement, negotiated by the
 
 
 NIGER
 I
 USTN's predecessor, the employers, and the Government, has been
 in force since 1972. The agreement covers basic work
 conditions, work contract elements, and union activities, but
 not wages. Individual unions may bargain for more favorable
 work conditions.
 The Labor Code, which is based on International Labor
 Organization (ILO) principles, prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers, and'th'USTN reported no such
 discrimination in 1991. There are no export processing zones
 in Niger.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Niger'd Labor Code prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 However, black or darker-skinned Tuaregs reported to the
 National Conference'that in remote areas of Niger white or
 lighter-skinned Tuaregs subjected many of their group to slave
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 To work, children, aged 12 and 13 must have special
 authorization from local labor inspectors. Children between
 the ages of 14 and 18 may be employed, subject to legal
 provisions limiting hours (4.5 hours maximum per day) and types
 of employment (no industrial work). Although child labor laws
 apply throughout the economy, local labor inspectors who
 enforce these laws inspect only workplaces in the formal
 sector, located primarily in urban areas. However, children
 generally do not work in ,the formal sector.- Child labor is
 common in the unregulated subsistence agriculture and informal
 trade sectors, where most Nigeriens are employed. Children
 often work for their families under harsh conditions that do
 not comply with the Labor Code's provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a'legal minimum wage for salaried workers. -According
 to union officials, this wage is not sufficient to provide a
 decent living for workers and their families. The legal
 workweek is 40 hours. However, certain occupations requiring
 irregular hours are authorized, longer workweeks, with a maximum
 of 72 hours. The Labor Code also prescribes occupational
 safety and health regulations that are enforced by the labor
 inspectors in the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and
 Professional Training. Because of.staff shortages, however,
 this office focuses mainly on safety violations in the mining,
 building, and industrial sectors. According to a ministry
 official, compliance is often difficult 'to enforce because
 workers may not be-fully aware of the safety risks posed in
 their jobs andmay refuse to wear protective clothing due to
 Niger's hot climate, although for the most part, employers
 provide adequate safety equipment.
