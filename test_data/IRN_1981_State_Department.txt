 IRAN
 The revolutionary government of Ayatollah Khomeini, beset by
 enormous international and domestic problems after it came to power
 in February 1979, was severely shaken during 1981 by street violence
 and opposition to clerical rule. The political turmoil was fueled
 further by the negative effects of the war with Iraq and a
 deteriorating economic situation. Widespread disregard for human
 rights, already serious in previous years, became more pronounced in
 1981. Instances of arbitrary arrests and summary executions
 increased dramatically. Religious persecution, particularly of the
 Baha'i community, became more severe. Civil liberties were further
 restricted, and interference of the regime and its supporters in the
 fundamental aspects of the lives of the population became
 increasingly pervasive and arbitrary.
 The domestic rivalry between President Bani-Sadr, and clerical
 leaders in the Islamic Republican Party (IRP) became more acute
 following the January 20 release of 52 American Embassy hostages
 held illegally in Iran, despite international condemnation, since
 November 4, 1979 (444 days).
 with preoccupation by the hostage crisis ended, and with the
 Iran-Iraq war largely at a stalemate, the deep ideological
 disagreements between the secular, western educated Bani-Sadr, and
 the fundamentalist Prime Minister Rajai reached a boiling point.
 Efforts by young fundamentalist militants to disrupt a March 1981
 pro-Bani-Sadr rally in Tehran. became the opening salvo of an IRP
 attempt to crush the opposition. Khomeini at first tried to calm
 the situation by establishing a three-man committee in mid-April
 (representing Bani-Sadr, the IRP, and Khomeini) to study the
 confrontation and ease tension. The IRP's steady drive for power,
 howeveri and Bani-Sadr's refusal to comply with the Ayatollah's ban
 on inflammatory speeches and other polemics led Khomeini on June 10
 to dismiss Bani-Sadr from his position as Commander-in-Chief and
 finally to remove him from the Presidency on June 21.
 Condemned for "political incompetence" by the IRP-controlled Majlis
 (Parliament) and under threat of arrest for "provoking groups to
 resist the legal institutions of the Islamic Republic," Bani-Sadr
 went into hiding and later fled the country. The regime prepared
 for the election of a new President during July. On June 28,
 however, a bomb blew up the IRP's headquarters in Tehran, killing
 Ayatollah Beheshti (Iran's chief justice and a leading figure in the
 regime) and some 72 others including ministers and Majlis deputies.
 The clerics charged the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (a leftist urban guerrilla
 group) with the responsibility. The regime responded ruthlessly with
 widespread arrests and summary executions. Despite the regime's
 efforts to blunt the effectiveness of the terrorists, assassinations
 and bombings continued. A bomb blast in August killed the newly
 elected President Rajai, his appointed Prime Minister, and other
 high level regime officials. Again the regime's response was a
 step-up in arrests and summary executions.
 New elections were held in October amidst the turmoil and resulted
 in the election of an IRP leader, Ali Khamenei, as President, and
 the appointment, of Hosein Musavi,(closely identified with Khamenei)
 as Prime Minister. The war with Iraq, a steadily deteriorating
 economy, and the internal security situation pre-occupied Iran's
 leaders throughout 1981.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Despite provisions in Iran's constitution which specifically
 prohibit torture, the wave of repression during the year has given
 rise to increased, and apparently credible, reports of torture,
 particularly during the interrogation of political opponents. In
 March, Ayatollah Khomeini appointed a special commission to
 investigate the situation. As the year ended,the commission had not
 yet issued a formal report. Khomeini did not allow an independent
 international investigation.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Opposition to the regime,.including terrorism against leading regime.
 figures, triggered strong repressive measures. Thousands were
 arrested and many executed throughout the country but particularly
 in Tehran and other urban centers. Amnesty International on October
 12 reported more than 3,350 executions since the regime took over in
 February 1979 including 1,800 executions in the less than four-month
 period June 20,through October 12, 1981. Even this number, however,
 is only an estimate based on regime statements, and the actual
 number of executions in 1981 and before appears to be much higher.
 The authorities also pursued persons accused.of violating Islamic
 ethical norms by engaging in prostitution, homosexuality and drug
 trafficking. Convictions of such persons take place after trials
 conducted with little regard for procedural or substantive
 safeguards and the harsh punishment meted out (public flogging,
 stonings and sometimes execution), is based on the principle of
 retribution (Iqasas*) which the regime claims is derived from
 Koranic law. On October 28, for example, a Tehran newspaper
 reported that 19 drug dealers (including two women) were executed.
 Eminent Muslim scholars outside Iran take issue with this and many
 other Khomeini regime interpretations of the Koran. The lack of
 procedural safeguards has resulted in accusations of such charges
 being used as a means of persecuting persons whose only "crimes' are
 their religious or political views.
 c. Disappearances
 There are reports that opponents of the regime such as members of
 the underground Iranian writers' Association have disappeared, as
 well as children of parents accused of being, or known to be, Bahais.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment were widespread as the regime
 cracked down on its opponents. In an effort to quell'the increasing
 number of assassinations and bombings, persons in the vicinity of
 such incidents were rounded up, interrogated and held in prison
 without charge. There are believed to be thousands of political
 prisoners, although reliable figures are not available.
 
 
 978
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1981 Amnesty International annual report reconfirmed the
 findings of its 1980 report which concluded that "the guarantees
 necessary for a fair trial are effectively lacking in cases heard by
 the Islamic Revolutionary Tribunals." The 1980 report stated
 further that defendants often were not told the exact charges
 against them; were not always allowed to call defense witnesses;
 often were not permitted to question witnesses against them; and
 were not allowed counsel of their own choice. Many trials were
 closed to the public and, in practice, there was no right of appeal
 and no-effective presumption that defendants were innocent until
 proven guilty. Amnesty International's report cites the execution on
 July 20, 1980 of five persons approximately 16 hours after their
 trial was reported to have begun as a clear example of the regime's
 almost immediate imposition of death sentences with little or no
 time to appeal or petition for clemency. Iran's prosecutor,
 Musavi-Tabrizi,..was quoted by the Iranian media in September 1981 as
 saying that-persons could be convicted on the testimony of two
 witnessesi without- the presence of counsel, and that "they may be
 -sentenced to deaththe same evening and executed."
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Invasions of homes increased during 1981 as part of the regime's
 effort to block the political activities and anti-regime actions of
 opponents.- Accounts of the situation by persons recently arriving
 from-Iran indicate that Revolutionary Guards and other revolutionary
 groups not only invade the privacy of homes, but also terrorize the
 inhabitants, steal private property, and blackmail their victims by
 threatening to.haul'them before revolutionary tribunals on
 -trumped-up charges of anti-regime behavior or anti-Islamic conduct.
 .Reports indicate that such behavior, while prevalent in the major
 cities, .is-even more frequent in the provincial areas.
 2. Respect. for civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.     Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 Freedoms of speech, the press and assembly, which were to be a part
 oftthe new Iran promised by the revolutionary regime, have been
 virtually-eliminated. Criticism of the regime's harsh repression of
 opponents is not tolerated even-within the confines of the
 Parliament-itself. -The mounting number of executions and the
 atmosphere of political repression impels Iranians to remain silent
 or otherwise conceal political views which do not conform with those
 of the regime. Measures against the regime's opponents included the
 banning of.newspapers and other publications considered
 unsympathetic to the clerics and the ruling Islamic Republican
 Party. The regime has also banned demonstrations by the opposition,
 and has used force in quelling any manifestations or street
 demonstrations. Furthermore, Iranian Muslims are urged by some
 regime supporters to avoid purchasing food products and beverages
 from.Christians and other non-Muslims.
 
 
 979
 The regime's increasingly harsh attacks on Israel and Zionism
 increased feelings of insecurity within Iran's Jewish community.
 Some Jews in Iran have been charged with "Zionism," a crime
 punishable by death. Since the revolution at least ten Jews have
 been executed by the Khomeini regime on charges ranging from spying
 for the U.S. and Israel, Zionism, "corruption on earth" and "warring
 against God."  Large numbers of Jews have fled Iran, and among
 those that remain, insecurity was intensified in 1981 by the arrest
 of several Jews, including a rabbi, accused of helping Jews flee
 Iran. Christian religious classes for children have been prevented
 from meeting and Christian physicians have reportedly been obliged
 to renounce their faith in writing in order to obtain work permits.
 The Baha'is, whose religion is not recognized by the constitution,
 continue to be singled out for especially harsh treatment, with the
 number of executions reaching well over a hundred. These executions
 included the secret execution in December of eight of the nine
 members of the national leadership of the Baha'i community, as well
 as some local Baha'i leaders. In the case of some officially
 acknowledged executions of Baha'is, the main charges were,
 basically, their adherence to the Baha'i faith.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 War conditions and the poor security situation created by terrorism
 and other challenges to the regime's authority have resulted in
 heightened control over travel within Iran, as well as abroad. The
 regime maintains lists of persons barred from leaving the country,
 as well as lists of Iranians living abroad who, if they returned to
 Iran, would face arrest and punishment for their association with
 the previous regime, or for anti-Khomeini sentiments. The
 authorities have introduced a myriad of bureaucratic obstacles
 severely limiting the issuance of exit visas. Those given
 apparently are granted in an arbitrary manner largely dependent
 upon the personal intercession of someone favorably known to the
 authorities, or in exchange for a bribe. As a result, an increasing
 number of Iranians during 1981 left Iran without exit visas, largely
 across the borders of neighboring countries despite border controls
 instituted by Iranian guards. Married women desiring to travel
 abroad continued to need the permission of their spouses.
 Thousands of Iranians are seeking asylum in many countries of the
 world, particularly the United States and Western Europe. Despite
 the absence of official restrictions on movement within Iran, travel
 to the war zones and in the insurgent Kurdish areas is discouraged.
 The regime has absorbed an estimated 45,000 to 60,000 persons of
 Iranian origin expelled from Iraq, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom are in
 camps. In addition, the regime is attempting to assist an estimated
 one million Afghan refugees who fled from Soviet-controlled
 Afghanistan.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The clergy dominated regime ruling through the Islamic Republican
 Party (IRP) has virtually total control over the political processes
 of the country. A few prominent Iranian politicians are able to
 voice opposition to aspects of the Khomeini regime's policies, but
 the regime's tolerance of such critics is severely limited.
 Bani-Sadr was dismissed from the presidency and his supporters were
 
 
 980
 arrested or driven underground and abroad. The regime showed little
 tolerance even for those who at one time were a part of the
 revolutionary process that brought the current regime to power. New
 elections in 1981 to replace the assassinated President, Prime
 Minister and parliamentarians were strictly controlled by the IRP,
 and no candidates other than those approved by Ayatollah Khomeini
 and the IRP were permitted to run.
 The handful of parliamentarians who took issue with the regime's
 policy of summarily executing large numbers of opponents were
 threatened by mob violence and expulsion from Parliament. While
 disagreements within the IRP are sometimes aired in Parliament and
 elsewhere, they are generally differences over tactics and methods
 reflecting personal animosities and ambitions rather than
 fundamental criticisms of the basic political structure and
 philosophy of Khomeini's Iran.
 Members of political parties and groups that do not support the
 .concept of an Islamic Republic under the ultimate authority of
 Ayatollah Khomeini are branded as enemies or as tools of foreign
 .powers and forced to live either in hiding or in exile to avoid
 imprisonment or execution. Ethnic minorities, particularly in
 Kurdistan, are'suppressed by the Iranian army and Revolutionary
 Guards when they press for greater autonomy or a bigger role in the
 affairs of the central government. The number of prisoners of
 conscience in Iran is not known, but according to Amnesty
 International such prisoners include "members of ethnic and
 religious minorities; members of political parties and groups
 opposed to the existing authorities; and people connected in some
 way with the-previous government."
 The imposition by Ayatollah Khomeini and other ruling clerics of
 their version of the traditional Islamic pattern of life and social
 behavior falls especially hard on the women of Iran. Iranian women
 continued.to exercise the right to vote and there is at least one
 woman in Parliament. Nevertheless, the rights gained by women under
 laws enacted by the previous regime have been rescinded. Severe
 dress codes, including the wearing of the chador (traditional cloak)
 are vigorously enforced. During 1981 the chador became mandatory
 for women in public establishments including international hotels,
 and no exception is made for foreign or non-Muslim women.
 Revolutionary committees are empowered to close down establishments
 that do not enforce the dress code.
 3. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 International concern over violations of human rights in Iran
 mounted during 1981. Amnesty International's request to send a team
 to investigate the large number of executions in Iran was refused by
 Ayatollah Khomeini, who proceeded to condemn international
 organizations,. including Amnesty International, as "corrupt" and out
 to "crush the Islamic movement" in Iran. The United Nations Human
 Rights Committee in October expressed its anxiety about the
 situation in Iran. The.Committee noted that Iran, a signatory of
 the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, had not yet fulfilled
 its promise of April 1979 to submit a report on how rights pledged
 in the Covenant are guaranteed. The President of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the delegate-
 
 
 981
 general for the Middle East visited Iran June 21-26 for discussions
 with the Prime Minister and other senior officials regarding ICRC
 protection for victims of the conflict with Iraq and ICRC visits to
 persons detained owing to events in Iran. The ICRC delegation in
 Tehran visited members of the Iraqi armed forces who had been taken
 prisoner. On June 16 the ICRC carried out a double repatriation
 operation involving wounded prisoners bf war; 17 Iraqis and 25
 Iranians.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances.
 The regime's preoccupation with the severe political challenge of
 its internal opponents and the need to sustain a costly war with
 Iraq made it even more difficult than before to attend adequately to
 the Iranian people's economic and social needs. The lifting of U.S.
 and other countries' economic sanctions following the release of the
 hostages was insufficient to stem the steady deterioration of the
 economy, and the prospects are dim for any improvement in the near
 future. High inflation, high unemployment and low industrial
 production are serious problems for a population estimated to be
 growing  at 2.9 percent per year. Nevertheless, despite shortages
 of staples, long-lines for gasoline and other goods, rationing, the
 regime is able to meet the minimal basic needs of its people. The
 adult literacy rate under the Shah's government was estimated at 50
 percent. There was a 54-year life expectancy in 1979. The
 universities remain closed, and elementary and secondary schools,
 while functioning, are doing so within the framework of a very
 restrictive clergy-dominated environment. School officials
 scrutinize the religious affiliations of students and may refuse to
 register children who profess a faith not recognized by the
 constitution. Health care deteriorated substantially due to the
 departure not only of a substantial number of foreign doctors, but
 also of many Iranian doctors who found life in revolutionary Iran
 intolerable. War refugees from Khuzistan province continue to
 strain the limited resources of the regime.
