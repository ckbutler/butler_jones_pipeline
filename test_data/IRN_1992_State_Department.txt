 IRAN*
 Iran Is an Islamic Republic under the leadership of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The
 formal system of government, based on a Constitution approved in 1980 by popular
 referendum and revised in July 1989, features a parliament and a president elected
 from among multiple candidates by universal suffrage. However all candidates
 must meet highly restrictive religious and political criteria imposed by the Council
 of Guardians, and as a result the choice offered to voters is narrow. The Govern-
 ment, dominated by a political elite composed of Shi'a Muslim clerics and of laymen
 allied with these clerics, attempts to impose its views of political and socioreligious
 orthodoxy. However, there remain significant factional differences on important eco-
 nomic and political issues.
 The Government's hold on power continues to be reinforced through arrests, sum-
 mary trials and executions, and other forms of intimidation implemented by an ex-
 tensive internal security system. Political arrests are made by the Revolutionary
 Guards and by security forces operating under the Ministry of Intelligence and Se-
 curity.
 Iran has a mixed economy. Although Islam guarantees the right to private owner-
 ship, the Government has nationalized the banks and owns several basic industries,
 including the petroleum and utilities sector. Oil exports are the primary source of
 foreign exchange. The disruptions of the revolution, the destruction from the Iran-
 Iraq war, and government mismanagement have caused serious economic deteriora-
 tion. Inflation ontinues to run at an estimated 30 to 50 peent, about 30 percent
 of the work force is still unemployed, and corruption and black market activities
 continue to ho widespread.
 fran continues to ho a major abuser of human rights, and there was no evidence
 of significant improvement i 1992. Owing to the efforts which the Government
 takes to conceal its human rights abuses, however, it is difficult to know precisely
 the details and numbers of such abuses. Domestic elements that might monitor and
 report on the Government's practices are ruthlessly suppressed.
 Abuses continued to include summary executions; widespread torture; repression
 of the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association; arbitrary detentions;
 lack of fair trials- repression of the Baha'i religious community; denial of citizens'
 right to change tir government; and severe restrictions on women's and worker
 rights. The Government did not implement various measures recommended by the
 Special Representative on Human Rite in his 1991 report. In his February 1992
 report, covering a December 1991 vist, the U.N. Special Representative noted that
 "Statements of intent have been made concerninag observance and the elaboration
 of legislative reforms, together with promises, although for the time being those in-
 tentions and prmises have not been carried out to a sufficiently significant extent
 to ensure normal observance of human rights."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect fr the Iegriy of the Person, Inluding Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exrajudicial Killing.-There is no reliable estimate of the
 number of people killed for political reasons in 1992. Given the lack of basic proce-
 dural safeguards in political trials, most of the executions ordered each year in such
 cases amount to summary executions.
 The Special Representative has cited Iranian media reports of persons executed
 for political reasons, and the Government has repeatedly indicated in public state-
 ments that it equates active political opposition to Iran's Islamic revolution with ter-
 * Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran, this report draws heavily on unof-
 ficial sources.

 rorisr. In addition, the Government continues to carry out political assassinations
 of its opponents residing abroad. The French Government's investigation into the as-
 sassination in Auguat 1991 of former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and his
 assistant has resulted in .warrants for the arrest of two Iranian government officials.
 German authorities were also investigating the killings in September 1992 of four
 Iranian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. A prominent member of the Baha'i commu-
 nity, Bahman Samandari, was summarily executed in March 1992, the first such
 execution of a Baha'i since 1988.
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances in 1992. Many families of executed political prisoners reportedly have
 not been informed officially of their relatives' deaths. The Government has re-
 sponded to many of the Special Representative's requests for information on specific
 prisoners by denying that it had any judicial record of them.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Persistent reports continue to indicate that detainees are tortured in detention, and
 that arbitrary brutalization of prisoners is common. Common methods of torture are
 said to include suspension for long periods in contorted positions, burning with ciga-
 rettes, and most frequently, severe and repeated beatings with cables or other in-
 struments on the back and on the soles of the feet. Prisoners are frequently held
 in solitary confinement or denied adequate rations or medical care as a way of forc-
 ing them to confess. In the past, guards have threatened and intimidated family
 members of detainees, and relatives or other prisoners have occasionally been forced
 to watch torture; it is not known, however, if such practices occurred in 1992.
 Prisoner protests against poor prison conditions have reportedly been met in the
 past with beatings, denial of medical care, and, in some cases, execution. The Spe-
 cial Representative reported in 1991 the existence of a "Prisoner's Organization to
 redress mistreatment. However no information has been made available on its ac-
 tivities. The Government signed an agreement with the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) in January allowing the ICRC to visit detainees but subse-
 quentl expelled ICRC workers in March. As of late 1992, the ICRC had not re-
 sumed its activities in Iran (except for some isolated cases).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention has been
 a major abuse, but it is not known how many cases there may have been in 1992.
 It is known that some persons were arrested on trumped-up criminal charges when
 their actual "offenses" were political. The lack of fair trials and other procedural
 safeguards encourage such practices.
 Baha'is continued to face arbitrary arrest and detention. As of August 1992, there
 were nearly 20 Baha'is in prison, as the Government continued its practice of de-
 taining a small but relatively steady number of Baha'is at any one time.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists in Iranian law. There
 is reportedly no legal time limit on incommunicado detention. Suspects are held for
 questioning at local Revolutionary Guard offices or in jails.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are essentially two different court systems.
 The civil courts deal with criminal offenses, and the revolutionary courts, estab-
 lished in 1979, try "political" offenses as well as cases involving narcotics trafficking
 and "crimes against God."
 By international standards, trials by revolutionary courts cannot be considered
 fair or public. If the trial is staged publicly, it is generally because the prisoner has
 already been forced to confess to a crime. Persons tried by the revolutionaty courts
 (including drug trafficking cases) enjoy virtually no procedural or substantive safe-
 guards; hence any executions carried out in such cases must be considered equiva-
 lent to summary executions. The Special Representative reported that trials lasting
 5 minutes and less are common. He also noted in his February 1991 report many
 examples of the lack of basic procedural guarantees, mentioning particularly the
 problem of limited access to a lawyer. The right to a defense counse is theoretically
 provided for in Iranian law and in the Constitution, but in actual practice defend-
 ants are not known to have access to a lawyer; moreover, they are unable to call
 witnesses on their behalf and are unable to appeal. Some persons have been impris-
 oned beyond the limit of their sentence and even executed after the formal expira-
 tion of their prison term.
 There was again no evidence in 1992 of any judicial reform that would bring Ira-
 nian courts into compliance with international standards, despite claims by judici-
 ary officials in 1991 that reforms would be implemented in response to recommenda-
 tions by the Special Representative.
 The judicial system is weakened by the fact that revolutionary courts may con-
 sider cases formally under the jurisdiction of the civil and criminal courts. Assign-
 ment of cases to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard and appar-
 ently occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular police. Revolutionary courts
 
 
 1001
 may also overturn the decisions of the civilian courts. The review authority of the
 Suprme Court is also limited.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the prerevolutionary jdicial sys-
 tem survive and the accused often have the right to a public trial with benefit of
 lawyers of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even this judiciary
 is not fully independent, however. Many of the former judges were retired after the
 revolution, and new judges were selectedL One criterion for new judges is grounding
 in Islamic law, and political acceptability is a requirement for any government posi-
 tion. Favorable verdicts reportedly can often be "purchased" from the judges serving
 on civil and criminal courts and to a lesser degree from judges of the revolutionary
 courts.
 No reliable estimate is available on the number of political prisoners. One human
 rights group reported that 10,000 prisoners allegedly benefited from amnesties or
 reductions in their sentences to msr the 13th anniversary of the Islamic revolution
 in 1992 but the amnesty excluded those accused of opposing 'the system.*
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which the State
 may control and a sphere of private life (reigio  culture, thought, and private be-
 havior) which the State may not properly  nrl. Authorities enter homes and of-
 fices, wiretap telephones, and open mail, but these activities are less common now
 than they were be ore 1982.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and security forces check on social activities.
 Women whose clothing does not completely cover the hair and all of the body except
 hands and face, or who wear makeup, are subject to arrest. Men have also periodi-
 cally been required to dress "modestly," eschewing, for example, short-sleeved shirts.
 Enforcement of standards of Islamic morality has appeared to vary with the  litical
 climate and the jurisdiction. There have been periodic crackdowns by the iead Of-
 rice for Combating Unlawful Acts on dress code and moral violations. However,
 there were continuing reports in 1992 of instances in which women challenged the
 authority of the Special Revolutionary Guards to impose 'proper" dress.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-According to the Constitution, "publications and
 the press may express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic prin-
 ciples, or are detrimental to public rights." In ractice, most publications are con-
 trolled by the Government; independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns and confiscation of publications and equipment but of arrest and sum-
 mary punishment if they are overly critical of the Government. The magazine Farad
 was banned in April, and its editor and two employees arrested after the magazine
 published a cartoon which the authorities deemed insulting to the late Ayatollah
 Khomemi.
 All books must be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic Guidance for review before
 they may be published. Publishers, authors and printers also engage in substantial
 self-censorship before submitting books to die Ministry in an effort to avoid the sub-
 stantial enalties, including economic losses, incurred when books are rejected. Ira-
 nian au orities have interpreted broadly their right to censorship on religious
 grounds, including official acceptance of the religious decree condemning British au-
 thor Salman Rushdie to death for his book "Satanic Verses."
 Newspapers, which are usually associated with various government factions, re-
 flect a variety of viewpoints. Generally, newspapers can and do criticize overnnent
 policies and officials beth in their reporti  and editorials. They are forbidden, how-
 ever, to criticize the concept of the Islamic republic or to promote ethnic minority
 rights. Nevertheless, some independent publishers out of favor with the Government
 continue to survive, and some books and pamphlets critical of the Government are
 published without reprisal. The Freedom Movement, for example, reportedly began
 publication of a monthly magazine in 1992, producing at least one issue. Foreign
 books, newspapers, and maazines may be imported only after they have been re-
 viewed by the Ministry of Is amic Guidance.
 All broadcasting facilities are government owned, and the content of their broad-
 casting reflects the political and socioreligious ideology of the Government.
 Although restrictions on academic freedom has been eased somewhat, course con-
 tent is still monitored and there is little genuine critical discussion of issues. In-
 formers are said to be common on campus and in the classroom. To achieve tenure,
 professors reportedly must cooperate with government authorities over a period of
 years. All textbooks proposed for use at the universities are reviewed by government
 authorities to determine their acceptability.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits un-
 armed assemblies and marches "provided they do not violate the principles of
 
 
 1002
 
 Islam." In practice, the on, ones permitted are those sponsored by the Government,
 such as Friday prayers and parades and demonstrations on official occasions. There
 were reports again in 1992 of unofficial and spontaneous demonstrations against the
 Government, many of them centering on the deteriorating economy. These dem-
 onstrations were suppressed by government forces, and official Iranian sources re-
 ported that at least 8 persons were executed for their involvement in them; the ac-
 tual number executed is thought to be much higher.
 Article 26 of the Constitution allows the formation of political parties, groups, and
 professional associations, as well as Islamic and some minority religious associa-
 tions, provided they do not violate the principles of "freedom, sovereignty, [and] na-
 tional unity" or question Islam or the Islamic Republic. In practice, most independ-
 ent organizations have either been banned, co-opted by the Government, or are mor-
 ibund.
 The Freedom Movement, founded in 1961 and declared illegal in 1991, continues
 to be harassed by Iranian authorities. According to reliable reports the Movement's
 telephones are tapped, its mail opened, and its members subjected to intimidation.
 While the Movement participated in the first parliamentary election after the revo-
 lution, it was prevented from doing so in all subsequent elections. A few of the nine
 persons belonging to the Association for Freedom and Democracy who were tried
 and sentenced in 1991 had their sentences suspended (but not lifted) and were al-
 lowed to return home because of their severe health problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The state religion is Islam, and religion is almost insepa-
 rable from government in Iran. The President and many other top officials ar
 mullahs (Islamic clergymen), as are the Speaker of the Parliament and many of the
 parliamentary deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from slightly over
 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is, Christians Zoroastrians and Jews) the
 rest are Sunni Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans, Baluch,
 and other ethnic minorities whose political influence is very limited. The Constitu-
 tion declares that "the official religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is
 Ja'fari Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations shall enjoy
 complete respect."
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic religion of Iran)
 populations are concentrated mainly in urban areas. Their religions are recognized
 by the Constitution, and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in the
 Parliament. They are permitted to practice their religions, to instruct their children,
 and-although with a great deal of disruptive interference-to maintain schools.
 Administrative and other official harassment nevertheless is reported to be com-
 monplace. In the case of the Chaldean Catholics (numbering about 14,000), the Gov-
 ernment has reportedly refused to renew the church's registration and has, as a re-
 suit, denied requests to print Bibles, construct chapels, or engage in registered char-
 itable activities. The Presbyterian Church has allegedly suffered similar interference
 from the authorities. A Christian convert from Islam, Mehdi Debadj, arrested in
 1983, reportedly is still being held in prison.
 The Government continues to discriminate against the Baha'i community, Iran's
 largest non-Muslim minority (300,000 to 350,000 members). The Baha'i religion is
 considered a "misguided sect" by the authorities and is not officially recognized. In
 legal matters, the Government has stated that it will protect the "social and legal
 rights" of Baha'is as "normal citizens." However, the Government has continued to
 attack the Baha'i community as a front for political and espionage activities and
 prohibits the community from electing leaders or conducting religious activities. The
 actual treatment of Baha'is varies depending on the jurisdiction. Baha'i marriages
 are still not recognized. Baha'is are now generally able to bury their dead in Baha'i
 cemeteries, although this remains a problem in a number of areas. Baha'is are for-
 bidden to participate in social welfare organizations, and they may not teach their
 faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been re-
 strictions on travel to Kurdish areas at times of heavy fighting. Persons may change
 their place of residence without obtaining permission. Between 3 and 4 million refu-
 gees, primarily Afghans but also Kurdish and Shi'a refugees displaced from Iraq in
 t   atrmath of the Gulf war, remained in Iran as of late 1992.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit permits except for approved courses of
 study, and Iranians who are suspect politically, such as some retired military offi-
 cers and high-level public officials under the former regime, are not able to leave
 the country. Some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in short supply and
 who were educated at government expense, have had to post bonds to obtain exit
 permits. In his February 1991 report, the Special Representative recounted several
 
 
 1003
 instances in which passports were denied, sometimes for apparent political reasons,
 and on other occasions with no reason given. There was no evidence that this situa-
 tion ameliorated in 1992.
 Iranian Jews are permitted to obtain "passports and to travel, even to Israel, but
 they are normally denied the multiple-exit permits given to most Iranians and must
 make a new application (with another fee) for each-planned trip. Permission is not
 normally granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel outside Iran at the
 same time.
 Iranians are generally able to return to Iran after long periods abroad without
 reprisal. The Government actively encourages the many thousands of skilled Ira-
 nians living abroad to return to help rebuild the country. Of those who have re-
 turned in recent years, a number have been able to pursue, through the Iranian ju-
 dicial system, the restoration of their properties. However, many exiles complain
 that formal legal guarantees of their safety have not yet been provided, and, as a
 result, many remain reluctant to return.
 There are some categories of persons who may be in danger if they return to Iran.
 Some of those with close ties to the former regime, draft evaders, and those who
 departed the country illegally face possible arrest upon their return. Members of or
 sympathizers with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran or the Communist
 Tudeh Party, both opposition groups banned by the Government are subject to im-
 prisonmert and torture or even execution should they return. Nevertheless, imme-
 diate relatives ofpersons wanted by the Government are ofen able to live in Iran,
 travel outside, and return without undue difficulty.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped not valid for emigration," but the
 Government does not make a clear distinction between legal        in another
 country and emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a legal resi-
 dence outside Iran may be issued passports and advance exit permits by the Iranian
 embassy, consulate, or interests section in their country of residence. The Govern-
 ment does not recognize dual nationality and considers Iranian-born US. citizens
 to be Iranians unless they formally renounce their Iranian citizenship in accordance
 with Iranian law. There have been many instances in which Iranian authorities
 have confiscated the U.S. passports of dual nationals. There are no known instances
 of the denial of Iranian citizenship to Iranians who left Iran, or to those who have
 remained there.
 The Government of Iran and the United Nations High Coimmissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) estimate there were approximately 2.8 million Afghan refugees in
 Iran at the beginning of 1992, 700 to 800 of whom arrived as economic migrants
 before 1978-79. The majority of the Afghan refugees are believed to have been inte-
 grated into local Iranian life. The remainder live either seminomadic lives or reside
 in government settlements in central and eastern Iran. The Government of Iran pro-
 vided assistance to those refugees. During the late spring and summer of 1992,
 some 200,000 Afghan refugees repatriated from Iran to Afghanistan. There were
 government/UNHCR plans in late 1992 to establish a formal repatriation program
 for the Afghan refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Gouern-
 ment
 Iranian citizens do not enjoy the right to change their government peacefully. Iran
 is ruled by a group of religious leaders (mullahs) and their lay associates who share
 a belief in the legitimacy of a theocratic state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's inter-
 pretation of Shi'a Islam.
 The revolutionary Government has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 president, Parliament deputies, members of the Assembly of Experts (responsible for
 choosing the Revolutionary Leader's successor), and members of local government
 councils. Parliamentary elections were held in April and May. Voting is by universal
 suffrage of everyone age 15 and older and is by secret ballot. All candidates must
 be approved by the Council of Guardians, however, and only those meeting the
 Council's vaguely described political and religious criteria may run. In practice, only
 supporters of the theocratic state are accepted. Even within this group, there were
 complaints from some Iranian politicians that the Council of Guardians deliberately
 used its authority to block their candidacies in the 1992 parliamentary elections.
 A few political parties have been licensed following the Ministry of Interior's an-
 nouncement in December 1988 that political parties would be allowed to form, pro-
 vided they met the Government's religious and political criteria.
 The Constitution provides for an independent Parliament which exists to a large
 degree in practice. While Parliament deputies are ty ically allied with various pow-
 erful political and religious officials, they may speak and vote independently and
 may shift from one faction to another. Vigorous parliamentary debates--normally
 
 
 1004
 covered extensively in the press-cover a wide variety of issues. Harsh criticism of
 government officials is often heard in these debates, and, in some cases, laws pro-
 posed by the executive branch have been voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of 12 members:
 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by the Leader, and 6 lay members well grounded
 in Islamic law who are nominated by the head of the Judiciary, subject to the Par-
 liament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify all bills passed by the
 Parliament as being in accordance with Islamic law and the Constitution. If bills
 fail to be certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision. The Council
 of Guardians can and does reject important bills and portions of bills passed by the
 Parliament. The Council for the Discernment of Expediency, a body created in 1988,
 resolves those legislative issues on which the Majlis and Council of Guardians dis-
 agree.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Iranian organizations that attempt to speak out on human rights, such as the
 Freedom Movement and the Association for the Protection of Liberties and Human
 Rights, face severe harassment by the Government (see Section 2.b.). In the past,
 the Government generally has been uncooperative with foreign human rights
 groups, whether government-sponsored or independent, regarding their activities as
 interference in the country's internal affairs. Foreign diplomats stationed in Tehran
 who attempt to develop information about human rights abuses face strong inter-
 ference from Iranian authorities.
 In late 1991, the Government permitted the U.N. Special Representative to visit
 the country for a third time and interview both opponents and supporters of the
 Government including high-ranking government officials such as the head of the
 Judiciary. Nevertheless, his access to victims of abuse was limited, many potential
 witnesses were intimidated or prevented from testifying and some of those who had
 testified during earlier visits reported having suffered reprisals. Government-im-
 posed controls during the Special Representative's visits prevented him from being
 able to investigate fully all reports of human rights abuses. As of late 1992, the Ira-
 nian Government had not responded to the Special Representative's request to make
 a return visit to Iran.
 In his February 1992 report, the Special Representative found that in 1991 the
 Islamic Republic of Iran had made "no appreciable progress towards improved com-
 pliance with human rights in accordance with the current international instru-
 ments." There were no developments in 1992 indicating that subsequent progress
 had been made. At the United Nations, Iran continued its efforts to end, or at least
 restrict, the Special Representative's mandate.
 Iran continued to assert that it should be judged by "Islamic," rather than West-
 ern, human rights principles.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The discrimination that women have traditionally faced in Iranian society has in-
 creased since the revolution. Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the hair and
 all of the body except the face and hands, is a requirement for all women, regardless
 of their religion, national origin, or citizenship. Women have been harassed, de-
 tained, or physically attacked if they appeared in public in clothing that official or
 self-appointed guardians of public morslity deemed insufficiently modest. Enforce-
 ment of these rules has varied considerably since Ayatollah Khomeini's death in
 1989, and, as noted in Section 1.f., there was evidence in 1992 of continuing resist-
 ance by women to the authority of the Special Revolutionary Guards to impose a
 dress code.
 Although violence against women is known to occur in Iran, little is known about
 its extent. Abuse within the family is considered a private matter in this conserv-
 ative society and is seldom discussed publicly. There are no official statistics on the
 subject. In the past, there have been credible reports of the torture and execution
 of women detainees, some of whom were allegedly raped before execution; it is not
 known if any such incidents occurred in 1992.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce their husbands,
 and regulations promulgated in 1984 substantially broadened the number of
 grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A husband may obtain a divorce
 without stating a reason or going to court.
 The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities suffer varying degrees
 of officially sanctioned discrimination in a number of areas, particularly with respect
 to employment, education, and public accommodations. Muslims who have converted
 to Christianity are similarly discriminated against, and under Shari'a (Islamic) law
 
 
 1005
 the ultimate penalty for apostasyis ecution. One requirement of university admis-
 Rion is passirg a test on Islamic theology, which has the effect of limiting most reli-
 gious minorities' access to higher education, although all students must receive in-
 struction on Islam regardless of their religion. Applicants for public sector employ-
 ment are similarly screened for adherence to standards of Islamic orthodoxy, with
 much the same effect. There have also been reports that religious minorities have
 suffered discrimination in the legal system, such as receiving lower awards in i jury
 and death lawsuits, and of suffering heavier punishments than those imposed on
 Muslims. Although Sunnis have encountered religious discrimination on the local
 level, the Government has tried to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 The Government continued to return some of the property of individual Baha'is
 that it had previously confiscated, although the amount represents a small fraction
 of the total seized. Some 25 families, however, were evicted from their homes in
 September following court decisions in Tehran, Isfahan, and Yazd. Property of the
 community, such as places of worship, remains confiscated. Most Bahals are now
 able to obtain food ration booklets. Baha'i children are now permitted to attend
 grade school and high school but are generally not permitted to attend college or
 em ploed on college faculties. A amall number of Bahais were permitted to lcave
 the country. While some Baha'i's have been issued passports, the Special Represent-
 ative reported that the vast majority of such applications are denied.
 Some Baha'i continue to be denied public sector (and often private sector) em-
 ployment on account of their religion; in a number of cases ration cards have been
 denied on the same grounds. Thousands of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs
 in the early 1980's receive no unemployment benefits and have been required to
 repay the Government for salaries or pensions received from the first day of employ-
 ment. Those unable to do so face severe prison sentences.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Article 131 of the Labor Code grants workers and
 employers alike the right to form and join their own organizatios. In practice, how-
 ever there are no real labor unions in Iran. A na ion  or ization known as the
 Worer's House, founded in 1982 as the labor wing of the now defunct Islamic Re-
 publican Party, is the only authorized national labor organization with nominal
 claims to represent all Iranian workers. It works closely with the workplace Islamic
 councils that exist in many Iranian enterprises. The Workers' House is largely a
 conduit of government influence and control, not a trade union founded by workers
 to represent their interests.
 The officially sanctioned Islamic labor councils also function as instruments of
 government influence and not as bodies created and controlled by workers to ad-
 vance their own interests, although the councils have frequently been able to block
 layoffs or the firing of workers.
 A network of guild unions operates on a regional basis. These guild unions issue
 vocational licenses, fund financial cooperatives to assist members, and help workers
 to find jobs. The guild unions operate with the backing of the Government.
 No information is available on the right of workers in Iran to strike. It is unlikely
 that the Government would tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. There were reports throughout 1992, however, of brief
 strikes in factories and in the petroleum industry, sparked chiefly by economic con-
 ditions.
 b. The Right f guganle und Baorgain Collectil.--In prastic, the right ofwork-
 ers  t organize ndependentf and bargal n collecti vely cannot be csumentd . It is
 not known whether labor legislation and practice in the exprt processing zones dif-
 fer in any significant respect from the law and practice in the rest of the country.
 No information is available on the mechanism used to set wages.
 c. Prohibition tf Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Section 2'T3 of the Iranian Pena~l
 Code provides that any person who does not have definite means of subsistence and
 who, through laziness or negligence, does not look for work may be obliged by the
 Government to take suitable, employment. This provision has been frequently criti-
 cized by the International Labor Organization (l ) as cntraven g ILO Conven-
 tion 29 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Iranian labor law, which exempts
 agriculture, domestic service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 15 years (compulsory education ex-
 tends through age 11) and places special restrictions on the employment of minors
 under 18. In addition women and minors may not be used for hard labor or, in gen-
 eral, for maiht work. Information on the extent to which these regulations are en-
 forced by tCue Labor Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and Social Af-
 fairs and the local authorities is not available.
 
 
 1006
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to set minimum wage levels each year determined by industrial sector and
 regon. It is not known if minimum wage levels are in fact issued annually or if the
 Labor Ministrys inspectors enforce their application. The Labor Code stipulates that
 the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the living expenses of a family and
 should take into account the announced rate of inflation. Information on the share
 of the working population covered by the minimum wage legislation or the share
 of the work force receiving a decent wage is not available.
 Labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum (except for over-
 time at premium rates), with 1day of rest (normally Friday) per week as well as
 at least 12 days per year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health and issuing occupational safety and health regulations and codes of practice.
 The Council has reportedly issued 28 safety directives. The Supreme Safety Council
 is also supposed to oversee the activities of the safety committees that have report-
 edly been established in about 3000 enterprises employing more than 10 persons.
 It is not known how well the Labor Ministry's inspectors enforce the safety and
 health legislation and regulations nor whether industrial accident rates are com-
 piled and show positive trends (Iran does not furnish this data to the ILO for publi-
 cation in its Year Book of Labor Statistics).
 Given the large segments of the economy exempted from the labor law, the State's
 still unresolved administrative disorganization resulting from the revolution, the ef-
 fects of the war with Iraq, andthe general lack of effective labor unions, it is un-
 clear to what extent the provisions of Iran's labor law affect most of the labor force.
 The ILO has long been concerned with official discrimination in employment
 against members of the Baha'i religion.
