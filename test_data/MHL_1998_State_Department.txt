 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of 34 atolls in the central
 Pacific, with a total land area of about 70 square miles. The approximately 56,000
 inhabitants are of Micronesian origin and concentrated primarily on Majuro and
 Kwajalein atolls.
 The Constitution provides for free and fair elections, executive and legislative
 branches, and an independent judiciary. The legislature consists of a 33-member
 Parliament (Nitijela), and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), which serves a largely consult-
 ative function dealing with custom and traditional practice. The President is elected
 by majority Nitijela vote and he appoints his Cabinet from its membership. The
 Government attempts to influence the judiciary.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security, and the Marshall Islands has no external security force
 of its own. The national and local police forces have responsibility for internal secu-
 rity. These agencies honor constitutional and legal civil rights protections in execut-
 ing their responsibilities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, import and income taxes, and
 fishing licensing fees generate limited revenues.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 However, government influence leads to occasional media self-censorship, and also
 affects the judiciary. There were instances of denial of due process for detainees. Vi-
 olence against women and child abuse are problems,
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly forbids such practices, and there were no reports that
 officials employed them. Prison conditions, while Spartan, meet minimal inter-
 national standards. The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes this prohibition.
 There were three reported cases of arbitrary detention--one lasting up to 7 days-
 in which persons were denied their rights to be charged or released within the speci-
 fied time, or to be informed of the charges against them.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, the Government attempts to influence judicial matters through leg-
 islative or administrative means. A High Court seat vacated in July remains un-
 filled. The President and his cabinet ministers publicly criticized the foreign na-
 tional High Court Chief Justice harshly. The harsh critical statement was broadcast
 on the government radio station following the Judge's declaration concerning a con-
 stitutional interpretation with which the Government disagreed.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right.
 The judiciary consists of a Supreme Court with appellate jurisdiction, a High
 Court with general jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters and appellate jurisdic-
 tion over subordinate courts at the district and community levels, and a Traditional
 
 
 1006
 Rights Court with jurisdiction in cases involving matters of customary law and tra-
 ditional practice.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from such practices, government authorities re-
 spect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally honors these rights in practice. How-
 ever, government influence leads to occasional self-censorship by the media in areas
 of political or cultural sensitivity.  -
 There is a privately owned weekly newspaper with articles and opinions in both
 English and the Marshallese language.
 There are two radio stations, one government owned. The President and cabinet
 members control the programming of the government station and generally allow
 nonadministration viewpoints to be aired. There is a cable television company that
 broadcasts a variety of foreign news and entertainment programs and occasional
 videotaped local events.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and this is observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 There are no recent reports of refugees. The Government has not formulated a
 policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right through periodic elections. The Nitijela
 (Parliament) and mayors are elected by secret ballot every 4 years with universal
 suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and older. The President is selected by the
 Nitijela from among its 33 members. The President then selects nine cabinet min-
 isters from among his closest supporters in the Nitijela. Executive power is central-
 ized in the president and his cabinet. This elite group dominates the legislature as
 well. In September the President and his Cabinet walked out of the legislative ses-
 sion when the Speaker of the Nitijela ruled that there would be a secret ballot on
 a motion of no confidence. The boycott continued at year's end. The action precip-
 itated a virtual shutdown of the legislature and a constitutional crisis that is under
 appeal to the Supreme Court. There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties, but no formal parties exist. Political activity by foreigners i prohibited.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. One woman holds a deputy minister position, and a woman is mayor of Majuro.
 Society is matrilineal, and those men and women who exercise traditional leader-
 ship and land ownership powers derive their rights either from their own positions
 in the family, or from relationships deriving from their mother's and sister's lineage.
 However, urbanization and the movement of the population away from the lands
 that they control, is leading to a decline in the traditional authority exercised by
 women. Women's cultural responsibilities and traditionally passive roles are not
 seen to be managerial or executive in nature, and women remain underrepresented
 in Parliament and other government positions.
 SectiOn 4  om     ntalAttitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations have been formed. No international human rights organization has ex-
 pressed interest or concern or visited the country.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The C    ont on prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 i          s or descent, and the Government generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-The Government identifies spousal abuse as common. Wife beating is
 not condoned in society, and most assaults occur while the assailant is under the
 
 
 1007
 
 influence of alcohol. The Governments health office provides counseling for reported
 spouse and child abuse cases, but advises that many cases go unreported. Assault
 is a criminal offense, but women involved in domestic violence are reluctant to pros-
 ecute spouses in the court system. Women's groups publicize women's issues and at-
 tempt to create a greater awareness of the rights of women. Violence against women
 outside the family occurs, and women in the urban centers would assume a risk by
 going out alone after dark.
 Inheritance of property and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with women occupy-
 ing positions of importance within the traditional system. No instances of unequal
 pay for equal work or of sex-related job discrimination were reported. However,
 while women workers are very prevalent in the private sector, many of them are
 in low paying jobs with little hope of advancement.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and free education, but these have not been adequate to meet
 the needs of the country's sharply increasing population.
 It is estimated that up to 20 percent of elementary school age children are not
 enrolled in school. The Government's enrollment report indicates that only two-
 thirds of those completing eighth grade attend high school. Of that number, 50 per-
 cent eventually graduate.
 Child abuse and neglect are criminal offenses. Although the Government has rati-
 fied the Convention on the Rights of the Child, awareness of the Convention and
 its provisions remain low among the general population. The law requires teachers,
 caregivers, and other persons to report instances of child abuse and exempts them
 from civil or criminal liability as a consequence of making such a report. However,
 there are few reports and few prosecutions. Child abuse and neglect are considered
 to be on the increase. Apparently contributing to the problem are the influences on
 family life and traditional values arising from increased urbanization, unemploy-
 ment, population pressures, two-earner households, and the availability of alcohol
 and illegal gambling.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no apparent discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. There
 are no building codes, and there is no legislation mandating access for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Government interprets this right as allowing the exist-
 ence of labor unions, although none has been formed to date. The Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no im-
 pediments to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. Wages in
 the cash economy are determined by market factors in accordance with the mini-
 mum wage and other laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits invol-
 untary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice. The law does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known
 to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices
 are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 The law does not prohibit the employment of children. Children typically are not
 employed in the wage economy, but some assist their families in fishing, agriculture,
 and other small-scale domestic enterprises. The law requires compulsory education
 for children from 6 to 14 years of age; but the Government does not enforce this
 law due to a lack of classrooms and teachers. There is no law or regulation setting
 a minimum age for employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in this subsistence economy where extended families are expected to help less fortu-
 nate members. The minimum wage for all government and private sector employees
 is $2.00 per hour. (The U.S. dollar is the national currency.) The Ministry of Re-
 sources and Development oversees minimum wage regulations, and its oversight has
 been deemed adequate. Foreign employees and Marshallese trainees of private em-
 ployers who have invested in or established a business in the country are exempt
 from minimum wage requirements. This exemption does not affect a significant seg-
 ment of the work force.
 
 
 1008
 
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours of work or occupational safety
 and health. Most businesses are closed and people'generally refrain from work on
 Sunday.
 A government labor office makes recommendations to the Nitijela on working con-
 ditions, such as the minimum wage, legal working hours and overtime payments,
 and occupational health and safety standards in accordance with International
 Labor Organization conventions. The office periodically convenes board meetings
 that are open to the public. There is no legislation specifically giving workers the
 right to remove themselves from situations that endanger their health or safety
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and there is no legislation protect-
 ing workers who file complaints about such conditions.
