 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal
 parliamentary form of government. Representatives in the
 multiparty political system are elected by universal suffrage
 at local, Provincial, and Federal levels. Government
 responsibilities are defined by the national Constitution
 subject to interpretation by the independent judiciary.
 Federal and Provincial election mandates last a maximum of 5
 years. Elections are free and often result in an orderly
 changeover of power to opposition parties.
 Federal, Provincial, and municipal police forces enforce
 national and local law. Canada's armed forces are under the
 authority of the elected civilian Government and have no role
 in domestic law enforcement except in strictly defined
 national emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 Canada's human rights performance in 1988 was exemplary. The
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised
 Constitution in 1982; guarantees fundamental rights and
 freedoms to allcitizens. Government and private
 organizations work actively to ensure that these rights are
 respected in practice at all levels of society. Canada is a
 leader in promoting respect for human rights around the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings.
 Canadian authorities in 1988 sought the extradition from the
 United Kingdom of a Sikh, formerly resident in British
 Columbia, who stands accused of having placed a bomb on a
 Canadian airplane in 1985 that killed two luggage handlers at
 Tokyo's Narita Airport. In an unrelated 1988 incident, a
 17-year-old Sikh refugee claimant was charged with the
 attempted murder, for political motives, of a Canadian
 newspaper editor of Sikh origins. The accused is currently
 being tried as an adult in a British Columbia court.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically
 motivated disappearances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 These abuses are prohibited by law, and none was reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected in practice.

 CANADA
 In July 1988, Parliament passed into law bills introduced in
 1987 which will strengthen the authority of the Government to
 detain refugee claimants and swiftly deport those found
 inadmissible. In 1988, as in 1987, opposition political
 parties and civil rights groups vigorously criticized portions
 of the bills, particularly those prescribing stiff penalties
 for persons and organizations--including churches and other
 humanitarian groups--which assist refugees to reach Canada
 without proper documentation.
 An act authorizing the Federal Government to take special
 measures to ensure safety and security during national
 emergencies was passed in July 1988. The intent of this law
 is to define the kinds of emergencies under which the
 Government may assume extraordinary powers, including the
 suspension of basic civil liberties. The new law replaces the
 older and more loosely defined War Measures Act. The 1939
 Official Secrets Act prohibits the private possession,
 distribution, and publication of information deemed
 prejudicial to the interests of the State and provides that
 persons under suspicion may be arrested without a warrant. No
 arrests under this law occurred in 1988.
 There is no exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In criminal trials, Canadian law provides that a person is
 presumed to be innocent until proven guilty and accords that
 person the right to a public trial and to counsel. Free
 counsel is available to indigents. The Official Secrets Act
 provides for secret trials with certain presumptions in favor
 of the State. Prosecutions under this statute are extremely
 rare, and convictions hard to sustain on appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Federal and Provincial Governments do not interfere with a
 person's basic rights except when there is a reasonable basis
 for presuming that the person is involved in criminal activity.
 Police officials face judicial penalties if they abuse a
 person's privacy without first obtaining a search warrant.
 Complaints by civil rights groups and opposition parties in
 1987 that the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service
 (CSIS) maintained files on, and conducted unwarranted
 investigations of, an unacceptably large number of Canadians
 ceased after CSIS reduced its files and instituted tight
 oversight measures designed to protect the civil rights of all
 Canadians.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. Exceptions to these
 freedoms include laws prohibiting certain forms of hate
 literature and pornography, restrictive decisions by
 Provincial film censorship boards, and laws which specifically
 protect language and cultural rights. An Ontario district
 court in May 1988 sentenced a pro-Nazi publisher to 9 months
 in prison on charges of spreading false news. The charges
 stemmed from a publication claiming that the World War II
 
 
 1008
 CANADA
 Jewish holocaust was a hoax. The publisher was convicted on
 the same charges in 1985, but that conviction was overturned
 on a technicality.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed. Permits
 are not required to organize meetings or form associations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided in law and respected in
 practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside
 Canada, or on the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 Canada continues to be a haven for many refugees and displaced
 persons. There is, nevertheless, widespread concern that many
 have taken advantage of Canada's generous refugee law by
 making spurious requests for asylum. The increasing concern
 of the Government and the public was reflected in Parliament's
 passage in July 1988 of government bills that will establish
 more stringent refugee processing procedures. The Government's
 aim in passing these bills was to strengthen its ability to
 protect fully the rights of genuine refugees while curtailing
 abuse of the system by persons who do not possess a genuine
 claim to refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Canadian people through universal suffrage freely elect
 Federal and Provincial governments which rule Canada.
 Legislative elections must be held at least every 5 years, and
 voter participation rates are high. The Governor General is
 Queen Elizabeth Ills representative as Head of State. The
 Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who usually are elected
 members of the House of Commons, exercise effective power.
 Three politically diverse parties are represented in the
 Commons, and several others function at the Provincial level.
 All Provinces and Territories have similar freely elected
 legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums,
 and the Federal Government encourages nongovernmental
 organizations to pursue investigations of human rights abuses
 throughout the world. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
 and its Provincial counterparts investigate and resolve
 complaints of discrimination in public and private sector
 activtties under governmental jurisdiction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, healtil care, and education are available to all
 
 
 1009
 CANADA
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 Article 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees
 equal benefits and protection of the law regardless of race,
 national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, or
 mental or physical disability. These rights are respected in
 practice. However, a variety of women's groups and minority
 rights groups continued in 1988 to express concern that the
 adoption by Canada of a constitutional accord bringing Quebec
 into the Constitution and granting it special status as a
 "distinct society" could endanger the rights of women and of
 linguistic and cultural minorities throughout Canada. Some
 groups see the accord, signed by the Prime Minister and the
 Provincial Premiers and approved by Commons in 1987 but not
 yet approved by all the Provincial legislatures, as
 threatening the promise of equal rights for women and
 minorities set forth by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Women participate freely in Canadian society. A Federal
 Cabinet minister, who is responsible for the status of women,
 and Federal and Provincial human rights commissions oversee
 women's rights. Women are well represented in the labor
 force, including in business and the professions, at wages
 comparable to those of men. Women enjoy marriage and property
 rights equal to those of men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to associate freely and to strike. These rights are
 protected--at the Federal level--by the Canada Labour Code,
 which covers all employees under Federal jurisdiction. All
 other organized workers are protected by Provincial labor
 legislation. Trade unions are independent of the Government
 and may freely affiliate with international organizations.
 In practice, certain groups of essential public sector
 employees are not allowed to strike. Restrictions vary from
 province to province. Eleven thousand members of the Alberta
 Nurses Association, barred from striking by Provincial
 legislation designating them "essential workers," went out on
 strike in January-February 1988, ignoring court orders to
 return to work. The Nurses Association was ordered to pay
 unprecedently high fines for the action, and some members were
 charged with contempt for refusing to return to work.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Some essential public
 sector employees have limited collective bargaining rights
 which vary from province to province. All labor unions have
 full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial
 system. Canada has a limited number of export processing
 zones, and labor laws and practices within them are consistent
 with Federal and relevant Provincial laws and practice.
 In 1987 the Security Intelligence Review Committee began an
 investigation of allegations that a person charged with
 conspiracy to bomb four Quebec hotels involved in a labor
 dispute had been acting as an agent provocateur for the CSIS.
 The Committee found no evidence to indicate that the CSIS had
 
 
 1010
 CANADA
 directed or encouraged this person in the perpetration of the
 illegal acts for which he was later convicted. The Committee
 found in addition that the CSIS had never assigned him to
 report on any labor organization or on the labor-related
 activities of any person.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor practiced in Canada.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor legislation differs among the provinces. The
 Federal Government generally prohibits those under 17 years of
 age from working for the Federal Government while school is in
 session. Provinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or
 16 from working without parental consent, working in any
 hazardous employment, or working at night. These prohibitions
 are effectively enforced through inspections conducted by the
 Federal and Provincial labor ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all limit
 the standard workweek to 40 or 48 hours and guarantee a
 sufficient minimum wage. The Province of New Brunswick's
 minimum wage of about $3.33 per hour is the lowest in Canada,
 but it is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living.
 Federal and Provincial legislation, which is effectively
 enforced through inspections conducted by the respective labor
 ministries, protects employees from hazardous working
 conditions.
