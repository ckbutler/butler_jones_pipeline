 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 David Dacko, the Central African Republic's first
 president, was overthrown in a 1966 coup and reinstated
 in September 1979. In a bloodless coup, Dacko success-
 fully toppled the government of former Emperor Jean
 Bedel Bokassa whose 13 years of rule were marked by
 very serious human rights abuses.
 In September 1981, President Dacko relinquished
 political power to the army. In poor health, unable to
 settle his differences with the opposition parties, and
 fearing that a constitutional succession would have
 ultimately brought his arch-rival, Ange Patasse, to the
 presidency, Dacko elected to pass the powers of government
 to his former chief-of-staff, General Andre Kolingba.
 The transfer of power was accomplished without bloodshed
 or popular opposition.
 Unable to come to terms with an increasingly restive
 opposition, Dacko had resorted on two occasions to
 martial law during the first eight months of 1981. In
 mid-March after Dacko had been pronounced the duly-
 elected president of the country, following popular
 elections, Patasse supporters resorted to pillage
 and intimidation in a show of force against the government
 which was unable to restore order by relying entirely
 on the police. Dacko declared a state of siege
 for several days during which he instructed the military,
 under General Kolingba to do whatever had to be done,
 to restore tranquility. Before calm was restored, it
 is believed that five persons, including a policeman,
 had died and several others had been jailed on charges
 of inciting civil unrest. In mid-July, Dacko again
 declared emergency rule in the wake of a bombing of a
 popular cinema in downtown Bangui. On the evening of
 July 14, two bombs were set off by pro-Libyan sympathizers
 whose intent was to terrorize the French and pro-French
 elements in the community. Dismayed by the incident,
 the first of its kind in the republic, Dacko turned
 once more to General Kolingba who administered martial
 law for several days.
 Upon taking power, in September 1981, Kolingba suspended
 the constitution that had been widely approved by
 popular referendum in February 1981. He further
 suspended the activities of all the political parties
 and admonished their leaders to refrain from political
 activity for the foreseeable future. He has shown no
 inclination to allow the political parties to play a
 role in society. Kolingba, who relies on military
 colleagues and civilian confidants for advice, rules by
 decree.
 Kolingba has stated that his major aim is reviving the
 moribund economy. The buildinq of democratic political
 
 
 50
 institutions may follow, but the present government
 argues that these are of secondary importance.
 The government, however, has not abridged the legal
 and judicial systems which are based on the French
 model. It maintains that it intends to use these
 systems to reconstitute the integrity of governmental
 and other institutions which were ridden with corruption.
 For example, about thirty persons were recently arrested
 on charges of embezzlement, and others are being
 prosecuted for lesser offenses. In no instance did the
 prosecutions appear politically motivated. The rights
 of prisoners and defendants are generally respected. No
 reports of mistreatment of prisoners were received in
 1981. Kolingba has thus continued Dacko's approach in
 this regard. Moreover, last August the former president
 decreed an amnesty for petty criminals. However,
 members of the opposition have charged that forty
 opposition partisans are behind bars, accused of
 inciting rebellion and of complicity in the July 14
 bombing.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 While neither the Dacko government, nor Kolingba's, made
 official statements or passed any decrees specifically
 prohibiting torture, no reports of torture were received
 during 1981. A supreme court justice recently noted in
 a speech opening the judicial year that freedom from of
 torture is a right of a defendant under the law of the
 republic.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Prison conditions remain substandard, but those currently
 imprisoned, including those yet to be tried for specific
 crimes, have not been subjected to harsh treatment.
 Family members, legal counsel, doctors, clergy and others
 have access to prisoners. Early in the year, however,
 five of deposed former Emperor Bokassa's henchmen were
 executed by a firing squad after conviction for murder.
 Few observers doubted that justice had been rendered.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence to suggest that people are abducted,
 detained clandestinely, or disappear as a result of
 government action.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The former Dacko government proclaimed itself opposed to
 the practice of arbitrary arrest and imprisonmentZ the
 present government has not made any such explicit pronounce-
 ment. Still, such practices are illegal and so far
 Kolingba has been guided by the law. Detention without
 charge by the police is limited to 48 hours. At that
 point, a detainee must either formally be charged or
 released. However, for serious crimes, local judicial
 procedures (which are modeled on the French) allow for
 unlimited detention while the public prosecutor prepares
 the state's case against the accused. About thirty
 persons are being detained on charges of corruption under
 this procedure.
 
 
 51
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The government endeavors to guarantee that the French-
 modeled legal procedures are fairly and openly applied
 and that the laws are properly executed. The criminal
 court defended its integrity in this regard in late
 1980 by quashing guilty verdicts against several of
 Bokassa's henchmen because of procedural irregularities,
 though the sentences were for the most part subsequently
 confirmed on government appeal.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The criminal codes contain safeguards against the invasion
 of the home at night. There are no reports of significant
 abuse of this right.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 Religious freedom is observed. Mass media are extremely
 limited and broadcast media are controlled by the govern-
 ment. This control enabled the Dacko government in its
 last months to censor reports critical of the government.
 Kolingba's government does likewise. There is no evidence,
 however, of censorship of reading material.
 Before May, 1981, all forms of non-violent public
 assembly were authorized. Political parties often held
 rallies, and their leaders expressed themselves in
 public without fear of reprisal. The riots in March and
 the subsequent politicization of various groups in
 society led to increasing restrictions on freedom of
 assembly, however. Thus in May, 1981, Dacko dissolved
 by decree the largest labor syndicate in the CAR, the
 Union Generale des Travailleurs Centrafricans. Another
 labor federation not hostile to the government was
 established in its stead. This and another such
 organization are led by relatively apolitical Central
 Africans. During 1981 these groups did not engage in
 strikes which would have run counter to the government's
 wishes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Apart from security checks for travelers, there are no
 other limitations on movement within the country.
 Financial and educational constraints rather than
 government controls, restrict foreign travel and
 emigration. The right of voluntary travel and repatri-
 ation is recognized and there appears to be no sexual
 discrimination in its application. About seven to eight
 thousand Chadians are in the country, most of whom have
 been resettled temporarily in local communities.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Dacko government held a popular referendum in
 February 1981 whereby a constitution was approved
 by a wide margin. Multi-party presidential elections
 were held in March and Dacko was elected by 50.23
 percent of the electorate. The government suspended
 the constitution on September 1, however. It further
 suspended the activities of political parties and seems
 intent on limiting public participation in the political
 process until some degree of economic recovery has been
 achieved and until the government concludes that the
 political parties will play a constructive role.
 Although Kolingba has supported the principle of
 non-tribalism in his speeches, some critics and cabinet
 members have charged that his fellow Yakoma tribesmen
 are gaining much more than their "share" of high
 positions in the government and parastatal organizations.
 Kolingba's cabinet, however, is reasonably well balanced
 tribally. Civilians and women generally do not play a
 role in the government; none has been named to the
 cabinet which is solely composed of military officers.
 President Kolingba has civilian advisors, however.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 No international organization or human rights organization
 has made accusations against the Kolingba government.
 None has asked to visit the Central African Republic
 for investigative purposes since the change of government
 in September, 1979. There are no domestic human rights
 monitoring groups.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Kolingba's government, like Dacko's has the enormous
 task of rebuilding and expanding one of the world's
 poorest economies, which was pillaged by Bokassa
 during thirteen years of absolute rule. The government's
 ability to do so depends to a considerable extent on
 massive and long-term inputs of financial and human
 resources from abroad. Current government plans focus
 on strengthening the agricultural sector, primarily
 through road building and maintenance programs, by
 encouraging cash crop production, and upgrading
 basic infrastructure.
 Per capita income was about $305 in 1980, but inflation
 and population growth rates have caused the average
 Central African's income to diminish by 6.7 percent a
 year during the 1977-1980 period.  In 1980, an inflation
 rate of 16 percent continued to contribute to a real
 decline in economic activity and per capita income. As
 a result, during the past several years much of the
 country's predominantly rural population has abandoned
 the cash economy for subsistence farming and hunting.
 Minimum. wage laws are in effect for both industrial and
 agricultural workers, but the number of those affected is
 small relative to the population as a whole, owing to the
 low level of economic development.
 
 
 53
 Despite the ravages of tropical diseases and an infant
 mortality rate of 190 per 1000, the country's population
 of about 2.3 million continues to grow by 2.2 percent a
 year. Life expectancy at birth is about 43 years
 because of the woefully inadequate or simply non-existent
 health care in some parts of the country. Although health
 care is accorded a high priority by the government, the
 government is handicapped by a lack of trained personnel and
 the inaccessibility of large parts of t)e country.
 Government support for education, even under the
 Bokassa regime, has always occupied an important part
 of the government budget. Still, the literacy rate is
 estimated to be no higher than 18 percent. Total
 school population is approximatly 280,000. As in the
 past, the ministry of education has plans to increase
 its expenditures to provide better-trained teaching and
 more schools to Central Africans living outside the
 capital.
 Women are generally accorded a lower status than men in
 Central African society and polygamy is practiced. Never-
 theless, the legal system and traditional practices tend to
 support the rights of multiple wives and their
 children
