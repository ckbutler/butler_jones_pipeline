 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic, with an active multiparty system,
 energetic information media, strong unions, and an ardent
 commitment to democracy in the hemisphere.
 In 1983 Venezuela held its sixth Presidential election in the
 past 25 years of unbroken civilian rule. The campaign was
 lively, with full access to the media by all candidates across
 the political spectrum and a high level of public interest.
 Venezuela has a mixed economy, with a large public sector. The
 state-owned petroleum companies contribute more than any other
 industry to the Gross National Product. After years of
 economic stagnation, the country has been experiencing economic
 problems triggered by falling oil prices. Fairly generous
 social benefits have cushioned the impact of unemployment.
 Human rights problems, when they occur, tend to be well
 publicized and investigated. The country is one of the most
 active participants in international forums and noted within
 the hemisphere as a proponent of democratic rule.
 Guerrilla activity has not been a major problem since the late
 1960's. In 1983 an isolated border post was attacked, and
 there were several widely publicized kidnappings in western
 border areas; these incidents apparently involved Colombian
 guerrilla organizations, sometimes working in concert with the
 Venezuelan Bandera Roja terrorist group. Police and military
 forces made two major roundups of Bandera Roja members.
 Suspected terrorists whose activities involve the use of armed
 force against constitutionally established institutions are
 tried by military courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Venezuelan authorities do not permit or engage in the unlawful
 or arbitrary deprivation of life for political motives. There
 has been evidence, however, of a tendency for the police and
 security forces to shoot and kill criminal suspects on sight.
 Several innocent bystanders have been killed accidently by
 police and security forces apprehending suspects of violent
 crimes. While not condoning these occurrences, the authorities
 have not put a stop to them.
 About a half dozen security force members and a dozen
 guerrillas have been killed in the conduct of the government's
 anti-guerrilla operations. Spokesmen of radical minority
 opposition parties have alleged summary executions by
 government forces in two cases but have advanced no proof, and
 the allegations are not generally believed. A small number of
 terrorists, whose activities have included bank robberies and
 attacks on police and security outposts, are still sporadically
 active in Venezuela.
 b. Disappearance
 Venezuelan police authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest,
 or hold persons in clandestine confinement. The armed forces
 
 (715)
 
 
 have resorted to the use of checkpoints to induct young men who
 have evaded obligatory military service. The inductees are
 at times held incommunicado for a month with no word to family
 or friends as to their whereabouts or physical condition.
 There have been several widely publicized cases of abduction by
 what are believed to be Colombian guerrillas operating in
 Venezuela along the border. The persons abducted, usually
 wealthy landowners or members of their families, are held for
 large ransoms, some ranging in the millions of dollars.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan law and authorities prohibit the torture of
 prisoners; this prohibition is respected in practice.
 Guarantees for the integrity of the individual embodied in the
 Venezuelan Constitution are enforced.
 Venezuelan laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment are generally respected. Some
 infractions occur, however, because of excesses on the part of
 local law enforcement officials or inadequate supervision of
 prison guards. Prison conditions are spartan, at times poor,
 and violence does occur, especially in more remote areas.
 Those responsible are not known to be punished. A contributing
 factor is the poor educational level of prison security
 personnel.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus is a right guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Arrested persons legally cannot be held
 incommunicado for more than 48 hours or detained for more than
 eight days without formal charges. The limits are sometimes
 exceeded, however, usually because of inefficiencies in the
 legal system.
 A much publicized violation of habeas corpus occurred early in
 1983 in connection with the arrest of three influential Caracas
 magazine editors whose articles had offended some high
 government officials. After two of the editors were freed, the
 third was also granted habeas corpus and released. Another
 government official, however, ordered a transfer of judicial
 jurisdiction and the editor's rearrest. A second habeas corpus
 petition was filed on behalf of the editor, but it was delayed
 by the new judge. The editor was finally released after
 considerable publicity.
 In the latter part of 1983, there also occurred a highly
 publicized case involving the arrest on suspicion of industrial
 espionage of an American citizen employed in Venezuela and
 eight of his Venezuelan colleagues. The accused were
 incarcerated and held incommunicado beyond the legal limit
 without being informed of the charges against them. Family and
 attorney contact with them was only secured after a relative of
 the American citizen held a widely reported vigil in the office
 of the prison's director.
 The detention of undocumented foreign workers, mainly from
 Colombia, continued to raise serious problems. Once in police
 custody, thousands of undocumented foreign nationals are
 
 
 frequently held incommunicado for three to six months without
 trial'before being deported.
 The case of four individuals charged with the bombing of a
 Cuban airliner and detained since 1976 has not been resolved.
 The four defendants remain in prison without benefit of trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and usually observed in
 practice. The accused is presumed innocent until guilt is
 proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 The civilian judiciary is independent of any other authority.
 Civilians engaged in armed subversion or terrorism are tried by
 military courts. Amnesty International's 1983 report said that
 by 1982 over 80 political prisoners faced charges of military
 rebellion in military courts. Amnesty's report also criticized
 the delay in handling of some cases of civilians under the
 jurisdiction of military courts in 1982.
 Charges in both civilian and military courts must be for
 specific criminal offenses, and rules of evidence are very
 strict. Military justice provides full access to the court by
 the accused and his counsel, but third-party access to the
 proceedings is left to the judge's discretion.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Venezuelan Constitution and laws provide safeguards against
 arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence. These safeguards are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Includingi
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Radio, television, and the press are free in Venezuela and are
 often highly critical of the authorities.
 In March, three influential Caracas magazine editors were
 arrested for allegedly failing to observe due respect to the
 memory of Venezuelan's Liberator, Simon Bolivar, and to the
 position of two high-ranking government officials. (The
 alleged offenses consisted of two unflattering articles about
 the government officials and an article picturing Bolivar as
 having been "devalued"--a reference to the drop in foreign
 exchange value of Venezuela's currency unit, the bolivar.) The
 media and public swiftly criticized the violation of the
 consitutional right of free expression. Three weeks after the
 arrest order was issued, all three editors were free with
 charges against them dismissed.
 The Government owns and operates two of the four television
 channels operating in the capital. Two of the numerous radio
 stations are also government owned and operated. Venezuela's
 print media are privately owned.
 Within the cultural and academic arenas, censorship, or
 interference on political grounds rareiy occur.
 
 
 718
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected in
 Venezuela.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held frequently without interference.
 An "object of special protection" under the Venezuelan
 Constitution, labor unions are free, independent, and
 powerful. The right to strike is exercised without official
 interference. Unions associate with the recognized public and
 private international bodies in their fields. The
 Confederacion de Trabajadores de Venezuela, an International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions affiliate, dominates
 organized labor in Venezuela. Other confederations occupy a
 lesser role in the labor scene. These include the
 Confederacion Unitaria de Trabajadores Venezolanos, which is
 affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions; the
 Confederacion de Sindicatos Autonomos de Venezuela; and
 Confederacion General de Trabajadores. The latter two
 organizations are of Christian Democratic orientation; both are
 affiliated with the Latin American Confederation of Workers and
 have ties to the World Confederation of Labor.
 Professional and academic associations flourish without
 interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Most
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and are allowed to
 proselytize actively. There are, however, a number of
 Protestant evangelical groups active in remote areas of
 Venezuela, whose members have at times been subject to
 harassment by local authorities. A federal commission has been
 formed to investigate the charges and countercharges of the
 missionaries and the local authorities. Also, in 1983 the
 Ministry of Justice and Religion refused to authorize entrance
 visas for new missionaries from these groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, citizens of Venezuela have freedom of movement to
 travel within the country and abroad and to return. The one
 exception pertains to travel to the Amazon Region of the
 country which requires a special permit for security reasons.
 Venezuelans may emigrate without restriction.  Citizenship can
 be renounced but not revoked. Recovery of nationality requires
 a residence period of two years for Venezuelan-bokn repatriates.
 Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for refugees and
 displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. As Venezuela does not recognize a "refugee status"
 for entry, refugees are given normal residence status and once
 within the country are expelled only for criminal activities.
 A special "family reunification program" exists for Cuban
 refugees living in Venezuela.

 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy, and as such the political
 process is open to all persons and parties. Opposition views
 are freely expressed and persons from the entire political
 spectrum contend for positions ranging from municipal council
 seats to the nation's Presidency.
 Some of the minor parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations, and they currently hold about 15 percent of the
 seats in the national legislature. Their participation in the
 political process is encouraged and supported by the two major
 centrist parties, Social Christian and Social Democrat,
 reflecting a widespread desire to have radical elements
 participate in the electoral process rather than engage in
 armed insurrection.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Venezuela is a frequent and vocal critic of governments in
 Latin America and elsewhere that commit or tolerate widespread
 human rights violations. It similarly supports international
 human rights organizations. Venezuela accepts the jurisdiction
 of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. An Amnesty
 International office and the Latin American Foundation for
 Human Rights and Social Development operate freely in Caracas.
 Venezuela in 1983 was the site of numerous international forums
 dealing with the issue of human rights.
 Amnesty International, in its.1983 report, expressed several
 concerns about human rights abuses in 1982. It noted that
 military tribunals had tried civilians charged with political
 offenses; that five prisoners had been held for over five years
 without trial, that there had been allegations of torture and
 one "disappearance" but the police officers implicated in the
 disappearance and torture were tried for aggravated homicide,
 and that the circumstances surrounding the death of 23 alleged
 guerrillas were being investigated. A broadly based special
 congressional committee concluded that the guerrillas died in
 armed combat and allegations of improper use of force could not
 be sustained. Freedom House in its 1983 report described
 Venezuela as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Venezuela has a high per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of
 about $3,900, largely because of oil exports. Despite the
 country's tremendous potential, however, in 1983 it suffered
 economic-difficulties, and per capita GNP fell. On February 18
 a de facto devaluation decreased the value of the free-market
 bolivar used by private business and the general populace to
 about one-third of its pre-Febtuary figure. As a result,
 general purchasing power fell, while business bankruptcies and
 unemployment increased.
 The Government continues, despite declining revenue, to aim its
 welfare programs at improving education, housing, and public
 health services for poorer Venezuelans.
 
 
 720
 Restriction on property rights based on sex, nationality, and
 religion or social status do not exist in Venezuela.
 Women in Venezuela are increasingly active in all political
 parties and present in the professions, in the judiciary, and
 in public administration. There are currently five women in
 the Venezuelan Cabinet. Venezuela's Constitution prohibits
 discrimination on the basis of sex and, in addition to equal
 political rights, accords women "special protection" in the
 workplace. Women workers are accorded extensive pre- and
 post-maternity leave benefits. There are also restrictions on
 the amount of involuntary overtime which may be required of
 women workers. Women are still underrepresented in political
 and economic life. Although wage and employment differences do
 exist, there is a trend toward greater equality for women.
 In 1983, the population was 17,993,000 with a growth rate of
 3.10 percent. Life expectancy at birth in 1983 was 67.4
 years. The infant mortality rate was 36.2 per 1,000 live
 births in 1983. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 102
 percent. The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio was 110
 percent and the adult literacy rate, 77 percent.
