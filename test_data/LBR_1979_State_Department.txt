 LIBERIA
 Liberia is the oldest republic in Africa. Founded in 1822 by
 blacks who were seeking the fundamental liberties denied them
 in the United States, Liberia has had strong cultural ties
 with the United States. The Liberian Constitution of 1847
 resembles the American system in its separation of powers and
 its protection of individual human rights. Subsequent amend-
 ments have served to reinforce these principles.
 Liberia has faced a serious social problem over the years
 due to divisions between descendants of the settlers and the
 indigenous population. The "unification policy," first
 enunciated by President Tubman in 1944, has in the past 35
 years changed substantially the social patterns in Liberia.
 While there is residual tension along these lines, Liberia's
 political dynamics now reflect the normal third world strains
 of rich/poor and urban/rural.
 With the accession to power of President William R. Tolbert,
 Jr. in 1971, the Government has increased its efforts to
 promote development throughout the country and has given
 added impetus to efforts to bring social justice and equality
 of opportunity to all.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is neither sanctioned nor practiced in Liberia.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government does not countenance arbitrary killing, or
 permit involuntary servitude. The penal system is modeled
 after that of the United States. Convicted thieves are,
 however, routinely flogged in public.
 Historically, Liberia has utilized severe methods (e.g.
 beating, verbal abuse) in criminal police investigation.
 While this practice has declined as-police training has
 improved, cases of harsh treatment of suspects still occur.
 Persons arrested on suspicion of ritual murder have been
 particularly subject to such treatment.
 In April more than 40 people were killed and 500 injured in
 Monrovia, when police clashed with and fired on demonstrators
 protesting an increase in the price of rice. There were
 isolated reports of physical mistreatment of those jailed
 during the April riots. These cases were not officially
 sanctioned. However, no steps have been taken against any of
 the security officials alleged to have been involved.
 Prison conditions, which were abysmal during the first half
 of this century, have improved markedly. An assistant
 Minister of Justice heads a rehabilitation program which
 promotes vocational training. New facilities have been
 
 
 107
 built and older ones rehabilitated. Religious groups work
 within the prisons, and considerable latitude is allowed for
 friends and relatives to visit and bring supplementary
 food items.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The unprecedented April 14-15 riots in Monrovia led to a
 number of arrests; all but 30 of the several hundred persons
 arrested were rapidly released. Leaders of dissident organi-
 zations held responsible by the Government for the riots were
 arrested, and charged with treason. On June 26, President
 Tolbert issued a blanket amnesty for all those involved in
 the disturbances, and all prisoners were released. Subsequent-
 ly, the Legislature reenacted for one year the emergency
 powers to suspend habeas corpus granted, inter alia, to the
 President under the Emergency Powers Act of 1973. These
 powers have never been invoked. There are no known political
 prisoners or persons held without charges for political
 reasons in Liberia.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trail
 Liberia's judiciary is modeled after the American system.
 Public trials are fully guaranteed in both right and practice.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are no reports of invasion of the home.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Tolbert Administration is strongly committed to extending
 direct assistance to the country's poor. In an effort to aid
 the bulk of the population, who are subsistence farmers, the
 government has aimed its current four-year development plan
 at an increase in agricultural production, concentrating on
 rice self-sufficiency, and on cash-cropping of rice, rubber,
 palm oil, coffee and cocoa stimulated by support from state
 marketing corporations. Efforts are also being under-
 taken, as part of the program of "simultaneous development,"
 to provide potable water supplies, extend the size and
 quality of the educational system, and increase the number
 of rural health posts. Many of these projects are beginning
 to bear fruit, but all are hampered by budgetary constraints
 as well as by difficulties in delivering government services
 to remote areas.
 The Government is meeting considerable success in improving
 its revenues collection. As a result, more money is available
 for development purposes. The efforts of the Government to
 deliver services to the poor are hampered by a persistent
 pattern of corruption. As a more professional group of
 Government servants rises into positions of authority, there
 has been a slow but steady improvement in this area.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed and observed
 in practice. The Liberian press has assumed more of an
 ombudsman role during the past year. It has been more open
 and frank in its coverage of internal and external events.
 The press has felt sufficiently free to attack officials from
 Cabinet rank on down for corruption, although it does not
 question the President and his family. In particular, its
 free and frank coverage of the July Summit of the Organization
 of African Unity, which led to complaints by some delegations
 was strongly defended by the Liberian Government.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 and regulations governing travel are minimal. Liberia's
 emigration policies are free and liberal.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process has traditionally been open to those
 who meet the age, citizenship and substantial property
 requirements. In response to growing criticism, the Govern-
 ment has recently decided to review the property requirements.
 In 1980 the national legislature will examine and, it is
 expected, broaden the suffrage eligibility criteria.
 Citizenship and the ownership of real property continue
 to be limited to "persons of Negro descent," defined as at
 least one-quarter Negro ancestry. This constitutional pro-
 vision denies citizenship and land ownership to two econo-
 mically important groups of resident aliens, the Lebanese and
 the Indians. Recently the government undertook to reconsider
 this measure, with particular emphasis on land tenure.
 Despite this exclusion from citizenship, Lebanese and Indians
 dominate commerce.
 Since the late 19th century Liberia has been governed by
 representatives of the True Whig party. Until the regis-
 tration of the Progressive People's Party in January 1980, no
 opposition parties had been registered. Many opposition
 groups have existed over the years and their active presence
 has been an acepted part of Liberia's political tradition,
 though their effective functioning has been limited by the
 political patronage and other informal assets held by the
 True Whig Party. President Tolbert remains publicly commit-
 ted to human rights and has resisted pressures to violate
 them in the name of expediency. This was particularly true
 after the April riots.
 Labor Unions function freely, though the unionization of
 government employees, including those of government corpora-
 tions, is prohibied. Liberia is on the ILO special list
 because of a legal prohibition against the organiztion of
 the agricultural work force by industral labor unions. The
 government has repeatedly promised to review this measure
 but has not done so.

 Liberia has an enviable record in the advancement of
 women to positions of responsibility and influence.
 Women presently hold key positions in the Cabinet
 (Finance and Health), the senior levels of the Civil
 Service, the Legislature, the Judiciary, as well as in
 the professions, business, education (including the
 President of the University of Liberia) and religion.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 No international organization has called for an investiga-
 tion of human rights conditions in Liberia in recent years.
 President Tolbert has been a leading advocate of human
 rights. He has acted not only domestically, but, by concrete
 actions such as the hosting of a UNHRC-sponsored seminar on
 human rights, has been in the vanguard of promoting human
 rights consciousness in Africa. His public speeches almost
 always include references supportive of human rights.
