 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a Constitution adopted in 1947.
 Sovereignty is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of
 state. On the national level, power is divided among executive, legislative, and judi-
 cial branches. Executive power is vested in a cabinet, composed of a prime minister
 and ministers of state, responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house Parliament. The
 Diet, elected by universal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister,
 who must be a member of that body. Nearly 70 percent of the electorate usually
 votes in general elections contested by numerous political parties covering a broad
 ideological spectrum. In the lower house general election in July 1993, the Liberal
 Democratic Party (LDP) lost its majority for the first time in 38 years. The Govern-
 ment is now formed by a non-LDP coalition of seven parties. The judicial system
 has several levels of courts; the Supreme Court has final authority.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace and is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be reports of harsh treatment of some suspects in custody.
 The Civil Liberties Bureau in the Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights and
 Refugee Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating to
 human rights practices in Japan.
 Japan's highly industrialized free market economy is efficient and competitive in
 world markets. The 1992 economic slowdown, including an increase in unemploy-
 ment, continued in 1993.
 The Constitution states, "all of the people are equal under the law and there shall
 be no discrimination in political, economic, or social relations because of race, creed,
 sex, social status, or family origin." The human rights assured by the Constitution
 are  generally secured by a just and efficient legal system. However, the
 "Burakumin" (a group historically treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indigenous
 people), women, and alien residents experience varying degrees of discrimination,
 some of it severe and of long standing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal or other extrajudicial killing.
 
 
 654
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of abductions, secret arrests, clan-
 destine detention, or hostage holding by security forces or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is provided for in the Constitution, reports by several Ja panese bar associations and
 some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use ph'si7l violence, including
 kickings and beatings, as well as psychological intimidation, including threats and
 name calling, to obtain confessions from suspects in custody. In Japan confession
 is regarded as the first step in the rehabilitative process. Roughly 85 percent of all
 criminal cases going to trial include confessions, reflecting the priority that the Jap-
 anese system places on admissions of guilt. While abuse remains a problem, appel-
 late courts have overturned several convictions in recent years on the ground that
 they were obtained by forced confession. In addition, civil suits have been brought
 against some  lice and prosecution officials, alleging abuse during interrogation
 and detention. ost of these cases are still pending.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest or impris-
 onment is provided for in the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. Persons cannot be de-
 tained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate
 before trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours with
 limited representation by defense counsel. This period is normally extended by a
 judge for up to 20 additional days for preindictment investigation. If an indictment
 follows, the suspect is transferred to a criminal detention adiity. In practice, de-
 fendants may consult with an attorney during the preindictment period only if they
 can afford to hire one. Bail is rarely available.
 The bar association and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." While Japanese raw stipulates that suspects should be held in
 "houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police cell may be sub-
 stituted. This provision was added to cover a shortage of detention facilities. Critics
 charge that allowing suspects to be detained b the same authorities that interro-
 gate them heightens thepotential for prisoner abuse and coercion.
 The length of time betore a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months from date of arrest; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in duration and fre-
 quency, although the Government denies that this is the case. The Japanese Crimi-
 nal Procedure Code grants the prosecutor's office and investigating police officials
 the power to limit access to attorneys when deemed necessary for the sake of the
 investigation. This is interpreted to mean that counsel may not be present during
 interrogation at any time, before or after indictment. As a court-appointed attorney
 is not approved until after indictment, suspects must rely on their own resources
 to hire an attorney for counseling before indictment. Some local bar associations
 provide detainees with a free counseling session prior to indictment. In practice,
 suspects able to afford private counsel may consult with an attorney an average of
 two times during the detention period before indictment, sometimes without private
 access. Counsel is provided at government expense after indictment when the ar-
 rested person cannot afford one.
 Preventive detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy
 and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this right is re-
 spected in practice. The defendant is informed of charges upon arrest and assured
 a public trial by an independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the right not to be com-
 pelled to testify against themselves as well as free and private access to counsel,
 although the right to such access is sometimes abridged in practice. For example,
 the law allows prosecutors to control access to counsel, and there are persistent alle-
 gations of coerced confessions. Defendants are also protected from the retroactive
 application of laws and have the right to access to incriminating evidence after a
 formal indictment has been made. However, Japanese law does not require full dis-
 closure by the prosecutor, and material that will not be used in court by the pros-
 ecution may be suppressed, even if favorable to the accused.
 The judiciary is independent and free from executive branch interference. Judges
 are appointed by the Cabinet for a 10-year term, which can be renewed until the
 age of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can serve until the age of 70, but face peri-
 odic review through popular referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the
 decision of a trial court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by law,
 appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of courts, with the Supreme Court
 serving as thehighest judicial authority. There is no trial by jury in Japan.
 
 
 655
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There are no reports that the Government or any other organization
 arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, an independent press and ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice. In 1993 the Japanese media drew
 attention to the alleged efforts of the Tokyo municipal government to restrict the
 rights of Iranians living in Japan to assemble in a popular local park. Citizen
 ups have taken up the cause, arguing that the city's actions are discriminatory.
 While the Government has not stood in the way of efforts to resolve the problem
 through appropriate legal and administrative means, neither has it acted to resolve
 the issue.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain the two major re-
 ligions, there are many others, including several Christian denominations. Foreign
 missionaries are welcome and gain admission to Japan through a specific visa cat-
 egory for foreign religious workers. Some temples and shrines receive public support
 as national historic or cultural sites.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely both within Japan and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Japanese nationality can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure to
 elect Japanese nationality at the proper age.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their govern-
 ment. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed by the political party or par-
 ties able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. From 1955
 until 1993, all prime ministers and almost all cabinet ministers were members of
 the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which enjoyed a majority in the lower house
 throughout this period. In 1993 the party lost its parliamentary majority. The Gov-
 ernment is now headed by a non-LDP coalition. Local and prefectural governments
 are often controlled by coalitions.
 Elections on all levels are held frequently; suffrage is universal; and ballots are
 secret.
 Postwar population movements have contributed to significant imbalances in size
 among parliamentary electoral districts. In the most underrepresented lower house
 district-mostly in urban areas-there are nearly three times as many voters per
 representative as in the most overrepresented districts-mostly in rural areas.
 Among upper house districts, the maximum disparity exceeds six-to-one. Court rul-
 ings have called for more equitable electoral districts. One court in December de-
 clared the July 1992 upper house election unconstitutional because of the mal-
 apportionment problem, but the lack of a nonpartisan redistricting mechanism has
 hampered the process of adjustment. Prposed political reform legislation would sig-
 nificantly reduce the disparity among lower house districts but would not affect the
 situation in upper house elections.
 There are no legal or de facto impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation.
 Women hold 14 seats in the 511-member lower house of the Diet, and 38 seats in
 the 252-member upper house. Three women-a record high-are members of the
 current 21-member Cabinet. Women make up nearly 20 percent of all government
 workers but hold less than 1 percent of top (section chief and higher) government
 posts.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local human rights organizations function freely, with no govern-
 mental restrictions or impediments. The Government does not obstruct or inhibit
 the investigative activities of international human rights nongovernmental organiza-
 tions.
 
 
 656
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The position of women in society and the home, although significantly
 improved during the last few decades, continues to reflect deep-seated traditional
 values that assign women a subordinate role. In this environment, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often goes unreported due to social and cul-
 tural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's
 spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women more often return to the home of
 their parents rather than file reports with authorities. Therefore, Ministry of Justice
 statistics on violence against women undoubtedly understate the scope of the cur-
 rent situation. Many local governments are responding positively to a need for con-
 fidential assistance by establishing special women's consultation departments in po-
 lice and prefectural offices.
 Although discrimination by private employers against women is prohibited by the
 Constitution, it persists. Legislation over the past 30 years has been enacted to ac-
 cord women the same legal status as men. The Equal Employment Opportunity Law
 of 1986 was aimed at eliminating sex discrimination in such areas as recruitment,
 pay, and working hours. Yet the law does not expressly forbid discrimination; it
 merely states that "employers should endeavor" to avoid it. Under this law and
 other regulations, the  inistry of Labor attempts to encourage corporate compliance
 with its objectives by positive inducements, including subsidies; it does not enforce
 compliance through fines or other punitive measures.
 Significant disparities in pay and access to managerial positions persist. Women
 comprise over 40 percent of the employed population. A 1989 Ministry of labor re-
 port noted that the average wage of women workers is about half that of men. In
 March 1992, nine working married women filed lawsuits with the Tokyo district
 court, citing discrimination in wages and promotions. Other cases are pending which
 question management's use of Japan's two-track (general versus administrative)
 system of hiring women employees. Initially designed to create a "career" track for
 employees while maintaining a separate "clerical" track observers say the system
 is used to discriminate against women, who traditionally have not been hired for
 managerial positions.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and sexual harassment in the
 workplace has increased. An increasing number of government entities are estab-
 lishing hotlines and designating ombudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination
 and sexual harassment. Nevertheless, sexual discrimination and stereotyping in the
 workplace continue to be major problems for women.
 Children.-Japan has child labor laws, and the rights of children are adequately
 protected.
 Indigenous People.-The Ainu are a Caucasoid people descended from the first in-
 habitants of Japan. They now probably number less than 100,000; almost all of
 them live on Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Their pri-
 mary occupations are hunting, fishing, and small farming. The ultimate effect of a
 law passed in 1898, the Former Aborigines Protection Act, was to leave the Ainu
 with only about 15 percent of their original landholdings. Ainu leaders, including
 Giichi Nomura at the Sapporo International Indigenous Peoples Symposium held as
 part of the U.N. Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples, continue to express griev-
 ances about this situation. Meanwhile, the Ainu continue to face social discrimina-
 tion while engaging in an uphill struggle against complete assimilation. The Gov-
 ernment has done ittle in response to Ainu grievances. An interagency study group
 opened hearings in January 1990 with the stated goal of reviewing Ainu history and
 making recommendations, but it has not played an active role.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.- The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of iso-
 lation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers against whom social, eco-
 nomic, and legal discrimination is widespread.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 fessions such as butchering and undertaking) are frequently victims of entrenched
 social discrimination. Their access to private housing, employment, and marriage
 opportunities has been greatly restricted. Beginning in 1969, the Government intro-
 duced with some success a number of social, economic, and legal programs designed
 to improve conditions for the Burakumin and hasten their assimilation into main-
 stream Japanese society. The Government has extended basic legislation to provide
 funding for Burakumin programs until 1997, but the Burakumin continue to lobby
 for a new law that will expand current programs. In recent years, however, some
 within the Burakumin community have questioned whether "assimilation" is an ap-
 propriate goal.
 
 
 657
 Despite improvements in Japan's legal system, Korean permanent residents (most
 of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan and who are estimated to num-
 ber approximately 2 million) are still subject to various forms of deeply entrenched
 social discrimination. In recent years, the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations providing permanent resident aliens with equal access to public housing
 and loans, social security pensions for those qualified, and certain public employ-
 ment rights.
 The legal obligations to carry an alien registration card and to be fingerprinted
 have been leading concerns among permanent resident aliens in Japan. This is par-
 ticularly so for second- and third-generation Korean residents, who constitute 82
 percent of all such aliens. In response to continued appeals from the Republic of
 Korea, the Government in 1993 halted the fingerprinting of permanent foreign resi-
 dents. Instead, the Government has established a family registry system that uses
 the resident's picture and signature and contains information on parents and
 spouses living in Japan, a system similar to that used for Japanese nationals. The
 new law leaves intact the requirement that all foreign residents must carry alien
 registration certificates at all times.
 Some immigrants reportedly face police harassment and discrimination in obtain-
 ing housing, jobs, and health care. In rgnition of the difficulties faced by foreign-
 ers in these areas, Tokyo city recently issued a law to prevent housing discrimina-
 tion against foreigners. There have also been efforts by the central andlocal govern-
 ments to disburse information on health insurance plans to enroll foreigners into
 the system. Some communities are using existing social welfare programs to cover
 emergency medical expenses incurred by uninsured foreign visitors.
 The January 1991 memorandum between the Japanese and South Korean Gov-
 ernments extended employment rights to local government positions, giving each lo-
 cality the authority to decide which jobs may be held by non-Japanese nationals.
 Local governments are also being urged by the Government to allow Korean resi-
 dents to take the teacher entrance examination and to employ them on a full-time
 basis. Private-sector employment and social discrimination are still common. Anti-
 discrimination laws affecting Korean residents were initiated as government guid-
 ance and are not backed up by penalty provisions.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for natu-
 ralization and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right
 to vote. In fact, however, most eligible aliens do not apply for citizenship, in part
 due to fears that their cultural identity would thereby be denied. De facto obstacles
 to naturalization include broad discretion on the part of adjudicating officers and
 great emphasis on Japanese language ability.
 The Justice Ministi's Immigration Bureau estimates that, as of May 1993, there
 were 298,646 foreign nationals residing illegally in Japan, an increase of 7 percent
 from the previous year. Many are laborers from Southeast Asia and South Korea.
 Additionally, there are a number of Iranian workers, but that number declined by
 13.8 percent, apparently as the result of the Government's suspension on April 15,
 1992, of a visa waiver agreement it had with Iran for short-term visitors. While
 many of Japan's illegally resident foreigners came in search of better-paying manu-
 facturing and construction jobs, there are indications that these opprtunities are
 disappearing with Japan's economic slowdown. Thus, more of the foreign workers
 are unemployed or marginally employed. Law enforcement sweeps against South
 Asians and other foreigners have increased. Activist groups claim that, with little
 or no knowledge of the Japanese language or of their legal rights, foreign workers
 can easily be discriminated against by employers. Some illegal alien workers have
 suffered exploitative treatment. The Government has tried to reduce the inflow of
 illegal foreign workers by prosecuting employers. Recent revisions of the Immigra-
 tion Law provide for penalties for employers of undocumented foreign workers. Sus-
 pected foreign workers may also be denied entry for passport, visa, and entry appli-
 cation irregularities. The Government continues to study the foreign worker issue,
 and several citizens' groups are working with illegal foreign workers to improve
 their access to information on worker rights.
 Japan has granted asylum in only a small number of cases to those claiming fear
 of persecution upon return to their homeland. The Government believes that most
 people seeking asylum in Japan do so for economic reasons. According to representa-
 tives of international organizations in Japan, since 1981 Japan has determined that
 only about 200 people have met the required standard. As for Chinese student dis-
 sidents, the Government has shown flexibility in dealing with visa extensions,
 though it continues to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 Strict administrative procedures contribute to the low rate of approval of asylum
 applications. For example, appeals of initial denials are reviewed by a higher au-
 thority of the same body, and decisions are rarely overturned. Asylum seekers claim
 
 
 658
 that the processing of asylum applications is not readily understandable making it
 difficult for them to comply with Government procedures. For example, tie Govern-
 ment's "60-day rule" requires applicants to appear at an immigration office within
 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of the time they learn they are likely to be
 persecuted in their home country- most asylum seekers arrive in Japan without
 knowledge of this requirement and can inadvertently waive their claim by not act-
 ing promptly. The Government recently stated that it is strivin to reform its asy-
 lum procedures and make them more accessible and understandable to asylum seek-
 ers.
 People with Disabilities.-Japan has no national law protecting the rights of the
 disabled, including access, but some prefectures and cities have enacted their own
 legislation addressing the issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to associate freely in unions
 is assured by the Constitution. Approximately 25 percent of the active work force
 belongs to unions. Unions are free of government control and influence. The Japa-
 nese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO), which represents 8 million Japanese
 workers, was formed in 1989 through the merger of several confederations and is
 Japan's largest labor organization. There is no requirement for a single trade union
 structure, and therere e no restrictions on who may be a union official. Members
 of the armed forces, police, and firefighters, however, are not permitted to form
 umions or to strike. The International labor Organization's Committee of Experts
 in 1991 criticized Japan's denial of the right of firefighters to strike as unwarranted.
 Government and umnon representatives have engaged in talks to address this issue
 over the past 2 years, but no resolution has been reached to date. Japanese law al-
 lows unions  t        nto make political campaign contributions, and most unions
 are involved in political activity as well as labor relations. RENGO and other labor
 groups are active in supporting political parties and individual candidates and in
 promoting their political and social programs.
 Organized labor generally supports two social democratic parties that are pres-
 ently part of the governing coalition and provides them with significant amounts of
 funds and manpower. Unions are active in international bodies, most notably the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive iater-
 national contacts. The right to strike is implicit in the Constitution and is exercised.
 During 1992, 231,000 man days were lost to strikes. Public employees do not have
 the right to strike, although they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration.
 Government employees have their pay raises determined by the Government, but
 the raises are based on a recommendation by the Independent National Personnel
 Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coectinely.-The Constitution states that
 unions have the right to organize, barain, and act collectively. These rights are ex-
 ercised freely, and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual "spring
 wage offensive," in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their firms, involves nationwide participation. Japanese man-
 agement usually consults closely with its enterprise union. However, trade unions
 are independent of management and arssively pursue the interests of their work-
 ers. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law, and in practice does not take
 place. Members of the armed forces, police, and fire fighters are not permitted to
 organize. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the use of forced labor, and there are no known cases of forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the revised labor Standards
 Law of 1987, minors under 15 years of age may not be employed as workers, and
 those under the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or harmful work.
 Child labor laws are rigorously enforced by the labor Inspection Division of the Min-
 istry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are administratively deter-
 mined by the Minister of Labor or the Director of the Prefectural Labor Standards
 Office, based usually on the recommendation of the tripartite Minimum Wage Coun-
 cil. Minimum wage rates vary by industry and region. In the Tokyo area, a steel-
 worker's rate is $5.65 (620 yen) per hour. The wage rates are sufficient to provide
 workers and their families with a decent living. The Labor Standards Law provides
 for the phased reduction of maximum working hours from the present 44-hour, 6-
 day workweek to 40 hours by 1994. The Ministry of Labor effectively administers
 various laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, principal
 among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law of 1972. Standards are set
 
 
 659
 by the Ministry of Labor and issued after consultation with the Standing Committee
 on Safety and Health of the tripartite Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspec-
 tors have the authority to suspend unsafe operations immediately, and the law
 tuarantees that workers may voice concerns over occupational safety and remove
 themselves from unsafe working conditions without jeopardizing their continued em-
 ployment.
