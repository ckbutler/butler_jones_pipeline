 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty parliamentary democracy and a member
 of the British Commonwealth. Political conditions have been
 stable since the early 1980's. The current Prime Minister,
 John Compton, was reelected in April 1987 and elections are
 not due again until April 1992. The governing United Workers
 Party holds a small majority of seats in Parliament, although
 the opposition St. Lucia Labor Party is active in seeking to
 expand its bases of support.
 The police are the only security force in St. Lucia. A small
 Special Service Unit (SSU) established within the police force
 has received some paramilitary training. A coast guard unit
 has also been created under police auspices. The police force
 has traditionally demonstrated a high degree of integrity,
 professionalism, and respect for human rights, although a
 recent inquiry raised concern about possible police corruption,
 especially narcotics-related corruption.
 St. Lucia has experienced more than 5 years of sustained
 economic growth, primarily in the agricultural and tourism
 sectors, although high unemployment remains a source of
 potential instability.
 St. Lucia continued to have a good human rights record in 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killings for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Constitution, and no
 allegations of torture were reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government honors in practice the constitutional provision
 prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and providing for
 a court hearing within 72 hours after arrest. There were no
 reports of arbitrary arrest or other forms of extralegal
 detention or forced exile in 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution mandates public trials before an independent
 and impartial court and provides for legal counsel to
 indigents. The legal code presumes that accused persons are
 innocent until proven guilty. The right of appeal is
 exercised through the regional West Indies Court of Appeal, a
 circuit court long noted for its impartiality.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Authorities consistently observe constitutional prohibitions
 against arbitrary search, seizure, and entry. There were no
 reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private
 lives of individual citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions for free speech and press are
 respected in practice. St. Lucia's two newspapers reflect
 contrasting political opinions. The local television station
 is privately owned, while the Government owns and operates
 Radio St. Lucia. A religious organization operates another
 radio station. The Government does not usually censor the
 media. However, in March the Government suspended a call-in
 show on the government-owned radio station on the grounds that
 the moderator was incapable of presenting the Government's
 position and was in fact serving as a spokesman for the
 opposition. Despite vocal protests by the opposition, the
 program has not yet been reinstated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal restrictions on public meetings in St.
 Lucia. Political opposition groups organize and conduct
 activities freely. The Constitution provides for freedom of
 association, which is enjoyed in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Lucia. While the
 majority of the population is- Roman Catholic, other
 denominations are free to maintain places of worship, train
 clergy, establish religious schools, and engage in the full
 range of activities normally associated with religious
 organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for these rights, and they are
 generally honored in practice. The Government revoked the
 passports of 16 St. Lucian citizens to prevent their travel to
 Libya in 1983, alleging that the group was to receive
 terrorist training. It continues to hold the passports of
 several of the original 16, thus restricting their travel
 outside St. Lucia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under St. Lucia's parliamentary system of government, citizens
 have a genuine choice of parties, policies, and officials.
 Political parties participate in free elections which are held
 every 5 years by secret ballot. Political activity is vigorous
 between elections, with opposition parties playing a
 significant role in and out of Parliament. Currently, the

 ST. LUCIA
 opposition St. Lucia Labor Party holds 7 of 17 parliamentary
 seats.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 International human rights organizations filed no reports or
 requests for investigations in 1988. There are no local human
 rights groups in St. Lucia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government does not discriminate in the allocation of
 social services or in other policies. There are no legal
 restrictions on the role of women in St. Lucia. Women are
 well represented in the middle ranks of government and the
 professions but underrepresented at higher levels. However,
 more women are taking advantage of public schooling and other
 specialized government programs, designed in part to extend
 opportunities for women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of association,
 specifying the right to form or belong to trade unions. There
 are no sectors or areas, including export processing zones,
 where union organization and collective bargaining are legally
 or administratively discouraged or impeded. Unions are free
 to choose their own representatives and union elections are
 sometimes vigorously contested. In a recent election, the St.
 Lucia Seamen and Waterfront Workers Union rejected long-time
 President Peter Josie, who then organized a new union, the
 Technical and Allied Workers Union. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and determine policies aimed at
 representing members' interests. Union are free to affiliate
 with international organizations and some are affiliated to
 international trade union bodies. St. Lucia ratified
 International Labor Organization Conventions 87 and 98
 pertaining to freedom of association and collective bargaining.
 Strikes in the private sector are legal if government-
 sponsored efforts to resolve disputes fail. Strikes do occur
 in practice.
 The Government does not normally interfere with trade union
 activities. Recent efforts to form a wider grouping of unions
 have in fact garnered some Government support. Prime Minister
 Compton reportedly welcomed a National Workers Union (NWU)
 initiative to promote national trade union unity. He met with
 interested organizations in July to discuss such a movement
 and to consider the possibility of forming an Economic
 Advisory Committee which would include labor representatives.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are legally permitted to engage in collective
 bargaining, and do so. Unions represent the majority of wage
 and salary earners and there is no significant antiunion
 discriminati6n.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Women and Young Persons Act prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor; the law is respected in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age in St. Lucia is 14, as stipulated
 by the Women and Young Persons Act. The law is enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers are guaranteed
 a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. Although no minimum
 wage is established by law, a government-established wage
 council reviews wage rates in different sectors and makes
 recommendations which generally are accepted as having the
 force of law. Occupational health and safety regulations are
 well enforced.
