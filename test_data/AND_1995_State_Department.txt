 ANDORRA
 The principality of Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in 1993 when its
 Constitution was approved by popular referendum. Two Co-Princes representing
 secular and religious authoritiesnave governed Andorra since 1278. Under the Con-
 stitution, the two Co-Princes-the President of France and the Spanish Bishop of
 Seu d'Urgell--serve equally as Heads of State and are each represented in Andorra
 by a delegate. Elections were held in December 1993 to choose members of the
 Consell General, the Parliament, which selects the Head of Government. The judici-
 ary functions independently.
 Andorra has no defense force. The national police have sole responsibility for in-
 ternal security.
 The market-based economy is dependent on those of neighboring France and
 Spain. With creation of the European Union internal market, however, Andorra lost
 its privileged duty-free status and is suffering an economic recession. Tourism is
 still an important source of income, but it fell dramatically during the year. Because
 of banking secrecy laws, the financial services sector is growing in importance.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 the judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciay, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The highest judicial
 body is the five-member Superior Council of Justice. One member each is appointed
 by: the two Co-Princes; the Head of Government; the President of the Parliament;
 and, collectively, members of the lower courts. Members of the judiciary are ap-
 
 
 760
 
 ointed for 6-year terms. The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient ju-
 dcial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Priacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides citizens with safeguards against arbitrary interference with
 their "privacy, honor and reputation," and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of pri-
 vate premises may be conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Private com-
 munications also are protected by law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning dmocratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly azd Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Since adoption of the
 1993 Constitution, the Government has registered seven political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Constitution acknowledges a special
 relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the State, "in accordance with
 Andorran tradition.' The Catholic Church receives no subsidies from the Govern-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It is government policy not
 to expel persons having valid claims to refugee status, and there were no reports
 of such expulsions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women have enjoyed full suffrage since 1970, but they continue to play a rel-
 atively minor role in politics. Notwithstanding the absence of formal barriers, few
 women have run for office; only 1 of 28 Mem    rs of Parliament is a woman, and
 only 2 women have occupied cabinet level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no restrictions to prevent their formation, no formal human rights
 organizations operate in Andorra.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that all persons are equal before the law and prohibits
 discrimination on grounds of birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opinions, or any other
 personal or social condition, although the law grants many rights and privileges ex-
 clusively to citizens. The Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Women.-No available data exists on the incidence and handling of domestic vio-
 lence cases, but spousal abuse appears to be virtually nonexistent. There is no legal
 discrimination against women either privately or professionally.
 Children.-There is no evidence of any special commitment by the Government
 to children's rights and welfare, although there is no indication of any problems in
 this area. Over the past 12 years there has been just one known case of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to new buildings for people with disabilities, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions in practice.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Spanish nationals are the largest group of
 foreign residents, accounting for 47 percent of the population. Other sizeable foreign
 groups are Portuguese, French, and British. A small number of North African and
 African immigrants work mostly in agculture and construction.
 Although the Constitution states that legal residents enjoy the same rights and
 freedoms as Andorran citizens, immigrant workers do not believe that they have the
 same rights and security. They lack many social benefits paid to residents and in
 
 
 many cases live in difficult and crowded conditions. The cost of living is high, and
 workers employed in low-wage industries often cannot afford normal housing costs.
 Many of them live in trailers or crowded apartments, with as many as 8 or 10 peo-
 ple sharing quarters designed for 4. Many such workers are in Andorra on tem-
 porary work permits. These permits are valid only as long as the job for which the
 permit was abtained exists. A worker hired on a temporary contract loses his work
 permit when the contract expires. If unable to find new employment, the worker
 quickly becomes an undocumented alien with no visible means of support and may
 be deported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the right of all persons
 "to form and maintain managerial, professional, and trade union associations with-
 out prejudice." The Constitution provides that a registry of associations be estab-
 lished (through future legislation) and maintained. There are no labor unions reg-
 istered as yet although at least one may be in the formative stages. Strikes were
 illegal under the old system, and the new Constitution does not state explicitly that
 strikes are permitted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Brgain Collectively.-Article 19 of the Constitution
 states that both "workers and employers have the right to defend their own eco-
 nomic and social interests." Parliament is charged with adopting legislation to regu-
 late this right in order to guarantee the provision of essential services. The threat
 of immediate dismissal (see Section 6.e. below) is apowerful deterrent to complaints
 from workers, .especially since there is very limited unemployment insurance. This
 inhibits workers from organizing effectively to press their cases. Antiunion discrimi-
 nation is not prohibited under current law.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not specifically pro-
 hibited by law, but it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children under the age of 18 are
 normally prohibited from working although in exceptional circumstances children
 ages 16 and 17 may be allowed to work. Child labor regulations are enforced by the
 Labor Inspection Office in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Public Health, and Labor.
 That office does not routinely inspect work places but responds to complaints.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek is limited to 40 hours, although
 longer hours may be required. The legal maximums for overtime hours are 66 hours
 per month and 426 hours per year. There is an official minimum wage, set by gov-
 ernient regulations. Other, higher wages are established by contract. The mini-
 mum wage is approximately $4.50 per our (Ptas 600). In principle it is enforced
 by the Labor Inspection Office, but self-enforcement is the norm. Living costs are
 high and the current minimum wage is inadequate for a worker and family.
 Wor kr complaints center on the lack of job security. Workers may be dismissed
 without prior notice and receive social security and health benefits for only 25 days;
 thereafter, there is no unemployment insurance. Foreign workers who contribute to
 the social security system are ineligible to receive retiremen benefits if they do not
 remain in Andorra after retirement; however, they may apply for a lump-sum reim-
 bursement of social security contributions when they leave the country. Retirement
 benefits are controlled by a board composed of Andorran nationals although they
 represent only a small portion of the work force. There is no special court or board
 to hear labor complaints.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, but enforcement
 is loose as there are no routine inspections. There is no legislation giving workers
 the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to
 their continued employment.
