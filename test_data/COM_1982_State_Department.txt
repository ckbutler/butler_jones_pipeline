 COMOROS*
 The period between May 1978 and late 1982 has been marked by
 the consolidation of the Comoran state under President
 Ahmed Abdallah. He originally proclaimed independence unila-
 terally from France in July 1975 but was quickly overthrown by
 French mercenaries. Ali Soilih was installed in his place and
 proceeded haphazardly to modernize the Comoros, relying on
 undisciplined youth who often terrorized society. Soilih openly
 challenged the dominance of Islam, affronting the population.
 He burned government archives and fired civil servants. A
 handful of mercenaries restored Ahmed Abdallah to power in 1978
 in a coup that appeared to be widely popular.
 A Constitution was adopted by popular referendum on October 1,
 1978, and Abdallah, who ran unopposed, was elected President on
 October 22, 1978. He has continued to rely on mercenaries for
 his personal security; they command the presidential guard.
 During 1982, a single ruling party was established: the Comoran
 Union for Progress. Only one party is permitted by law. Its
 members swept 37 of 38 seats in the legislature; there were
 reports of vote manipulation. Opposition candidates who ran as
 independents criticized the Government openly, however, and have
 suffered no reprisals. The new parliament amended the
 Constitution, so that taxes are collected centrally.
 Reportedly there no longer are political prisoners in Comoros.
 The last prominent case to receive attention was that of Ali
 Soilih's Foreign Minister, Abdallah Mouzaoir, who returned in
 late 1981 and was arrested; he was pardoned in May 1982.
 Several members of the Soilih Government as well as persons
 critical of Abdallah have received important government posts.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 Five persons were killed during the May 1978 coup, and Chief of
 State Ali Soilih was killed in the coup's aftermath under
 circumstances that are not clear. No further reports have been
 received of killings for political or other motives by the
 Government or other political organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances have been alleqed in recent years.
 c. Torture
 While there are no confirmed recent reports of torture of poli-
 tical opponents, it appears that beatings continue to be
 administered for violation of Islamic law by Muslims, such as
 breaking the Ramadan fast. The Constitution, which states that
 it is "inspired by the Universal Declaration of the Rights of
 Man," does not refer specifically to torture. It does guarantee
 "the liberty and security of each individual" so long as third
 parties are not harmed.
 *There is no United States Mission in the Comoros Islands, and
 the United States has only limited information about the human
 rights situation there.
 
 
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions are primitive in the Comoros, with prisoners
 reportedly sleeping on the qround and receiving little if any
 medical attention. Prisoners depend on their families for
 food. In discussions of such situations with Comoran officials,
 they point to the country's extreme poverty which has not
 permitted the funding of a modern penal system.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 No prisoners are believed to be held under unusual conditions
 without trial. A small number of individuals, probably less
 than 10, were sentenced by civil courts for common law viola-
 tions including murder during the Ali Soilih regime. All
 prisoners listed as "prisoners of conscience" by Amnesty
 International in 1982 are now free.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A special court of justice was established in 1979 to try
 members of the Ali Soilih regime accused of excesses. Several
 persons were found guilty by this court but were later pardoned.
 The court has been disbanded. A state security court established
 in 1981 tried Abdallah Mouzaoir, a prominent opponent of Abdallah
 who returned from exile in publicized circumstances in November
 1981. The security court found Mouzaoir quilty of endangering
 state security. He was reportedly sentenced to two years
 detention. President Abdallah granted a pardon in May 1982,
 and Mouzaoir resumed his affairs in the Comoros.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 "The inviolability of the home under the conditions prescribed by
 the laws of the republic" is guaranteed in the preamble of the
 Constitution. It is not known whether this is observed in prac-
 tice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no press in the Comoros, only a low power, government
 radio station which does- not cover the archipelago. Overseas
 editions of the French and English language press are expensive
 but readily available.. During the 1982 elections, opponents of
 the Government criticized it at gatherings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There have been reports of a few instances where the security
 forces broke up gatherings of students demonstrating against the
 Government. Some harassment reportedly occurred in connection
 with elections for National Assembly members in February 1982, but
 opposition candidates generally campaigned freely. Labor has the
 right to strike in principle, although this has not been tested in
 practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The bedrock strength of Islam in the Comoros is characteristic
 throughout the islands. This is the state religion, and trans-
 gressions by Muslims are punished with short term jail sentences
 and beatings. Non-Muslims are guaranteed the right to practice
 their religion under the Constitution, and this right is re-
 spected.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal travel within the Comoros is logistically difficult, but
 there are no apparent restrictions. Tnternational travel is not
 hampered.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The National Assembly legislated in 1979 that there should be
 only one political party in the country for a period of 12
 years. The Comoran Union for Proqress, which is dominated by.
 Abdallah, was established as the sole political party in 1982.
 It handily won the parliamentary elections, notwithstandinq
 several respected independent challengers who felt they were
 unfairly deprived of victory. Women play a subservient role in
 what is an extremely conservative society.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 President Abdallah received an Amnesty International investiga-
 tive mission in 1981. At the time he released several political
 prisoners and later released all, including former Interior
 Minister Salim Hamidi, the subject of a special appeal. Amnesty
 expressed its concern over the special court of justice esta-
 blished in 1979 to try cases involvinq political offenses
 committed during the Soilih Government. This court has now been
 disbanded. Amnesty also called attention to the new state
 security court. Subsequent to the Amnesty report, the security
 court tried and convicted Abdallah Mouzaoir in May 1982 for
 endangering the security of the state. President Abdallah
 pardoned Mouzaoir.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Comoros Islands are one of the world's poorest regions. The
 lava-encrusted soil is largely unsuited for agriculture, so that
 most of the Comoros' estimated 400,000 inhabitants scratch out a
 living from subsistence agriculture and fishing. Agriculture,
 the primary economic activity, involves more than 80 percent of
 the population, constitutes 40 percent of the Gross National
 Product (GNP), and provides virtually all foreign exchange
 earnings. The principal exports, essential oils, cloves, and
 vanilla, however, do not provide nearly the revenue needed to
 cover essential imports. The best available figures show GNP at
 $240. Malaria ravages the population. Seventy-five percent
 of births are said to take place in the home. The infant
 mortality rate is about 90 dead per 1000 live births (1980) and
 life expectancy at birth is 47 years. The needs for literacy,
 food, clothing, health, work, and shelter are enormous. Vir-
 tually all children between ages four and six undergo Koranic
 studies in Arabic. Primary enrollment averages 63 percent, with
 75 percent for boys and 51 percent for girls. Secondary school
 figures are 25 percent overall, with 35 percent for boys and 16
 percent for girls. The adult literacy rate is about 20 per-
 cent. Annual average population qrowth in 1980 was 2.2 percent.
 There are only two hospitals and five clinics for the three
 islands. The Government of the Comoros has turned to France and
 internanational aid donors for assistance. Extensive progress
 has been made in the fiscal area, as the country strives to
 develop a realistic budget and centralize revenue collection.
 The first economic development plan should be ready for presen-
 tation to a Comoros donors group in the spring of 1983.
