 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multi-party democracy, with constitutionally
 guaranteed universal suffrage for all persons 21 years of age
 and older. On September 8, 1984, some 227,000 citizens cast
 their ballots in the fifth general election since independence
 (1966). Voters selected representatives to the National
 Assembly from among candidates of five political parties which
 campaigned freely and without harassment. The constitutional
 rights of individuals in Botswana are protected by an
 independent judiciary. The police force and a small,
 well-disciplined army provide internal and external security.
 Botswana has made great strides in its 18 years of
 independence despite the minimal infrastructure inherited at
 independence, a dearth of skilled manpower, and severe
 climatic constraints imposed by insufficient rainfall.
 Botswana encourages private enterprise and free trade. All
 citizens, including those whites who accepted Botswana
 citizenship, are free to participate in the economic and
 political life of the country. For the past several years,
 Botswana has been a haven for refugees from the political and
 military strife of neighboring countries. While the flow of
 refugees slowed during 1984, recent strife in SouthAfrica and
 political maneuvering in Zimbabwe may lead to a further influx.
 Botswana's human rights record is generally good. Citizens
 receive equal protection before the law; there have been no
 incidents of political violence; several women hold positions
 of importance in the public and private sector. Labor unions,
 however, are kept under close surveillance by the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no such instances in Botswana.
 b. Disappearance
 The Botswana Constitution provides for the protection of
 personal liberty. There have been no allegations of secret
 arrests or clandestine detentions in Botswana.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The government-owned newspaper reported the trial and
 sentencing of a policeman accused of beating a suspected
 criminal. Recently, the newspaper reported that a criminal
 suspect had alleged that police investigators had tortured him
 in the process of attempting to elicit a confession. An
 American citizen arrested on the charge of car theft also
 alleged that he had been tortured by the police; a police
 investigation of the incident concluded that there was
 insufficient evidence to support the allegation. The American
 citizen was declared a prohibited immigrant upon being found
 guilty of the criminal charge and has since left Botswana.
 While beatings of prisoners apparently occur occasionally,
 they do not appear to be a regular or government sanctioned
 practice.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 Prisons are crowded but appear to provide an adequate diet,
 health care, and visits from family members. Flogging is
 permitted for infractions of prison rules. A law making
 flogging mandatory for certain criminal offenses (rape,
 attempted rape, armed robbery, burglary, housebreaking, and
 related offenses) was upheld by the High Court in December
 1983. Tribal courts, presided over by a chief, in which
 Jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses, may also sentence
 individuals to be flogged. No summary executions have
 Occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Botswana Constitution contains provisions protecting
 citizens from arbitrary arrest. There are no political
 prisoners in Botswana, and preventive detention is illegal.
 There is a requirement that the police bring a suspect before
 a magistrate for charging within 48 hours of his arrest.
 Suspects must be released after 48 hours unless the magistrate
 issues a warrant of detention which is valid for 14 days.
 Every 14 days, the police must appear before the magistrate
 and show they are making progress in the case. To date, there
 have been no known instances of abuse of this system.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of a fair public trial is provided by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel;
 consultation between defendants and counsel may be held in
 private. The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 military. The High Court has ruled that one may not be
 compelled to testify against oneself. Silence cannot be
 construed as guilt, and the burden of proof remains with the
 prosecution. All trials are held in public. Provisions exist
 for conducting closed hearing trials relating to security
 cases, but the High Court exercises oversight. Earlier this
 year, the police received a rebuke from the High Court for
 insisting that a member of its Special Branch be tried in
 camera on the charge of being on the payroll of a foreign
 country. The High Court heard the accused's appeal but upheld
 his conviction and the sentence (two years imprisonment).
 There are no special courts to deal with security or political
 offenses. Although the Botswana Defence Force Act provides
 for military courts, none as yet has been established, and
 cases over which the military has jurisdiction are referred to
 the Attorney General and the civilian court system. Problems
 in the administration of justice center mainly on the
 difficulty of recruiting sufficient numbers of qualified
 judicial personnel and court reporters.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in
 practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft or drug trafficking. There have
 been no reported instances in which this authority was used
 during the past year.

 BOTSWANA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The
 government-owned daily newspaper (English and Setswana)
 impartially covered the statements of opposition parties and
 aired the views of opposition candidates during the recent
 election campaign. A privately-owned weekly paper (English
 only) published a wider range of news, including articles--not
 always laudatory--on public figures. Botswana has signed the
 Kadoma Declaration, which bans entry of journalists based in
 South Africa. However, the Government has not taken any
 active steps to implement the resolution nor to hinder the
 movement of any journalists in their efforts to collect
 information or report on events.
 During the recent political campaign, opposition leaders
 protested that the Government was discriminating against them
 by taping public speeches of their candidates, but not those
 of the ruling party's candidates. The Government responded
 that the Constitution gave the right to tape political
 speeches, but thereafter conspicuously taped the speeches of
 all candidates. In one case, the Government alleged that a
 candidate had incited the military to overthrow the
 Government; the High Court dismissed the case for lack of
 sufficient evidence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in
 Botswana exemplified in the Kgotla, a communal meeting,
 similar to a New England town meeting, where citizens freely
 question leaders and voice opinion on local policies. During
 the recent political campaign, all the candidates, including
 the Vice President and cabinet ministers, were exposed to
 sharp questions from their constituents. Large gatherings
 require local police approval, which is routinely given.
 Demonstrations are permitted so long as order is maintained.
 Organizers are required to submit a detailed plan for any
 demonstration and are personally responsible for ensuring that
 the plan is followed.
 Unions have the legal right to strike after exhausting
 established procedures, which require that the Government be
 invited to attempt to arbitrate the dispute. The last strike
 occurred in 1976. Unions have chafed under government
 regulations which prohibit the contribution of union funds
 from outside Botswana and require that all union leaders be
 full-time working members of the trade covered by their union,
 thus preventing employment of paid full-time union
 organizers. In May, the Government postponed a proposed
 election of the Botswana Federation of Trade Union (BFTU)
 officers on the grounds that the Government had not been
 advised sufficiently in advance of the elections; elections
 were held a month later. Unions associate freely with
 international organizations and members attend international
 conferences. The BFTU is affliated with the democratic
 oriented International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in
 Brussels, and is also a member of the Ghana-based Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity.

 BOTSWANA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Open practice of religion is permitted and encouraged. There
 is no state religion. While most residents identify
 themselves with Christian sects, active groups of Muslims,
 Hindus, Bahais, and others practice their faiths freely.
 Religious affiliation is neither an advantage nor disadvantage
 politically or socially. The Government has attempted to
 remain aloof from internal problems in various churches,
 particularly those which were founded as branches of South
 African churches. In recent years, some members have
 attempted to dissociate themselves from control of the South
 African mother church and establish an independent Botswana
 church. This has created problems of ownership of church
 property.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions on
 emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel is
 unrestricted as well. Passports, in general, are easily
 obtained. Refugees documented by the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are generally required to
 live in the settlement at Dukwe in northern Botswana where
 conditions are relatively good, due largely to contributions
 from international donor organizations. Refugees may be
 authorized to live elsewhere for reasons such as employment or
 schooling. As with other foreigners in Botswana, refugees are
 not permitted to accept employment opportunities which could
 be filled by a citizen. As a result of allegations from some
 refugee-producing countries that refugees are using Botswana
 as a sanctuary while they involve themselves in
 anti-government activities in their home countries, the
 Government of Botswana has declared that any refugee found
 outside Dukwe without government permission will be considered
 to have abandoned refugee status and will be repatriated
 immediately. Indications are that the policy has been
 effective as a deterrent to questionable activities by
 refugees. While some reports allege that the Government of
 Botswana has returned a large number of bona fide refugees to
 their country of origin, there is no evidence that this has
 occurred in more than a few instances. At the end of 1983, 39
 refugees involved in a major disturbance at the refugee camp
 were repatriated without following UNHCR procedures. Two
 South Africans and one Malawian have also been repatriated.
 Some refugees who leave Botswana on U.N. travel documents
 issued by Botswana encounter difficulties in returning.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On September 8, 1984 adult citizens of Botswana (21 years of
 age and over) participated in their fifth free and democratic
 elections since independence in 1966. Five political parties
 competed in the election, although only two of them contested
 most of the 34 constituencies. Lack of financial resources
 and personnel prevented the other three from similar
 participation. An estimated 70 percent of eligible voters
 registered, and 86 percent of the registered voters actually
 voted. Voter turnout was the greatest since independence. No
 violent incidents occurred during the campaign or the election
 itself. No incidents of gross voting fraud have come to
 light. However, one of the opposition parties requested the
 
 
 30
 BOTSWANA
 High Court to rule that one constituency election should be
 held again due to "irregularities." The High Court found in
 favor of the opposition and a new election took place December
 1 for the constituency held by Botswana's Vice-President.
 Local newspapers, independent and government-owned, reported
 the speeches and campaign programs of all parties.
 The political rights of women and minority groups generally
 are observed. There are two female members of Parliament, one
 of whom is also Minister of External Affairs. The other works
 as Executive Secretary of the majority political party. The
 one white member of Parliament is also a minister and the
 speaker of the National Assembly, a prominent businessman, is
 also white. Only the 50,000 Basarwa or "Bushmen" remain
 generally unrepresented in government and ignored. While the
 Government does not oppress them or deny them rights,
 including the right to vote, it does little to help or protect
 a minority whose way of life is changing rapidly due to recent
 economic development in Botswana.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana cooperates with international agencies concerned with
 human rights. Relations with the office of the UNHCR, the
 only international human rights organization active in
 Botswana, are friendly and open. There are no Botswana-based
 organizations set up to observe, report, or contest human
 rights violations. Although the Botswana Government
 consistently has responded promptly and forthrightly to the
 inquiries it has received about the human rights situation in
 Botswana, the UNHCR encountered initial difficulty obtaining
 information about the refugees repatriated in December 1983.
 The Government eventually cooperated and agreed to follow
 UNHCR procedures in the future.
 As a thinly populated country surrounded by larger and more
 powerful neighbors, Botswana seldom comments publicly on
 alleged human rights violations in those countries. Botswana
 does join with other African governments in condemning
 apartheid in South Africa, however. Amnesty International
 stated in its 1984 report that there was not sufficient
 information available to include an entry on Botswana.
 Freedom House terms Botswana "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 When Botswana became independent in 1966, its developed
 infrastructure was negligible and per capita gross national
 product (GNP) was estimated at only $69. In 1982, per capita
 GNP was $902 (World Bank data). The exploitation of mineral
 resources has helped bring about economic development and
 improve the economic and social welfare of the people. A
 third year of drought has created havoc in the agricultural
 and construction sectors of the economy, forcing the
 Government to spend heavily (about $25 million) on drought
 relief aid. The percentage of urban population with access to
 potable water increased from 71 percent in 1968 to 95 percent
 in 1975. Due to the difficulties of supplying potable water
 to Botswana's widely scattered rural population, it was
 estimated in 1975 that only 45 percent of the rural population
 had access to potable water. In 1977, it was estimated that
 94 percent of the calorie supply required for Botswana's
 
 
 31
 BOTSWANA
 population was available in the country. Because of the
 drought, the country has become heavily dependent on imported
 foodstuffs, either purchased or donated. Life expectancy
 increased from 41.0 years in 1968 to 61.26 years in 1984.
 Women hold approximately 24 percent of paid employment
 positions. An estimated 41 percent of central government
 employees are women, many of them in high-level positions.
 While there is little overt discrimination, statistics suggest
 that social custom elevates the rights and privileges of men
 above those of women. Some 40 percent of rural households (83
 percent of the total population is rural) are headed by women,
 and generally their economic situation--access to capital,
 seeds, labor, and draft animals--is significantly worse than
 that of households headed by men. Women about to marry may
 choose civil marriage, in which all property is held in
 common, or customary marriage, which recognizes individual
 property brought to a marriage. Most women are not aware,
 however, of the implications of these alternatives. Often a
 married woman is unable to obtain a bank loan without the
 signature of her husband, or an unmarried woman without the
 signature of her father. The Government has participated in
 the preparation of a handbook outlining women's rights in
 Botswana and established preference points for women who seek
 goverment-sponsored development loans.
 Botswana has made considerable progress in providing
 educational opportunities. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio increased from 56 percent in 1968 to 89
 percent in 1978 and rose to 93 percent in 1979. The
 difference in the 1978 ratio for boys (80 percent) and girls
 (98 percent) is due primarily to the custom of using
 school-age boys to herd cattle. The adult literacy rate is
 estimated at approximately 40 percent (1971 World Bank figure
 and the latest available).
 Rural incomes are much lower than urban incomes, one factor
 leading to increased rural migration during the past decade.
 The urban population increased from 8 percent in 1971 to 17
 percent in 1981 and probably has increased again during three
 years of drought. Despite general improvement in the economy
 during the past decade, poverty still afflicts a large
 proportion of the population. The most recent estimates in
 1979, which take into account an annual population growth rate
 of about 3.3 percent (1984 World Bank data), are that 55
 percent of the rural population and 40 percent of the urban
 population have incomes below the absolute poverty level.
 The Government of Botswana promises equal treatment for all
 its citizens in the distribution of social services. However,
 since most of the Bushmen occupy the harsh and remote areas of
 the Kalahari desert where population density is very low,
 there are few clinics and schools available to them. The
 Government is building some facilities at the edge of the
 desert where they serve as a magnet for Bushman families.
 This in turn creates new problems as the occupants of the
 desert--hunter/gatherers--are forced into wage labor and
 cattle herding where they tend to be absorbed into Tswana
 society.
