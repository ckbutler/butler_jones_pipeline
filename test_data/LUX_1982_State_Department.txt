 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy under a
 constitutional monarchy. Executive power is exercised by
 the Grand Duke and the Council of Government (cabinet),
 which consists of a president of the government (prime
 minister) and several other ministers. Legislative power
 is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, elected directly to
 5-year terms. Luxembourg's economy is that of a highly
 developed industrialized country. It is a free enterprise
 system with heavy emphasis on agriculture, steel
 production, service industries (especially banking) and
 radio-television broadcasting. During 1982 Luxembourg
 experienced worsening economic circumstances and increased
 unemployment.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person. Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or
 opposition political organizations is unknown in
 Luxembourg. There are no indigenous terrorist
 organizations in the country, and there have been no major
 violent terrorist acts during the past year.
 b. Disappearance
 Official abduction or secret arrest do not occur.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Treatment of prisoners is exemplary. A new, modern prison
 was scheduled to open in late 1982.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no prisoners in Luxembourg being detained in
 disregard of due process of law. Habeas corpus exists and
 is respected. Preventive detention does not exist. The
 law permits detention without charge for up to 24 hours
 following arrest.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary. Defendants have
 the full range of internationally recognized legal rights
 and protections. The judiciary is free from executive or
 military interference, and there are no military or special
 courts. There is the right of appeal.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to
 
 
 948
 enter a private home. No forced entry has been alleged.
 Luxembourg's statutes prohibit other violations of the
 home.
 2". Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press,
 religion, and assembly. Except for restrictions against
 pornography, there is no media censorship. There is no
 intimidationby the Government of individuals or media
 organs criticizing it, and the Government does not
 interfere with academic inquiry. There are no limitations
 on orderly public meetings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Unions have the right to organize, negotiate, and strike,
 although by tradition strikes are rare in Luxembourg.
 Unions participate in a tripartite arrangement with
 government and management in the decision-making process
 on major economic issues. Virtually the entire work force
 is unionized. Unions and professional groups freely
 maintain contacts with international bodies in their
 fields. Free assembly is not restricted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion, and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of minority
 religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions regarding movement
 within Luxembourg, foreign travel, or emigration and
 repatriation. Luxembourg has a liberal refugee and asylum
 policy in principle, but admits only limited numbers of
 refugees.
 Foreigners applying for residence tend to be judged on the
 value of their skills and their means. An exception to
 this was Luxembourg's acceptance of over 100 Vietnamese
 refugees in 1979/80. Once admitted into Luxembourg,
 refugees are well treated.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy, in which all
 citizens at least 18 years of age can vote. Luxembourg's
 sizeable foreign resident population (26 percent) does not
 have the right to vote, although it enjoys the rights of
 free speech, press, assembly, movement, and religion.
 Significant numbers of women hold political office,
 including the Foreign Minister and the Mayor of
 Luxembourg.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The current and prior Luxembourg governments have
 
 
 949
 supported international and non-governmental investigation
 of alleged violations of human rights. The Red Cross,
 Amnesty International, and the UN High Commissioner for
 Refugees have representatives in Luxembourg.
 Although Luxembourg is a strong advocate for the respect
 of human rights internationally, the Government recognizes
 that Luxembourg's small size generally precludes it from
 directly influencing international and regional human
 rights bodies. Instead, Luxembourg consistently advocates
 its support for human rights in the Council of Europe and
 the European Communities and works toward developing a
 pro-human rights EC consensus and policy. Freedom House
 rates Luxembourg among the "most free" nations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Luxembourg is a small country (population. 354,000 in
 1979) with a very high standard of living, as shown by per
 capita GNP statistics ($12,820 in 1979) and by the usual
 physical indices of a wealthy society -- good hospitals,
 many doctors. 99 percent literacy (1970), good primary and
 secondary schools, lack of any substantial poverty, and
 low unemployment.   Steel dominates the economy and in
 1980 accounted for 58 percent of all exports.   Luxembourg
 has a large foreign population (26 percent of the total in
 1980). Although immigration is low, the foreign
 population is growing, while the native Luxembourg
 population is declining. Overall. Luxembourg has one of
 the few negative growth rates in the world, with an
 average of only 1.4 children per couple. The infant
 mortality rate in 1981 was 11.5 per 1000. These
 demographic trends lead to a rapidly aging population,
 with a life expectancy at birth of 72.3 years (1980).
