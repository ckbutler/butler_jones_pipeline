 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic with an elected president, a bicameral legis-
 lature, and an independent judicial branch. Former President Julio Maria
 Sanguinetti won a narrow victory on November 27, the third election following the
 end of the military government. He will replace President Luis Alberto Lacalle on
 March 1, 1995.
 The Interior Ministry administers the country's police departments and the prison
 system and is responsible for domestic security and public safety matters. Elements
 of the police continue to be responsible for human rights abuses.
 The economy is a mixture of private enterprise and state entities and is heavily
 dependent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. Private property rights are re-
 spected. The economy grew by an estimated 4 percent in 1994; per capita gross do-
 mestic product was approximately $4,750.
 The principal human rights problems continue to be police abuse and maltreat-
 ment of prisoners. After some improvement in 1993, prison conditions deteriorated,
 and the lack of professionalism in police ranks remains a problem. Levels of violence
 aginst women remain high, and neither police nor judicial authorities deal with it
 effectively. Societal discrimination against the small black minority is also a prob-
 lem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 In August, after a government decision to extradite three alleged members of the
 Spanish Basque terrorist group ETA, Uruguayan sympathizers demonstrated in
 support of the three's claim to asylum. When police tried to break up groups of dem-
 onstrators, violent clashes erupted. One demonstrator was killed, another 60 were
 injured; about 30 policemen were injured, 1 of them seriously. In spite of initial re-
 ports to the contrary, it appears that most of the gunshots came from the police.
 Leftist political groups and A  y International accused the police of using exces-
 sive fore, and the overnment assigued a judge to conduct a full investigation. The
 final report of the investigation is due to be released in February of 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torure and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prhibits brutal treatment of prisoners, but elements of the police
 continue to commit such abuses. Human rights monitors assert that many cases of
 abusego unreported, hence the problem may be more serious than it appears. The
 judiciland parliamentary branches of government are responsible for investigating
 specific allegations of abuse. The authorities charged several police officers with
 mistreatment of prisoners or abuse of their office, including one case involving a dis-
 abled person who committed suicide in his jail cell. However, as progress on these
 cases is often slow or nonexistent, the courts seldom convicted and punished police
 for such abuse.
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities remained poor, but not life-
 threatening. In March the Parliament's human rights committee reported that "lack
 of medical assistance, deficient nutrition, overcrowding, enforced idleness, mistreat-
 
 
 516
 ment on the part of guards, alcohol, drugs, and corruption" made the country's larg-
 est prison "uninhabitable." In June the prisoners rioted and effectively destroyed the
 physical plant of the Libertad prison. The authorities transferred the 900prisoners
 oused there to other facilities, which only worsened the already overcrowded condi-
 tions at the other prisons. Prison escapes, attempted escapes, physical deterioration
 of facilities, and other problems increased.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before they can make an arrest. The only
 exception is when the police apprehend a suspect during commission of a crime. The
 Constitution also provides the accused with the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 grounds for the detention. Police may hold a detainee incommunicado for 24 hours
 before presenting the case to a judge, at which time the detainee has the right to
 counsel. If the detainee cannot afford a lawyer, the courts appoint a public defender.
 The judicial process must begin within 48 hours; failure to comply has led to the
 release of accused persons. If the crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in pris-
 on, the accused person is confined during the judge's investigation of the charges
 unless the authorities agree to release the person on bail, or until the case is closed.
 The authorities generally respect these constitutional provisions in practice.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, headed by a Supreme Court, which supervises the work of the lower courts.
 There is a parallel military court system that operates under a military justice code.
 Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases involv-
 ing the military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state of war or
 insurrection. The Government respects the independence of the judiciary.
 The prosecutor or the complainant must open all criminal trials with a public
 statement of the charges. Trial proceedings were formerly based on written argu-
 ments, which7 were not normally made public, but the defense attorney had access
 to all- documents that formed part of the written record. The legal process is now
 more open and transparent as a result of oral argument, introduced in 1990, and
 now increasingly used throghout the system. There is no legal provision against
 self-incrimination, and a judge may compel the defendant to answer any questions
 the judge poses. The defense attorney or prosecutor may a ppeal convictions to a
 higher court which may acquit the person of the crime, confirm the conviction, or
 reduce or increase the sentence.
 There are no political prisoners.
 Sf. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Conepondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy. It states that the home is absolutely
 inviolable at night and may be entered and searched only with a judicial warrant
 and only during the day. It provides equally strong protection for private papers and
 correspondence, and requires a warrant for confiscation. The authorities gnerally
 respectthese rights.and safeguards in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom ofSpeech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, but the authorities may abridge these rights if persons are deemed to
 ee inciting violene or "inslting the nation" (sde blow).
 Alr elements of the political spectrum freely-express their viewpoints in beth the
 print and broadcast media. Montevideo alone has 8 daily newspapers and 6 impor-
 tant-weeklies; tere    r also approximately 100 weekly and a few daily newspapers
 throughout the country. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three com-
 mercial television stations. There are aeut 110 radio stations and 20 television sta-
 tions in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opin-
 ions are free, within the limits contained in the Constitution and the law, and out-
 lines methods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The law calls
 deor 3 months' to 2 years'. imprisonment for "knowingly divulging false news that
 causes a grave disturbance to the publicpeace or a grave prejudice to economic in-
 tersts of the State or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their powers." The
 authorities use this law intermittently to set and enforce certain limits on freedom
 of the press. After the August demonstration in support of the alleged ETA mere-
 C bers, the Government accused two radio stations of inciting the demonstrators to vi-
 olence. The President revoked the license of a station orated by the Tupamaros-
 an active urban terrorist group during the 1960's which now function as a legiti-
 mate political faction-and suspended the iense of another station for 48 hours.
 
 
 517
 In October a court sentenced a businessman to 12 months in prison (suspended)
 after he blamed the failure of his business on the President of the country and
 called the President a "swindler and a thief."
 The national university is autonomous, and the authorities respect academic free-
 dom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly and association. Groups freely organize and express their opinions. The
 law requires permits for public marches and donnstrations; the Ministry of the In-
 terior issues permits routinely, and demonstrations generally occur without official
 harassment or intimidation.
 c. Freedom of Relion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 authorities respect it in practice. Members of all religious groups exercise their
 faiths unhindered, and missionaries are free to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration,   Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on internal and foreign travel or emigration.
 Uruguayans who left the country during the military regime and wish to return are
 encouraged to do so.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their government. Uru-
 guay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18
 years of age or older, and no restrictions regarding race, sex, religion, or economic
 status. The Colorado Party the National (Blanco) Party, and the Broad Front coali-
 tion are the three major political groupings. Each allows ideological divisions within
 the party, and each such division may field its own slate of candidates in general
 elections.
 In national elections, each party fields different lists of candidates; in essence, vot-
 ers express a preference for a party and for a list of candidates rather than for an
 individual candidate. The winning list of the party that receives the most overall
 votes occupies the Presidency and a proportion of seats in the Senate and Chamber
 of Deputies corresponding to the percentage of votes that the party received. A party
 therefore may run multiple presidential candidates, each with his or her own slate
 of legislative candidates. In the November elections, the Broad Front chose to run
 only one presidential candidate. This candidate won more popular votes than any
 other candidate in history. He did not, however, win the presidency, since the Colo-
 rado Party's four candidates received more combined votes.
 Blacks and women face de facto impediments to participation in politics and em-
 ployment in government. In the outgoing Government, 6 women held seats in the
 9-member Parliament; there were no female senators or governors; and only 1
 woman headed a public entity. There was one female vice presidential candidate in
 the 1994 elections, but her candidacy ended when her presidential running mate
 withdrew before the election. The three women elected to the Senate in 1994 were
 the first directly-elected females in the upper house (others have served as sub-
 stitutes). Voters elected another seven women to the lower house of Parliament.
 About 50 percent of Uruguay's judges are women, but they tend to be assigned
 to family and civil courts. There are no women on the Supreme Court; women hold
 only 17 percent of the positions on the second highest court. A few women are found
 at high levels of the Uruguayan private and public sectors. The Socialist Party re-
 quires that one-third of its candidates be women. Women are prominent in many
 government offices at the middle levels, but they remain largely marginalized from
 mainstream politics and underrepresented in the highest government and political
 party offices.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups have functioned freely and without restriction since
 the end of military rule in 1985. The Government has responded to U.N. Human
 Rights Commission inquiries concerning the military regime period and is open to
 inquiries from, and does not restrict the activities of, domestic and international
 human rights monitors.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 language, or social status. Despite these provisions, de facto discrimination based
 upon sex and race exists.
 Women.-Women enjoy equality under the law but face a number of forms of dis-
 crimination stemming from traditional attitudes and practices. Studies show that
 
 
 518
 the work force remains segregated by gender and race. Women make up almost one-
 half the work force but tend to be concentrated in lower paying jobs. They make
 up half the students entering universities and often pursue professional careers but
 are underreprsented in traditionally male professions.
 Violene agaist women continues to be a severe problem; nongovernmental orga-
 nizations estimate that the actual number of cases is probably 10 times the total
 reported to police. In 1988 the Interior Ministry created a Women's Division in the
 pohie force onerned exclusively with crimes against women. Some women's orga-
 nizations complain that even these special police are untrained and lack sensitivity
 to the problems of battered women, and that a woman's ability to make and sustain
 a complaint often depends on the attitude of the judge.
 One private shelter for battered women operates in Montevideo. The Government
 began work on a shelter in 1992, but it has not yet opened. Private women's rights
 groups offer counseling services, and the Montevideo municipality operates a 24-
 hour hot line for victims of domestic violence. In August the Education and Culture
 Minister and the Interior Minister agreed to institute a national program for pre-
 vention and treatment of domestic violence, to be administered by the National In-
 stitute of Women and the police.
 Children.-Although the Government is committed to protecting the rights and
 welfare of children, there continue to be some reports of police abuse of detained
 minors. Government action to deal with these reports is slow or nonexistent. Ap-
 proximately 20 percent of the national budget was designated for pre-university
 education in 1994; in November voters rejected a constitutional referendum requir-
 ing that at least 27 percent of the national budget be earmarked for all types of
 education.
 A local human rights group estimates that there are approximately 1,400 street
 children in Montevideo. There are another 70 in the city's juvenile institutions.
 Early in the year, a judge ordered the closure of Miguelete, the largest male deten-
 tion center, because of its harsh conditions. The detainees ranging in age from 14
 to 18, were transferred to another facility; they later rioted and destroyed that cen-
 ter. The Government then moved all 53 detainees back to Miguelete, where they re-
 mained at the end of the year. The authorities filed charges of mistreatment against
 two of Miguelete's directors after the riot, but subsequently dropped them, and the
 accused returned to their duties. Miguelete has no educational, rehabilitation, or
 recreation facilities. Thirty-two female detainees were housed in another facility,
 which does have educational and recreation facilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's black minority approximately
 6 percent of the population, or 180,000 people, enjoys equality under the law but
 faces societal discrimination. A 1993 report put the number of black university grad-
 uates at 65, and black professionals at fewer than 50. Blacks are practically unrep-
 resented in the bureaucratic, political, and academic sectors of society. They lack the
 educational opportunities and social and political connections necessary for entry
 into these groups. Most citizens do not recognize that discrimination against minori-
 ties is a problem, and the Government has not taken action to deal with this prob-
 lem
 People With Disabilities.-The legislature passed a law covering the rights of the
 disabled in 1989, but the Government has not implemented it. It does not mandate
 accessibility to existing buildings or public services for people with disabilities; new
 public buildings will be required to have such access. The law is mostly declarative,
 i.e., it does not stipulate specific remedial measures or sanctions for not complying
 with these measures. The law requires that 4 percent of public sector jobs be re-
 served for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that laws should promote
 the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies. In spite of
 this provision, there is almost a complete lack of regulation of union activities.
 Unions traditionally organize and operate free of government regulation. Civil serv-
 ants, employees of state-run enterprises, and private enterprise workers may join
 unions. An estimated 12 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are
 independent of political party control but have traditionally been more closely asso-
 ciated with the Broad Front, the leftist political coalition.
 The Constitution also provides workers with the right to strike, and there was sig-
 nificant strike activity during the year. The Government may legally compel work-
 ers to work during a strike if their work is considered an essential service. An es-
 sential service is defined as one whose interruption "could cause a grave prejudice
 or risk, provoking suffering to part or all of the society."
 
 
 519
 There are no restrictions on a union's right to form confederations or affiliate with
 international trade union bodies, but the only union confederation is by choice not
 officially affiliated with any of the world federations. Some individual unions are af-
 filiated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining between
 companies and their unions determines most private sector salaries. The executive
 branch, acting independently or through tripartite salary councils it convokes, deter-
 mines public sector salaries. In December 1993, the Ministry of Labor and the pub-
 lic service unions signed an agreement indexing salary increases to inflation which
 covers most public service employees until March 1995; this resulted in less strike
 activity in the public sector.
 There are no laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination; however, a 1993 executive
 decree established fines for employees engaging in antiunion activities. The law does
 not require empIoyer to reinstate workers fired for union activities. However, in
 cases of legal c  enes by union activists, courts tend to impose indemnization
 higher than the normal payment for dismissed workers.
 While no institutionalized mechanism exists for resolving workers' complaints
 against employers, the law generally prohibits discrimination by employers, includ-
 ing arbitrary dismissals for union activity. The International Labor Organization
 (ILO), in a 1992 decision, noted the lack of statutory provisions in this area, and
 said that the current system of protection against antiunion practices does not in-
 fringe ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively, but
 "could be improved in so far as accelerating the procedure."
 All labor legislation fully covers workers employed in Uruguay's five special ex-
 pert zones. There are no unions in any of these zones, but there are as yet relatively
 few workers in traditionally organizable occupations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its existence.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Child Labor Code protects
 children violations are punishable by fines of up to $500. The Ministry of Labor is
 responsible for enforcing the code, and illegal child labor is not a problem. The law
 generally does not permit children under 15 years of age to work, but 12-year-olds
 may be employedi they have a special permit. Children under the age of 18 may
 not perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work. Controls over salaries and hours
 for children are more strict than those for adults. Children over the age of 16 may
 sue in court for payment of wages, and children have the legal right to dispose of
 their own income. However, many children work as street vendors in the expanding
 informal sector or in the agrarian sector, they are generally less strictly regulated
 and receive lower pay.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A legislated minimum monthly wage, adjusted
 and enforced by the Ministry of Labor, is in effect. The minimum wage is adjusted
 whenever public sector wages are adusted, usually once every 4 months. The mini-
 mum wage was about $84 (475 pesos) per month at the end of the year. It functions
 more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a true measure of minimum
 subsistence levels, and does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in industry and 44 hours in commerce, with
 a 36-hour break each week. The law stipulates that industrial workers receive over-
 time compensation for work in excess of 48 hours and that workers are entitled to
 20 days of paid vacation after a year of employment.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security enforces legislation regulating health
 and safety conditions in a generally effective manner. Some labor regulations cover
 urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural workers.
 After several serious accidents and work stoppages to protest the lack of safety
 standards in the construction industry, the Ministry initiated a public service cam-
 paign, with newspaper and television announcements, urging better workplace safe-
 ty practices.
