 ALBANIA*
 Albania is a one-party state ruled by a Marxist-Leninist
 dictatorship. The Government proclaims itself a People's
 Socialist Republic. Ramiz Alia, who officially replaced
 long-time dictator Enver Hoxha as Albania's leader in 1985,
 exercises personal leadership through the 140,000-member
 Communist party known as the Albanian Party of Labor (APL).
 Since assuming leadership, Alia has pledged continuity with
 Hoxha's policies. Internationally, he has pursued a policy of
 cautiously expanding diplomatic, cultural, and commercial
 links abroad, especially with neighboring Balkan and Western
 European states.
 A large, effective security service, the Sigurimi, assists the
 party in maintaining repressive controls over the Albanian
 people, whr are permitted only very limited civil and political
 rights.
 Albania has a centrally controlled command economy under which
 the State owns the means of production, and the Government
 directs all significant economic activity. Within a strategy
 of economic self-reliance, the Government emphasizes a policy
 of rapid industrialization and development. In recent years,
 however, the rate of economic growth has declined.
 There are indications that a limited number of restrictions on
 everyday life have been relaxed somewhat under Alia. Although
 the Albanian population continues to be isolated from foreign
 influences, the Government now tacitly allows citizens to
 receive foreign broadcasts from Italy, Greece, and
 Yugoslavia. The Government has liberalized visa issuance for
 tourists from most Western countries and allowed a limited
 number of its own citizens to visit neighboring countries in
 tour groups. In other areas, significant human rights
 violations, corroborated by private international
 organizations and refugees, continue to occur. The Government
 has repeatedly refused to cooperate with any international
 organization which investigates human rights complaints.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No evidence came to light of political killings by the
 authorities during 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent information available on whether
 disappearances occur.
 *The United States has not had diplomatic relations with, or
 official representation in, Albania since 1939. It is
 difficult, therefore, to comment authoritatively on conditions
 in Albania.

 ALBANIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Criminal Code prohibits and provides punishment for the
 use of physical or psychological force during investigations.
 Nevertheless, former political prisoners have often reported
 that they were beaten or otherwise ill-treated during
 investigation proceedings to force them to make confessions.
 Although some of the worst abuses of the past may have ended,
 it appears that Albanian investigators still resort to threats
 and beatings to obtain confessions or collaboration. In the
 absence of independent means of investigating these charges,
 it is difficult to corroborate such reports.
 Private international humanitarian organizations have reported
 extremely harsh prison conditionz in Albania, including a
 severe hard-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac and Ballsh labor camps,
 in particular, have been noted for their harsh conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval, or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act which is not a crime.
 The Criminal Code, however, is explicitly ideological and
 officially characterized as a "weapon in the class struggle."
 Its provisions defining political offenses are loosely
 formulated, allowing the courts to interpret them broadly to
 punish whomever the regime desires.
 The Criminal Code lists 34 crimes, 12 of which are political
 offenses, for which the death sentence may be imposed. Among
 these are such nonviolent political offenses as: unauthorized
 leaving or "flight" from the State, agitation and propaganda
 against the State, creation of a counterrevolutionary
 organization or participation therein, concealment of a person
 who commits a crime against the State, activity against the
 revolutionary movement of the working class, and refusal to
 carry out a duty or coercing others to refuse.
 The Criminal Code also provides that banishment (generally to
 a state farm or enterprise) or internment may be
 administratively imposed, without trial, for up to 5 years on
 persons whom the authorities consider a threat to the
 Communist system and on the families of fugitives. Amnesty
 International's 1987 Report noted that six members of the Popa
 family from Durres were punished in this manner. In December
 1985, they left the collective farm and sought refuge in the
 Italian Embassy in Tirana where they still remain at the end
 of 1987.
 There are numerous reports that families of escapees from
 Albania have been imprisoned or interned as a deterrent to
 other potential illegal emigrants. Amnesty International has
 reported a number of such cases in recent years, but another
 source claimed that close relatives of recent escapees are no
 longer interned.
 Amnesty International reports that political detainees lack
 adequate legal safeguards during pretrial investigations. By
 law, investigations into crimes against the State must be
 completed within 3 months, but extensions are easily obtained,
 
 
 844
 ALBANIA
 and no effective maximum period of investigation is enforced.
 Most investigations into political offenses are completed
 within 4 months, but Amnesty International charges that some
 investigations have dragged on for-more than a year.
 Political detainees have been held in solitary confinement for
 up to 6 months during pretrial investigations without access
 to lawyers or relatives. The Criminal Code provides that
 accused persons must be informed when investigation of their
 cases is concluded and allowed to examine all the evidence to
 be brought against them. Usually, however, they are not
 allowed to examine all the materials and are shown only a copy
 of the indictment. While investigators are theoretically
 bound by rules of procedure, and the accused may appeal to
 higher authority against investigators who violate proper
 procedures, there do not appear to be any effective controls
 on the powers of investigators in political cases.
 Little information on forced labor is available. It is
 believed that one form of punishment is internal banishment to
 a 'labor camp. The prisoners do not have a choice of work but
 are remunerated for their labor. In addition, virtually every
 citizen is required to participate in uncompensated
 "voluntary" work projects, particularly at harvest times.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes a Supreme Court and regional and
 district courts. Like all organs of the Government and state
 authority, the judicial system is under the total control of
 the APL. Courts may not render an independent verdict in
 conflict with the wishes or policies of the regime.
 Amnesty International reports that persons accused of
 political crimes lack adequate legal safeguards during their
 trials. Defendants at political trials have usually been
 denied defense counsel and have had to conduct their own
 defense. Major political trials of state officials are closed
 when it suits the purposes of the regime, but most political
 trials of ordinary citizens are held in open court. Most such
 trials last no more than 1 day, and there have been no known
 acquittals.
 Reports of the number of persons in prison range from 4,000 to
 40,000, including 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and other political
 prisoners. Many persons are serving sentences for expressing
 dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or for trying to
 flee the country. Former political prisoners report about
 1,200 political prisoners each were being held in the Ballsh
 and Spac labor camps during the early 1980's. Some 300 more
 were imp   oned at Burrel, and others were held in Tarovic,
 Kosove, and Tirana prisons. Although the Government declared
 an amnesty on November 15, 1982, there is no independent
 confirmation of the number of persons amnestied, and there are
 reports of further political arrests since 1982.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence, but at the same time provides
 that these and other civil rights are subordinate to the
 general interest and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 Socialist order. Observers generally believe that the
 
 
 845
 ALBANIA
 authorities can, and do, violate the privacy of the home
 whenever and to the extent necessary to achieve their ends.
 The Government uses its pervasive informer network to report
 on, among other things, the private lives of its citizens.
 Children are taught to report their parents' activities in the
 home, such as whether they practice religion or speak against
 the Government.
 Contact with the outside world is carefully monitored.
 Albanian citizens are required to report any contact with
 foreigners to the police. Refugees have reported difficulties
 they had while in Albania in receiving mail or telephone calls
 from relatives living abroad. Sometimes packages of food,
 medicine, and clothing sent to them were returned by the
 Albanian authorities. There are reports that it became
 significantly easier in 1986 and 1987 to receive letters and
 packages from relatives abroad. Though it is technically
 illegal to receive television or radio broadcasts from
 neighboring Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, recent indications
 are that the Government tacitly allows its citizens to do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution states that citizens enjoy these
 freedoms, it provides that they may not be exercised in
 opposition to the Socialist order. Consequently, the
 Government has imposed rigid restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press. Any citizen who publicly criticizes the Government
 is subject to swift and severe reprisals under an article of
 the Constitution which forbids anti-State agitation and
 propaganda. Amnesty International claims in its 1987 Report
 to have received information about several persons convicted
 under this article and serving sentences of up to 20 years for
 peacefully expressing views critical of economic or political
 conditions in Albania.
 All news media are government controlled and never criticize
 the state and party leaderships or their policies. Art and
 literature are deemed to be weapons of revolutionary change
 and are subject to rigid state control and censorship. The
 authorities also manipulate scholarly inquiry and publications
 for political purposes, particularly in such fields as
 linguistics, literature, economics, history, geography,
 folklore, and ethnology.
 Information'from abroad is carefully controlled, and persons
 having unauthorized contacts with foreigners have been
 reprimanded or jailed. There is some indication that such
 restrictions may have been relaxed somewhat lately. Western
 visitors report that Albanian citizens are increasingly bold
 in talking to Western visitors and tourists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deal severely with group activities that
 do not have government sanction or that might appear to be in
 opposition to the leadership. There are no independent
 associations or organizations; all are controlled by the APL.
 Nearly all Albanians belong to trade unions that are part of
 the United Trade Unions of Albania, an arm of the APL. These
 unions have no significant independent voice in the field of
 labor relations, although they do play a key role in
 
 
 846
 ALBANIA
 indoctrinating and propagandizing the workers, in maintaining
 labor discipline, and in organizing the periods of so-called
 voluntary manual labor in which all Albanians are expected to
 take part.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited by
 the Constitution and by government policy. Historically,
 about 70 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, nearly 20
 percent were Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were
 Roman Catholic. A recent refugee report estimated that
 between 2,000 and 2,500 Jews live in Albania.
 In 1967"the Government proclaimed Albania the first atheist
 state in the world, abrogated all laws dealing with
 church-state relations, and began actively to eradicate all
 vestiges of religion. More than 2,100 mosques, churches,
 monasteries, and other institutions were closed, their fixed
 assets were seized without compensation by the authorities,
 and many religious leaders were persecuted, imprisoned, or
 even executed for continuing their religious functions. All
 religious literature was banned, as were any personal
 manifestations of religious belief or practice. While a few
 outstanding historic churches and their religious art are
 being restored as museums, most churches and mosques have been
 converted to other uses.
 The regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 threatening harsh penalties for believers who practice their
 faith and by obliging citizens to inform on believers.
 Nevertheless, there have been some signs that the regime is
 quietly toning down its antireligious campaign, as Tirana
 tries to improve its relations with Italy, Greece, and
 Turkey. There has been, however, no official statement that
 religious practice is once again allowed. In its 1987 Report,
 Amnesty International, citing refugee statements in 1986,
 noted the arrest of Father Pjeter Meshkalla, an 80-year-old
 Jesuit, after he had celebrated mass in a private house. He
 had already served two long terms of imprisonment. One
 Western report said Father Meshkalla had died in custody in
 1987, but this has not been confirmed. Despite years of
 antireligious pressure, some Albanians have continued to
 practice their faith in their own homes, particularly in
 villages and in more remote mountainous areas. Tourists have
 also reported seeing Muslim Albanians praying along roadsides
 with apparent impunity.
 In November 1983, the Vatican publicly condemned religious
 persecution in Albania and claimed that a number of priests,
 members of holy orders, and seminarians had died in prison.
 It also reported that two priests had been executed for
 baptizing children. The official press denies, however, that
 believers have been persecuted and maintains that religious
 belief is opposed only by argument.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement.
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are controlled
 very strictly, and transgressors against the laws are severely
 punished. The Criminal Code states that flight from the State
 or refusal to return to the fatherland by a person sent abroad
 on service or allowed to leave the State, is considered
 
 
 847
 ALBANIA
 treason and punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10
 years or by death. Amnesty International stated in its 1987
 Report that a worker from Kavaje was serving a 25-year prison
 sentence for having attempted to leave Albania illegally.
 Despite this, Albanians continue to risk their lives to cross
 heavily guarded borders into Greece and Yugoslavia. Until
 recently, Albanians were allowed to leave the country legally
 only on official business or, very rarely, for family
 reasons. In 1987 organized groups of Albanian tourists
 visited Yugoslavia, and Albania is reported to be negotiating
 similar programs with Italy and other Western European
 countries. Albania has publicly stated that it wishes to
 increase the number of its university students on exchange
 programs in Western countries. Neither Albanian law nor
 practice allows the right to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right exists in theory or in practice. The system of
 government is a totalitarian dictatorship, headed by Ramiz
 Alia in his capacity as First Secretary of the APL and
 Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly. The
 Constitution establishes the APL as the sole political entity
 and Marxism-Leninism as the only political ideology. The APL
 is governed internally by the principle of "democratic
 centralism," under which decisionmaking power is concentrated
 in the hands of a small elite. Any attempt by individual
 citizens, or even party members, to criticize policy or change
 the form of government or its leaders is dealt with severely.
 The Constitution provides that the People's Assembly (a
 unicameral parliament) is the supreme organ of national
 government in Albania; similar bodies, called people's
 councils, exist at the local level. Candidates for these
 assemblies are first designated by a mass organization known
 as the Democratic Front, which is controlled by the APL, and
 then "elected" without opposition by universal suffrage.
 After the last quadrennial elections, held on April 27, 1986,
 the Government announced that 100 percent of eligible voters
 had participated and that the official slate of candidates had
 been elected with more that 99.99 percent of the votes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies violating human rights and refuses to
 cooperate with any investigation of allegations to the
 contrary, including confidential investigations by the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Greeks are the largest ethnic minority, but smaller numbers of
 Serbs, Macedonians, Vlachs, Gypsies, and Jews also live in
 Albania. The Constitution grants national minorities
 "guaranteed protection and development of their culture and
 popular traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its
 teaching in the schools, and equal development in all fields
 of social life." While there are differences of opinion over
 the extent to which minorities can exercise their cultural,
 educational, and linguistic rights, they are clearly
 restricted. While Greeks and Macedonians can be educated in
 
 
 848
 ALBANIA
 their mother tongue through the primary level, there is no
 publishing or broadcasting in these languages. Several
 reports indicate persecution, harassment, and discrimination
 against minorities solely because-of their ethnic status.
 There have even been reports of mass removals of segments of
 the Greek population out of traditionally Greek lands in the
 south toareas more distant from the Albanian-Greek border.
 Furthermore, insofar as the ban on religious practice has
 removed the Greek Orthodox Church from Greek communities in
 Albania, an important part of that ethnic group's commmunity
 life and links to Greece has been eliminated. The leadership
 of both the ,APL and the Government are overwhelmingly ethnic
 Albanian of Moslem background.
 The Codstitution states that women shall enjoy "equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 in all social-political activity, as well as in the family."
 Information on the extent to which these rights are exercised
 is not available, but there are indications that the regime
 has advanced the status of women. Women are said to
 participate equally in the obligatory labor and military
 service programs. There are several women in party and
 government leadership positions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no current data available on the minimum age for the
 employment of children, minimum wages, maximum hours of work,
 or occupational safety and health.
