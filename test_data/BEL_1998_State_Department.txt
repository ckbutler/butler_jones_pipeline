 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch who plays
 a mainly symbolic role. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the Prime Min-
 ister, holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the lower house of the bi-
 cameral Parliament. Constitutional reforms enacted in 1993 transformed Belgium
 from a unitary into a federal state with several levels of government, including na-
 tional, regional (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels), and community (Flemish,
 Francophone, and German) levels. The judiciary is independent.
 The Government maintains effective control of all security forces. The Police
 Judiciaire'and the Gendarmerie currently share responsibility for internal security
 with the municipal police, but the two organizations are to be merged at the federal
 level, and the Gendarmerie and municipal police are to be integrated at the local
 level under a new reorganization plan.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and limited
 government participation in industry. The primary exports are iron and steel. The
 economy supports a high standard of living for most citizens.

 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and the judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of
 abuse. Violence against women is a problem, and the Government passed legislation
 that criminalizes domestic violence to help protect women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such-practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 In addition to the integration of the police forces, the reorganization plan calls for
 the creation of an independent oversight body for the federal police and also for the
 creation of a new anticorruption unit that is to be integrated into the federal police
 structure.
 Prison conditions vary. Newer prisons meet international standards. Older facili-
 ties meet or nearly meet minimum international standards despite their Spartan
 physical conditions and limited resources. A month-long strike by prison guards in
 February led to a temporary worsening of prison conditions. Federal police filled in
 for prison guards during the strike. In December the prison system, designed to hold
 7,533 prisoners, had 8,074 occupants. During 1997 and 1998, the Government ex-
 panded the capacity of the prison system by approximately 600 beds. The expansion
 program is intended to improve overall conditions and expand capacity to 8,000 beds
 by 2000.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Arrested persons must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is -subject to month-
 ly review by a panel of judges, which may extend pretrial detention based on estab-
 lished criteria (e.g., whether, in the courfs view, the arrested person would be likely
 to commit further crimes pr attempt to flee if released). Bail exists in principle
 under the law but is granted rarely. The Government no longer separates convicted
 criminals and pretrial detainees. Pretrial detainees receive different benefits from
 convicted criminals, such as the right to more frequent family visits. Approximately
 40 percent of the total prison population consists of pretrial detainees. Arrested per-
 sons are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their choosing or, if they cannot afford
 one, to an attorney appointed by- the state.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. The judicial system is organized
 according to specialization and territorial jurisdiction, with 5 territorial levels: Can-
 ton (225), district (27), provinces and Brussels (11), courts of appeal (5), and for the
 whole Kingdom-the "Cour de Cassation." The latter is the highest appeals court.
 The judiciary enforces the law's provision for the right to a fair trial. When a pre-
 liminary judicial investigatory phase is completed, a suspect is formally charged if
 the evidence so warrants. Charges are clearly and formally stated, and there is a
 presumption of innocence. All defendants have the right to be present, to have coun-
 sel (at public expense if needed), to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to
 appeal. Military tribunals try military personnel for common law as well as military
 crimes. All military tribunals consist of four officers and a civilian judge. At the ap-
 pellate level the civilian judge presides. The accused has the right of appeal to a
 igher military court.
 The Government continued to implement judicial reforms in the wake of public
 dissatisfaction with the handling of the 1996 Dutroux pedophile investigation (see
 Section 5). The reform legislation included the creation of a board of attorneys gen-
 eral, whose purpose is to oversee and streamline nationwide policy on criminal pros-
 ecutions. Changes also were made to the procedure governing the appointment and
 promotion of magistrates. The Government also created a High Council on Justice
 to supervise the appointment and promotion of magistrates. The Government plans
 for the Council to serve as a permanent monitoring board for the entire justice sys-
 tem and to be empowered to hear complaints against individual magstrates.
 Following its review of the judicial system, the Government implemented several
 reforms that granted stronger rights to victims of crime. These measures allow vic-
 tims to have more access to information during an investigation, as well as the right
 
 
 1160
 to appeal if an investigation does not reach a decision to bring charges. As part of
 its program of judicial reform, the Government in 1997 opened the first in a series
 of planned "justice houses." These facilities combine a variety of legal services under
 one roof, including legal aid, mediation, and victims' assistance. The Government
 plans to open 27 justice houses in 27 judicial districts by 2001.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Intererence With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and vio-
 lations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Boards of directors that represent the main political, linguis-
 tic, and opinion groups supervise programs. A government representative sits on
 each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations operate 'with
 government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to television from other
 Western European countries and elsewhere abroad. Satellite services are also avail-
 able.
 There are restrictions on the press regarding libel, slander, and the advocacy of
 racial or ethnic discrimination, hate, or violence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Citizens are free to form or-
 ganizations and establish ties to international bodies, but the Antiracism Law (see
 Section 5) prohibits membership in organizations that practice discrimination overt-
 ly and repeatedly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hinder the practice of any
 faith. The law accords "recognized" status to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Ju-
 daism, Anglicanism, Islam, and Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, and these religions
 receive subsidies from general government revenues. Taxpayers who object to con-
 tributing to religious subsidies have no recourse. By law, each recognized religion
 has the right, to provide teachers at government expenge for religious instruction in
 schools, but not all avail themselves of this right. For recognized religions, the Gov-
 ernment pays the salaries, retirement, and lodging costs of ministers and also sub-
 sidizes the renovation of church buildings.
 Although Islam was declared a recognized religion in 1974, Muslims have not had
 an elected body to act as their representative in dealings with the federal govern-
 ment. In December Muslims held nationwide elections for an assembly consisting
 of 51 persons representing numerous communities of the Muslim faith. Of those
 elected, four were women. The Muslim representative body to be recognized by the
 Government is to be composed of 17 members appointed by the elected assembly
 and the current Muslim executive council.
 The Evangelical Association (a group of Evangelical Christian organizations) con-
 tinued to claim discrimination due to the Government's refusal to grant it recog-
 nized status separate from the Protestant religion. Despite the Government's re-
 fusal, it is negotiating with the group in an effort to ensure that the Evangelical
 Association enjoys the same benefits as recognized religions. The lack of independ-
 ent recognized status does not prevent religious groups from practicing freely.
 In 1997 a parliamentary commission, established by the Government to rec-
 ommend a policy to deal with the potential dangers that "sects" may represent to
 society-especially children-issued its report. It divided sects into two broadly de-
 fined categories: the report characterized a "sect" as any religious-based organiza-
 tion, and a "harmful sect" as a group that may pose a threat to society or individ-
 uals. Parliament adopted the reports recommendations. To implement one of the
 recommendations, in May Parliament passed legislation to create a "Center for In-
 formation and Advice on Harmful Sectarian Organizations." The Center is to collect
 open source information on a wide range of religious and philosophical groups and
 to provide information and advice to the public regarding the legal rights of freedom
 of association, freedom of privacy, and freedom of religion. The Government estab-
 lished a budget for the Center, which is scheduled to open early in 1999, but has
 not yet published regulations to govern its operations. The Center is authorized to
 propose policy or legislation on the problem of sects but is not authorized to provide
 opinions or assessments of individual sectarian organizations. The Government cre-
 ated an interagency body designed to work in conjunction with the Center to coordi-
 nate government policy on sects. Neither the Government nor Parliament has yet
 
 
 1161
 
 taken any action to establish a special police unit on sects or to designate special
 magistrates to monitor cases involving sects, which were two other recommenda-
 tions of the 1997 commission.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations (U.N.) High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. The Government provides first asylum, and during the year 21,947 new appli-
 cations for asylum were filed, compared with 11,817 in 1997. A total of 1,484 appli-
 cants, mostly from previous years, were granted permanent residence. Counting ap-
 lications from previous years, 24,225 applications remained pending. Of new asy-
 lure seekers since May, 25 percent were displaced residents of Kosovo. No special
 procedures were established for these individuals.
 All asylum seekers can plead their cases before immigration authorities. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee/asylee
 status. A special program initiated in 1992 for refugees from the former Yugoslavia
 was discontinued at the begining of the year. The displaced persons admitted
 under that program were aowed either to adjust their status and become perma-
 nent residents or to apply for political asylum.
 Asylum seekers arriving by air with no papers are detained for up to 5 months
 while awaiting consideration of their cases. Cidren in such centers do not attend
 school. If no asylum decision has been reached by the end of the 5-month period,
 then the asylum seeker is released or voluntarily repatriated. At the discretion of
 the Minister of Interior, the Cabinet may exempt certain cities, which have already
 accepted large refugee populations, from giving legal residence to new refugees/
 asylees.
 In June a Senate commission recommended reforms to the immigration law de-
 signed to create a more "just and humane" immigration policy. The commission
 criticized the conditions in detention centers and advocated the upgrading and ren-
 ovation of certain centers. In addition to improving the physical infrastructure of the
 centers, the commission recommended that detainees receive improved access to
 legal, medical, and social services. The commission also proposed the creation of a
 national body to oversee the quality of conditions in detention centers.
 In September a young Nigerian woman, Semira Adamu, died following a struggle
 with police who were trying to repatriate her forcibly. Her case was reviewed by the
 Aliens Office and the Government's Commissioner for Refugees, who determined
 that her claim to refugee status was unfounded. During the repatriation attempt,
 Adamu was resisting police, and they placed a pillow over her face to subdue her.
 Adamu collapsed and later died. Following an autopsy, the authorities determined
 that the cause of death was asphyxiation. She had entered iBrussels earlier during
 the year using fraudulent documents and claimed that she was fleeing Nigeria to
 avoid a forced marriage.
 After the incident, the Minister of Interior revealed that two of the officers in-
 volved were disciplined previously for excessive use of force in another case. The
 three officers who restrained Adamu were charged with manslaughter, and the Gov-
 ernment launched an investigation into the case. Shortly after the incident, the Gov-
 ernment acknowledged that the use of a pillow to silence unruly detainees was
 standard procedure.
 News of the incident provoked a number of demonstrations throughout the coun-
 try calling for the resignation of the Minister of Interior and for drastic revisions
 to the country's asylum and repatriation policy. The Minister resigned several days
 later and took responsibility for the mistakes made by the police.
 In the aftermath of this incident the Government adopted new policies on asylum
 in October, which mirrored recommendations made in June by the Senate Commis-
 sion. The commission recommended and the Government agreed that the detention
 period for undocumented aliens should be limited to 5 months. Other changes in-
 cluded additional staff and funding for the immigration office, in order to ensure the
 timely review of pending cases and visa issuance; the assignment of immigration of-
 ficers abroad to assist airline personnel in reviewing passenger documentation dur-
 ing check-in; the enlargement of reception centers; and additional funding for social
 and legal services for asylum seekers. The changes in the law create a new category
 of temporary visa for illegal migrants in need of urgent medical attention.
 The Government does not plan to change its repatriation policy, but the use of
 the "cushio"-to avoid screaming and biting-was eliminated. The use of manacles
 for hands and feet was retained, and the Gendarmerie unit that deals with forced
 repatriations is to be enlarged and better trained. Also, more specialized staff are
 to be recruited in order to facilitate voluntary repatriation. The maximum stay in
 
 
 1162
 detention centers was reduced from 8-to 5 months in line with the Senate commis-
 sion report. A special commission is to be set up to monitor conditions in the deten-
 tion centers, and a wider range of officials and welfare organizations are to have
 access to the centers in order to assess the living conditions. The Government meas-
 ures also create a special commissioner to monitor asylum policy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully.
 Citizens ages 18 and older exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and
 fair elections held on the basis of universal and compulsory (under penalty of fine)
 suffrage. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some Senators
 elected by community councils and others elected by Senate members) are held at
 least every 4 years. Opposition parties operate freely.
 In July the European Court of Justice censured Belgium for failure to comply with
 a European Council directive requiring members states to accord to all citizens of
 European Union (EU) countries resident in another EU country the right to vote
 in municipal elections. In December Parliament approved a constitutional amend-
 ment that extends that right to EU citizens. Parliament was debating implementing
 legislation at year's end.
 The Federal Government is responsible for such matters of state as security, jus-
 tice, social security, and fiscal and monetary policy. The regional governments are
 charged with matters that directly affect the geographical regions and the material
 well-being of their residents, such as commerce and trade, public works, and envi-
 ronmental policy. The linguistic community councils handle matters more directly
 affecting the mental and cultural well-being of the individual, such as education and
 the administration of certain social welfare programs.
 Women hold some high-level positions in the Government. Two of 15 federal min-
 isters are women. In the Federal Parliament, 18 of 150 House members and 18 of
 71 Senators are women. The law requires that 33 percent of the candidates on the
 ballot in all future elections be women.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the state. Most major institutions, including political
 parties, are divided along linguistic lines. National decisions often take into account
 the specific needs of each regional and linguistic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the listed factors, and the Government
 enforces it. With Dutch, French, and German as official languages, Belgium has a
 complex linguistic regime, including language requirements for various elective and
 appointive positions.
 Women.-A 1997 parliamentary report described domestic violence against women
 as still "covered by a culture of silence." In one academic study, an eminent sociolo-
 gist found that slightly less than 1 percent of the women in a particular town had
 reported incidents of domestic violence to the authorities. However, the number of
 unreported incidents is higher, and other studies suggest that approximately 6 per-
 cent of women in several other towns were abused by their domestic partners.
 In February a law came into effect that defines and criminalizes domestic vio-
 lence. The legislation protects married and unmarried partners. Women's groups see
 the legislation as an important step in recognizing conjugal violence as constituting
 a distinct offense from other forms of aggression. The legislation allows social orga-
 nizations to represent victims of domestic violence in court provided that they have
 the victim's consent. The legislation also requires the Government to maintain a
 database of statistics on the subject, but by year's end the Government had yet to
 make any progress on implementing any provisions of the law and did not yet have
 any accurate statistics on domestic violence.
 A number of shelters and telephone help lines operate throughout the country. In
 addition to providing women with shelter and advice, many offer assistance on legal
 matters, job placement, and psychological counseling for both partners. Approxi-
 mately 80 percent of these organizations' budgets are provided by one of the three
 regional governments.
 
 
 1163
 
 The law prohibits organizing prostitution or assisting immigration for the purpose
 of prostitution, but not prostitution itself. Parliament enacted a law in 1995 that
 defined and criminalized trafficking in human beings. Under this law, victims of
 trafficking may be granted temporary residence permits and are eligible to receive
 aid from government-funded reception centers. Since 1994 the majority of cases
 were victims of either sexual or economic exploitation. The victims of sexual exploi-
 tation are increasingly women under the age of 18. Since enactment of this law, a
 magistrate was designated in each judicial district to supervise cases involving
 human trafficking. During the year, 244 women from over 30 countries were victims
 of human trafficking. The largest number of victims (65) were of Nigerian origin.
 Equal treatment of men and women is provided for by the Constitution, federal
 law, and treaties incorporated into law. The Government actively promotes a com-
 prehensive approach to the integration of women at all levels of decisionmaking.
 The Division of Equal Opportunity, a part of the Ministry of Labor, focuses specifi-
 cally on issues affectng women, including violence against women, sexual harass-
 ment, and the participation of women in the political process. Beginning in 1999,
 federal law requires that one-third of all candidates for elected office be women.
 Sexual harassment is illegal. The Government implemented procedures to monitor
 sexual harassment claims in the private sector in 1992 and in the public sector in
 1995. Victims of sexual harassment have the right to sue their harassers under ex-
 isting law.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded system of public education and health
 care. It provides compulsory education up to the age of 18. The Francophone and
 Flemish communities have agencies specifically dealing with children's needs.
 Government and private groups provide shelters for runaways and counseling for
 children who have been physically or sexually abused.
 There are comprehensive child protection laws. Children have the right to a voice
 in court cases that affect them, such as divorce proceedings. The law states that a
 minor "capable of understanding" can request permission to be heard by a judge,
 or that a judge can request an interview with a child. In 1995 the government en-
 acted laws designed to combat child pornography by increasing penalties for such
 crimes and for those in possession of pedophilic materials. The law permits prosecu-
 tion of Belgian citizens who commit such crimes abroad and provides that criminals
 convicted of the sexual abuse of children cannot receive parole without first receiv-
 ing specialized assistance and must continue counseling and treatment upon their
 release from prison.
 Belgium is both a transit point and destination for trafficking in women and chil-
 dren. During the year, 45 children from 26 different countries were trafficked in the
 country, the largest number from Macedonia (8).
 In 1996 the authorities uncovered a pedophile/child pornography and trafficking
 ring. The criminal investigation of this rng continued during the year. Five suspects
 remained in detention; however, their trial is unlikely to begin before mid-2000. In
 February a parliamentary commission, appointed in the aftermath of this case and
 tasked with investigating allegations of corruption and complicity in the law en-
 forcement and judicial systems, issued its report. The commission sharply criticized
 the entire judicial system, including both the police and judiciary for undisciplined,
 inept, and potentially corrupt handling of the pedophile scandal and associated
 crimes. It also recommended that disciplinary action be considered against numer-
 ous police officers and magistrates involved in this investigation. By November one
 police officer and one magistrate had been recommended for sanction, but their pun-
 ishment had not yet been fixed. The Cour de Cassation was considering at year's
 end whether to sanction the examining magistrate who handled the pedophile inves-
 tigation.
 In another response to the public outcry over the handling of the pedophile case,
 the Government established a center for missing and exploited children that opened
 in December 1997.
 Child prostitution is of limited scope, but in response to recommendations made
 in a 1994 government study, the police received instructions to be especially diligent
 in combating prostitution among those who appear to be under the age of 18.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law provides for the protection of disabled persons
 from discrimination in employment, education, and in the provision of other state
 services. The Government mandates that public buildings erected since 1970 be ac-
 cessible to the disabled and offers subsidies to induce the owners of other buildings
 to make necessary modifications. However, many older buildings are not accessible.
 The Government provides financial assistance for the disabled. It gives special aid
 to parents of disabled children and to disabled parents. Regional and community
 
 
 1164
 rograms provide other assistance, such as job training. Disabled persons are eligi-
 le to receive services in any of the three regions (Flanders, Walonia, or Brussels),
 not just their region of residence.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected, and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of citizens are native Dutch speakers, about 40 percent
 are French speakers, and fewer than 1 percent are German speakers.
 An Antiracism Law penalizes the incitement of discrimination, hate, or violence
 based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. It is illegal for providers of goods or services
 (including housing) to discriminate on the basis of any of these factors and for em-
 ployers to consider these factors in their decisions to hire, train, or dismiss workers.
 The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Fight Against Racism, a parliamentary
 organization tasked with investigating complaints of discrimination based on race,
 handied 2,145 calls asking for information in 1997. Of these calls, 1,472 were to
 make actual complaints, leading to mediation or court action in 810 cases. In the
 first 8 months of the year the Center handled approximately 608 calls, 473 of which
 were actual complaints.
 In 1997 six Belgian paratroopers who participated in the 1993 U.N. peacekeeping
 operation in Somalia were accused of dishonorable, racist acts during their time in
 Somalia. The charges included such things as swinging a young Somali over a fire,
 forcing a young Muslim Somali to eat pork and drink salt water, and offering a So-
 mali girl as a "birthday gift" to other Belgian soldiers. In late 1997, two of the six
 soldiers were acquitted under the antiracism law of the charges arising from swing-
 ing the boy over the fire. The military courts based their decisions on lack of evi-
 dence as to intent.
 In March a military tribunal tried the four other soldiers. One soldier, a sergeant
 who offered the young Somali girl to three colleagues as a "gift," was found not
 guilty of racism but guilty on one count of soliciting a prostitute-for which he re-
 ceived a 3-month suspended sentence. In the other three cases, the military court
 waived judgment and placed the three soldiers on probation. If they complete the
 probationary period without further offense, their records would be cleared. The
 Center for Equal Opportunity and the Fight Against Racism and the military pros-
 ecutor appealed the verdicts. The appeals court found the sergeant guilty of racism
 and soliciting a prostitute. The court imposed a more stringent penalty including a
 12-month prison sentence, a fine, and a 5-year suspension of civil and political
 rights. The appeals court upheld the sentence of the lower court regarding the other
 three soldiers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers have the right to
 associate freely, which includes the freedom to organize and join unions of their own
 choosing. The Government does not hamper such activities, and workers fully and
 freely exercise their right of association. About 60 percent of workers are members
 of labor unions. This number includes employed and unemployed workers. Unions
 are independent of the Government but have important links with major political
 parties. The Government does not require unions to register.
 In its 1998 report, the International Labor Organization's Cdmmittee of Experts
 on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations reiterated its criticism
 that the Government should adopt legislation establishing "objective, predeter-
 mined, and detailed criteria" to enable employers' organizations and trade unions
 to have access to the National Labor Council. Because of restrictive interpretation
 of the legislation in force, only the Christian, Socialist, and Liberal trade union con-
 federations have access to the National Labor Council. However, collective bargain-
 ing on wages does not take place in the Council; it occurs at the branch and enter-
 prise levels.
 Unions have the right to strike, and strikes by civil servants and workers in "es-
 sential" services are tolerated. However, seamen, the military, the federal police,
 and magistrates have no right to strike. Even though many strikes begin as wildcat
 actions, strikers are not prosecuted for failure to observe strike procedures mutually
 agreed between employers and unions in collective bargaining agreements. Crimes
 committed during a strike action, such as causing bodily harm or damage to prop-
 erty, are clearly illegal strike methods, which the authorities prosecute.
 In February armored car drivers ended a 6-week strike that was prompted by a
 string of violent armored car robberies. The drivers went on strike in part to protest
 inadequate security. The strike ended when the Government agreed to abolish night
 shifts and provide increased security. Also in February, prison guards ended a 4-
 week strike after gaining agreement from the Government to hire additional person-
 nel, increase social benefits, and decrease overcrowding in prisons. National railway
 
 
 1165
 
 workers went on strike several times throughout the year to protest European
 Union plans to privatize national rail freight carriers. In November Brussels re-
 gional transportation employees went on a 1-day strike to force management to hire
 additional personnel andt increase annual vacation and security measures. Em-
 ployees of the Wallonia public transportation company struck several times in No-
 vember to protest a government plan to offer incentive awards to select employees.
 The International Confeatiotion of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in its 'Annual
 Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights 1998" described a continuing trend of
 using civil court rulings to end strikes. The ICFTU report stated that the rulings
 included a threats of fines against strikers. In the past, the ICFTU report noted
 that these rulings, which were made without giving a hearing to unions, called into
 question the right to strike. However, the 1998 report describes a change in ap-
 proach by some judges who reviewed past decisions and upheld the union positions.
 Unions are free to form or join federations or confederations and are free to affili-
 ate with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized, protected, and exercised freely. Every other year
 the employers' federation and the unions negotiate a nationwide collective bargain-
 ing agreement, covering 2.4 million private sector workers, that establishes the
 framework for negotiations at the plant and branch levels. In 1996 the nationwide
 collective bargaining talks failed. Following this failure, the government imposed a
 nominal 6.1 percent limit on compensation increases (including cost of living adjust-
 ment, wage increases, and job creation measures) for the 1997-98 period. In 1997
 labor negotiations at the branch level resulted in numerous agreements covering 1.5
 million private sector workers. In the fall, employers and unions agreed on a nation-
 wide collective bargaining agreement that limits compensation increases to 5.9 per-
 cent for the 1999-2000 period. The agreement covers cost of living adjustments,
 wage increases, and job creation measures.
 The law prohibits discrimination against organizers and members of unions and
 protects against the termination of contracts of members of workers' councils, mem-
 bers of health or safety committees, and shop stewards. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Effective mechanisms such as the labor courts exist for adjudicating disputes be-
 tween labor and management.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding by children, is illegal and does not occur. Domestic workers and all other
 workers have the same rights as nondomestic workers. The law prohibits forced and
 bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. The
 Government also enforces laws against those who seek to employ undocumented for-
 eign workers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children is 15, but education is compulsory until the
 age of 18. The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). Youths between the ages of 15 and 18 may
 participate in part-time work/study programs and may work full time during school
 vacations. The labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national laws and
 standards. There are no industries where any significant child labor exists.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly national minimum wage for
 workers over 21 years of age is $1,214 (44,538 BF); 18-year-olds must be paid at
 least 82-percent of the minimum, 19-year-olds 88 percent, and 20-year-olds 94 per-
 cent. The minimum wage, coupled with extensive social benefits, provides workers
 with a standard of living appropriate to a highly developed nation. Minimum wages
 in the private sector are set in biennial, nationwide collective bargaining meetings
 (see Section 6.b.), which lead to formal agreements signed in the National Labor
 Council and made mandatory by royal decree for the entire private sector. In the
 public sector, the minimum wage is determined in negotiations between the Govern-
 ment and the public service unions. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces the
 law regarding minimum wages. By law, the standard workweek cannot exceed 40
 hours and must have at least one 24-hour rest period. Many collective bargaining
 agreements set standard workweeks of 36 to 39 hours. The law requires overtime
 pay for hours worked in excess of the standard. Work done from the 9th to the 11th
 hour per day or from the 40th to the 50th hour per week is considered allowable
 overtime. Longer workdays are permitted only if agreed upon in a collective bargain-
 ing agreement. These laws and regulations are enforced effectively by the Ministry
 of Labor and the labor c ourts.
 The law calls for comprehensive provisions for worker safety. Collective bargain-
 ing agreements can supplement these laws. Workers have the right to remove them-

 selves from situations that endanger their safety or health without jeopardy to their
 continued employment, and the law protects workers who file complaints about such
 situations. The Labor Ministry implements health and safety legislation through a
 team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualify for disability and medi-
 cal benefits. The law mandates health and safety committees in companies with
 more than 50 employees. Labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national
 health and safety laws and standards.
