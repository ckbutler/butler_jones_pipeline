 BRUNEI
 Brunei Darussalam, a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of Bor-
 neo, is a sultanate ruled by the same family for 600 years.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of political power by
 former Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin to an appointed council of state, but in 1962 the
 Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency
 powers for 2 years. These powers have been regularly renewed, most recently in
 September by the current Sultan. Although not all of the articles of the Constitution
 are suspended, the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power. He
 also serves as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, dean of the national university,
 and chief religious leader.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's office and is firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei's large oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with its small population, give
 it one of the world's highest per capita gross national products.
 Human rights in Brunei remain broadly circumscribed. In practice, citizens do not
 have the right to change their government, and they generally eschew political ac-
 tivity of any kind, knowing that the Government and ruler will disapprove such ac-
 tivity and may punish them. Nor, constitutional provisions notwithstanding, do they
 genuinely exercise the freedoms of speech, press, and association. Other human
 rights abuses, including discrimination against women and restriction of religious
 freedom, continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment-
 The media occasionally report on allegations of police mistreatment of prisoners, but
 these reports cannot be verified. In 1988 caning became mandatory punishment for
 42 criminal and drug-related offenses and for vandalism. Since then, sentences of
 whipping have been handed down and carried out in the presence of a doctor who
 monitors implementation and has the authority to interrupt and postpone the pun-
 ishment for medical reasons. Reportedly, as many as 50 offenders per year are
 caned.
 Prison conditions range from fair to good. There is no overcrowding, prisoners
 usually have a cell to themselves. Prisoners receive regular medical checkups. Re-
 mand cells at police stations are Spartan but adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-While the law provides for a prompt judi-
 cial determination of the validity of an arrest, those provisions, like the Constitution
 itself, may be superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation of the emer-
 gency powers. Moreover, the Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government
 to detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government occa-
 sionally has used the ISA to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity
 but apparently did not do so in 1995. A person detained under the ISA was released
 in Apn&l 1994 following his pledge of loyalty to the Sultan.
 Police officers have broad powers to make arrests without warrants. However,
 under normal circumstances, a magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest. War-
 rants are issued without this endorsement on rare occasions, such as when police
 are unable to obtain the endorsement in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.
 Under the 1918 Banishment Act, any person deemed to be a threat to the safety,
 peace, or welfare of Brunei, may be forcibly exiled either permanently or tempo-
 
 
 rarily by the Sultan. There have been no cases of banishment of citizens in recent
 times.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution does not specifically provide for
 an independent judiciary. However, Brunei civil law, based on English common law,
 provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Shari'a (Muslim law) su-
 persedes civil law in a number of areas, including divorce, inheritance, and sexual
 crimes.
 The judicial system consists of five levels of courts, with final recourse in civil
 cases available through the Privy Council in London. In January Brunei terminated
 appeal to the Privy Council in criminal cases. Procedural safeguards include the
 right to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter, the right to a speedy trial, and
 the right to confront accusers. There were no -known instances of government inter-
 ference with the judiciary and no trials of political opponents.
 A few political prisoners, probably "returnees" (individuals who participated in the
 1962 rebellion, fled the countryv, and subsequently returned), are still in prison be-
 cause of their role in the rebellion and their alleged refusal to renounce violence and
 pledge loyalty to the Sultan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A-
 though the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons,
 families, or homes, this rarely happens. There are sporadic reports of mail having
 been opened prior to delivery.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While no law restricts freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press, the Government on a few occasions censored international
 newspapers and periodicals by removing or blacking out articles or photographs
 found to be objectionable, particularly those potentially embarrassing to Brunei's
 royal family, critical of the Government or the Sultan, or those judged sexually or
 morally improper by censors. The growing use of facsimile machines and access to
 satellite transmissions make it increasingly difficult to keep such material from en-
 tering Brunei. The independently owned local newspaper practices self-censorship
 by avoiding issues it knows the Government would object to.
 The only Brunei-based television station is government owned. Two Malaysian
 television channels are received in Brunei. A 10-channel cable network of television
 stations, which includes the Cable News Network, the British Broadcasting Cor-
 poration World News, and several entertainment channels, is widely viewed. Be-
 cause of the almost total absence of criticism or opposing views, the Government's
 tolerance of political criticism has not been effectively tested recently. In the past,
 it has not hesitated to arrest on national security grounds those who attempted to
 propagate unwelcome political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes also has not been seriously tested in recent years. Following the 1967
 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to form in 1985 and
 1986. The Government severely restricted membership in beth parties, disbanding
 one of them in 1988.
 The Brunei Solidarity National Party, which had been inactive for several years,
 held an assembly in February, reportedly with the consent of the Government.
 About 50 people attended. In May the party president resigned: in a September
 interview in a local newspaper, he said he had resigned after the Home Affairs Min-
 istry warned him not to involve himself in political activity because he is a former
 political detainee. He told the interviewer that he is seeking authorization from the
 Government to resume political activity. There has been no public party activity
 since the February assembly.
 The activities of international service organizations continue to be constrained. In
 1995 the Government reminded local leaders of these organizations that Muslims
 may not be members.
 c. Freedom   of Religion.-The Constitution states, 'The religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: provided that all other religions may be practied in peae and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darussalam." In 1991 the Govern-
 ment began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary monarchy and the observ-
 ance of traditional Bruneian and Muslim values by reasserting a national ideology
 known as the Malaya Islam Beraja (MIB) or "Malay Muslim monarchy," the genesis
 of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century.
 This reassertion of MIE has created a variety of impediments to the full and un-
 constrained exercise of religious freedom called fur in the Constitution and in the
 1993 Kuala Lumpur Declaration. The Government in 1993 participated in issuing
 the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, which confirms the right of all persons to a wide
 
 
 555
 range of human rights, including freedom of religion. Despite this, and constitu-
 tional provisions the Government routinely restricts the practice of non-Muslim re-
 ligions by: prohibitin proselytizing occasionally denying entry to foreign clergy or
 particular priests, bisnops, or ministers; banning the importation of religious teach-
 ing materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permission to expand,
 repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines. In July a foreign nun was de-
 nied admission to Brunei to attend the annual assembly of the International Con-
 ference of Education Teachers (ICET), for which she was a duly registered delegate.
 The Ministry of Education has also restricted the teaching of the history of reli-
 gion or other courses in religion in non-Islamic schools while requiring courses on
 Islam or the MIB in all schools. Only the International School, which Bruneian citi-
 zens or permanent residents generally are not permitted to attend, is exempted
 from these restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts the movement of former political prisoners
 during the first year of their release. Otherwise, it generally does not restrict free-
 dom of movement for most citizens, visitors, and permanent residents. The Govei-n-
 ment places some contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain expatriate
 employees, but this is limited to the first year of the contract. Although Brunei has
 not been willing to accept asylum seekers, it has agreed in principle, and subject
 to certain reservations, to the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted by the 1989
 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are unable to change their government through established democratic
 processes. Under the continuing state of emergency, there is no parliament, and po-
 litical authority and control rests in the hands of the ruling monarch. Individual
 citizens may seek to express their views or to influence government decisions and
 policies by petitioning the Sultan or handing him letters when he appears in public.
 The only form of popular representation lies in a traditional system of village
 chiefs who, since 1992, are elected by secret ballot by all adults. These leaders com-
 municate constituents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic
 meetings, chaired by the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by
 the Sultan.
 Substantial numbers of women serve at the junior and middle levels of Brunei's
 large government bureaucracy. Nevertheless, at higher levels of the bureaucracy a
 clear pattern of discrimination exists. Since independence, no woman has been ap-
 pointed to head a ministry, and women continue to be passed over despite the fact
 that there are by now a number of well-qualified candidates for promotion to posi-
 tions at permanent secretary and deputy minister levels. A woman now serves as
 an intermediate court judge, the highest judicial position held by Bruneians.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations that deal specifically with the
 protection of human rights. Given the tight restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press and the Government's unwillingness to tolerate criticism, any group or indi-
 vidual attempting to investigate and report publicly on human rights issues would
 face severe constraints. There were no known allegations of abuses or requests to
 visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except for religion (see Section 2.c.), the Constitution does not contain specific
 provisions prohibiting discrimination based on the factors listed above.
 Women.-The extent to which spousal abuse may occur and go unreported is not
 known. However, in response to a growing perception that domestic violence is a se-
 rious problem, the police established a special unit to investigate allegations of
 spousal abuse in October 1994. Approximately 16 cases of domestic abuse were re-
 ported topolice in the first half of 1995. The Government has established a shelter
 or abuse women, and reportedly there were four residents there in 1995. In Janu-
 ary the Government initiated a well-publicized telephone "hot line" to report abus-
 ers.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a
 fine. An assault resulting in serious injury would be punished by caning and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 While the level of violence in Bruneian society is low, beating of servants--or refus-
 ing them the right to leave the house on days off, sometimes on grounds that they
 
 
 556
 "might encounter the wrong company-is less socially unacceptable behavior. Since
 most female domestics are foreign workers who are highy dependent on their em-
 ployers, those subject to abuse may be unwilling or unable to bring complaints ei-
 ther to Bruneian authorities or to their governments' embassies in Brunei. Wien
 such complaints are brought, however, the Government is generally quick to inves-
 tigate allegations of abuse and impose fines and punishment as warranted.
 1n accordance with Koranic precepts, women are denied equal status with men
 in a number of important areas, such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of cli-
 dren. Under the Brnei Nationality Act, citizenship is passed on through males
 only. Female citizens who are married to foreider or bear children by foreign fa-
 thers cannot pass on Bruneian citizenship to their children, even when such chil-
 dren are brn in Brunei. This has resulted in creation of a sizable population of
 stateless children, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who are entitled to live
 in Bruni and be documented for travel by the Government, but who cannot enjoy
 the full privileges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are ehigible for permanent positions im government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do not have university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-to-month positions
 continue to receive slightly less annual leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterarts in permanent positions.
 Religious authonities strongly encourage Brnei Muslim women to wear the
 tudong, a traditional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women
 do not, howevrt and there is no official pressure on non-Muslim women to do so.
 All female students in government-operated schools are required to wear the
 tudong, however, while students in nongovernment schools are officially encouraged
 to wear it.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women, and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. Women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in the armed forces, although they may not serve in combat. The
 number of female university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of
 Brnnei University's entering class is female.
 Children.-There are no published statistics regarding the welfare of children.
 The strong commitment to family values within society, the high standard of living,
 and government funding for children's welfare provides most children a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas, nutritional standards are high, and poverty is almost unknown. There
 were 18 reported cases of child abuse in the first half of 1995.
 People With Disabiities.-While no legislation mandates accessibility or other as-
 sistance to disabled persons, they are well integrated into Brunei society and the
 workplace, due mainly to past and ongoing efforts of the Government and non-
 governmental organizations to raise public consciousness.
 Indigenous People.-The 6 percent of Brunei's population that is composed of in-
 digenous peoples has long been integrated into Bruneian society, and enjoys the
 same rights as other citizens.
 National/IRacial/Et hnic Minorities.--Some members of non-Malay minorities,
 such as ethnic Chinese, including those brn and raised in Brunei, are not automati-
 cally accorded citizenship and must travel abroad as stateless persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brnei but must _be re-
 istered with the Government. There are three generally inactive registered trae
 unions, all of them in the oil sector, with a total membership amounting to less than
 5 percent of that industry's work force. All workers, including civil servants, other
 than those serving in the military and police, may form or join trade unions. Unions
 are independent of the Government. The Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the for-
 mation of trade union federations in Brunei but forbids affiiation with labor organi-
 zations outside Brunei. An individual contract is required between an employer and
 each employee, but legal trade union activities cannot be deemed to violate em-
 ployee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this provision as conferring the right
 to strike, but there have been no strikes. Brunei is not a member of the Inter-
 national Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to ranize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employment
 or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or nonmembership
 in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions in Brunei
 are not conducive to the development of trade unions. There is little interest on the
 
 
 art of workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not very active.
 runei law is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few industries.
 There are few industries of the kind in which unions have traditionally developed.
 Also, cultural tradition favors consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit pack-
 ages are based on market conditions and tend to be generous.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Chapter XI of the Labor Enact-
 ment Laws of 1954 prohibits employment of children below the age of 16. Parental
 consent and approval by the Labor Commission is required for those below the age
 of 18. Women under ae 18 may not work at night or on offshore oil platforms. The
 Department of Labor (DOL), which is a part of the Ministry of Home Affairs effec-
 tively enforces laws on the employment of children. There were no reports of viola-
 tions of the child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens to command good salaries. There is no minimum wage.
 The standard workweek is Monday through Thursday and Saturday, with Friday
 and Sunday off, allowing for two 24-hour rest periods each week. Overtime is paid
 for work in excess of 48 nours a week, and double time is paid for work performed
 on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety standards are established by gov-
 ernment regulations. The DOL inspects working conditions on a routine basis and
 in response to complaints. The DOL generally enforces labor regulations effectively.
 However, in the unskilled labor sector enforcement is lax, especially for foreign la-
 borers. The DOL is empowered to close any workplace where health, safety, or
 working conditions are unsatisfactory, and it has done so in the past.
