 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The Federil Republic of dermany (FRG) is a constitutional
 republic and parliamentary democracy. National power is
 divided among executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
 The head of the Federal Government, thq Chancellor, is elected
 by'the-Bundestg, the lower house of Parliament. The powers
 of-the Chancellor and of the Parliament, which are substantial,
 areset dowi"in:the Basic Law (constitution). -There is a
 division of governmental authority between national and state
 governmentse The latter retain significant  utonomy,
 especiallf-iflatiers relating to law-enforcmcnnt and the
 courts;/cultufe and education, the environment, and-social
 assisE ance?'
 Organized essentially at the-state (land) level and operating
 under the direction of state governments, well-trained and
 disciplined 'police sdrupulously r X9ect citizens' rights, as
 well as those of other persons resident in the FRG to the
 extent they are protected by'law. In dealing with hostile
 elements, including terrorists, special care is taken to
 respe~t*'the-rights 6f the accused.
 The-industrialized bconomy of the FRG provides 6ne of the
 highest standards of living in the world.
 The foiindati6n of the'Basic'Law, adopted in 1949, rests firmly
 on the principles of liberty, equality, -and the free exercise
 of individual rights. The "basic rights" enumerated in that
 documehi axe theoretically subject'to interference only on the
 basis ot alaw, ind in practice these human rights are
 scrupulously protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUiiA RIGHTS -
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other' xtrajudicial Killing
 PolitiCally motivated -killinfg by the Government or by
 mainfitredmfapolitica1fotganizations is unknown. Teriorist
 groups on the far-left (the Red Army Frakfioh--RAF), the far
 right-(neo-Nazi groups), and Middle Eastern terrorists
 continue to engage'in pbl~tbal violence.
 b. Ditappearande
 Govehental- or police autori1ies do not abddct, secretly'
 arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police-authorities do not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, noT do they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment. Use of excessive force -against pridbners or
 detainees is not legally sanctioned or'officially encouraged.
 On the rare occasions when it occurs, it is subject to
 impartial invesfigation and legal sanction.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest , Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested in the FRG except on'the basis'of an
 arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial authority. Any
 person detained by the police'must be brought before a judge
 
 
 1128
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 and charged no later than the day following the day of
 apprehension. The court must then issue an arrest warrant
 with stated reasons or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention in the normal sense. The
 law, however, provides that a prisoner may .be held in custody
 (but no longer than 24 hours) while awaiting a formal charge
 if there is evidence that he might seek to flee the country to
 avoid prosecution. The right of free access to legal counsel
 has been restricted only in the cases of some terrorists who
 have used contacts with lawyers to promote and continue
 terrorist activity even while in prison. Only judges may
 decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail
 bond exists in the FRG but is seldom employed. There is no
 exile.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due process and
 prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both
 government interference and intimidation by terrorists. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 or monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after
 authorization by a court order.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, an independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press.
 Criticism of the Government is unrestricted. The media and
 artistic works are not censored. Academic freedom is
 complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic
 books. Newspapers and magazines are privately owned.
 Radio and television networks and stations function, for the
 most part, as corporations under special public laws. They
 are governed by independent boards made up of representatives
 of churches, political parties, and other organizations.
 A few experimental private television cable stations and local
 television cable networks have been set up. Legislation has
 been enacted in all states except Bremen and Hesse to
 facilitate and encourage private television stations using
 cable, satellites, and other "new" media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits
 beforehand and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the
 repair of any damage to public facilities. When demonstrators
 
 
 1129
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 -have not obtained the required permits, police have exercised
 considerable restraint, showing concern primarily for the
 continued functioning of public facilities and for the safety
 of Ihe genr.al public.
 Mei  rship in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 incl ding pplitical parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 _to 'be "findamentally antidemocratic" may be outlawed. Under
 "this-cohstlutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court in the 1950's declared both a neo-Nazi
 and 'a Communist party to be illegal.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 lak6r unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. 'Freedom of Religion
 The full rractice of religion is allowed. Major religious
 groifps participate in a state-administered church tax system.
 The Governmebt .subsidizes. hurch-affiliated schools and
 providestreligiou  instruction in schools and universities for
 Protest _ts, Catholics, and members of the Jewish community.
 The majQi religious groupings are active in FRG public
 polittC!l debates. Political parties are legally barred from
 reftii4ig members on the basis of religion.
 d.'" Freedom of Movement Within the'Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Gepmanitizen  are. free, t9'mve a'nywhere within the country
 61d Vt-'eave- ad return at any time.  The Basic Law provides
 that Germans who arrive in the Fedeial 'epublic from the
 German Democratic Republic (GDR), as well as from Eastern
 Europe ind the Soviet Union, are treated as German citizens
 and therefoke may take up residence without restrictions.
 Contin-uihg a trend begun 'in 1986., the number of ethnic Germans
 from Eastern Eur6p.e coming to'settle in. the FRG grew steadily.
 By June-, early 152,000 had come, including nearly 100,000
 from Poland, 41,000 from the Soviet Union, and 11,000 from
 Romania. In addition, nearly 56,000 Germans from the GDR had
 arrived by Jiy 31.  With the opening of the Hungarian-
 Austrian border in September and unimpeded travel to the FRG
 through Czechoslovakia in November, the number of East German
 refugees increased dramatically to an official total of
 343,854 by year's end.
 The right'of alylum of those who are politically persecuted is
 also guaranteed by the Basic Law and respected in practice.
 By August, the total number of asylum seekers in the FRG was
 estimated to be 800,000, with Poles, Yugoslavs, and Turks the
 three largest groups.
 Once formally granted asylum status, and to a lesser extent-
 while being processed, asylees hbve essentially the same
 access to social welfare benefits as German citizens. Short
 of'the right to vote, they _njoy complete civil rights. While
 onlj &bout 10 percent of'the asylum seekers are successful
 with theit requests for'political asylum, denial of political
 asylum does not automatically result in deportation. Eighty
 percent of those whose petitions are denied are typically
 allowed to remain in the country for other, humanitarian
 reasons. Persons from Eastern"European countries are normally
 allgwed'to remain whether or not official asylum status is
 granted. -Extraditions have been extremely rare.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the parliamentary democracy established by the Basic
 Law, the FRG is ruled by a government chosen by the people
 through orderly elections based on universal adult suffrage.
 The Bundestag (lower house) is elected through a mixture of
 direct constituency candidates and party lists. Members of
 the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, are appointed by
 the state governments. Around 87 percent of voters normally
 participate in national elections, but local contests attract
 significantly lower participation.
 Candidates for public office are usually members of political
 parties but are not required to be. New political parties are
 free to form and enter the political process, but the Basic
 Law and the state constitutions stipulate that parties must
 achieve at least 5 percent of the total vote in order to be
 represented in the Federal and state Parliaments. The FRG has
 been ruled since its creation by governments'headed by one of
 the two major parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or
 the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The current Government is
 led by a coalition of the CDU joined by its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free
 Democratic Party (FDP). The SPD and the Greens, a party
 represented in the Bundestag since the elections of March
 1983, comprise the opposition. Although party discipline
 plays an important role, voting on issues in the Bundestag is
 ultimately a matter of individual decision.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 -'here were no allegations ofvilations of human rights in
 1989. A number of human rights.organizations, both
 international and local, freely conduct their activities in
 the Federal Republic. The Government considers the
 international promotion of human rights one of its highest
 priorities.
 Section S Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal and relatively little de facto
 discrimination in the availability of shelter, health care,
 and education to all inhabitants, regardless of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or
 citizenship.
 Due to increased unemployment, the Government has pursued a
 three-pronged policy with regard to foreign workers:
 integration of longtime residents, limitation of further
 entries, and repatriation aid for those willing to return to
 their home countries. At the end of June, foreign workers
 totalled 1.592 million, or 5.8 percent of the work force, and
 36 percent were organized in trade unions. A national debate
 has been under way over whether the rights of guest workers
 should be broadened to permit unlimited residence and the
 right to vote or reduced by limiting the right of entry for
 dependent children.
 Since the passage of an equal employment rights law in 1982,
 women are guaranteed equal employment at the workplace. They
 are increasingly rising to management and leadership positions
 
 
 1131
 FEDRAL REPUBLIC OF GERMAWY
 in the private and public sectors.' Protective legislation
 bars women from working in certain heavy industrial occupations
 and alsb geherally bans night work. Young women experience
 drfficulties 'in gaining access-to training in some
 traditfibnally mafe fields. Recent court rulings and government
 pilot programs, however; have helped break down some of these
 attitudinal and institutional barriers. Women enjoy full and
 equal-protection under-the law  including property and
 Inhe'ittnce'tights. Consistent with the special status which
 mothers bbi-by-pursuant to the terms of the Basic Law, the
 Government progides financial bezefits for mothers, including
 maternity- lave'and child allowances. There are several
 active womenvb rights-groups.
 Viorence agdinst women is acknowledged, and the women's
 movement has urged public ai~cussion of the problem and
 tougher'penbltids'for crimes against women. Reliable figures
 concbrtning domestic vibletce,"including wife beating, are not
 available. Women's groups have taken'the lead in calling for
 tougher punishment for'domest'i violence and other crimes
 against women. They have also sponsored the creation of a
 number of refuges for women who are victims of such violence.
 These refuges receive support at the state and local level
 varying from 100 percent of expenses in Berlin and Hamburg to
 more limited -eupiort-int'other states. According to the
 Interior Ministry, the official number of rape cases reported
 in 1988 fell to 5,251, the lowest level since 1958. In a
 parliamentary speech in My,' the CDU Minister for Youth,
 Family, Women, and Health referred to a recent study by the
 Allensbach Public Opinion Research Institute which said rape
 occursa'at least onci in every fifth marriage. Claims by some--
 women's boganizations that,many-rapes are not reported and
 that rabe in marriage is serious enough to require making it a
 punishable'obffense have s6 far'not persuaded legislatois to
 make' arital 'rape a punishable offense.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The~right to associate: freely, choose representatives,
 deterfaine programs and policies to represent members'
 interests;-hnd to 'publicize vietis is recognized'and exercised
 freely.' 'The right to strike is guaranteed by law, except for
 civil 'servants and personnel in sensitive positions, such as
 members' of the armied forces. 'Strikes occurred in 1989,
 notably In the ptifting industry'and in the retail trade; in
 which work time Teduction was one of several issues.
 The country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, with about 41 percent of the eligible work force �
 unionized. The German Trade'Union Federation represents over
 83 percent of organized workers. Reborn in the wake of World
 War II, the unions are particularly conscious of their historic
 role as the protector of worker rights and a bulwark of the
 democratic system. In order to avoid the political divisions
 which plagued the post-World War I labor movement, the unions
 adopted the principle of a "unified union," independent of any
 political party but in which the two major parties are
 represented. They actively participate in the International
 Labor Organization and in international and European trade
 union organizations.

 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 by law and is widely practiced. Each year approximately 7,000
 contracts are renegotiated, affecting some 20 million workers,
 or 90 percent of the dependent work force.
 No government mechanism to promote voluntary worker-employer
 negotiations is required because of a well-developed system of
 autonomous contract negotiations. There is a two-tiered
 bargaining system, whereby basic wages and conditions are
 established at the industry level and then adapted to the
 circumstances prevailing in particular enterprises through
 local negotiations. A distinguishing characteristic of FRG
 izdustrial relations is the legally mandated system of works
 councils which provide a permanent forum for continuing
 selective worker participation in the management of the
 enterprise. Workers are fully protected against antiunion
 discrimination, and there is a well-developed labor court
 :-system to process complaints. There are no export processing'
 or free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is barred by the Constitution and
 is nonexistent in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under age 15 with a few exceptions: children aged 13 and 14
 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver
 newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; children aged 3 through
 14 may take part in cultural-performances under stringent
 conditions with regard to number of hours, time of day, and
 form of activity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 While thers is no legal minimum wage, minimum wages are set by
 contract within each industry sector. At the lower end of the
 minimum wage scale is the $5.40 per hour wage (at current
 exchange rates) for agricultural workers. Such minimum wage
 levels provide an adequate standard of fiving for workers and
 their families. The'number of hours of work per week is
 regulated by contracts which directly-or indirectly affect 80
 percent of the working population. Negotiation of a 35-hour
 workweek is a major goal of FRG unions. The average workweek
 is nearly 39 hours. Federal legislation sets occupational
 safety and health standards. For each occupation, there is a
 comprehensive system of worker insurance carriers who enforce
 requirements for safety in the workplace.
