 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa's governing institutions and society continued to consolidate the
 democratic transformation initiated by the historic 1994 national elections. Areas
 where local elections had been postponed in late 1995 held peaceful polls to select
 local councilors in mid-1996. The Government of National Unity, comprising min-
 isters from the African National Congress (ANC), the National P y (NP), and the
 Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) functioned successfully through the first half of the
 year, with the NP voluntarily deciding to withdraw from both national and provin-
 cial executive branches on June 30. With the withdrawal of the NP, the Parliament
 took on an even more central role in the national debate. In addition to the 3 major
 parties, the 400-member National Assembly includes the Democratic Party (DP), the
 Freedom Front (FF), the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and the African Christian
 Democratic Party (ACDP). The Government continues to operate under an Interim
 Constitution. However, following year-long negotiations in the Constitutional As-
 sembly (the National Assembly and Senate sitting jointly), the Constitutional Court
 certified a revised draft Constitution as complying with the Interim Constitution's
 required 34 principles. President Mandela signed the new Constitution into law on
 December 10 and it is scheduled to come into effect in February 1997. The judiciary,
 including the Constitutional Court, is independent.
 The South African Police Service (SAPS) has primary responsibility for internal
 security, although the Government continues to call on the South African National
 Defense Force (SANDF) to provide support for the SAPS in internal security situa-
 tions. The Deputy Defense Minister stated in August that at least 8,000 SANDF
 troops are deployed daily in support of the SAPS countrywide. The SAPS is under-
 going a major restructuring and transformation from a primarily public order secu-
 rity force largely dedicated to enforcing apartheid laws to a more accountable, com-
 munity service oriented police force. The SANDF and the newly created SAPS bor-
 der control and policing unit share responsibility for external security. The civilian
 authorities maintain effective control of the security forces. However, some members
 of these forces committed human rights abuses.
 South Africa has a diversified and productive economy with strong agricultural,
 mining, and industrial sectors. In 1995 the manufacturing sector accounted for 24.3
 percent of the gross domestic product valued at $105  bi lion. The inequality of op-
 portunity and the skewed government spending of the apartheid era have resulted
 in widespread illiteracy, high unemployment, a lack of adequate health care, and
 other socioeconomic ills among the black majority population. Official unemploy-
 ment rates for the formal sector fluctuate between 32 and 40 percent. Over 60 per-
 cent of the black population is either unemployed, underemployed, or working in the
 informal sector. Although the Government is working hard to redress the gross in-
 equities of the economy through the promotion of small, medium, and microenter-
 rises and by attracting large levels of foreign direct investment, the socioeconomic
 legacy of apartheid is expected to remain a problem for many years.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the laws
 and newly independent judiciy provide an effective means of dealing with in-
 stances of individual abuses. Some members of the security forces committed human
 rights abuses, including use of excessive force during arrest, torture, and other
 physical abuse. Deaths in police custody remain a problem. The Government has
 taken action to investigate and punish some of those involved. The judiciary is over-
 
 
 255
 
 burdened, and lengthy delays in trials are a problem. Discrimination against women
 and the disabled continued. Violence against women and children remains a serious
 problem. Although there were still hundreds of political and extrajudicial killings,
 political violence continued to decrease, bath in KwaZulu/Natal and countrywide.
 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), created to investigate apartheid-
 era human rights abuses, compensate victims, and grant amnesty for full disclosure
 of politically motivated crimes, began intensive rounds of hearings in April, which
 continued through the end of the year. Parliament continued to revise or repeal dis-
 criminatory legislation, and it passed an Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights
 Act. A new labor relations regime was adopted that improves the climate for worker
 rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Deaths in police custody remain a
 problem. There were at least 32 deaths in custody during the year, although final
 statistics were not available. A number of cases of deaths in police custody are
 under investigation by the authorities. Deaths due to use of excessive force during
 apprehensions are a serious problem.
 The number of political and extrajudicial killings continued to decrease in 1996,
 following the general trend after the April 1994 national elections. The Human
 Rights Commission (HRC) reported that political violence resulted in 970 deaths in
 the first 11 months of 1996, compared with 1,296 for the same period in 1995. The
 South African Institute for Race Relations (SAIRR) reported 683 politically moti-
 vated killings in the first 11 months of 1996, compared with 1,044 for the same pe-
 riod in 1995.
 Beginning shortly before the peaceful community elections in KwaZulu/Natal in
 June, IFP and ANC leaders and grassroots supporters intensified their efforts to
 promote the fledgling provincial peace proess. Reputed warlords from both parties
 held oint rallies in the Natal midlands to promote tolerance, and a joint IFP-ANC
 provincial commission is working on guide lines for free political campaigning. The
 increased emphasis on peace is reflected in the continued fall in the number of po-
 litically motivated killings in KwaZulu/Natal. The HRC reports that politically moti-
 vated killings in the province fell to an average of 41 per month tough August,
 compared with an average of 67 per month in 1995. One of the most egregious ex-
 amples of political violence was the murder of Zulu Princess Nonhlanhla m April,
 in an attack on a royal palace in which Zulu Queen Buhe and Princess Sibusile
 Zulu were badly injured. The police have made arrests in the case. On March 22,
 11 bodies were found in KwaZulu/Natal's south midlands and an additional 6 people
 were killed in another incident.
 Vigilante action and mob justice were problems. People Against Gangsterism and
 Drugs (PAGAD), a community-based organization caln g for stronger action by the
 Government and police against crime and drugs, engage in acts of intimidation and
 violence against suspected drug dealers and gang leaders. In one incident in Cape
 Town in August, an anvi PAGAD crowd shot and burned to death alleged drug
 dealer and gang leader Rash ad Staggie in the presence of police. The Government
 condemned the action and subsequent PAGAD violence, and it has taken steps to
 arrest some of those who participated in the violence. Several PAGA]) leaders were
 subsequently taken into custody for violating their bail conditions during ongoing
 judicial investigations.
 Three people were arrested for the 1987 murder of Zazi Kuzways. In Johannes-
 burg eight persons standing in a line of job seekers outside a plant were shot and
 killed by unknown assailants.
 There were a number of killrns due to factional fights between either political
 or ethnic groups, many of them in and around mining operations. For example in
 September, 21 miners were killed at a mine as a result of factional fighting between
 Xhosa and Sotho. Over 30 squatters were killed in factional clashes near a platinum
 mine in Northwest province.
 There were occasional reports of killings linked to the continued practice of witch-
 craft in some rural areas. In the Northern province, where traditional beliefs re-
 garding witchcraft remain strong, officials reported dozens of killings of people sus-
 pected of witchcraft. The Government has instituted educational programs to pre-
 vent such actions.
 The TRC's investigative unit i looking into a number of cases of alleged political
 or extrajudicial killings committed in previous years that have been brought to its
 attention through TRChearngs. Also, special police investigative teams continue to
 make arrests in the cases of the 1995 Christmas season massacres.
 
 
 In March the Rand Supreme Court found nine members of the Afrikaner
 Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) guilty of murder charges in connection with the April
 1994 preelection bombing campaign. Another 13 AWB members were convicted of
 lesser charges (possessing arms and explosives), and 4 were acquitted.
 A resurgence of violence attributed to extreme right Afrikaner nationalist groups
 occurred late in the year. A previously unknown group calling itself the "Boere At-
 tack Troops" claimed responsibility for a Christmas Eve bombing in the Western
 Cape town of Worcester that resulted in four deaths.
 In August retired SAP Colonel Eugene de Kock, who commanded a police unit al-
 legedly used for "third force" activities, was found guilty on 89 charges, including
 6 murder charges, and sentenced in October to 2 life sentences plus an additional
 212 years' imprisonment. De Kock is in the process of applying for amnesty from
 the TRC.
 On October 11, a court acquitted former Defense Minister Magnus Malan of mur-
 der and conspiracy charges. Fourteen other defendants were acquitted, including 6
 Zulu policemen acquitted a day earlier. The State had charged General Malan and
 the others with involvement in the January 1987 murder of 13 people at
 Kwamakhuta, near Durban.
 No charges have been filed to date in the case of the 1994 assassination of former
 Dutch Reformed Church moderator Johan Heyns; this situation is unlikely to
 change. Five men were arrested in the 1981 murder of Griffiths Mxenge. Their trial
 was postponed until April 1997, pending amnesty hearings involving at least three
 of the accused.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances caused by government authorities or agents. Starting in April the TRC heard
 public testimony regarding numerous politically motivated disappearances between
 1960 and 1993. Investigations into a number of these disappearances were subse-
 quently begun by the TRC's investigative unit, as well as by the relevant provincial
 attorney general in some cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Interim Constitution stipulates that "no person shall be subject to torture of
 any kind, whether physical, mental, or emotional, nor shall any person be subject
 to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." Some members of the
 police used excessive force and tortured and otherwise abused suspects and detain-
 ees. However, broad efforts to reform police practices have substantially reduced
 such activities.
 Monitoring organizations continued to make credible reports of police abuse of de-
 tainees while in custody, including beatings, suffocation with rubber tubing, electric
 shock, and rape. In August an attorney was appointed Executive Director of the
 Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD). The ICD is a civilian channel for com-
 plaints operating separately from the SAPS. It investigates allegations of mis-
 conduct and corruption by members of the police. Also, several human rights edu-
 cation programs for the SAPS were conducted by nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's).
 The SAPS has continued to undergo sweeping, positive changes, including the in-
 stitution of reforms designed to create partnerships between local police forces and
 the communities they serve. Resignations and retirements of senior police officials
 have permitted the infusion of new personnel at senior levels, from both inside and
 outside the SAPS, and these appointments have also served to further affirmative
 action within the SAPS.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, including visits by human
 rights organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Interim Constitution expressly pro-
 hibits detention without trial. It also provides that every detained person has a
 number of other rights, including the right to be informed promptly of the reasons
 for detention; to be charged within 48 hours of arrest; to be detained in conditions
 of human dignity; to consult with legal counsel at every stage of the legal process;
 to communicate with relatives, medical practitioners, and religious counselors; and
 to be released with or without bail, unless the interests of justice require otherwise.
 Courts and police generally acted in good faith to respect these rights, although
 there was a growing problem with bringing detained persons to trial in a prompt
 fashion. According to the HRC, prisoners wait on average for 6 months to be tried,
 although in extreme cases this can extend up to 2 years. This problem is due in
 large measure to the overburdened judiciary, which has more cases than it can han-
 dle efficiently, and insufficient staff and resources.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 
 
 257
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Interim Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent and impartial judiciary subject only to the Constitution and the law, and
 the Government respects this provision in practice. The independence and impartial-
 ity of the judiciary were underscored by the Constitutional Court's September 6 de-
 cision to decline to certify the new draft constitution (see Section 3).
 While the precise relationship between the Constitutional Court and the Appellate
 Division of the Supreme Court (which was formerly the country's supreme judicial
 body) remains unclear, the Interim Constitution makes the former the highest court
 for interpreting constitutional issues; the latter remains supreme in all others.
 Judges try criminal cases. The jury system was abolished in 1969. Serious of-
 fenses are tried in the Supreme Court, while magistrates hear lesser offenses. The
 presiding judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence.
 The Interim Constitution's section on fundamental rights provides for due process,
 including the right to a fair, public tral within a reasonable time of being charged
 and the right to appeal to a higher court. It also gives detained persons a right to
 state-funded legal counsel when "substantial injustice would otherwise result."
 The Government and legal bodies have actedto redress historic racial and gender
 imbalances in the judiciary and the bar. The ranks of judges, magistrates, senior
 counsels, and attorneys are now more reflective of society, although still far short
 of a representative composition.
 Byyear's end approximately 4,000 written aplications for amnesty had been re-
 ceived by the TRC, of which about half were fom those already incarcerated for
 crimes which they claim were committed for political reasons. On Auust 29, the
 TRC granted its cost amnesty to two men convicted of killing Glad Mokgatle, an
 ally of Bophuthatswana strongman Lucas Mangope, ruling that their actions fit the
 required definition of a political crime. The two were released on August 30.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The In-
 terim Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally re-
 spect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 A Constitutional Land Court was established to adudicate, among other matters,
 claims of persons dispossessed and removed from land during the apartheid era.
 Several thousand land claims have already been lodged with the Commission on
 Restitution of Land Rights, which has been set up to process, investigate, and at-
 tempt to settle claims.e Commission's decisions are to be refred to the Court
 for approval, and complex claims are to be heard and decided by the Court. The
 Court has the power to order the State to compensate victims or to exproriate their
 former land. The revised deadline for lodging claims is April 1998, and the Court
 must complete its work within 5 years.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. These rights
 can, however, be limited by general law under some circumstances. Coverage of
 news and expression of opinion is vigorous and unfettered. Self-censorship is not a
 serious problem. While most major broadcast media are still state-owned, their edi-
 torial independence apmrs genuine and the Government is taking steps to end its
 broadcast monopoly. The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) controls
 all broadcast television and most radio. Once seen as the Government's voice, the
 SABC is in the midst of an historic reorganization and change of direction. SAB
 news programming offered balanced coverage of the Government and the leading op-
 position parties, although the smaller opposition parties regularly complained of in-
 sufficient coverage of their activities.
 The work of the Independent Broadcast Authority (IBA) is contributing to major
 changes in the electronic media. The IBA granted 81 licenses for community radio
 broadcasters d laapproximately 60 of these small, not-for-profit stations were broad-
 casting in 1996. The IBA also held hearings on issuance of eight commercial licenses
 and the sale of six SAB radio stations to private investors. Although some parties
 (notably potential commercial broadcasters) have complained about the slow
 progress, the IBA's work has begun to bring real competition to the country's air-
 waves for the first time.
 Several laws remained in effect that permit the Government to restrict the publi-
 cation of information about the police, the national defense forces, prisons, and men-
 tal insti ons. While these laws were not often employed, they remained a genuine
 threat to freedom of the press. In August the Attorney Gneral of the Western Cape
 province invoked the Criminal Procedure Act in an effort to compel journalists to
 turn over all written and graphic material related to an episode of gang violence.
 Editors were threatened with subpoenas but refused t ton over any materials.
 Through reporting and editorials, journalists publicized the threat and argued that
 
 
 258
 the media could not become agents of the police. The Attorney General backed
 down, but the incident demonstrated the media's vulnerability to such laws.
 Similar events in Cape Town also brought threats to the media from members of
 the community action organization PAGAD (see Section L.a.). Journalists who cov-
 ered the mob murder of a reputed drug dealer by PAGAD members were threatened
 with death if they made their notes or graphic materials available to the police.
 In October the newly formed South African Editors' Forum criticized President
 Mandela for an attack on black journalists. Mandela had complained that black
 journalists were unfairly criticizing the Government in order to please white press
 owners.
 The South African Board of Censors reviews and passes judgment on written and
 graphic materials published in or imported into the country. The Board of Censors
 has the power to edit or ban books, magazines, movies, and videos. It regularly exer-
 cises that power.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Interim Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and of association, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. Political parties and organizations operate freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Interim Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Interim Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice.
 In January the Government formally acceded to the 1951 United Nations Conven-
 tion Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In July South Africa
 signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) on standardization of regional refugee policies, which is designed to
 shift more responsibility for handling refugee flows onto first- asylum countries in
 the region.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum, granting appli-
 cants the right to work and study. Over 16,000 asylum seekers were registered by
 the Government in 1996. In May the Government and the UNHCR completed the
 Mozambican repatriation program. About 70 percent of the tens of thousands of ille-
 gal immigrants deported during the year came from Mozambique. Despite numerous
 procedural safeguards, energetic efforts to combat a mounting illegal immigration
 problem sometimes resulted in wrongful deportations.
 Parliament passed an amnesty bill in June permitting certain illegal aliens who
 have lived in South Africa for 5 years or more to become legal residents. Despite
 predictions that up to a million of the estimated 5 million illegal aliens in the coun-
 try would apply for the amnesty, by year's end only about 10,000 had taken advan-
 tage of the measure.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government in 1994 elections that
 international observers deemed to be substantially free and fair. The country contin-
 ued to be governed pursuant to an Interim Constitution that provides for a bi-
 cameral parliament, an executive state president, and an independent judiciary, in-
 cluding a constitutional court. The Parliament comprises the National Assembly
 (400 members elected by proportional lists) and the Senate (90 members, 10 from
 each province, elected by the provincial parliaments). The two houses are generally
 coequal. Seven parties are represented in the Assembly, with the African National
 Congress, the National Party, and the Inkatha Freedom Party holding the majority
 of the seats (252, 82, and 43 respectively). All citizens over 18 years of age are per-
 mitted to vote in elections.
 Until the National Party withdrew from the Government on June 30, these three
 parties shared executive power in a Government of National Unity (GNU) under the
 nterim Constitution. The Interim Constitution provides for an executive deputy
 president from any party garnering more than 20 percent of the total vote. Thus,
 in addition to President Nelson Mandela, who is the Executive Head of State, South
 Africa had two Executive Deputy Presidents, Thabo Mbeki from the ANC and F. W.
 de Klerk (the former State President) from the NP. This arrangement was altered
 on June 30, when the National Party voluntarily withdrew from the GNU, de Klerk
 relinquished his deputy presidency, and only the ANC and the IFP were left in the
 executive branch. Mbeki became the sole Executive Deputy President. The ANC
 filled 24 of the 27 cabinet positions.
 
 
 According to the Interim Constitution, the Constitutional Assembly (CA) was re-
 quired to draft and approve a permanent constitution by May 9. The draft was re-
 quired to comply with 34 constitutional principles spelled out in the Interim Con-
 stitution. On May 8, the CA (minus the IFP, which walked out of constitutional ne-
 gotiations in February 1995) approved a document, which was referred to the Con-
 stitutional Court. Hearings were held in July, and on September 6 the court re-
 ferred the document back to the CA, citing seven provisions and one whole chapter
 that did not comply with the principles. Following intensive negotiations in Septem-
 ber and October, the CA submitted a revised draft, which was certified by the Con-
 stitutional Court on December 2. President Mandela signed the new Constitution
 into law on December 10.
 In addition to certification of the new Constitution, the Constitutional Court also
 has the responsibility to interpret, defend, and enforce the Constitution. The Court
 has the power to overturn any law or executive act that it deems unconstitutional.
 The Interim Constitution also provides that the Court protect over 25 fundamental
 rights of citizens, pending entry into force of the new Constitution.
 local councils elected in November 1995 were in place in seven of South Africa's
 nine provinces (and in some areas of the Western Cape) throughout 1996. Disputes
 that had delayed local polls in parts of the Western Cape and KwaZulu/Natal were
 successfully resolved, and peaceful elections were held in those provinces on May
 29 and June 26 respectively.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. Over one-fourth of the National Assembly members are women, women won 20
 percent of the Senate seats in the 1994 elections, women chair approximately one-
 quarter of the 60 National Assembly committees, and women fill oth the Speaker
 and Deputy Speaker positions in the National Assembly. In the Cabinet, female rep-
 resentation increased somewhat in 1996. Women hold 4 of 27 ministerial positions,
 as well as 8 deputy ministerial slots.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. Many organizations now
 parti~cipate in governmental bodies seeking to gather pubic input and to fashion
 policies related to human rights.
 During 1996 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was constituted and began
 its work. Under the 1995 enabling legislation, the TRC is empowered: To look into
 apartheid-era gross human rights abuses committed between 1960 and 1993; to
 grant amnesty to perpetrators of a broad range of politically motivated crimes; and
 to recommend compensation for victims of human rights abuses. The TRC began
 public hearings into human rights abuses in April, and held its first amnesty hear-
 ings in May. By year's end, thousands of statements from victims of human rights
 abuses had been received by the TRC, and hearings held throughout the country.
 Approximately 4,000 amnesty applications had also been submitted.
 President Mandela announced on December 13 that the deadline for submitting
 amnesty applications to the TRC would be extended from December 14, 1996 to May
 10, 1997. Mandela also said that he would request that the National Assembly ex-
 tend the amnesty period cutoff date from December 6, 1993 to May 10, 1994 (the
 date on which Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's first democratically elect-
 ed president). The TRC had strongly urged Mandela to extend both deadlines, argu-
 ing that the extensions would encourage additional perpetrators to apply for am-
 nesty.
 In their institutional testimony before the TRC, both former government and lib-
 eration movement representatives conceded that human rights abuses had been
 committed by individuals acting on their own, but denied that abuses had been au-
 thorized at the highest levels. Investigations into these statements continued at
 year's end.
 TRC officials emphasized throughout the year that the Commission's mandate is
 to investigate human rights abuses committed by all parties, and that all parties
 are bound by the legislation's amnesty provisions. Comments by some ANC officials
 that appeared to suggest that the ANC was exempting its members from the am-
 nesty process prompted concern that the Commission's independence was being un-
 dermined. However, senior ANC officials assured TRC Chairman Desmond Tutu in
 a meeting late in the year that the party respected the Commission's authority and
 was encouraging its members to apply for amnesty where appropriate.
 By year's end, a number of former government officials, including one former min-
 ister and a top-level police official, had indicated that they would apply for amnesty.
 
 
 Hearings had been held involving nearly 50 a picants, including 5 former senior
 security policemen who presented evidence to the Commission on approximately 40
 cases of disappearance, bombings, and murder. Former security force Colonel Dirk
 Coetzee, one of the first apartheid government "defectors" to expose security force
 human rights violations, also testified before the Amnesty Committee; two others
 accused with him in the murder of Griffiths Mxenge have submitted amnesty appli-
 cations.
 On August 29, the TRC granted its first amnesty to two men convicted of killing
 Glad Mokgatle, an ally of Bophuthatswana strongman Lucas Mangope, ruling that
 their actions fit the required definition of a political crime. The two were released
 on August 30. In December the TRC granted amnesty to former policeman Brian
 Mitchell, who was serving a 30-year sentence for his part in the 1988 murder of 11
 people, known as the Trust Feed massacre. Amnesty was granted in half the nearly
 two dozen cases adjudicated by year's end.
 The government-created Human Rights Commission is tasked with promoting the
 observance of fundamental human rights at all levels of government and throughout
 the general population. The HRC also has the power to conduct investigations, issue
 subpoenas, and hear testimony under oath. While commissioners were named in
 late 1995, the Commission's powers were not formally determined until May 17. Op-
 erations have been hampered by red tape, budgetary concerns, the absence of civil
 liberties legislation, and uncertainty over the entry into force of the new Constitu-
 tion, which will, among other provisions, expand bill of rights provisions to cover
 actions between private individuals.
 The Office of Public Protector, which was also mandated under the Interim Con-
 stitution, functioned throughout the year. Its role is to investigate abuse and mis-
 management by the Government. In its highest profile case, the Public Protector ex-
 amined the handling of the contract and funding for the AIDS-awareness play
 "Sarafina Il" by officials of the Department of Health. The Government indicated
 that it would accept the recommendations of the inquiry, some of which were critical
 of government action.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Interim Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, gender, eth-
 nic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, be-
 lief, culture, language, sex, pregnancy, marital status, or birth. Legal recourse is
 available to those who believe they have been discriminated against.
 Women.-There is a high rate of violence against women. Newspapers report that
 every 6 days a woman is killed by her husband or boyfriend. According to a study
 conducted by the NGO, People Opposing Women Abuse, the figures for reported
 rape have risen consistently each year, from 32,000 cases in 1994 to nearly 37,000
 in 1995 (the last year for which figures are available). Unofficial estimates by the
 National Institute for Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offenders suggest
 that only 1 rape in 20 is reported to police.
 The Prevention of Family Violence Act of 1993 defines marital rape as a criminal
 offense and provides a simpler, cheaper, and more effective procedure for women to
 obtain injunctions against their abusive husbands and partners. However, to date
 only a handful of women have pressed complaints under the law, despite govern-
 ment and NGO efforts to increase public awareness of it.
 Given the high incidence of violence against women, the Government pledged to
 establish more centers for battered women. However, by year's end few such centers
 had been opened and women's advocacy groups were calling on the Government to
 speed implementation of its pledge. The SAPS created new police units dealing spe-
 cifically with domestic violence, child protection, and sexual violence, which are in-
 tended in part to increase victims' confidence in the police, resulting in more victims
 coming forward to report such crimes. In October the TRC conducted a special hear-
 ingon abuses suffered by women before an all-female commission.
 In March the Government established an Office on the Status of Women, located
 in the Deputy President's Office. The Office is intended to coordinate gender desks
 in each department, which will be charged with reviewing department policy and
 developing strategies to ensure integration of gender concerns in policy and plan-
 ning, and to undertake investigations of reported gender discrimination.
 The Commission on Gnderllquality Bill was passed by Parliament in June. The
 act established a government body to promote gender equality and to advise and
 make recommendations to Parliament on any legislation affecting women. In No-
 vember the National Assembly approved the list of appointees (which included 10
 women and 2 men) to the countrys first gender commission.
 
 
 261
 Discrimination against women remains a serious problem despite legal and con-
 stitutional advances and government attention to this issue. For example under
 some traditional laws, women are prevented from owning land and inheriting propu-
 erty. The new Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act protects persons who
 have insecure and informal rights and interests in land; many women are in this
 category. Some steps were taken to achieve greater economic advancement for
 women such as establishing an investment fund. The Affirmative Action Monitor,
 published by the consulting group FSA-Contact, reported that there was a 25 per-
 cent increase in the number of female professionals in the organizations surveyed.
 In January the Government ratified the U. N. Convention on the Elimination of
 All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 The Women's National Coalition (formed in 1994) includes mere than 90 women's
 groups from labor, political parties, religious groups, trade unions, cultural and so-
 cial interest groups and business and professional bodies. Government participants
 in the U. N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing developed a national
 plan of action and induced government departments to make concrete commitments
 to address gender issues. During parliamentary deliberations on the 1996 budget,
 many officials provided information assessing gender-specific implications of their
 budgets, as well as their departments' efforts to promote women.
 The new Constitution includes an equality clause that prohibits discrimination on
 the grounds of gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, or sexual orientation. The
 Government used the Platform o Action from the Beijing Conference as a reference
 guide in the drafting of this and other provisions of the law.
 Polygyny continues to be practiced in several ethnic groups. However, generally
 only one marriage is regstered under civil law; subsequent marriages are conducted
 under traditional rites. Bride price ("lobola") is also a traditional practice of some
 ethnic ups.
 Chi!ren.--The Interim Constitution stipulates that children have the right "to
 security, education, basic nutrition, and basic health and social services." The Gov-
 enent remains firm in its commitment to provide tese services, and has made
 some progress toward developing the mechanisms for delivering necessary services.
 However, the demand for such services far outstrips the resources currently avail-
 able.
 The Schools Bill passed by Parliament aims to achieve greater educational oppor-
 tunities for black children. It introduces compulsory education from ages 7 to 15,
 a single syllabus, and more equitable funding. The Government plans to redeploy
 teachers from predominantly white to predominantly black schools in order to equal-
 ize student/teacher ratios, and to redistribute funding from relatively rich to rel-
 atively poor school districts. Student populations on umversity campuses are becom-
 ing more representative of the country's racial profile, with previously all-white uni-
 versities reaching out to recruit students from black and colored townships.
 Social programs known as "Presidential Initiatives," which were included in the
 former Reconstruction and Development Program, continue to receive government
 support. These initiatives offer free health care to pregnant women and to children
 under 6 years of age, and provide nutritious meals for primary school children.
 Violence against children remains widespread. A report conducted by the Human
 Sciences Research Council and the Child Protection Unit concludes that crimes com-
 mitted against children are currently rising at an annual rate of 29 percent. Re-
 ported cases have increased 65 percent between 1993 and 1995. The increase in re-
 ported cases can be attributed to the creation of special units to deal with these
 crimes, growing emphasis on children's rights, and increased attention to the prob-
 lem by the public and the media. However, a lack of coordinated and comprehensive
 strategies to deal with such crimes continues to impede the delivery of needed serv-
 ices toyoung victims.
 Child prostitution is on the rise, primarily in Cape Town, but in Durban and Jo-
 hannesburg as well. An increase in the number of children living on the streets has
 contributed to the growing number of child prostitutes. The child sex industr has
 become increasingly organized, with children either being forced into prostitution or
 exploited by their parents to earn money for the family.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is traditionally prac-
 ticed in some remote areas of South Africa, although the practice is not thought to
 be widespread. Traditional circumcision of teenage boys results in the hospitaliza-
 tion, mutilation, or even death of several youths each year.
 In March amendments to prison legislation were passed permitting the detention
 of 14- to 18-year old juveniles who were awaiting trial for serious crimes such as
 rape and murder. In August Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela initiated
 a national debate on the incarceration of juveniles by claiming that 62 percent of
 
 
 the 398 juveniles awaiting trial in top security jails-some as young as 12 years
 old-should not be there because they were being tried on relatively minor charges.
 People With Disabilities.-The Interim Constitution and Bill of Fundamental
 Rights prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. Society continues to pro-
 mote an increasingly modern concept of people with disabilities as a minority whose
 civil rights must be protected. The Government attempts to ensure that all govern-
 ment-funded projects take account of the needs of its disabled citizens.
 However, in practice government and private sector discrimination in employment
 still exists, given the wide discretion alowed managers in hiring practices. Accord-
 ing to the Affirmative Action Monitor, fewer than two-thirds of South African com-
 panies target the disabled as part of their affirmative action programs. The law
 mandates access to buildings for people with disabilities, but such regulations have
 rarely been enforced and until recently, public awareness of them was virtually non-
 existent. The National Environmental Accessibility Program, an NGO comprising
 disabled consumers as well as service providers, has established a presence in all
 nine provinces in order to lobby for compliance with the regulations and to sue of-
 fending property owners when necessary.
 Indigenous People.-The Interim Constitution provides for the recognition of "the
 institution, status, and role of traditional leadership," and requires the courts to
 "apply customary law when that law is applicable, subject to the Constitution and
 any legislation that specifically deals with customary law.'
 The Interim Constitution further permits legislation for the establishment of pro-
 vincial houses of traditional leaders and a national council of traditional leaders,
 both of which would deal with matters relating to traditional leadership, the role
 of traditional leaders, indigenous and customary law, and the customs of commu-
 nities observing a system of customary law.
 National/Racial [Ethnic Minorities.-The Interim Constitution and Bill of Fun-
 damental Rights prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic or social origin,
 and culture. The Government has begun reorganizing and redesining the edu-
 cational, housing, and health care systems to benefit all racial an ethnic grups
 in society more equally. The public and private sectors continue to pursue aflirma-
 tive action programs, which are permitted under terms of the Interim Constitution.
 The Government has instituted an effective affirmative action program and has
 strongly encouraged private firms to do so. According to a Department of Labor sur-
 vey, 82 percent of private sector firms have instituted affirmi'tive action programs.
 The new Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act, which protects people
 with insecure and informal rights and interests in land, supplements the many 1994
 land and housing acts which were passed to redress former discriminatory practices
 and to promote equality in access to land and housing resources.
 According to Affirmative Action Monitor, affirmative action policies have had little
 impact on the top echelons in business. The number of white senior and middle
 managers has been reduced by less than 2 percent. The number of black senior and
 middle managers has increased by less than 1 percent. The number of companies
 with affirmative action programs decreased, over the last year, declining from 94
 percent in 1995 to 82 percent in 1996. Based on the consultants' survey, one-third
 of the organizations with no current progrms did not intend to implement one.
 Twelve prcent of the companies surveyed said that they had experienced a drop
 in standaeds or deterioration in quality of work due to affirmative action. However,
 the country's black majority increasingly is making inroads into the previously all-
 white entrepreneurial sector through pooled investments and acquisitions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associatio.-Fredom of association and the right to strike are
 provided by the Interim Constitution and given statutory effect in the Labor Rela-
 tions Act (LRA), which entered into force on November 11. All workers in the pri-
 vate sector are entitled to join a union. Most workers in the public sector, with the
 exception of members of the National Defense Force, the National Intellgence Agen-
 cy, and the South African Secret Service, are also entitled to join a union. No em-
 ployee can be fired or prejudiced because of membership in or advocacy of a trade
 union. There are 227 registered trade unions and about 40 unregistered trade
 unions, with a total approximate membership of 3.2 million, or about 42 percent of
 the employed, economically active population.
 The largeat trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions
 (COSATU is formally aligned with the ANC and the South African Communist
 Party. Over 60 former COATU members serve in national and provincial legisla-
 tures and administrations, and scores more entered local government following the
 November 1995 local elections. The much smaller National Council of Trade Unions,
 while officially independent of any political grouping, has close ties to the Pan
 
 
 263
 Africanist Congress and the Azanian Peoples Organization. A third major federa-
 tion, the Federation of South African Labor, comprises primarily white-collar profes-
 sional employees. A federation of public service employees called the Federation of
 Organizations RepresentingCivil Employees was created in early 1996 but has not
 yet been formally retstered.
 The LRA has established a simpleprocedure for a protected strike. All that is re-
 quired is that the dispute be referred for conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve
 the disute, then a trade union is entitled to enage in a legal strike. Such a strike
 is not lable to criminal or civil action. The  LA  allows employers to hire replace-
 ment labor for striking employees, but only after giving 7 days' notice to the striking
 tr a d   eni o n .
 The LRA applies to public sector as well as private sector workers. Therefore,
 public sector employees are also guaranteed the right to strike, with the exception
 of essential services and the three components of the security services mentioned
 above. While this right was first asserted in the Public Sector Labor Relations Act
 of 1993, the LRA simplifies and rationalizes collective bargaining in the public sec-
 tor and the resort to industrial action. Moreover, through the LEA, Parliament has
 granted employers the right to lock out workers if certain conditions are met. How-
 ever, a controversial attempt to establish this right in the Constitution was rejected
 by the Constitutional Court in September.
 The Government does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international
 labor organizations.
 The Intrnational Labor Organization readmitted South Africa in 1994; the coun-
 try had withdrawn from the Organization in 1964.
 b. The Right to Organize ane Bargain Collectively.-The law defines and protects
 the rights to organize and to bargain collectively. The Government does not interfere
 with union organizing and generally has not interfered in the collective bargaining
 process. The new LEA statutorily entrenches 'organizational rights," such as trade
 union access to work sites, deductions for trade union subscriptions, and leave for
 trade union officials, which strengthen the ability of trade unions to organize work-
 ers.Union artici ation as an equal partner with business and government in the tri-
 partite National Economic Development and Labor Council, a tripartite negotiating
 forum, ensures a direct voice forlabr in the formulation of economic, social, and
 labor pognains.
 The new LRA creates workplace forums that are intended to promote better shop
 floor communication between management and labor over issues of work organiza-
 tion and production. The forums, to receive statutory protection, can only be initi-
 ated by trade unions in businesses with more than 100 employees. However, the law
 is designed to build wide support within the trade union movement and business
 for new workplace relationships.
 To further reduce the adversarial nature of labor relations, the LRA also creates
 a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA), which is in-
 tended to play an aggressive, interventionist role to resolve disputes before they be-
 come full-fledged strikes or lockouta. In the event the CCMA is unable to resolve
 a dispute, it may be referred to the Labor Court. However, the intent of the bill is
 to reduce judicial intervention into labor relations, relying on the parties to resolve
 the dispute whenever possible.
 There are no export processing zones.
 a. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-For)ed labor is prohibited by the
 Interim Constitution, and the law is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of minors under age
 15 is prohibited by law. However, the law gives discretionary powers to the Minister
 of Welfa to exempt certain types of work to allow individual employers or groups
 of employers to hire children under certain conditions. This is common practice in
 the agricultural sector. Use of child labor in the informal economy is also common.
 The Ministries of Labor and Justice do not effectively enforce child labor laws, act-
 ing largely in response to complainta made against specific employers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage. Instead, the LRA provides a mechanism for negotiations between labor
 and management to set minimum wage standards, industry by industry. Currently,
 100 industries covering moat manufacturing workers come under the provisions of
 the act. In those sectors of the economy not sufficiently organized'to engage in the
 collective bargaining processes which establish minimum wages, the Wage Act gives
 the Minister of Labor the authority to set minimum wages and conditions. The
 Wage Act, however, does not apply to farm or domestic workers.
 Occupational health and safety issues are a top priority of trade unions, especially
 in the mining and heavy manufacturing industries. Although attention to these is-
 
 
 sues has increased dramatically, including passage in 1993 of the Occupational
 Health and Safety Act, industrial and mining processes are dangerous and some-
 times deadly. Government attempts to reduce mining fatalities culminated in June
 in the Mine Health and Safety Act. The act had its genesis in a report issued last
 year by a commission of inquiry convened to look into health and safety issues at
 South African mines. The new act establishes the right of an employee to remove
 himself from a work place he deems a danger to his health and safety. Moreover,
 it establishes a tripartite Mine Health and Safety Council, and an Inspectorate of
 Mine Health and Safety tasked with enforcing the act and monitoring compliance
 with its provisions. The act specifically makes it an offense for a company to dis-
 criminate against an employee who asserts a right (e.g., to leave a hazardous work
 site) granted by the act, and requires mine owners to file annual reports that pro-
 vide statistics on health and safety incidents for each mine being worked.
