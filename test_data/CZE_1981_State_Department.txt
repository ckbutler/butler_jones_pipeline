 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is governed by a
 communist regime similar to those in other Warsaw Pact
 states. It has an advanced economy and a sophisti-
 cated and well-educated populace which has had long
 contact with the main currents of Western European
 thought and tradition. The two main ethnic groups --
 the Czechs and the Slovaks -- have had different
 historical experiences and developments. The
 accommodation of the interests and aspirations of both
 groups within one country has not always been a smooth
 process. Slovak resentment at the longstanding
 domination of the Central Government by the more
 numerous Czechs led to the adoption in 1968 of the
 present federal system in which some functions are
 delegated to separate Czech and Slovak governments and
 in which Slovaks are more heavily represented than
 previously in federal institutions.
 Although both the Czechs and the Slovaks were long
 under the domination of others, they had a successful
 experience with democracy from the founding of the
 modern Czechoslovak state in 1918 until its
 destruction by Hitler in 1938. With the imposition of
 communist rule in 1948, the people of Czechoslovakia
 were again subjected to an authoritarian system of
 government. The "Prague Spring" of 1968, the brief
 experiment at liberalization which attempted to bring
 "socialism with a human face" to Czechoslovakia,
 demonstrated that the desire for participatory
 democracy still existed among the people and even
 within the Czechoslovak Communist Party. The August
 1968 invasion by.the Soviet Union and four other
 members of the Warsaw Pact and the permanent
 stationing of an estimated 70,000 Soviet troops within
 the country demonstrated even more forcefully,
 however, that the Soviet Union was unwilling to
 tolerate a participatory democracy in Czechoslovakia.
 Czechoslovak citizens are restricted in their practice
 of basic civil and political freedoms. Overt
 oppos.tion to the laws and guidelines approved by the
 Communist Party in any field, including creative
 activity, is punished. The threat of punishment and
 the denial of economic or educational opportunity,
 however, are much more widely used methods of control
 than punishment by arrest and imprisonment. The
 Czechoslovak people do not actively participate in
 political and economic decision-making. Attempts to
 enlarge the area of popular debate on Czechoslovak
 government policies in recent years have been
 unsuccessful.
 Charter 77 is a movement of intellectuals, students
 and workers which had been seeking to persuade the
 Czechoslovak government to abide by its own laws and
 international commitments. The Government has
 attempted to suppress dissident activity by
 periodically arresting, trying, and sentencinq leading
 
 (750)
 
 
 751
 members of the movement to prison terms on charges of
 anti-State activities. Many people active in Charter
 77 have emigrated in the face of harassment by the
 authorities. Some Czechoslovak citizens, such as
 author Pavel Kohout, have been denied permission to
 return to the country after temporary stays abroad and
 have been stripped of their citizenship.
 Others, for example journalist Jiri Lederer, have
 emigrated after serving prison terms for political
 offenses. The police frequently detain human rights
 activists for 48 hours before releasing them with
 warnings. Harassment of individuals detained in such
 circumstances also often includes attempts to persuade
 them to emigrate. Occasionally, trials are held and
 prison sentences are imposed for terms ranging from
 one to five years or more for such crimes as
 subversion, incitement and parasitism. One example of
 this was the October 1979 trial of six members of VONS
 (the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly
 Persecuted, a group which publicizes abuses of the
 judicial system), which resulted in prison sentences
 for five of the accused on charges of subversion. One
 of the five was later released because of severe
 health problems; the others remain in prison.
 In May 1981 eighteen persons were indicted on charges
 of subversion. Seven of these persons reportedly are
 still being detained, although no trial has yet taken
 place. Six of these persons are still under
 investigation, but are not detained, including
 prominent human rights activist, former Charter 77
 spokesman, and ex-Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek.
 Two other prominent members of Charter 77 were also
 tried and convicted in the summer of 1981. Charter 77
 signatory Jiri Gruntorad was sentenced to four years
 imprisonment in July 1981, and in the same month
 former Charter 77 spokesman Rudolf Battek received a
 sentence of seven and one-half years. The Battek
 sentence reportedly was the longest meted out to a
 political dissident in over two decades. Battek's
 sentence was reduced on appeal to five and one-half
 years imprisonment. Religious activists have also
 faced renewed pressure from the Government, as
 evidenced by the October trial of six persons,
 including two priests, who received sentences ranging
 from ten months to three years on charges of illegally
 distributing religious material and obstructing state
 supervision of religion.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 The integrity of the person is guaranteed in Article
 30 of the constitution, which states, "inviolability
 of the person shall be guaranteed... offenders can be
 punished only by due process of law." There is no
 indication that torture is used by the Czechoslovak
 government.
 
 
 752
 b.    Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Despite the provisions of Article 30, there are
 reports that the police employ harsh methods, such as
 beatings, in interrogations of suspected criminals.
 This practice appears evident especially in political
 cases, and beatings have been reported in police
 stations as well as on the street under circumstances
 which led the victims to believe that the actions were
 performed by police officials. There have been no
 reports of perpetrators of such actions being arrested
 and tried. The government has compelled political
 dissidents to be examined and treated at psychiatric
 institutions to discredit them. Prison conditions are
 sub-standard -- for example, cells are small and
 unheated. Prisoners report that they receive
 administrative punishments, such as reductions in pay
 and limitations on free time and bathing and exercise
 periods, for failing to meet unrealistically high work
 standards. The diet in prisons is reliably reported
 to be deficient, sometimes requiring persons to
 undergo special medical treatment upon release.
 Amnesty International has reported inadequate medical
 care in the cases of several political prisoners.
 There are three categories of imprisonment, with
 correspondingly harsher regimes of incarceration for
 more serious crimes and recidivists. Visits to all
 prisoners by family members are limited, and the
 frequency with which visits are allowed varies
 according to the category of imprisonment. Political
 prisoners sometimes report that they are subjected to
 harsher treatment, not only by guards, but by fellow
 inmates. There are no reports that different
 treatment is otherwise afforded according to social
 class, race, sex.or religion. In practice, effective
 redress for cruel and degrading treatment does not
 appear possible. There are no summary executions.
 The death penalty is imposed for particularly heinous
 crimes, but only after judicial review and
 consideration of executive clemency.
 c. Disappearances
 No instances of disappearance in Czechoslovakia have
 been reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 estimated at approximately 100. This figure is
 imprecise at best, however, since the Government does
 not recognize prisoners of conscience as a special
 category. Political defendants have been tried and
 convicted on the basis of sweeping charges, such as
 "damaging the i2te ests of the Republic". Detained
 persons can be held up to 48 hours without charges,
 although in practice this period is often exceeded.
 The two-month limit on pre-trial detention can be
 extended by the prosectutor at will, as it has been in
 
 
 753
 the case of the aforementioned seven human rights
 activists held without trial since May 1981. There
 are no effective safeguards, such as habeas corpus,
 for defendants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Czechoslovak law requires that all trials be public
 and that the accused be given the right to counsel,
 informed of the charges and given the opportunity to
 present a defense. In practice, however, there are
 significant restrictions on these legal guarantees for
 those charged with political crimes. Public access to
 trials of persons charged with political offenses is
 denied; only selected supporters of the regime and a
 limited number of relatives are admitted to the
 courtroom. Efforts by diplomatic and other interested
 representatives to attend such trials have been
 unsuccessful. Although counsel may visit the accused,
 both before and after the trial, a police officer is
 often present to monitor the meetings. Lawyers are
 known to have been disbarred after too vigorous a
 defense of political opponents of the government.
 Defendants do exercise the right to defend themselves
 in court and occasionally have had charges dismissed
 or downgraded at the original trial or on appeal.
 The courts have only limited independence. Judges can
 be removed by either the federal assembly or by the
 national councils of the Czech or Slovak republics.
 Civilians are tried by military courts only in special
 circumstances, such as espionage. All verdicts and
 sentences can be appealed to at least one higher court
 by either the defendant or the prosecutor or both.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution is supposed to guarantee the
 inviolability of the home. A search warrant is
 required from the prosecutor unless there is not
 sufficient time to obtain one, although the standard
 in such caes is unclear. However, there are
 wide-spread reports of house searches without
 warrants, and evidence obtained in these searches is
 admissible in court. The homes of dissidents are
 often closely watched by the police to curtail access
 by western newsmen or other dissidents. Government
 use of electronic "bugging" seems to be widespread,
 focused particularly on the residences of persons who
 are politically suspect.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed in
 the constitution, provided that the exercise of these
 freedoms is "...consistent with the interests of the
 working people...". Freedom of assembly is also
 purportedly allowed in order for citizens"... to take
 an active part in the Administration of the State and
 
 
 754
 in the economic and cultural development of the
 country."
 In practice, however, these freedoms do not exist.
 Individuals may not publicly express views contrary to
 the "principles of a socialist state", criticize the
 Czechoslovak Communist Party or the Government's
 decisions or leaders, or hold public meetings without
 permission from the police. The mass media are
 completely controlled by the State and operate under
 the direct supervision of the Party. Many prominent
 journalists who supported liberalization in 1968 are
 not allowed to practice their profession. Only a few
 Western periodicals are allowed into the country, and
 those are unavailable to the average citizen.
 Radio Free Europe broadcasts are Jammed, but most
 other international broadcasting, including that by
 the Voice of America, can be heard in Czechoslovakia.
 Freedom of association is closely controlled.
 Professional groups are controlled by the State. No
 independent groups are allowed to exist. Printing and
 reproduction devices, other than typewriters, are
 controlled by the ministry of the interior and it is
 illegal for an individual to possess one.
 Reproduction of printed materials is limited to eleven
 typewritten copies, and reproduction of "subversive"
 materials is a criminal offense.
 Freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice
 religion are guaranteed in the constitution. In
 practice, however, the State rigorously regulates
 religious activity. Clergy are paid by the State and
 require a State license to practice. Their activities
 and public statements, including sermons and homilies,
 are closely examined by government authorities.
 Religious education, proselytizing, and the education
 of new clergy are carefully limited. Only those
 religious groups recognized by the State are permitted
 to operate. Male religious orders are not permitted
 in Czechoslovakia. Members of female orders are
 restricted to nursing and the care of the elderly in
 outlying areas. The Jehovah's Witnesses are
 explicitly outlawed. Overt religious activity usually
 results in effective disqualification for advancement
 in most fields.
 Nominally, about 11 million Czechoslovaks are
 Catholics and just over one million are Protestants.
 Some priests and much of the senior Catholic clergy
 have.been co-opted into a pro-government organization,
 Pacem in Terris. As demonstrated by the arrests of
 several Catholic priests and lay workers in
 the fall of 1981 for distributing samizdat (self
 published) religious literature and for obstructing
 State supervision of religion, those who stray beyond
 narrowly-defined boundaries are subject to punishment.
 The Jewish community, numbering several thousand, has
 a central religious organization financially supported
 by the Government. There are synagogues and prayer
 
 
 755
 houses and a Jewish museum. There are no Jewish
 schools or rabbinical seminaries, but one Czech Jew is
 attending a rabbinical seminary abroad.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Czechoslovakia is not
 normally restricted. Travel in some areas near the
 borders or in the vicinity of military installations
 is, however, proscribed. Travel by Czechs and Slovaks
 to other Eastern European Communist countries (except
 Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union) is unhindered, but
 travel to Western countries is difficult, since
 travelers must obtain both permission to leave and,
 unless they intend to visit close relatives, a hard
 currency authorization. Travelers to the West usually
 must leave some member of the immediate family in
 Czechoslovakia to ensure their return. These
 restrictions are relaxed for retirees.
 Obtaining permission to emigrate is a long and arduous
 process, especially for persons in political
 opposition to the government. Applicants must endure
 long waits and may suffer such reprisals as demotion
 or loss of job after applying. There are no special
 barriers to anyone's emigrating to join a foreign
 spouse. Czechoslovakia denies the right of
 repatriation by the expedient of depriving of
 citizenship those of its citizens it does not wish to
 return. Such denial is generally used only in
 political cases involving prominent dissidents.
 Emigration passports are not valid for return to
 Czechoslovakia without special endorsement; voluntary
 expatriation is frequently a condition for permission
 to emigrate, particularly in cases where the emigrant
 does not have close relatives abroad.
 The only significant refugee group within the country
 is comprised.of communists who have fled from'
 non-communist countries, with Greek communists the
 largest such group. There are also Indonesian and
 American communist expatriates. There are no known
 instances of forced repatriation of such persons.
 There is a significant outflow of refugees from
 Czechoslovakia, at least several thousand per year.
 These are primarily persons who leave the country
 legally on vacation to non-Warsaw Pact European
 countries and do not return.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All significant decisions regarding the government,
 the economy, and society are made exclusively by the
 leadership of the Communist Party.. Only a very
 limited number of Party'leaders enjoy meaningful
 participation in the political process. Ordinary
 citizens, especially those who are not Party members,
 have no role in the process of selecting their leaders
 or in making important political or economic
 
 
 756
 decisions. Four minor political parties are
 permitted. They may publish their own newspapers, but
 must conform their activities to the line of the
 Communist Party.
 There is little evidence of meaningful public
 discussion of social, political, or economic issues.
 In general, the people learn about Party and
 government decisions only after the fact. The
 Government has reacted to attempts to broaden the
 political process by arrest and imprisonment. Women
 are equal under the law. There are small numbers of
 women in the professions and in higher-ranking Party,
 government and management positions.
 The trade union movement is organized under the
 guidance of the Communist Party, as provided for in
 the constitution. Worker membership is virtually
 obligatory. Strikes, collective bargaining and
 lobbying are not permitted. Workers are expected to
 carry out directives to fulfill the economic plan.
 They have little influence on production decisions,
 but, in some cases, have been able to bring about
 changes in their working conditions. The right and
 duty to work are guaranteed in the constitution. In
 practice, persons who hold political views differing
 from those of the government have found it difficult
 to retain positions for which they were trained and
 have been forced into such menial jobs as
 window-washer, stoker, or street cleaner. The
 International Labor Organization has faulted the
 Czechoslovak government for this practice of using
 economic deprivation as a method of political control.
 About 600,000 Hungarians live in Czechoslovakia,
 primarily in Slovakia along the border with Hungary.
 Primary education in Hungarian is provided in these
 areas as well as Hungarian language radio and
 television programs, newspapers, and magazines.
 Hungarians are proportionately represented-in federal
 and local legislative bodies but are under-represented
 in prestigious jobs in the economy and the state
 apparatus. The only other sizeable minority group in
 Czechoslovakia is gypsies, numbering about 250,000
 persons, who are generally viewed by Czechs and
 Slovaks as occupying a lower social stratum.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In a detailed report on Czechoslovakia published in
 1981, Amnesty International dobumented its concern
 about the number of human rights violations in the
 Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, particularly as
 regards the following: A) the arrest and imprisonment
 of Czechoslovak citizens under the national law for
 the non-violent exercise of internationally recognized
 human rights, in particular the right to freedom of
 expression and information; B) the abuse of legal
 
 
 757
 provisions relating to arrest, pre-trial detention and
 trial procedure; C) the poor treatment of prisoners of
 conscience and inadequate conditions of detention; and
 D) the retention of the death penalty. The
 Czechoslovak government has reacted negatively to
 expressions of concern about human rights violations
 in Czechoslovakia by other governments or
 non-governmental institutions. It frequently delays
 or refuses visas to members of international human
 rights organizations. In several instances,
 representatives from these organizations have been
 detained or expelled during visits to Czechoslovakia.
 The Government's stated reason for reacting with such
 high sensitivity to outside investigation is that it
 considers these matters to be internal issues.
 There are two groups within Czechoslovakia that
 concern themselves with promoting respect for human
 rights: Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense
 of the Unjustly Persecuted (VONS). Charter 77 has
 issued several studies on topics such as the standard
 of living, the plight of pensioners, and the right to
 travel abroad. VONS concentrates on abuses of the
 judicial system and has used public records and
 reports from friends and relatives of accused persons
 in issuing communiques on cases where it believes the
 police, the courts, or the prisons have abused
 citizens' civil or human rights. These communiques
 are distributed to Czechoslovak authorities.
 As a result of their activities, members of both these
 groups have suffered considerable persecution,
 including loss of jobs, detentions, loss of
 educational opportunities for their children,
 imprisonment, and minor harassment, such as suspension
 of driving licenses and surveillance.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Basic needs for adequate food and health care are met,
 and the demographically stable, largely urbanized
 population enjoys a reasonably comfortable material
 existence. Health care is universally available
 through a national system administered and financed by
 the government. There are reports that prompt
 treatment is sometimes secured only through payments
 of bribes.
 Average life expectancy at birth is 71 years (1979
 figures). The infant mortality rate is 19 per 1000
 live births (1978 figures). The population growth
 rate is about .7 percent. There are occasional
 deficiences of supplies and services, but these are
 attributable more to economic constraints or
 management deficiencies than to deliberate neglect of
 human needs. The average diet is more than adequate,
 with 139 percent of calorie supply available for
 consumption (as a percentage of the normal nutritional
 requirement). Annual consumption of meat is also
 high, averaging approximately 85 kilos of meat per
 capita.
 
 
 758
 Education is compulsory up to 15 years of age.
 Literacy is nearly universal. The adjusted primary
 school enrollment ratio (1978 figures) is 94 for the
 total population and 94 and 95 for males and females,
 respectively. Secondary and university education are
 free, but there are many reports that the selection of
 students for courses and schools, in particular those
 leading to more desirable careers, is based on their
 parents' political standing and reliability. Access
 to higher education thus appears to be an instrument
 of control over a large segment of the population.
 Opportunities also exist for evening study at the
 advanced secondary and technical level.
 Czechoslovakia has had a rising standard of living
 since the end of World War II, but recent figures show
 a tapering off. GNP per capita is $5,290 (1979
 figures). While Czechoslovak society was relatively
 egalitarian during the 1918-1938 republic, the result
 of more than 30 years of communist rule has been a
 "leveling" of the population, which exhibits neither
 great wealth nor poverty; nonetheless, access to goods
 and services varies significantly, with elites, such
 as Communist Party members, artists, and athletes,
 having standards far above the norm. A pension system
 provides beneficiaries with a minimum income. In
 addition, some retirees are allowed to supplement
 their pension payments by working.
 About 48 percent of Czechoslovak women are in the work
 force. Most of them have lower paying, less skilled
 jobs, although equal pay for equal work seems to hold
 true in most cases.
