 MALAWI
 In an end to one-man, one-arty rule in Malawi, on May 17, Bakili Muluzi won
 the Presidency in Malawi's first democratic, multiparty elections since independ-
 ence. His party, the United Democratic Front (UDF), gained an 84-seat plurality in
 the 177-member Parliament (see Section 3). The Malawi Congress Party (MCP), the
 former sole legal party, and the former Life President, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, made
 strong showings, with the MCP winning 55 seats. The Constitution, passed just
 hours before the elections, provides for a strong presidency, and an independent leg-
 islature and judiciary. While the multiparty National Consultative Council and Na-
 tional Executive Committee successfully guided the political transition during the
 last months of the Banda government, the election results reflected the regional
 strengths of each of the three major parties, UDF in the south, MCP in the center,
 and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) in the north.

 The National Police, headed by the Inspector-General of Police under the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, are responsible for internal security. Although the police occasion-
 ally called on the army for back-up support in particularly difficult situations, the
 military did not play a significantly active role in the internal security of the coun-
 try. In early 1994, the army completed the disarmament of the Malawi Young Pio-
 neers (MYP), which had been responsible for many human rights abuses under the
 Banda government. Despite the political transformation, there continued to be credi-
 ble reports that police abused detainees and used excessive force in handling crimi-
 nals. The police also continued to detain persons without charge for longer than the
 law allows. The new Inspector-General of Police, apointed folowing the elections
 in May, began to address some of the endemic problems by agreeing to meet with
 representatives of donor governments and human rights organizations and request-
 ing assistance for the improvement of the organization, transportation and training
 of the police force.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi has a predominantly agricul-
 tural economy. Over 85 percent of the population derives its income from agri-
 culture. The main cash crops are tobacco-Malawi's most important foreign ex-
 change earner-tea, coffee, and sugar. In 1994 the economy was rocked by severe
 shortages of foreign exchange, rapid depreciation of the currency, high inflation, and
 drought.
 Malawi's human rights performance improved significantly in 1994, most notably
 through internationally recognized free and fair elections held in May and the intro-
 duction of a new Constitution with strong human rights provisions. During the year,
 citizens exercised their rights of speech, press, assembly, and political association
 generally without government interference, although there were occasional accusa-
 tions of government attempts to restrict the media.
 Despite many improvements, however, there continued to be serious human rights
 abuses. In particular, the police continued to abuse and use excessive force in han-
 dling criminal suspects. Lengthy pretrial detention and the uncertain judicial sys-
 tem called into question the ability of the accused to receive timely justice. In re-
 sponse to the rise in crime, ang  mobs carried out summary justice. Political lead-
 ers faced a major challen  i addressing the serious human rights abuses commit-
 ted duringthe long Banda era, in part because many government, UDF, and MCP
 members have had some past ties to the Banda regime. While the President has
 not yet established the constitutionally mandated human rights commission, he ap-
 pointed a commission with a mandate limited to investigating the alleged political
 killings of four prominent politicians in 1983. In early 1995, the Government placed
 ex-president Banda under house arrest and planned to try him and others for these
 deaths. Women continued to experience societal discrimination, and domestic vio-
 lence against women remained a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. However, frustrated by increased crime and inadequate
 law enforcement, civilians sometimes resorted to vigilante justice in beating, ston-
 ing, hacking, and even burning suspected criminals to death. While mob justice is
 recognized as a crime, the authorities did not attempt to prosecute any alleged per-
 petrators.
 After the elections, the Government appointed a commission to investigate the
 1983 deaths of four prominent political figures, three government ministers and a
 parliamentarian, who are widely believed to have been victims of political killings.
 'ie previous government ignored calls for an investigation, claiming the four had
 died in an auto accident. In early 1995, the Government placed ex-president Banda
 under house arrest and arrested several others in connection with the killings. A
 trial is expected in 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicate that the police continued to beat suspected criminals dur-
 ing initial detention and interrogation at police stations. These same reports, how-
 ever, stated that the number and severity of beatings diminished dramatically after
 the first months of 1994.
 The new Government granted the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) access to police detention centers, but local police authorities were some-
 times reluctant to cooperate. As a result the ICRC had difficulty gaining access to
 some police facilities. The new Inspector General participated in an ICRC training
 seminar on human rights for senior police officials.

 Conditions in prisons improved in 1993 and 1994, but overcrowding, inadequate
 nutrition, and substandard sanitation and health facilities remained serious prob-
 lems. Women are not kept in separate facilities, but are separated within the prison
 compound. Rape of female prisoners is not a problem. As a result of the Govern-
 ment's increased awareness and response to these problems and continued ICRC
 visits and training sessions, the ICRC decided to close its office in Blantyre at the
 end of the year and to continue its follow-up activities from its regional delegation
 in Harare, Zimbabwe.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law permits the accused to challenge
 the legality of the detention, to have access to legal counsel, and to be charged or
 released within 48 hours. In all cases where the court determines that a defendant
 cannot afford to supply his own counsel, legal services are provided by the Govern-
 ment. In practice, the authorities held many detainees for weeks without charge, os-
 tensibly due to the inability of police to complete investigations promptly, and few
 persons were able to afford legal counsel There are not enough lawyers or private
 resources to meet the needs of indigent detainees. Pretrial detainees represent about
 one-third of the prison population, and in some cases persons have been detained
 for years.
 In a few cases during the campaign period,plice arbitrarily detained members
 of opposition parties for "questioning." These detainees were held for a few hours
 and released.
 The judicial system continued to be handicapped by serious weaknesses including
 poor recordkeeping, personnel shortages, and most recently the transfer of several
 hundred murder cases from the traditional courts to the High Court. In the past,
 traditional courts were the keystone of the Banda legal system, and the cases were
 transferred to ensure prisoners have the right to a fair trial in accordance with
 international standards. However, only a few of the transferred murder cases had
 actually gone to trial by year's end.
 There were no reports of political detainees in 1994. (See Section 1.e.).
 The Government did not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a High Court, a Su-
 preme Court of Appeal, and subordinate magistrate courts and allows for traditional
 courts, which continue to operate at the local level, ruling on minor civil and cus-
 tomary law cases. With the reorganization, however, these traditional courts are
 now subordinate to the regular court system.
 Under the Constitution, the judiciary is independent from other branches of gov-
 ernment. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Na-
 tional Assembly. Other justices are appointed by the President following a rec-
 ommendation by the Judicial Service Commi sion. All justices are appointed until
 the age of 65 and may only be removed for reasons of incompetence or misbehavior,
 as determined by a majority in Parliament and the President.
 By law defendants have the right to a public trial but not to a trial by jury. How-
 ever, in hearing the first murder cases transferred from the traditional courts to the
 High Court, the High Court used juries of seven persons from the defendant's home
 district (see Section 1.d.). Defendants have the right to an attorney, access to evi-
 dence and witnesses, and the right of appeal. There were no reports that the au-
 thorities deliberately denied these rights, but the many problems confronting the ju-
 dicial system and inadequate state funding meant that, in practice, many persons
 were denied the right to an expeditious trial
 Juvenile offenders have special rights under the Constitution, including the right
 to be separated in custody from adults, to be treated in a manner which accounts
 for age and the possibility of rehabilitation, and exemption from the punishment of
 life imprisonment without the possibility of release.
 By the end of 1994, there were no known political prisoners in Malawi. Neverthe-
 less, in his May 21 inaugural address President Muluzi ordered the release of all
 remaining political prisoners (probably a few at most). The only person widely
 known to have been released was a man who had been charged with attempting to
 incite the armed forces to overthrow the Government. The President also commuted
 all death sentences to life in prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, search warrants are required, and there were no reported incidents of ille-
 gal search of homes or businesses. However, postal authorities occasionally opened
 and inspected private correspondence, seemingly at random.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and citizens widely exercised these rights in 1994.
 
 
 151
 During the year, more than 20 newspapers published a broad spectrum of political
 and ideological views. The Government generally tolerated press criticism. However,
 in one highly publicized incident followmig the May elections, an opposition paper
 published a 2-year-old photograph of the new President which depicted him in a
 prison uniform. The photo was supposedly taken following his arrest and conviction
 for stealing six British pounds while serving as a government clerk in 1968. The
 Minister of Justice/Attorney General attempted to stop the newspaper from publish-
 ing, and the police harassed its editor and detained him for questioning. Following
 an immediate public outcry the President reversed the Attorney General's decision,
 and the paper continued publication.
 The only radio station is the government-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation
 (MBC), which is the most important medium for reaching the public. Both the MCP,
 when in power, and the new UDF-led Government gave priority in MBC program-
 ming to their policies. Most recently the MCP charged the Minister of Information
 and Broadcasting with directing the MB1C not to broadcast an MCP statement.
 Many of the old repressive laws which were of concern to international human
 rights organizations including laws affecting freedom of the press have been specifi-
 ca    d a essed in the new Constitution and are now considered "unconstitutional."
 To date, in cases where an old law conflicts with the Constitution, and has reached
 a court of law for a decision, the Constitution has prevailed, effectively nullifying
 the repressive laws that are still on the books. During the year the Government
 began the time-consuming process of revising the entire legal code.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The authorities routinely granted official per-
 mits, which are required by law for large gatherings and meetings.
 The new Government continued the policy of requiring organizations, including
 political parties, to register with the Registrar General under the Ministry of Jus-
 tice, but there were no reports of any group being denied registration or having its
 registration delayed. Eight political parties participated in the elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 people exercised this right freely. However, the law requires that religious groups
 register with the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People have the right of movement and residence within the borders,
 and the right to leave and return. In practice, however, some Asians have been de-
 nied this right (see Section 5).
 During the campaign period, police occasionally delayed the travel of members of
 the then political opposition at checkpoints between regional boundaries, but it was
 not clear whether such actions were taken on individual initiative or at government
 direction. Following the elections, the new Government reintroduced police road-
 blocks, citing the increasing crime rate. There were no reports of political harass-
 ment at the newly established checkpoints, but there have been allegations of har-
 assment for the purpose of obtaining bribes, particularly at border-crossing points.
 Malawi continued to host thousands of Mozambican refugees. At the beginning of
 1994, 700,000 Mozambicans remained in Malawi, down from a peak in excess of 1
 million. At the end of the year, only 100,000 remained. During the year, the Govern-
 ment cooperated with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other relief organizations to assist their return to Mozambique and
 to meet a number of new arrivals (approximately 1,500 to 2,000), mostly from
 nonneighboring countries such as Somalia and Zaire. The Government initially hesi-
 tated to take on the responsibility of a new refugee population, in part due to popu-
 lar resentment that UNHCR support allowed refugees a lifestyle unattainable to
 many Malawians. Subsequently, the Government initiated plans to relocate the new
 refugees to a camp, converting a former prison for this purpose. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right on May 17 when over 80 percent of the population
 freely and peacefully voted-for the first time in 30 years-for a new President and
 Members of Parliament in multiparty elections. Although there were minor irreg-
 ularities during the elections principally perpetrated by the then-ruling MCP, inter-
 national observers declared the elections substantially free and fair. There is univer-
 sal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and over.
 President Muluzi and Vice President Justin Malewizi (both from the United
 Democratic Front-UDF), and a 26-member Cabinet (19 ministers from the UDF and
 7 from three other parties), exercised executive authority. Parliament consists of 177
 
 
 152
 members (85 from the UDF, 56 from the MCP, and 36 from the Alliance for Democ-
 racy-AFORD). In September the President designated Chakufwa Chihana of
 AFORD Second Vice President, and the Parliament amended the Constitution in Oc-
 tober to authorize this position. In December Chihana was sworn in. A group of
 Malawians questioned the constitutionality of the designation of a second vice presi-
 dent prior to the amendment of the Constitution to allow for such an office, and
 sued the President and the Speaker of Parliament for violating the Constitution.
 The court did not rule on the case and the issue remained unresolved at year's end.
 The key issue facing the new Government as it attempts to consolidate democracy
 is the strengthening of the economy; the Government's main focus is poverty allevi-
 ation. It is also attempting to address past human rights abuses, poor education
 and the challenges inherent in operating a government which includes a political
 opposition. The move to appoint a second vice president was, in part, an attempt
 to include a portion of the opposition in the executive and develop a working major-
 ity in the Parliament.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. Social discrimination, however, does limit women's participation.
 While most women voted, few hold public office, and in the May elections only 10
 women were elected to the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allowed local and international human rights groups to monitor
 and investigate its activities and did not take any action against these organiza-
 tions. Some organizations, such as the Malawi Law Society's Legal Resources Cen-
 ter, the Foundation of Integrity of Creation, Justice and Peace; the Christian Coun-
 cil of Malawi; Vera Chirwa's "Carer"; and the Society for the Advancement of
 Women, began recording evidence of past abuses, monitored the new Government,
 and issued statements whenever they felt the new Government violated human
 rights or the Constitution.
 The new Constitution provides for a national compensation tribunal, which will
 entertain claims of criminal and civil liability against the former government, and
 a human rights commission which will protect, and investigate violations against
 the rights provided for in the Constitution. These bodies were not yet in place and
 functioning at the end of 1994. The Government had, however, invited applications
 for the position of ombudsman, who will investigate claims of injustice.
 The Government discussed human rights problems with international govern-
 mental and nongovernmental organizations, and permitted visits by United Nations
 and other international organizations, including the ICRC. For the most part the
 Government responded positively to recommendations and attempted to remedy
 human rights problems as they came to its attention.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Relgion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for women; forbids discrimi-
 nation based on language, culture, or religion; and generally guarantees every per-
 son the right to equality and recognition before the law.
 Women.-Under the new Constitution, women have the right to full and equal
 protection by law and may not be discriminated against on the basis of their gender
 or marital status. In practice, however, women continued to experience discrimina-
 tion and did not have opportunities equal to those available to men. Historically,
 women, especially in rural areas, have been unable to complete even a primary edu-
 cation and are therefore at a serious disadvantage in the job market. Women often
 do not have equal access to legal and financial assistance and are often the victims
 of discriminatory inheritance practices in which the majority of the estate goes to
 the deceased husband's family. They are also often at a disadvantage in marriage,
 family, and propry rights.
 The Nationa Connmssion on Women, an organization overseen by the Ministry
 of Women and Children Affairs, operated without official funding, and its impact
 was limited to disseminating information on women's rifhts and working with other
 government ministries to increase awareness of womens rights. More important in
 addressing women's issues were local nongovernmental organizations, such as the
 National Association of Business Women, which sponsored income-generating
 schemes for small groups of women in rural and urban areas.
 Violence against women is not believed to be a serious problem. However, spousal
 abuse, especially wife beating, does occur. Domestic violence is not discussed openly
 by women, reportedly even among themselves and there are no confidential shelters
 or facilities for treatment of women who sufier physical or sexual abuse. Police do
 
 
 153
 not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and few cases of violence against
 women actually reach the courts. Occasionally the press reported instances of sexual
 abuse and harassment of female students by their male teachers, who, if caught,
 faced dismissal.
 Children.-Although the Constitution provides for equal treatment for children
 under the law, the Government, dedicated few resources to children's health and
 welfare. However, it did institute a system of free primary education for all children,
 beginning in October. A few charitable organizations attempted to reduce the num-
 ber of child beggars in urban areas and find alternative care for them.
 A few small ethnic groups practice female genital mutilation (FGM), which has
 been condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 mental health. However, FGM is neither common nor generally accepted by the soci-
 ety as a whole.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most Malawians of African heritage are
 members of indigenous tribes and are not discriminated against by the Government
 or society. However, there is discrimination against Asians. In previous years, Asian
 residents and citizens were prohibited from living and working in specified areas.
 In early 1994, these restrictions were lifted from citizens of Asian background but
 remained in place for the majority of resident Asians who are not citizens. Following
 the elections and the ratification of the new Constitution, these restrictions became
 unconstitutional, but the Business Licensing Act, which was used in the past to
 deny Asians the opportunity to establish businesses in the rural areas, remained on
 the books. Few Asians actually tested the easing of these restrictions in 1994.
 Following the elections, the Government started restricting the previously auto-
 matic renewal of temporary employment permits for expatriates, particularly busi-
 nessmen, in the hope that Malawians would be hired in theirplace. Other affected
 expatriates included teachers, health workers, researchers, and missionaries. While
 this was consistent with Malawian law, the new and unexpected policy of strict en-
 forcement, and the focus on businessmen specifically, caused concern and sometimes
 hardship to many expatriates who had established themselves in Malawi.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated accessibility to
 buildings and services for the disabled, but one of the national goals listed in the
 new Constitution is to support the disabled through greater access to public places,
 fair opportunities in employment, and full participation in all spheres of society.
 There are special schools and training centers which assist individuals with disabil-
 ities and several self-supporting businesses, run by and for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Because most households derive their income from
 the agricultural sector, only a small percentage of the work force earns wages in
 the formal sector. Approximately 473,000 persons, or 14 percent of the work force,
 earn formal wages. As of April, government data showed there were 63,000 dues-
 paying union members, 39 percent of whom were teachers. At that time, the major-
 ity of paid-up union members were in the private sector.
 Workers have the legal right to form and join trade unions, but unions must reg-
 ister with the Ministry of Labor. For government workers, a union's membership
 must consist solely of government employees. In 1993 civil servants organized them-
 selves into the Civil Service Joint Consultative Committee.
 Unions may freely form or join federations. Until the new era all unions were
 required to affiliate with the Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM), which until
 late 1993 was closely affiliated with the former ruling party and highly cir-
 cumscribed by the Government. In late May, when the current, democratically elect-
 ed government took power, unions became independent of the Government and of
 political parties. No new federations outside the TUCM had been formed by year
 end.
 Under the Constitution, workers have the right to strike. There are no legal re-
 strictions on this right other than those listed for "essential services" as determined
 by the Minister of Labor. The law requires that labor disputes in "essential services"
 be reported to the Minister of Labor in writing, who then attempts to negotiate a
 settlement. He may refer the case to a tribunal within 28 days of receiving the dis-
 pute report if it is not possible to reconcile the parties. Only if a trade dispute has
 gone through this process, but not been resolved or referred to a tribunal, may
 workers in essential services" go on strike.
 There were a number of strikes during the year. Most strike activities were peace-
 ful and legal. However, in early October, junior-level civil servants went on strike
 in pursuit of higher wages and benefits and blocked roads and stoned moving gov-
 ernment vehicles. Although the Government had met with the Civil Service Joint
 Consultative Committee from September until the strike, junior-level employees felt
 
 
 the Committee did not represent their interests. The strike was finally settled
 through negotiations with a small delegation chosen by the strikers and resulted in
 a modest wage increase. There are no laws or regulations which prohibit retribution
 against strikers and their leaders
 Unions may affiliate with and participate in international bodies, but require gov-
 emnment permission to do so. The TUCM is a member of the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions, the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and
 the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council (SATUCC). In January
 SATUCC reopened its offices in Malawi (which were closed by the Banda govern-
 ment in 1992).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is freely
 practiced but is not specifically protected by law. In practical terms, the Government
 sets wages in the state-owned industries, and employers do so in private businesses.
 The abundance of unskilled laborers relative to employment opportunities gives
 labor only a limited voice in wage and contract negotiations. By contrast, skilled
 workers-be-cause of their scarcity-enjoy higher salaries and have had some suc-
 cess when negotiating employment terms, either on an individual basis or through
 collective means.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, but there is no legal re-
 quirement that employers reinstate workers fired for union activities. Most individ-
 ual labor disputes-usually in the form of a worker claiming unfair dismissal-are
 initially referred to the Ministry of Labor for resolution. The Ministry typically en-
 courages a settlement between the parties; it does not actually adjudicate the merits
 of the claim. Tribunals apply in all disputes.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Constitution prohibits
 forced labor, and such labor is not practiced except by prison inmates.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chiidren.-The new Constitution defines chil-
 dren as those under the age of 16 (replacing the law which defined children as per-
 sons under the age of 12). It prohibits the employment of children in work that is
 hazardous or ha       or interferes with their education. However, there is no law
 making education compulsory. The law also prohibits children from working at
 night or in "industrial undertakings." Enforcement by police and labor inspectors in
 the Ministry of Labor is not effective.
 In the large agricultural sector, young children work on family farms and on
 smaller estates, often in the two major export industries-tobacco and tea. Children
 are not commonly employed in industrial jobe.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Malawi has two legislated minimum wage
 rates: one for cities, and one for the rest of the country. Wage rates were last in-
 creased in July. The minimum in the cities of Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu, and the
 municipality of Zomba is $0.23 (ink 3.50) per day, in other areas it is $0.20 (ink
 3.00) per day. These wage levels do not provide a worker and family with a decent
 standard of living. However, wage earners tend to supplement their incomes
 through farming activities carried out through the extended family network. The
 prescribod minimum wages are largely irrelevant for the great majority of citizens
 who earn their livelihood outside the formal wage sector.
 Wages in Malawi's formal sector are primarily derived from the prescribed mini-
 mum wages and by comparison to civil service wages. Industrial employees receive
 the highest wages, with most private commercial firms setting their wages higher
 than those for comparable government employees. Agricultural workers tend to re-
 ceive at most the legal minimum wage with some additional benefits such as access
 to basic medical treatment and food. While the Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 enforcing the minimum wage levels, it does not do so efectively.
 There is no legislated standard workweek in Malawi, but most companies have
 a maximum workweek of 48 hours with 1 day of rest. However some wage laborers
 work 7 days per week. The Workers' Compensation Act includes extensive occupa-
 tional health and safety standards. Enforcement of these standards by Ministry of
 Labor inspectors is erratic, and workers-particularly in industrial jobs--often work
 without basic safety clothing and equipment. According to the Ministry of Labor,
 workers do have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
