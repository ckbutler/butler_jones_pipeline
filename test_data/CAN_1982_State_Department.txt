 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal system, par-
 liamentary form of government, and a strong democratic tradition.
 Under Canada's federal system, specific governmental responsi-
 bilities are reserved either to the provinces or national govern-
 ment. Each has substantial autonomy in its respective areas of
 competence. The multi-party system provides for democratically
 elected representatives at local, provincial, and federal levels
 by universal suffrage. Canadians have a high standard of living
 and a comprehensive system of government services. An active.
 free press and the information media allow public discussion and
 examination of all issues affecting Canadians.
 Respect for fundamental human rights in Canada is based on a
 number of federal and provincial documents which reflect the
 political, cultural, and social practices of the Canadian people.
 In 1982 Canada revised its Constitution and added a Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms. On April 17 Queen Elizabeth signed a
 proclamation which *patriated" the Constitution giving Canada
 the right to amend the document in all respects with no refer-
 ence to the UK Parliament. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms
 guarantees fundamental rights to everyone including "(a) free-
 dom of conscience and religion; (b) freedom of thought, belief,
 opinion and expressions including freedom of the press and other
 media of information; and (c) freedom of peaceful assembly and
 of association.' The Constitution also guarantees the right to
 vote and to travel freely as well as legal and language rights.
 It provides for judicial review of actions in these areas by the
 federal parliament or provincial legislatures.
 These rights are "subject only to such reasonable limits pre-
 scribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and
 democratic society.' The Parliament or provincial legislatures
 may enact limited exceptions to certain Charter provisions for
 up to five years (renewable for another five) when express decla-
 rations are made that the Act in question shall operate notwith-
 standing the Charter. Otherwise, the Charter of Rights and
 Freedoms places basic human rights beyond the reach of ordinary
 legislative action. The War Measures Act of 1914 permits a
 declaration of a state of emergency with suspension of certain
 civil liberties in the event of war, invasion, or insurrection.
 Canada maintains full commitment to human rights. The Canadian
 public, Parliament and the media are quick to react to any real
 or suspected infringement on basic freedoms, not only in Canada
 but elsewhere in the world. Canada is a staunch supporter of
 United Nations resolutions and declarations on human rights. It
 has played a leading role in stimulating global concern for
 human rights abuses and in working to strengthen international
 human rights machinery. Traditionally a place of refuge for
 victims of oppression in other parts of the world, Canada has
 welcomed large numbers of refugees in addition to contributing
 substantial sums for humanitarian assistance.
 Although legislative protection of human rights falls under the
 jurisdiction of both federal and provincial governments, the
 specific guarantees discussed below are those in existence at
 the federal level, often reinforced by complementary provisions
 in provincial statutes.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 
 
 862
 a. Killing
 There was no politically motivated killing, either by the govern-
 ment or its domestic opposition, in 1982. Political violence is
 rare in Canada. Since the demise of the Quebec Liberation Front
 more than a decade ago, the country was free of such activity
 until the attempted assassination of a Turkish diplomat in April
 1982. Armenian terrorists who claimed credit for that attempt
 struck again in August, murdering the Turkish military attache
 in Ottawa. The country reacted with shock and outrage. Canada's
 Prime Minister condemned the crime and vowed Canada's resolve to
 capture the perpetrators. Security measures were enhanced and
 the Canadian authorities have concentrated considerable resources
 on resolving the case.
 ,b.' Disappearance
 Secret arrest or clandestine detention is contrary to law and
 does not take place in Canada; neither do politically motivated
 disappearances occur.
 c. Torture
 Torture is contrary to Canadian tradition and law. These
 principles and guarantees are respected in practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Criminal Code prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment as does the Bill of Rights. The 1982 Charter of Rights and
 Freedoms also proscribes such punishment. The death penalty has
 been abolished for all crimes except for certain offenses against
 the Code of Military Service Discipline. Prison conditions and
 overcrowding have been topics of public discussion.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The 1982 Constitution, subject to override provisions, prohibits
 arbitrary detention and imprisonment. It also recognizes, the
 right to be informed promptly of reasons for arrest or detention,
 to retain counsel without delay and to be informed of that
 right, to have the validity of the detention determined by way
 of habeas corpus, and to be released if detention is not
 lawful. Accused persons are generally released pending trial,
 and there are provisions for judicial review at specified inter-
 vals when pre-trial detention does occur.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Bill of Rights give
 individuals charged in criminal proceedings the right to a public
 trial before an independent and impartial tribunal. The new
 Charter also guarantees the right not to be tried twice for the
 same offense, the right of witnesses against self-incrimination,
 the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause
 and the right to the assistance of an interpreter.
 More generally, in civil as well as criminal matters, the
 presumption of innocence and the right to a public trial are
 fundamental features of the Canadian legal system. Defendants
 have the right to counsel of their choice. Although there is no
 provision of general application in federal law recognizing the
 right to legal assistance, persons charged with criminal offenses
 under federal law may generally take advantage of provincial
 legal aid programs subsidized by the federal government. The
 
 
 863
 judiciary in Canada is an independent branch of government.
 Judges are appointed by either the federal or provincial govern-
 ment, depending on the level and jurisdiction of the court.
 Secure tenure of judges and standards set by provincial law
 societies contributes to this independence and impartiality.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Code prohibits forcible entry into real property in
 the peaceable possession of another. If a police officer, when
 not authorized to do so in law, conducts a search without a war-
 rant, he becomes an intruder and is subject to legal penalties..
 The 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms also guarantees security
 against unreasonable search or seizure, subject to the exception
 provisions noted above. Upon petition of the Federal Court of
 Canada and with sufficient justification, a law enforcement
 official may be granted a 'Writ of Assistance,* which empowers
 the official with due cause to enter and search premises without
 a specific warrant. The writ, usually issued under the Narcotics
 Control Act, is non-specific and open-ended, empowering the par-
 ticular law enforcement officer throughout his career. According
 to official inquiries, some abuses, including surreptitious
 entry and mail openings, have occurred in the past. Recommen-
 dations were made to ensure adherence to the rule of law in the
 future. In general, Canadian law enforcement agencies enjoy
 high regard and wide public support.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically guarantees
 "freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including
 freedom of the press and other media of communication.'
 In practice, viewpoints representing the complete political
 spectrum are vigorously argued in newspapers and other publi-
 cations across Canada and on the more than 2,000 publicly and
 privately owned broadcasting stations. In most radio and
 television broadcasts, the majority of the content must be of
 Canadian origin. Tax exemptions granted to a Canadian firm
 advertising in Canadian media are not granted if the firm
 advertises in foreign media aiming at a Canadian audience, thus
 discouraging the practice. Subsidized postal rates for Canadian
 publications provide them an advantage over foreign-owned publi-
 cations printed and mailed in Canada and those printed abroad
 and brought into Canada for mailing. Some provinces maintain
 censor boards with authority to delete sexually explicit or
 violent material from films for distribution. In the political
 sphere, opposition party critiques of official policy are widely
 reported and, during parliamentary sessions, daily debates and
 question periods are televised nationwide. A similar practice
 is followed by some provinces.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Noting the exception and *reasonable limits' clauses, the
 Canadian Constitution guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association. Canadian labor unions enjoy notably wide
 freedom of action and, representing 30.6 per cent of the work
 force, play an important role in society and the economy.
 Canadian law recognizes the right of labor in both the public
 and private sector to organize, associate freely, bargain collec-
 tively, and strike. These rights are well established and recog-
 nized in practice, although citing economic circumstances, the
 
 
 864
 federal government and several provinces have passed legislation
 which limits somewhat the collective bargaining rights of public
 sector employees. Federal and provincial legislation proscribes
 discrimination in union membership recruitment and employee
 hiring.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes the fundamental freedom of conscience
 and religion. There is no national religion. The major reli-
 gious groups are Roman Catholic, United, (a union of several
 Protestant groups), Anglican, and Jewish. Others, notably Islam,
 Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikh, have been introduced by more recent
 immigrants. All faiths enjoy freedom of worship and religious
 expression.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens and permanent residents have the constitutional
 right of free movement in Canada; they can live and work in any
 province. The Constitution also protects the right of every
 citizen to enter, remain in, and leave the country. However,
 federal officials have expressed concern over provincial laws
 which inhibit non-residents of a province from working or owning
 land, and which create other barriers to the free flow of
 capital, labor, and services throughout the Canadian economy.
 The Charter of Rights in the new Constitution strengthens the
 right of citizens and permanent residents to establish residence
 in any province and to take up employment there. It mandates
 equality of treatment in employment, subject to exceptions for
 provincial 'affirmative action' programs for socially and econom-
 ically disadvantaged groups. This adjustment will require accom-
 modation of provincial and federal responsibilities and authority
 and may require adjudication by the courts.
 Nearly one-half million refugees and displaced persons have
 resettled in Canada since the end of World War II, including
 75,000 Indochinese admitted since 1979. Canada is a principal
 haven for refugees and immigrants. Over the last five years,
 Canada has admitted one immigrant for every 30 residents, and
 one refugee for every 324 residents--the highest per capita
 ratio of refugees to total population of any country in the
 world. In 1981, Canada contributed approximately forty-three
 million dollars for refugee humanitarian assistance, and a
 similar figure is anticipated for 1982. The Canadian Government
 has taken a major role in focusing international attention on
 the causes of refugee problems, particularly when widespread
 violations of human rights have contributed to mass population
 movements. Private citizens and voluntary organizations play a
 large part in Canadian refugee programs alongside government-
 supported activities. Canada's annual refugee plan for 1982
 called for the admission of 4,000 Indochina refugees, 6,000
 refugees from Eastern Europe, 1,000 from Africa, the Middle East
 and other world areas, plus 2,000 contingency reserve spaces.
 These figures reflect government-sponsored refugee levels and do
 not include more than 4,000 privately sponsored and family
 reunification cases.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Legislative power at the federal level is vested in the House of
 Commons, whose members are elected through universal suffrage
 (in secret ballot by adult Canadian citizens), and in an
 
 
 865
 appointed Senate. Elections for the 282 single-member consti-
 tuencies must be held at least every five years, and participa-
 tion rates are high. In the 32nd Canadian General Election in
 February 1980, more than 11 million Canadians, 69 per cent of
 registered voters, cast ballots. Canadians have complete freedom
 to join and participate actively in the political party of their
 choice. Three parties are represented in the House of Commons
 and several others function in the provincial level. All prov-
 inces and territories have their legislatures.
 Women are increasingly active in Canadian political life. They
 participate fully in political parties and are represented in.
 Parliament and provincial legislatures. A Cabinet Minister is
 charged specifically with responsibility for the status of women.
 A federal Advisory Council on the Status of Women, consisting of
 women with distinguished records in business, government, and
 social service, advises the Minister of Women's Affairs on
 measures to maintain sexual equality within the public service
 and in federal legislation. Canada has ratified the UN Conven-
 tion prohibiting all forms of discrimination against women, and
 the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms contains a clause speci-
 fying that all its provisions pertain equally to men and women.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 Canada has vigorously supported efforts to increase the authority
 of international bodies to investigate and deal with human rights
 abuses. An exhaustive report documenting Canada's observance of
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was
 presented to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva
 in 1980 and has been widely distributed inside Canada. Canadian
 initiatives have been instrumental in achieving major advances
 at recent sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
 Numerous mechanisms and institutions exist in Canada for moni-
 toring human rights practices. The Canadian Human Rights Com-
 mission, established in 1977, is charged with investigating and
 resolving complaints of discrimination in government and business
 activities under federal jurisdiction, and combatting discrim-
 ination through information, education, and research. The Com-
 mission's annual report published in March, 1982, reported over
 23,000 inquiries, the majority for information and referral to
 other authorities. The Commission accepted 479 formal complaints
 in the past year. In addition to recommending amendments in
 legislation affecting Indians, the Commission also advocated
 changes in the Unemployment Insurance Act, measures to reduce
 racial tension and promote affirmative action, aid to disabled,
 and strengthened occupational health and safety codes. Each
 province also maintains a similarly active and effective Human
 Rights Commission.
 Since 1975 a continuing federal-provincial committee of officials
 responsible for human rights has been in existence to provide a
 forum for intergovernmental discussion on matters related to
 human rights in Canada. Canada's Commissioner of Official
 Languages reviews public complaints over violations in statutory
 language rights which guarantee Canadians the right to deal with
 federal institutions in either French or English.
 Non-government human rights organizations and interest groups
 are also active in maintaining high public concern over human
 rights issues in Canada and abroad. The prominent role occupied
 by human rights considerations in Canada's external relations
 
 
 866
 was reinforced in the March, 1982, Annual Conference on Foreign
 Policy and Human Rights, sponsored by the Canadian Human Rights
 Foundation and attended by senior government officials and
 private experts from across the country and abroad.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 Canadians regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background,
 or political opinion. The Canadian government has demonstrated
 a strong commitment to improving the lot of the poor. The
 federal and provincial governments administer extensive social
 welfare programs. An equalization system provides for transfers
 of revenue from the more prosperous provinces to those which are
 relatively less well-off. Education is free up to grade 13.
 All Canadians are covered by a national medical and health
 insurance program. Canada is one of the few countries in the
 world which provide for full automatic indexing of income tax
 levels to adjust for inflation. There is a comprehensive and
 generous program of unemployment insurance compensation adminis-
 tered by the federal Department of Employment and Immigration.
 Over two million Canadians over 65 receive old-age security pay-
 ments.
 A sophisticated system of education, including numerous univer-
 sities and other institutions, both public and private, contri-
 butes to the free flow of ideas. The literacy rate is 98 per
 cent and the primary school enrollment ratio is 102 per cent
 (includes students enrolled from outside the *appropriate' age
 group). The Quebec Superior Court recently overturned portions
 of a provincial law which the court determined restricted the
 education and mobility of English-speaking students. The ruling,
 which hinged on the "reasonable limits' to fundamental freedoms
 versus individual rights, was the first major test of the new
 Constitution. The provincial government is appealing the ruling,
 although it has indicated certain adjustments may be made to the
 language law.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission has recommended steps to
 end sexual discrimination in existing legislation which denies
 Indian status (the right to tribal membership, and related
 benefits) to native women who marry non-Indian men. A section
 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, due to take effect in
 1985 and subject to override provisions, guarantees equal benefit
 and protection of the law without discrimination based on race,
 national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental,
 or physical disability. The delay in entering into force is to
 allow the federal and provincial government time to review and
 adjust existing practices and statutes.
 Associations of Indian, Inuit, and Meti peoples have laid formal
 claim to large areas of Canada, and agreements applying to two
 areas were reached in 1975 and 1978. After extensive study, the
 federal government, in late 1981, reaffirmed its commitment to
 negotiating settlements of claims based on aboriginal title
 relating to traditional use and occupancy of land. The govern-
 ment is offering to extend new benefits and rights in exchange
 for those based on traditional interests. It proved impossible
 to resolve this issue during the constitutional negotiations, so
 the new Constitution specifically *recognized the existing
 aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada,
 without going into further detail. Futhermore, the Charter of
 Rights provides that its guarantees shall not be construed so as
 to derogate from aboriginal rights and freedoms previously recog-
 nized or acquired in land claims settlements. Which aboriginal
 
 
 867
 rights should be constitutionally protected will be the subject
 of a constitutional conference. It will be held by April 1983,
 and include representatives of aboriginal peoples.
 According to a report of the Department of Indian and Northern
 Affairs, native peoples as a group have less access to social
 benefits provided by the government, and suffer traditional
 social problems more deeply, than the mainstream of the popula-
 tion. Infant mortality-rates are twice, and suicide rates three
 times, the national average. Life expectancy is 10 years below
 the national norm and violent death occurs 4 to 5 times more
 frequently than in the country as a whole. Indians occupy penal
 institutions in numbers more than three times their proportion
 of the population, and juvenile delinquency also is around three
 times the national average. Welfare payments are the main source
 of income for just over half the Indian population (which has
 aore than doubled since 1951), the report concludes. Indians
 obtained the franchise in federal elections in 1960 and, during
 the 1950's and 1960's, in the provinces as well. As mentioned
 above, the federal government and the provinces, in concert with
 the Indians, are acting to redress the situation through a series
 of measures, some of which may alter the constitutional basis
 concerning the status of Canada's native peoples. The federal
 budget for Indian affairs is approximately US$820 million in
 fiscal year 1982, one half of which is to be administered by the
 Indians themselves.
 Much emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilingual,
 multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom from
 discrimination while maintaining distinct cultural identities
 with Canada. In particular, the Official Languages Act of 1969
 declared English and French to be equal in status, rights, and
 privileges in all federal institutions. During the 1970's
 federal policies nearly doubled the percentage of officer ranks
 in the public service occupied by francophone Canadians. The
 new Constitution ensures that most Canadians belonging to either
 of the official language groups have the right to educate their
 children in that language, wherever numbers warrant. As noted
 previously, this right already has been successfully defended in
 Quebec's Superior Court., The Constitution does not require
 Quebec to provide English language schools for children of
 immigrants or other non-Canadians.
 Canada's per capita gross national product in 1980 was $10,131,
 compared with $9,640 in 1979. Canada's population of 24,326,000
 (1981 figures) grew by 1.3 percent in 1980. In 1981, the infant
 mortality rate was 12 per 1,000 births and life expectancy (1980)
 was 74.2 years. According to 1976 figures, 98.5 percent of the
 population have access to safe water. The ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements in 1977 was 127 percent.
