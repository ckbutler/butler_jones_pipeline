 Djibouti is a one-party state ruled since independence in 1977
 by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and his People's Assembly
 for Progress (RPP) which has been the only lawful political
 party since 1981. Public life in Djibouti is dominated by two
 ethnic groups, the politically predominant Issa (the tribe of
 the President) and the largest single tribe, the Afar. The
 presidency is considered to be reserved for an Issa and the
 prime ministry for an Afar. Real authority in the Government,
 civil service, party, and armed forces is in Issa hands.
 Djibouti's security services, all under government control,
 include an army of about 3,500 total personnel (primarily
 ground forces with small naval and air units), and three
 national police forces: the National Security Force and the
 National Police, both under the Ministry of the Interior, and
 the Gendarmerie, under the Ministry of Defense, which has been
 involved in human rights violations. France guarantees
 Djibouti's external security and maintains a force of about
 3,800 military and naval personnel in Djibouti.
 Djibouti's narrowly based fledgling economy depends almost
 entirely on services to its (mostly French) 10,000 expatriate
 residents and operation of the seaport, airport, and
 Djibouti-Addis Ababa railroad. Although the State is the
 largest employer, individuals are free to pursue private
 business interests and to hold personal and real property.
 Human rights in Djibouti remained tightly circumscribed in
 1989. Areas of concern included: the continued denial of
 political pluralism, in particular the domination of the
 Government and single legal political party by the Issa tribe;
 restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, and assembly;
 refusal to recognize the refugee rights of Somali nationals
 fleeing the Somali civil war; incidents of arbitrary arrest,
 detention, and deportation; and allegations of the use of
 torture by the security services.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There was no politically motivated killing, but at least one
 person died while in official custody. This occurred after
 the authorities, in the city of Tadjourah in June, arrested
 five persons who protested the method of distribution of
 emergency relief food aid. A young Afar man died under
 unexplained circumstances in a hospital while in police
 custody (see Section l.c.).
 b. Disappearance
 There was no disappearance of persons for political reasons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 According to credible reports, in 1989 branches of the
 Gendarmerie in particular carried out brutal interrogations of
 some detainees (including Somali refugees), which included
 beatings and other physical abuse, and there were allegations
 
 
 99
 DJIBOUTI
 of methodical torture of detainees in isolated cases. The
 death in a hospital of a young Afar man while under
 Gendarmerie custody in the spring sparked renewed public
 allegations of torture by the security authorities. The
 Government did not comment publicly on this incident.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 By law, a person may be detained no more than 48 hours without
 an examining magistrate's formal charge. In practice, this
 deadline is ignored in cases of political interest. An
 accused has the right to legal counsel, which is provided by
 the State, if the accused is destitute. An accused person
 awaiting trial may, by a judge's order, be released on bail or
 on personal recognizance, or be jailed pending the final
 verdict.
 The Director of a prominent U.S. human rights organization was
 detained in 1989 for 4 days without charge, while undertaking
 to ascertain the situation of Somali refugees (see Section
 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Djibouti's legal system is a mixture of Djiboutian legislation
 and executive decrees, French codified law adopted at
 independence, Shari'a (Islamic religious law), and traditions
 of the native nomadic peoples. Crimes in urban areas are
 dealt with according to French-inspired law and judicial
 practice in the regular courts. Civil actions may be brought
 under either French-inspired law in the regular courts or in
 the context of tribal customs in the traditional court.
 Shari'a courts handle only family matters such as marriage,
 divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Decisions of all
 three courts may be appealed to an appeals court of the same
 system. Appellate decisions of all three court systems may be
 appealed to the country's Supreme Court.
 The Tunisian national charged with the fatal 1987 terrorist
 bombing of an outdoor cafe remained in prison awaiting trial
 at the end of 1989.
 A special State Security Court may hear in closed session
 cases of espionage, treason, and acts threatening the public
 order or the "interest of the Republic." This Court last
 convened in 1986.
 Proceedings-in-all courts except the State Security Court are
 open to the public.. The judiciary appears to be generally
 sympathetic to theF-government position and susceptible to
 government influence in cases of political-interest.
 f. Arbitray-Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There werd no reported incidents of arbitrary interference
 with privacy, family, home, or correspondence in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for-Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Those who express public views
 that are critical of, or perceived as threatening to, the
 
 
 100
 DJIBOUTI
 Government face prosecution for cor~mon crimes or detention for
 days or weeks without charge.
 Djibouti's radio and television stations and one newspaper (a
 French-language weekly) are all government owned and
 operated. All media personnel are civil servants. The
 Government's avowed policy is to coordinate the dissemination
 of all information in the interest of national development.
 The news media do report on social and national development
 problems within Djibouti, but the Government itself, its
 policies, and those of neighboring governments are free from
 criticism. The media largely avoid reporting on domestic
 politics and ethnic strife in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia.
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper was removed from office
 in April 1989 (and later reassigned to another ministry) after
 publication of articles unflattering to the Government of
 France. In addition, a journalist was arrested, held for
 3 weeks, and subsequently dismissed from his job in connection
 with the distribution of antigovernment tracts in Tadjourah.
 As a rule, the Government does not censor or forbid the
 importation of books and newspapers, but in 1989 the
 Government banned importation of the book "The Satanic Verses."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government effectively bans political protest by selective
 enforcement of public assembly permit laws and by detention of
 persons without charge. (Detainees in such cases are usually
 released with no ill-treatment within a matter of days, though
 often not within the legally mandated 48-hour period within
 which charges must be filed.) In 1989 public demonstrations
 in protest of the death of the Afar held in custody in
 Tadjourah resulted in the arrests of about 25 persons, of whom
 11 were sentenced to 6 months in prison for unauthorized
 demonstration against the authority of the State.
 Permits for political meetings are not issued outside party
 auspices; it appears that permits for such purposes are sought
 only rarely. Peaceful assembly and association for
 nonpolitical purposes are routinely permitted.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Djibouti respects freedom of religion for all faiths.
 Virtually the entire population is Sunni Muslim. The holy
 days of Islam are legal holidays. The Government and all
 private offices observe Islam's month of Ramadan with a
 shortened workday. However, the Government imposes no
 sanctions on those who choose to ignore Islamic teachings on
 diet, alcohol consumption, religious fasting, etc.
 The expatriate community supports Roman Catholic, French
 Protestant, Greek Orthodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches.
 Less than 1 percent of the population belong to these
 Christian congregations. Foreign clergy and missionaries may
 perform charitable works, but proselytization is a sensitive
 issue and, while not illegal, is strongly discouraged.

 DJIBOUTI
 d.- Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely within Djibouti and may live and
 work where they choose. In 1989 the police increased document
 checkpoints aimed at- controlling crime and especially the
 influx of illegal aliens and refugees from neighboring
 Ethiopia and Somalia. Djiboutians leave for, and return from,
 international travel without restriction or interference.
 Passports are available to all Djiboutians but are invalid for
 travel to Israel and South Africa.
 Djibouti cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist and protect the approximately
 1,500 registered Ethiopian refugees in Djibouti city. As a
 matter of policy, however, the Government does not recognize
 as refugees the approximately 30,000 Somali nationals who have
 fled the Somali civil war.
 Although the Government has an informal agreement with the
 UNHCR that these refugees will not be forcibly repatriated if
 they do not "cause trouble," the UNHCR -in fact has limited
 ability to extend protection to these individuals. The police
 routinely conduct sweeps of people thought to be illegal
 aliens, and some Somali refugees have been deported as a
 result. Africa Watch's October 1989 report indicates that
 many refugees may have perished during the forced repatriation
 in June of 125 people into an isolated area of Somalia. One
 refugee reported that they were pushed across the border into
 Somalia'without shoes, water, or food. To avoid the heat they
 walked during the night. At least 4 of his group of 20
 reportedly died of thirst during the trek.
 Djibouti's treatment of Somali refugees came in for serious
 criticism from international human rights organizations,
 particularly-over several instances of expulsion of Somali
 refugees into northern Somalia. Amnesty International (AI) in
 December 1988 and Africa Watch in December 1989 appealed to
 the Government to ensure that no refugees would be forced to
 return to their country of origin or coerced, ill-treated, or
 arrested if they opposed repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djiboutians have neither the right nor the ability peacefully
 to change their government. The Issa-dominated People's
 Assembly for Progress (RPP) jealously guards its position as
 Djibouti's only political party, a status it has enjoyed since
 the Afar-dominated Djiboutian People's Movement (1MPD) was
 outlawed in 1981. The party chooses the candidates for the
 presidency and-the 65-member National Assembly, a legislative
 body with no real power. Presidential elections are held
 every 7 years, and elections for the National Assembly every 5
 years. Citizens are encouraged to vote, but their only choice
 is whether'to cast a ballot for or against the party's
 candidates. The two different ballots must be cast in
 different boxes, making it obvious who votes against the party.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been responsive in recent years to
 inquiries concerning human rights practices, but it has taken
 
 
 102
 DJIBO=f
 no action to resolve the problems addressed by AI's and Africa
 Watch's appeals on treatment of refugees. There are no
 private human rights organizations in Djibouti.
 The Government speaks out about human rights practices in the
 Israeli-administered territories and in the Republic of South
 Africa but is silent about human rights violations in Djibouti
 and in neighboring Ethiopia and Somalia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The dominant status of the Issa in the party, the civil
 service, and the military is maintained by de facto
 discrimination based on tribe and language against the Afar,
 and discrimination based on tribe against the Isaak and
 Gadaboursi.
 Women in Djibouti legally possess full civil rights but are
 traditionally secondary to men in public life, and generally
 live within the constraints of Shari'a law. Women are active
 in small trade; and many women are employed in offices and
 stores, mostly as clerks and secretaries. There are women,
 though only a few, in the professions (the judiciary,
 medicine, teaching) and in the military and the police.
 According to medical personnel, violence against women--
 including rape and wife beating--appears to occur relatively
 infrequently in Djibouti. Moreover, most domestic and
 community violence is considered a family or tribal matter, is
 dealt with accordingly, and is rarely brought to the attention
 of authorities. The police and courts are almost never
 involved. As a result, it has not become a public or
 government issue, but the party-affiliated Djiboutian National
 Women's Union (DNWU) in November 1988 began a government-
 supported campaign against female circumcision. Progress in
 the campaign has been slow, however, particularly in the
 northern districts, where nomadic traditions of genital
 mutilation of young girls (e.g., clitoral excision and
 infibulation) are widely practiced.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Labor unions play a minimal role in Djibouti. Workers are
 free to join or not to join unions as they choose. There are
 30 individual labor unions in Djibouti, many of which
 represent employees of only one private or state-owned
 corporation. Only a small percentage of Djiboutian workers
 are union members. The Government exerts control over
 individual unions through Djibouti's sole government-organized
 labor central, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers
 (UGTD). Key labor positions in the UGTD are held by persons
 sympathetic to management.
 Workers are free to strike, but in practice most labor action
 is limited to short, wildcat protests.
 The UGTD is affiliated with Africa's continent-wide official
 trade union body, the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. Unions are free to maintain relations and exchange
 programs with unions and labor organizations in other
 countries. A representative of the American Federation of
 Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations's
 
 
 103
 DJIBOUTI
 African-American Labor Center led a seminar in Djibouti on
 union administration in February.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law recognizes labor's right to organize and bargain
 collectively. In practice, formal collective bargaining
 virtually does not exist; relations between workers and
 employers are informal and paternalistic. On questions of
 wages and health and safety conditions, the Ministry of Labor
 encourages direct, ad hoc resolution by labor representatives
 and employers. Either workers or employers may initiate a
 formal administrative hearing at which the Labor Inspection
 Service of the Ministry of Labor mediates. Wages are set by
 employers in consultation with the Ministry of Labor to assure
 adherence to mandatory minimum wage regulations.
 There are no export procbssing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Prohibited by law, there is neither forced nor compulsory
 labor in Djibouti.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of 14 yeats for employment is respected
 in practice. Children may and do work in family-owned
 businesses such as restaurants and small shops, including at
 night. Children are not employed under hazardous conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates are specified by government regulations and
 by categories of workers and are enforced by the Ministry of
 Labor. Increased last in 1976, minimum wages begin at less
 than $80 a month for unskilled laborers and reach nearly
 $1,400 a month for "directors" and medical doctors. The
 minimum wage in most cases does not provide a decent living
 for a worker and his family. However, many workers also
 receive housing or housing allowances and transportation and
 food allowances. Mandatory seniority bonuses range from 4
 percent of the worker's basic salary after 2 years of service
 to a maximum 52 percent after 26 years of service.
 The legislated maximum workweek is 40 hours, often spread over
 a 6-day workweek. Overtime pay regulations apply to
 additional work. Workers are guaranteed daily and weekly rest
 periods and paid annual vacations. The Ministry of Labor
 enforces occupational health and safety, work hours, and wages
 regulations through inspection, dispute mediation, and
 administrative judgment by the labor inspection service.
 These regulations are vigorously enforced.
