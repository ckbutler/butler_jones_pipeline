 BOLIVIA
 With a 1978 per capita income of $360, Bolivia
 ranks among the poorest countries in Latin America.
 Historically weak governments, frequent coups
 and general political instability have been impediments
 to economic and social progress and a source of
 frequent violation of human rights. However, in
 1971, following a bloody coup by General Hugo
 Banzer, the situation began to improve. In the
 next seven years, Bolivia enjoyed relative political
 stability and economic growth.
 In 1977, the Banzer Government initiated a liberali-
 zation of virtually all ma3or restrictions on
 human rights and scheduled elections for July 1978.
 Elections were held as planned but the vote counting
 was marred by serious irregularities and the National
 Electoral Court annulled the results. Immediately
 thereafter, General Juan Perqda, one of the candidates
 in the election, seized power in a bloodless coup and
 over the next four months maintained the human rights
 momentum of the last year of the Banzer Government.
 During that period, Pereda's Government abrogated the
 feared state security law and pledged to hol new
 elections and turn over power to an elected Government
 within two years.
 Many members of the military and civilian political
 opposition desired an election earlier than the May 1980
 date set by Pereda. This sentiment was a major factor
 leading to the November 24 bloodless overthrow by the
 Commander in Chief of the Army, General David Padilla
 Arancibia. The new Government has called elections for
 July 1, 1979 with the elected Government to take office
 on August 6, 1979.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 (216)
 
 
 217
 a. Torture
 No reports of torture have been received since the
 Banzer Government released all remaining political
 prisoners in early 1978.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In addition to releasing political prisoners, each
 of the Governments that ruled in 1978 made an effort
 to improve the treatment of persons still in jail.
 Altnough no officers guilty of mistreatment of prisoners
 during arrest or interrogation appear to have been
 fined or incarcerated for such offenses, they have been
 criticized by higher authorities and transferred to less
 sensitive posts.
 No reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
 or punishment have been received following the November
 takeover of the Government by General Padilla.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In January 1978, under pressure of a hunger strike,
 the Banzer Government announced a general political
 amnesty for all Bolivians in exile. Since then, there
 has been a significant reduction in incidents of
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. The Permanent
 Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR), domiciled in
 Bolivia, maintains that 450 people were detained
 without trial for various periods in 1977 but that
 this figure declined to fewer than one hundred in 1978.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Pereda Government significantly improved per-
 formance in this area. While justice continues to
 move slowly in Bolivia because of inherent faults
 in the judicial system--antiquated procedures,
 shortage of qualified personnel, etc.--cases of
 individuals being arrested for various reasons
 and held for more than a few days without being
 given a fair public trial have decreased dramatically
 to just a few in 1978. One such instance occurred
 
 
 218
 in early November 1978 when several persons were
 arrested in connection with a foiled coup attempt
 against Pereda. While keeping tnem under detention,'
 the Government used various legal technicalities
 to delay a hearing on an application for a writ
 of habeas corpus by Oscar Garcia and others
 arrested on suspicion of plotting against the
 regime. The reason for this action was that
 Garcia had been severely beaten and was unable
 to appear in court. Immediately after the November
 coup, General Padilla released these men from
 prison. Also, on the positive side, all political
 prisoners remanded to the courts for trial in
 early 1978 were released for lack of evidence.
 Particularly significant was the repeal in August
 of the 1972 law on the security of the state
 which allowed the Banzer Government to overrule
 constitutional guarantees, including habeas corpus.
 In 1978 the United States and Bolivia signed a
 treaty allowing Atmerican and Bolivian nationals
 convicted of crimes in the other country to serve
 out their sentences in their own country. Under
 this treaty seven American prisoners were repatriated
 in August.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Bolivian security authorities have in the past made
 occasional invasions of homes in the mining and out-
 lying agricultural areas. During such searches
 the authorities claimed to be looking for "subversives"
 and "subversive literature". In 1978 the number of such
 incidents declined to just a few and no reports of
 invasions of the home were received following the most
 recent takeover.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Bolivian Indian, generally illiterate and
 presently served by totally inadequate educational,
 health and other services, represents more than
 fifty percent of the country's population. Most
 
 
 219
 Indians today own the land they cultivate and
 enjoy other rights of citizenship as a result of
 the traumatic 1952 social revolution. But, as
 they have for centuries, they continue to eke out
 only a subsistence income from the thin soils of
 Bolivia's mountain slopes and the desolate high
 plateaus between the Andes ranges. The Bolivian
 Government hopes to improve the Indians' status
 through its Five-Year Economic ana Social Development
 Plan for the 1976-80 period.
 The Plan emphasizes a rapid growth, export oriented
 strategy. It calls for improving national income dis-
 tribution, incorporating the rural population (which
 constitutes over sixty percent of the entire population)
 into the modern life of the country, and improving
 the welfare of the poorest elements through educa-
 tion, health and agricultural programs.
 The Five-Year Plan announced by President Banzer
 in 1976, calls for annual growth in agricultural
 production to reach 7.4 percent by 1980. In support
 of its agricultural sector objectives, President
 Banzer increased the Minister of Agriculture's budget
 Dy 56 percent in 1976, the first operational year of
 the Plan. However, from 1977 to 1978 the Government, as
 part of an austerity program, was forced to make reauc-
 tions in the Ministry of Agriculture's budget in propor-
 tion with those made in other ministries' budgets.
 The Pereda Government's agricultural policy, in keep-
 ing with the Plan's goals, gave priority to commercial
 crop development while concurrently striving for self-
 sufficiency in food production for domestic consumption.
 Overall performance in the agricultural sector has
 been somewhat varied in recent years as a result of
 climatic conditions and Government agricultural policies.
 domestic wheat production reached 48,000 metric tons
 in 1977. Bolivia imports most of the wheat necessary
 to meet annual demand and the US supplies most of the
 imports. The 1978 sugar crop reached record levels--
 263,107 metric tons. Cotton production increased by
 
 
 about five percent in 1978--to 16,000 metric tons.
 Approximately 14,000 metric tons were exported. Non-
 traoitional agricultural products which are currently
 exported include timber, coffee, beef, and rice.
 Five-Year Plan goals for the health sector are to
 increase life expectancy from 47 to 52 years by 1980,
 to reduce the high mortality and morbidity rates by
 six percent and eight percent respectively, and to
 strengthen health services. Despite a limited resource
 base, the Ministry of Health doubled its investment
 budget in 1976 and has since concentrated on construction
 and renovation of health facilities. Currently available
 to only fifteen percent of the rural population, the
 Government is implementing a pilot project to test
 systems for the delivery of low-cost health services
 to rural communities.
 Not only is Bolivia's population predominantly rural
 and illiterate, but most do not speak Spanish as a
 first language. The Five-Year Plan calls for improving
 the quality and relevance of education for some one
 iillion rural youth between the ages of five ana nineteen
 and for reducing illiteracy by two percent by 1980.
 For 1978, education expenaitures constitute 24.3 percent
 of the Central Government's budget, the largest single
 item.
 The Bolivian housing program has been directea toward
 urban requirements. Recently, however, the Pereda Govern-
 ment had expressed interest in extending low-cost hous-
 ing and the savings and loan system to the countryside.
 Urban poverty is widespread. To help raise urban
 employment levels, the Pereda Government had begun to
 establish Bolivia's first Government employment service
 in La Paz and was initiating with World Bank financing
 a training program for skilled workers.
 The success of Bolivia's Five-Year Plan depends on
 a healthy and growing economy. Currently falling
 exports and diminishing foreign reserves will
 adversely affect limited resources available to
 the Padilla Government to achieve its ambitious
 goals.
 
 
 221
 Such corruption as exists does not seem to prevent
 citizens from receiving vital services. It is too
 early to tell whether or not President Padilla will
 alter the economic and social development plan.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 ana Assembly
 During 1978 tne Government removed all legal restric-
 tions inhioiting full and free exercise of these rights.
 The new Government headed by General Padilla has not
 reintroduced these restrictions. It appears there are
 now no legal or other restrictions inhibiting free
 exercise ot these rights. However, the Bolivian press
 is wiaely believed to practice a form of self-censorship
 as evidencea in the Oscar Garcia habeas corpus proceeaings
 under the Pereda Government in November 1978.
 In February the 1974 decrees suspending trade union
 freedoms were lifted and unions are now negotiating
 and obtaining significant wage gains for their members.
 Also since last February other decrees atfecting the
 universities and professional groups have been repealed.
 All elements of the Bolivian University system have
 regained their autonomy and have either held their
 elections or have scheduled them for the near future.
 Traditionally, women have not enjoyed equal opportunity
 in Bolivia. However, altnough there are few women
 in the professions, there are some women lawyers who
 hold high positions in several ministries. Also,
 Inaian women in urban and rural areas are a major part
 of the commercial sector and contribute substantially
 to tamily incomes. They have considerable responsibi-
 lities in running small businesses and farms. The
 Government's National Community Development Service
 recently established a specitic division to
 deal with the problems of rural women. Moreover,
 
 
 222
 
 in at least two of the regional development corpora-
 tions special attention is being paid to the role
 of women in rural development.
 D. Freedom of movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 In January 1978 the Government eliminatea all restric-
 tions on freedom of movement within Bolivia and on
 foreign travel. All Bolivians living in exile were
 allowed to return following a January 1978 political
 amnesty. Moreover, the systemn of "residenciamiento"
 (restrictions on movement or activity) has been
 completely abolished. There have been no reports of
 restrictions imposed by the new Government on the
 freedom of movement within the country or on foreign
 travel. Nor has General Padilla forced any Bolivians
 into exile.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 On July 9, 1978, Bolivia held its first national
 elections since 1966. Tne campaign up until the
 weeKend of the election was generally open and
 honest. Violations of the democratic process occurrea,
 such as significant bias on the part of the national
 television system in favor of tne "orficial" candidate,
 General Pereda, but they were considerably fewer in
 number and far less serious than in previous election
 campaigns. In addition, random incidents of violence
 occurred in the last few days. On election day, however,
 there was widespread fraud in favor of Pereda and, to
 a lesser extent, in favor of one of the opposition
 candidates. The serious extent of the fraud was attested
 to by an international commission invited to Bolivia
 by the Permanent Assemoly on Human Rights.
 At the request of Pereda, who probably received a
 plurality of the total vote, the election returns
 were annulled by the National Electoral Court which
 suggested that new elections be held within six months.
 However, on July 21, Pereda led a successful coup against
 President Banzer and assumed the Presidency.
 
 
 223
 The coup was a major setback to the democratization
 process that had been set in motion by President
 Banzer in November 1977. But General Pereda promised
 new elections by August 1980 and respected the rights
 of the opposition political parties to operate freely.
 On November 24, after barely four months in power,
 President Pereda was deposed by his Army Commander,
 General Padilla. General Padilla had become dis-
 satisfied over the apparent delay in holding elections
 and, with the support of young military officers,
 assumed the Presidency. The new Government immediately
 called Presidential and Congressional elections for
 July 1, 1979, with the elected Government scheduled
 to take office on Independence Day, August 6, 1979.
 An issue still to be decided before new elections
 can be scheduled is the right of trade union leaders
 to be candidates for national office. They were unable
 to run under the election law used in the 1978 elections.
 Due to considerable protest by both the trade unions
 and the political parties, this provision of the
 electoral law was being reconsidered by the Pereda
 Government.
 In the July elections, the Indian peasants, who con-
 stitute over half of the electorate, demonstrated
 increased political consciousness. In every election
 since universal suffrage was introduced in 1952, this
 group had solidly supported the Government candidate.
 In the 1978 election, however, perhaps half of the
 Bolivian peasantry voted for opposition candidates.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal organization in Bolivia promoting respect
 for human rights is the Permanent Assembly on Human
 Rights (PAHR). Bolivian Government officials criticiz-
 ed the PAHR for supporting a December 1977-January
 
 
 224
 1978 hunger strike (which forced the Government to
 grant a general political amnesty) and tor inviting
 a group of international observers to oversee the July
 election process. Nevertheless, President Pereda,
 while Minister of the Interior under Banzer, tried
 to maintain a relatively cooperative working relationship
 with the PAHR. The Government invited the Organization
 of American States to send a delegation to observe the
 July 9 elections and accepted its report without comment.
 However, tne Government was severely critical of what
 it considered to be a biased report made by the group
 invited by the PAHR. The group denounced the wide-
 spread fraud carried out in favor of General Pereda
 but aid not comment on incidents of fraud committed
 in favor or one of the opposition candidates.
 The present Government of Bolivia remains undecided
 about becoming a signatory to the American Convention
 on Human Rights (San Jose Pact). As a member ot the
 United Nations Security Council, Bolivia has expressed
 its concerns over the Namibia question and its numan
 rights implications.
