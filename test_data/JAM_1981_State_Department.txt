 JAMAICA
 
 Jamaica is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy.
 The two major political parties, the Jamaican Labour
 Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP),
 have alternated in power since the first elections
 held under universal adult suffrage in 1944.   Prime
 Minister Edward Seaga, leader of the JLP, won the
 general elections in October 1980. His government
 is constitutionally required to hold the next parliamentary
 election sometime before the end of 1985. Violence
 has been a growing problem in Jamaican elections,
 culminating in the death of hundreds in the long,
 hard-fought 1980 campaign.
 The electronic media are government-owned, as is one
 of the daily newspapers (which the new government
 has offered for sale). The government has not approved
 license requests to establish privately-owned radio
 and television facilities. Jamaica's two most widely
 read daily newspapers are published by one private
 company. There is a Communist Party newspaper, and
 the opposition PNP has announced plans to launch its
 own monthly paper.
 Jamaicans have a high respect for human rights, which
 generally prosper in Jamaica's open society with its
 strong democratic traditions. Despite difficult economic
 circumstances and substantial political violence in
 1980, Jamaica continued its strong record of observing
 human rights. Jamaica's legal system is based on
 English common law and an independent judiciary.
 The constitution provides for an independent director
 of public prosecutions to pursue criminal cases and
 for an independant commission to oversee or inquire
 into allegations of official misconduct.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution and is not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Legal prohibitions against cruel, inhuman and degrading
 treatment or punishment are respected. Access to
 detainees by relatives, attorneys, physicians and
 friends is routine. Prison conditions are austere.
 Jamaica has the death penalty, which is used in cases
 involving murder.
 There have been occasional claims of beatings and
 (T1)
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 31
 
 
 472
 other abuses by police, and some members of opposition
 parties have charged the police force with politically
 motivated harassment. Most observers concede that
 there is a small minority of individuals within the
 police force who have abused their authority, especially
 during the highly-charged election campaign when the
 security forces actively attempted to control violence,
 and during the ongoing efforts against criminal gunmen.
 These instances are unusual and are not official policy.
 Officials committing illegal acts are liable for punishment,
 although most reported incidents do not lead to prosecution.
 In 1981 new procedures were introduced in the police
 force to register and investigate complaints. As
 of September 1981, 24 policemen had been brought to
 court during the year on charges ranging from dishonesty
 to murder. In November a Jamaican court sentenced
 a policeman to five years imprisonment for abuse of
 authority. A total of 32 regular officers were dismissed
 from the force. In addition, 42 officers were suspended
 during the first nine months of 1981 pending judicial
 or administrative resolution of the charges against
 them.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that people have been subject
 to secret arrests, abduction or clandestine detention
 by any official groups. Habeas corpus is guaranteed
 by the constitution and respected by the courts and
 police.
 d. Arbitrary Arrests and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners. Arbitrary detention
 without trial does not occur. Delays in trial are
 common. A "gun court," established in 1974 as an
 extraordinary means of dealing with the serious problem
 of violent crime, considers cases involving the illegal
 use or possession of firearms or ammunition. After
 arraignment, the "gun court" has allowed some pre-
 trial detentions lasting months, and convictions carry
 a mandatory life sentence.   Reforms in "gun court"
 procedures are under consideration.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jamaica has an independent judiciary. In regular
 courts, accused persons receive a fair public trial,
 in accordance with constitutional and legal guarantees
 and standards. Legal counsel is provided to indigents
 in criminal cases. Restrictions on public attendance
 and less stringent rules of evidence apply in the
 "gun court," where cases are conducted before a judge
 except in murder cases, when the trial is heard by
 a jury.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Jamaican law requires judicial warrants before
 entry, except during those times when the "supression
 of crime act" is in force. The act, passed by the
 parliament in response to violence which threatened
 the national peace and tranquility, is currently in
 force until January 1982, when it could be further
 extended at the initiative of the government. Although
 
 
 473
 the act authorizes Jamaica Defense Force (JDF) personnel
 to operate alongside the police, since the violence-
 ridden election period JDF personnel have only rarely
 exercised this authority on raids into areas infested
 by criminals. No search warrant is required under
 this.act, but regulations approved by parliament in
 1980 require that every effort be made by the security
 forces to have the owner or occupier of the premises
 present during the search. There are no substantiated
 reports of serious abuses of the right to the sanctity
 of the home.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are
 guaranteed in the constitution and are observed in
 practice. There is no official censorship of the
 media, books or art, nor is there any interference
 in academic studies. Jamaica's principal independently
 owned newpaper, the "Daily Gleaner," has been highly
 critical of previous governments and is continuing
 its role of independent critic. The government-owned
 "Daily News," which has often favored the opposition
 PNP in its coverage and columns, has been offered
 for sale as part of the government's divestment program,
 but no new owner has been announced. Several smaller
 newspapers and magazines are published. The Communist
 Party publishes a bi-weekly paper, and the opposition
 PNP has announced plans to issue a monthly newspaper
 in conjunction with the National Workers Union and
 other affiliated groups. Foreign publications are
 available, but expensive.
 The electronic media are government-owned, and the
 Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC) has, at times,
 been accused of political bias by the principal political
 parties. The smaller of Jamaica's two radio stations
 has maintained a politically neutral stance. Some
 employees of the JBC were declared redundant shortly
 after the new government assumed power and were fired.
 The dismissed workers filed suit, charging a violation
 of the Labor Relations and Industrial Disputes Act,
 and the matter currently is before the courts. The
 current government has announced its intention to
 introduce legislation to make the publicly owned media
 more independent of political influences. Like the
 previous government, the current one has denied applications
 to open independent radio and television stations.
 Public demonstrations and rallies are integral to
 Jamaican politics and frequently are staged by the
 major parties without government interference. A
 large variety of professional groups exist and are
 free from official harassment. Many different churches
 and religious sects operate freely; membership confers
 neither advantage nor disadvantage.
 Jamaica has a strong, organized labor movement which
 contributes many leaders to the political process.
 The two major unions, the Bustamante Industrial Trade
 Union and the National Workers Union, are aligned
 with the two major political parties but operate as
 independent organizations which differ at times with
 
 
 474
 both political movements. Unions participate extensively
 in labor-related policy decisions and make active
 use of the bargaining rights in the Labor Relations
 and Industrial Disputes Act of 1975. Jamaican workers,
 including government workers, have the right, which
 they have exercised, to strike.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees freedom of movement.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration,
 although the government has for some years restricted
 the amount of foreign exchange made available for
 travel abroad. Refugees have not been attracted to
 Jamaica. There is no evidence of discriminatory treatment
 of travellers based on nationality, race or sex.
 Jamaica gives its nationals free right of re-entry
 and residence in the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens 18 years of age and over areeligible
 to vote.   No group is denied the right to participate
 in political activity. An electoral commission with
 bipartisan membership, created in 1979, was very involved
 in preparation for the 1980 elections and implemented
 a number of procedural changes to protect the integrity
 of the electoral process. While there were some charges
 of impropriety in that election, these were recognized
 to be beyond the control of the official election
 machinery. Despite extensive violence during the
 campaign, 86 percent of registered voters turned out
 at the polls. Women have equality with men under
 the law, but in practice they suffer economic discrimination,
 particularly lower pay and more difficult access to
 some jobs. The previous government changed Jamaican
 law to provide a procedure by which children born
 out of wedlock may be legitimized.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violation of Human Rights
 The previous government invited Amnesty International
 to investigate allegations of violations of human
 rights at any time. Amnesty International replied
 that it saw no need for such a mission. There has
 been little interest by international or non-governmental
 groups in investigation of human rights in Jamaica.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 After a decline of 5.4 per cent in gross domestic
 product in 1980, some positive growth took place in
 1981. This will mean the first increase in real income
 and hence in living standards that Jamaicans have
 experienced in eight years. The inflation rate, which
 was 28.6 per cent in 1980, is expected to be about
 11 percent in 1981. There were 39,900 more people
 in jobs in April 1981 than in April 1980, and the
 unemployment rate declined from 27.0 percent to 26.2
 percent for the same period.
 Like its predecessor, the Seaga government is committed
 
 
 475
 to social programs and plans to devote a sizeable
 part of the national budget to these neecs. The quality
 of health care, which had suffered drastically due
 to the increasing migration of physicians, is still
 a problem for the government.   However, the emigration
 of doctors seems to be slowing, and public hospitals
 are again obtaining the specialists they need. Government
 spending for health related services will also show
 an increase during 1981.
 The need for low-cost housing is exacerbated by high
 contruction costs and high interest rates. The Seaga
 government is committed to lowering the cost of housing.
 In addition, some housing projects left unfinished
 by the previous government due to lack of funds or
 vandalism are now being completed and sold.
 Jamaica's educational system is free, but families
 are experiencing difficulties in meeting costs for
 books and uniforms. The Seaga government places a
 high priority on improving the quality and quantity
 of schools, and spending for education represents
 the largest single item for social services. The
 education budget for 1981 is also substantially larger
 than last year's allocation. The adult literacy rate
 is officially given at 86 percent. Ninety-eight percent
 of primary school age children are enrolled in schools.
 Women are assured equal rights under the law and constituted
 47 percent of the work force in October 1980, the
 date of the last available survey.
