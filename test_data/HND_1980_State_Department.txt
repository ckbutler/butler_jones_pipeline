 HONDURAS
 In July 1980, Honduras ended seven and a half years of
 military rule with the inauguration of a popularly elected
 constituent assembly. The country is now undergoing
 a transitional political process which is scheduled to
 culminate with general elections in the latter part of
 1981. The current provisional government, which replaced
 a three-man military junta, is jointly composed of officials
 named by the major political parties and representatives
 of the military. The former head of the military junta,
 General Policarpo Paz Garcia, was named provisional president
 by the constituent assembly, which has asserted the supremacy
 of civilian rule.
 Honduras is a developing country with serious economic
 and social problems -- illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition
 and inadequate health care. Freedom of speech, press,
 religion, assembly and emigration are respected. Legal
 guarantees against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 and against torture or degrading treatment are observed
 in practice, although the administration of justice is
 hindered by an overburdened and inadequately financed
 court system.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There were no reports of torture during 1980. Torture
 is specifically prohibited by the Honduran constitution
 (Article 65) and criminal legislation.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The press reports freely on allegations of mistreatment
 by local police. The use of unnecessary force and brutality
 is sometimes alleged, most often during the arrest process.
 Members of the police are subject to dismissal for abuses
 against the public, a sanction which is sometimes applied.
 No figures have been published this year regarding such
 dismissals, however. The new national police commander,
 who took office in August 1980, has publicly committed
 himself to vigorous disciplinary action against police
 overreaction.
 With few exceptions, jail conditions are poor, although
 there is one new prison for women only, and a similar
 one for men is planned. Access to prisoners is not a
 problem for relatives, attorneys, consular officials
 or international humanitarian organizations; on occasion,
 press visits are allowed. If delays occur, they are
 the result of inefficiency rather than any deliberate
 policy to prevent communications with prisoneis.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no abductions, secret arrests or clandestine
 detentions in Honduras.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Honduras. Habeas
 corpus is guaranteed by the constitution and Honduran
 law provides for arraignment within 24 hours of arrest.
 This appears to be the practice in most cases, although
 
 
 467
 hearings may be delayed due to administrative backlogs.
 When there is reasonable indication of an offense, Honduran
 legal procedures permit the judge to hold a person for
 up to six days for questioning before determining if
 charges are to be brought. If the judge determines that
 there is sufficient evidence to warrant trial, charges
 are then specified in a court order. The individual
 may then be held pending further investigations. Bail
 is allowed in many cases.
 One highly publicized incident provided the basis for
 leftist accusations that Honduran authorities were holding
 political prisoners. In April 1980, an American businessman
 was kidnapped by armed terrorists. He escaped hours
 after the kidnapping'and his abductors were taken into
 custody and charged. Leftist groups labelled those accused
 in the case as 'political prisoners", while the government
 argued that they were common criminals. The accused
 were subsequently released under the terms of a broadly-
 phrased amnesty decreed by the constituent assembly in
 September 1980 which encompassed individuals involved
 in both common and politically motivated crimes. Persons
 released under the amnesty included alleged members of
 Communist Party front groups as well as alleged members
 of Cuban-supported terrorist organizations.
 A continuing problem involves the detention of peasants
 on charges such as arson, cattle rustling, wood cutting,
 destruction of fences, and theft, often in connection
 with land disputes and invasions. Peasant federations
 frequently claim that the charges are a form of harassment,
 while landowners claim that crimes have in fact been
 committed. Honduran authorities have in the past occasion-
 ally resorted to intimidation, including deportation
 of foreign-born religious, to discourage political activism
 among peasants. However, during 1980 no verified inci-
 dents of that nature have been reported.
 Agrarian unrest, with attendant illegal land occupations
 and sporadic tension, is not new in Honduras. Pressure
 tactics by peasant groups are sometimes used to force
 more rapid implementation of agrarian reform laws. In
 fact, after moving squatters off land, the government
 in many caseg .wards that or other land to them under
 the terms of the law.
 Honduran military and police generally seek, success-
 fully, to handle agrarian incidents without serious violence.
 Persons arrested in past years as a result of such incidents
 were also released under the terms of the 1980 amnesty.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Honduran judicial system suffers from a number of
 problems. Reform has been a stated goal of recent supreme
 court presidents. Efficient application of justice suffers
 from a lack of tenure for judges, an archaic legal code
 and a chronic shortage of funds. Access to the legal
 process often varies with the socio-economic standing
 of the litigant. Inordinately long delays are frequently
 encountered in the administration of justice and the
 system is overburdened. The judiciary's budget was substan-
 tially increased in 1979, and increased further in 1980.
 With all of its problems, the judiciary does act, and
 there were cases of military officers brought to trial
 in civilian courts and convicted of criminal offenses
 even under the previous military government.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 
 
 468
 There are no reports involving invasion of the home,
 the sanctity of which is protected by the constitution
 and criminal code.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Honduran per capita GNP is approximately $500. During
 the period 1975-79, the country has enjoyed a growth
 of real gross domestic product averaging 6 to 7 percent
 per annum. Agricultural export gains resulting from
 high international commodity prices and expanded production
 were the most dynamic factors spurring the increase.
 However, during 1980 real growth dropped sharply, to
 perhaps as low as 2 percent. Disappointing export perfor-
 mance, related in part to falling coffee prices, together
 with a large domestically financed budget deficit explain
 the decline. Until recently, inflation has been relatively
 moderate (6-1/2 to 8 percent per year). However, it
 has gotten as high as 20 percent during the last twelve
 months.
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the Honduran economy.
 Historically, bananas dominated the scene, but in recent
 years there has been considerable diversification of
 export crops. In 1977, coffee replaced bananas as the
 principal foreign exchange earner. Coffee production
 is distributed among 45,000 families, most of whom are
 small land owners. Meat, lumber, cotton and tobacco
 are other important exports. About 62 percent of the
 population lives in rural areas. Most are small farmers
 producing at little more than subsistence level. Agrarian
 reform laws passed in 1962 and 1975 are being implemented
 with relative success; since 1973 more than 30,000 families
 have been resettled on agrarian reform land.
 Despite the economic progress achieved in recent years,
 Honduras has many problems to overcome, including malnutri-
 tion, inadequate health care, and a population growth
 rate approaching 3.5 percent. The government has been
 vigorous in addressing these concerns. In 1974, it embarked
 on an ambitious five year development plan, the primary
 objectives of which were to integrate the rural poor
 into the national economy and substantially increase
 social services in rural areas. The plan was relatively
 successful despite implementation problems. The present
 (1979-83) five year plan continues this commitment.
 Government expenditures for economic and social development
 in agriculture, education and health have increased substan-
 tially, and in 1979-80 represented over 40 percent of
 the total budget. In contrast, defense (including police
 forces) accounted for 7.5 percent of the budget. Under
 the five year plan investments are being made in basic
 infrastructure, including transportation, communications
 and energy, as well as health, education, health care
 delivery and agrarian reform.
 Land reform efforts suffer from shortages of capital
 and technical assistance. Programs of agricultural research
 and extension, crop diversification and storage, have
 been expanded. In 1975 the ministry of health instituted
 a program to extend basic health services to the rural
 areas. Primary education is provided to an estimated
 54 percent of primary school-age children, although a
 high percentage of these never finish primary or begin
 secondary school. Just over half the population can
 read and write. In April 1980, the Honduran government
 launched a literacy campaign. to improve this record.
 
 
 469
 It is generally acknowledged by Hondurans that corrup-
 tion continues to be a problem at most levels of government
 and society, but there is no indication that the practice
 has seriously undermined economic development.
 By reason of tradition and custom, most women are restricted
 to activities involving health and home. Women aged
 15 to 60 constitute 18.4 percent of the labor force.
 Based on 1974 census data, outside of the agricultural
 sector, women most often are employed as domestic servants,
 clerical workers, itinerant or market vendors, and in
 food processing or other manufacturing. In public service,
 women are sometimes discriminated against, although there
 are now several women members of the constituent assembly.
 Women also now serve as members of the uniformed police
 force.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion are respected.
 There is no censorship of the media, although books and
 other materials are sometimes confiscated from travelers
 returning from communist countries. These confiscations
 are often vigorously denounced in the press.
 Restrictions imposed since 1972 on freedom of assembly
 for political'parties were lifted in early 1980 in prepara-
 tion for the April election of a eonstituent assembly.
 Party activities have continued without restrictions.
 A number of small radical political groups exist and
 are tolerated in practice, including the Honduran Communist
 Party, although they are currently barred by the electoral
 tribunal from participation in the electoral process.
 Leaders of both major parties in the present constituent
 assembly support the legalization of all groups willing
 to participate in the electoral process. Student, worker,
 peasant and other interest groups have freedom to organize
 and frequently hold public demonstrations without interfer-
 ence.
 The Honduran press conducts a lively national debate free
 of government control. In spite of occasional government
 expressions of annoyance, the media criticizes both govern-
 ment programs adid civilian and military government leaders
 frequently and freely. No incidents of official interference
 with the media were recorded in 1980. However, the govern-
 ment has been known to occasionally manifest displeasure
 by withholding advertising. The government has also
 informally suggested that items not be published, to
 influence media treatment of issues.
 Honduras has a long tradition of effective and democra-
 tic trade union activities. The labor movement is well
 organized and has a history of service to its constituency.
 Trade unions are not hampered by the government and provide
 members with advisory services, health benefits, and
 housing benefits. The usual reasons for strikes are
 improved wages, grievances, and efforts to gain recognition
 from employers. Although unions are guaranteed the right
 to organize and bargain, Honduras' labor code includes
 a cumbersome procedure of negotiation and arbitration
 before a union can go on strike legally. In fact, unions
 often strike without waiting for this procedure, resulting
 
 
 470
 in some strikes being declared illegal. Subsequent agreements
 generally render these declarations of illegality moot,
 however.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These rights are respected in Honduras, although travel
 to and from El Salvador continued to be restricted during
 most of 1980 because of an unresolved border dispute, that
 erupted in war in 1969. A peace treaty was signed in
 Lima, Peru on October 30, 1980, which reestablishes official
 relations between the two countries and will facilitate
 travel between Honduras and El Salvador. Honduras served
 as the first point of refuge for many Nicaraguans during
 the 1978-79 civil war and several thousand have since
 been granted resident status. During 1980, Salvadoran
 refugees estimated in the thousands have fled to Honduras
 to escape civil conflict in the rural Salvadoran countryside.
 Honduran authorities have generally responded well to the
 refugees' needs, despite limited resources.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Constitutional government had been suspended and political
 activity sharply curtailed since December 1972. During
 1980, however, the rights of all recognized political
 parties were fully restored in preparation for the April
 election of a constituent assembly. A massive voter
 census and registration process, which had begun in August
 1978 and ended a year later, enrolled over 1.2 million
 persons out of an estimated eligible electorate of 1.4
 million. Over a million citizens actually voted, and
 the turnout of over 82 percent of the electorate was
 unprecedented in Honduran history. Charges were frequently
 aired before the election that the results would be rigged
 in favor of the National Party, one of Honduras' two
 major political forces. Instead, the rival Liberal Party
 secured a majority of the vote in an election which was
 widely praised for its openness and honesty.
 Even during the post-1972 period of military government,
 civilian political parties, labor unions, trade organiza-
 tions and other interest groups were free to organize
 and articulate their positions. Political parties continue
 to have access to the media. While no parties are formally
 banned, only those which are legally recognized can appear
 on the ballot. Recognition is obtained after completing
 a process provided for in the electoral law. The Christian
 Democratic Party was unable to present candidates for
 the April 1980 constituent assembly elections, having
 failed to overcome legal challenges to its registration
 in time to participate. These were based on unsubstantiated
 allegations that the party receives funds from overseas
 and that it advocates violence; both charges were vigorously
 denied. Final exclusion from the April 1980 election
 was based on a technicality. However, in August 1980
 the Christian Democratic Party was formally recognized
 by the national electoral tribunal and is free to partici-
 pate in the coming 1981 general elections. The registration
 of other, presently-excluded minority parties, including
 the Honduran Communist Party, has been called for by
 leaders of the constituent assembly.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 Honduras was one of the first countries to ratify the
 
 
 471
 Inter-American Human Rights Convention. The Honduran
 government cooperated fully with a 1976 Amnesty Interna-
 tional investigative mission, as well as one which visited
 in 1979 to look into the situation in the camps set up
 for refugees from Nicaragua's recent civil war.
