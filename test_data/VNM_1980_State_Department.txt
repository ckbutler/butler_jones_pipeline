 VIETNAM
 Following the unification of North and South Vietnam under
 a Hanoi-based communist government in 1975, policies gener-
 ating extensive human rights violations have been common in
 the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). In its effort to
 consolidate power the SRV meted out harsh sentences in
 prison-like conditions in "reeducation camps" to thousands
 of persons affiliated with the fallen regime of South Vietnam.
 By 1980 many lower-ranking officials of the former regime
 had been released, but probably at least 50,000 remain
 imprisoned in the labor camps. During the past five years
 the SRV government encouraged and at times coerced the
 departure of nearly one million Vietnamese, at least half of
 that number ethnic Chinese. At the Geneva conference on
 refugees in July 1979 Hanoi undertook to halt this flow of
 refugees and to cooperate with the United Nations Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) to organize a program for orderly legal
 departure. Progress has been slow in setting up the Orderly
 Departure Program and, although Hanoi generally has honored
 its pledge to stop the refugee flow, an average of 6,000
 Vietnamese per month left the country clandestinely in
 1980. Refugees have cited deteriorating economic conditions,
 repressive government controls, discrimination against
 Chinese, Catholics, and former officials of the South Vietnam
 regime, and stepped up military conscription as reasons for
 leaving. The increased conscription and the worsening
 social and economic conditions are in part the consequence
 of Vietnam's diversion of manpower and resources to its
 invasion and o6cupation of Kampuchea, an operation which has
 debilitated the already limited industrial and agricultural
 capability of the SRV. Corruption had an increasing impact
 upon life in Vietnam during the past year and affected the
 distribution of government services, ethnic discrimination,
 internal freedom of movement and emigration. Refugee accounts
 of government practices, although at times inconsistent,
 provide a reasonable pool of information about human rights
 trends in Vietnam.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are reports that some prisoners have been beaten. Pro-
 visions of below subsistence levels of food rations, denial
 of medical care and assignment of hard labor to political
 prisoners and prisoners of conscience are regular practices,
 resulting in acute suffering, permanent physical impairment
 and death.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although the SRV admits that a few "war criminals" have been
 executed,'execution apparently is not a widespread occurrence
 in the "reeducation camps." The government has announced the
 execution of persons involved in organizing the clandestine
 departure of refugees. Information on the exact conditions
 in the "reeducation camps" is limited. Camps visited by
 observer teams appear to be in good condition, but refugee
 reports suggest that elaborate preparations are taken to
 present a false picture to visitors and that dangerous and
 hard labor is the norm. One former prisoner at camp A-30
 in Phu Khanh province has recounted that former Army of the
 Republic of Vietnam (AWN) and Government of Vietnam officials
 
 
 715
 often are brutalized by the large number of common
 criminals at the camps and camp personnel take no action to
 restrain the criminals. Sanitation and diet are said to be
 problems, with outbreaks of malaria, dysentary, and beriberi
 common.
 c. Disappearances
 Refugees report that the authorities occasionally wait for
 months before notifying relatives that a person has been
 detained. In 1980 there were no reports of persons dis-
 appearing without any eventual word of their location.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The regime continues to maintain in "reeducation camps" with-
 out trial large numbers of people, primarily those identified
 with the former regime. Estimates of those detained range
 from 24,000 (an SRV figure) up to two hundred thousand. The
 "reeducation camps" are designed to produce conformity
 through confinement, indoctrination and hard labor. Many
 former ARVN officers of lieutenant and captain rank have been
 released after three years of "reeducation," but majors and
 above generally are still imprisoned. One refugee, a former
 resident of a "reeducation camp," asserts that 35,000 former
 high ranking southern military and civilian figures still are
 in camps in the north, including 10,000 in Thanh Hoa province
 alone. In its 1980 Report, Amnesty International concludes
 that for many, the reason for continued detention has shifted
 from the detainee's misdeeds and behavior to the perceived
 foreign policy and national security concerns of the country.
 Accordingly, many have become victims of what is commonly
 termed administrative detention without trial. Since 1975,
 persons are subject to arbitary arrest, which occurs frequently,
 and held often without charge or trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In general both political prisoners and those accused of
 ordinary offenses are denied public trial and access to
 counsel. As far as is known no one sent to a "reeducation
 center" has undergone a public trial. People regularly are
 arrested and imprisoned without any form of legal proceedings
 (habeas corpus, counsel or public trial), because of real or
 suspected association with either the former government or
 resistance groups.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The North Vietnamese system of population surveillance by
 block wardens now extends to Ho Chi Minh City and other
 southern towns, although the system works imperfectly in the
 south, partly because of a shortage of trusted Party workers.
 There are reports of officials planting incriminating evidence
 during searches of residences. No warrants are needed.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Economic development continues to be thwarted by the impact
 of sporadic attempts to socialize southern agricultural pro-
 duction, output loss fxom the flight and expulsion of skilled
 and entrepreneurial workers, the high cost of maintaining
 defenses against China, as well as by the conflict in Kampuchea,
 which requires the regrime to divert to the war effort badly
 
 
 716
 needed resources and personnel. Government efforts in the
 autumn of 1979 to encourage agricultural production have
 had minimal results due to the peasants' reluctance to
 expand output under the threat of collectivization and the
 lack of food and other consumer goods on which to spend any
 earnings. Agricultural output has been reduced further by
 persistent drought in late 1979 and early 1980 followed by
 severe flooding in the Red River delta in July. This
 accumulation of man-made and natural disasters required Hanoi
 to import some two to three million tons of foodstuffs in
 1980- The heavy burden of inflation on city dwellers,
 including government cadre and proletariat, is reflected in
 increased corruption, moonlighting and crime. The corrup-
 tion in turn increases the burden on the average citizen,
 who frequently must bribe officials to obtain public services
 and official documents.
 General distrust of the south plays a role in the formulation
 of economic policies. The large agricultural, market-
 oriented southern economy has yet to recover from its near
 collapse and is only slowly being reintegrated into the
 more industrialized communist system of the north. Attempts
 to collectivize agriculture in the south and to control the
 marketing of food products have contributed to the food
 shortage by reducing the incentives for production.
 Collectivization of the fishing industry and nationalization
 of most seagoing boats has lowered fishermens' income
 severely; according to some reports, seventy percent of the
 catch is taken in taxes. The fishing industry has been
 further curtailed by severe government limits on the amount
 of fuel and water taken on fishing trips, measures taken
 to prevent refugee escapes.
 Because of the food shortages brought on by economic policies,
 drought and flooding, rice and meat rations have been
 reduced drastically, with lower allocations of food given to
 the south. The families of draft dodgers and deserters from
 the armed forces as well as most family members of boat
 escapees have been removed from food distribution lists. By
 mid-1980 sales of government food virtually were restricted
 to cadres and certain government employees and their families.
 Most people, therefore, are required to buy food on the free
 market, where prices are accelerating while income levels
 remain static.
 The ethnic Chinese, who account for well over half the total
 number of refugees, are discriminated against severely through
 denial of employment and educational activities. Former ARVN
 officers systematically are denied employment and the children
 of former GVN officials (both military and civilian) are
 blocked from university education by a review of family back-
 ground which weeds out all "unreliable elements." Persons
 released from "reeducation centers" are subject to severe
 restrictions on employment and travel.
 The level of health care has declined steadily since 1975.
 The severe shortage of medical facilities and medicines has
 been aggravated by the need to divert material and personnel
 for the care of soldiers wounded in Kampuchea. In Vietnamese
 hospitals there are distinct levels of treatment for different
 levels of cadres, and only the most minimal facilities are
 available for the average worker. People who are not employed
 by the state (e.g. Chinese, former GVN officials) are not
 eligible for care at government medical facilities.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Vietnamese authorities have attempted to divide and control
 the Catholic church, the Buddhist Sangha, and the other
 religious sects, however, people are permitted to attend
 religious services. Catholic priests are subject to
 police surveillance and most priests and nuns are required
 by the government to work full time in state-run occupations,
 thus limiting their participation in religious activities.
 The Church's teaching role has been restricted severely
 and many churches have been closed. Sermons require
 government approva3, and uncooperative priests are subject to
 prison sentences or "reeducation." Catholics are closely
 watched by the security forces, are required to attend
 political lessons, and are discriminated against in employ-
 ment. In central Vietnam, thousands of Catholics have been
 forcibly relocated and required to work on government
 construction projects.
 Nearly all of the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of
 the Cham minority, which the regime distrusts because of
 Cham involvement in anti-government activities. The
 government has disbanded the organized Muslim association
 and broken all links with overseas Muslim organizations.
 The regime forbids the traditional pilgrimage to Mecca and
 has not given permission for the Muslim community to
 participate in the Koran reading contest held in Malaysia.
 Many Muslim schools have been closed but most mosques are
 still open.
 Buddhists have resisted efforts to control them. The
 politically active An Quang Unified Buddhist Church reacted
 sharply when the government packed its leadership council
 with pro-Party monks. In Ho Chi Minh City, demonstrating
 Buddhists were arrested in April 1977 and pagodas closed.
 An Quang leaders remain under arrest, with the exception
 of three who.are held virtually incommunicado at the An
 Quang Pagoda in Ho Chi Minh City. Other religious groups
 (notably the Hoa Hao, a reformed Buddhist sect), also have
 resisted government control. The Hoe Hao leadership is now
 reportedly imprisoned.
 The Ministry of Culture and Information maintains tight
 control over all newspapers, other publications, and
 cultural exhibitions, censoring all sources of information
 and promoting "revolutionary culture." Many prominent
 artists and writers have been arrested.
 There are reliable reports that the Ministry of Interior
 inspects and censors international mail and on occasion
 takes action against persons whose letters are critical of
 the SRV government.
 There is no freedom of assembly in Vietnam.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Government approval is required for all internal and
 external travel. No one is allowed to change his residence
 or work location without permission from the authorities.
 Only government officials or approved spokesmen for
 
 
 718
 quasi-governmental organizations receive permission to
 travel abroad.
 A number of factors, including ethnic discrimination, lack
 of economic and educational opportunities, fear of
 reprisals or of exile to remote areas and, recently, fear of
 conscription to fight in Kampuchea, have stimulated a mass
 exodus from Vietnam since 1975. In early 1979 the Vietnam-
 ese adopted a program to "facilitate" the departure of ethnic
 Chinese as refugees, functioning through special offices at
 the provincial Party level and charging large fees for
 permits to exit, passage, etc. At its height in the spring
 of 1979, the exodus, mostly of ethnic Chinese, reached over
 40,000 per month by boat and additional thousands went into
 China over the northern border.
 At the conference on Vietnamese refugees held in Geneva
 in July 1979, the SRV pledged a moratorium on refugee
 departures, and information from refugees who have left
 Vietnam since then indicates that SRV authorities are no
 longer systematically assisting departures and are punishing
 people caught trying to depart clandestinely. In May 1979
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 reached agreement with the SRV on the legal departure of
 persons from Vietnam. It was agreed that the UNHCR would
 facilitate implementation of the January 1979 announcement
 by Vietnam that it would permit the orderly departure of
 persons who wish to leave Vietnam for countries of new
 residence, and subsequently UNHCR on behalf of the USG
 negotiated an a~reement to cover persons wishing to leave
 for the U.S. As of October 1980, about 2000 people had left
 legally in an ad hoc fashion, and in December a systematic
 program of orderly departure for the U.S. was inaugurated
 with an initial flight of 250 persons.
 During 1980 the great majority of refugees from Vietnam left
 clandestinely, but there were some cases in which bribes
 were paid to low level security officials to facilitate
 escape. Hanoi and province-level radio stations broadcast
 news of executions of boat leaders involved in abortive
 escapes as well as word of punishments dealt to others
 implicated. Currently, male offenders, mere passengers, can
 expect sentences ranging from 3 to 15 years at hard labor,
 while female offenders may receive from one to three months,
 with those without children often receiving larger sentences.
 Property, often including the means to make a living, is
 confiscated from those trying to depart illegally as well as
 from those who have departed. For persons who leave under
 the orderly departure program, the major hurdle is to
 receive an exit permit from the SRV, a time consuming process
 which many departees report can be speeded up by paying
 bribes to responsible officials. Refugees from the Mekong
 Delta have reported that people have paid SRV officials from
 eight to ten taels ($4800-$6000) of gold per person just to
 be considered on a tentative orderly departure list, with no
 guarantee as to when or if they would be able to leave.
 Furthermore, persons on the "orderly departure list" re-
 portedly are subject to recurring security checks and
 harassment.
 
 
 719
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Authority is concentrated in the Communist party, which
 controls the political process. The Politburo of the
 Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party (VCP) makes
 the decisions, and within the Politburo power is concentrated
 in the hands of five men. The National Assembly endorses
 the Politburo's decisions. A new constitution appears to
 contain no changes affecting participation in the political
 process. The Central Committee approved the new constitu-
 tion at a plenary session in September and the National
 Assembly approved it unanimously on December 18, 1980.
 The last national election in Vietnam was held in 1976,and
 local elections are held more often. The 1976 National
 Assembly elections provided some choice of non-Party candi-
 dates; however, only one list was presented. Voters could
 strike off candidates whom they did not like. Some reports
 claim cadres told voters whom to strike out. The electorate
 was required to participate in the election in order to have
 their ration cards validated. Elections for a new National
 Assembly reportedly will be held during the first half of
 1981.
 Although southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and National Assembly positions, distrust of southerners is
 a significant factor in the delegation of political
 responsibilities. Difficulty in applying socialist collectiv-
 ism, enforcing population controls and suppressing minority
 armed resistance has led to some relaxation of earlier
 discriminatory policies toward ethnic minorities, but
 gradual assimilation appears to be the long run objective.
 The SRV has created special schools in the Hanoi area to
 train minority cadres who can be the "eyes and ears" of the
 party among their own people.
 Recent party recruitment has focused on the military, with
 a resulting decline in the membership percentage of manual
 workers, women, and ethnic minorities. The average age of
 party members is high--currently approximately forty--but
 new recruitment should'lower it.
 The Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions is under the direct
 and total control of the Communist Party end by itself has
 no power to establish trade union policies in the SRV. Its
 primary function is to provide a mechanism to disseminate
 and enforce party policies.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There has been no independent outside investigation of human
 rights in Vietnam, although the SRV government has allowed
 some delegations, including an Amnesty International group
 in 1979, limited glimpses of living conditions in the country.
 Carefully planned tours of acceptable facilities--including
 model "reeducation camps"--are usually on the agenda, pro-
 viding few revelations about the true extent of human rights
 infractions in Vietnam. A former prisoner at a camp visited
 by one foreign delegation has described elaborate preparations
 to beautify the camp before the visit, temporary removal of
 most prisoners during the delegation's visit, and cadres'
 careful briefing of the prisoners on what to tell delegation
 members.
