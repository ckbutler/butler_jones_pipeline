 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy.
 The two major political parties, the People's National
 Party (PNP) and the Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), have al-
 ternated in power since the first elections in 1944.
 Prime Minister Michael Manley, leader of the People's
 National Party (PNP), won election in 1972 and reelection
 in 1976. His Government is constitutionally required
 to hold the next parliamentary election sometime before
 the end of 1981. Jamaicans have a high respect for human
 rights, which generally prosper in this open society
 with strong democratic traditions. The one privately-
 owned newspaper, The Gleaner, is vigorous despite opposi-
 tion to and from the Government.
 Jamaica's legal system is based on English common law
 and the judiciary is independent. The Constitution pro-
 vides for an independent Director of Public Prosecutions
 to pursue criminal cases and for independent commissions
 to oversee or inquire into various sectors of public
 life when allegations of official misconduct arise.
 During 1979, despite severe economic difficulties, Jamaica
 maintained a strong record of observance of human rights
 internally. Parliament passed a major bill, now being
 implemented, to reform electoral practices. An indepen-
 dent commission investigating allegations of official
 corruption and officially-condoned violence continues
 to meet and take evidence. However, the level of confron-
 tation between the Government and the PNP on the one
 hand and The Gleaner on the other has intensified.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law. There are occasional reports
 of beatings of suspects by police. These instances are
 irregular and are not condoned by the Government or higher
 police authorities. Officials commiting such acts are
 liable for punishment, although most reported incidents
 do not lead to prosecution.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Legal prohibitions against cruel, inhuman and degrading
 treatment or punishment are scrupulously followed. Access
 to detainees by relatives, attorneys, and friends is
 routine. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) has
 
 (354)
 
 
 alleged the existence of a police "death squad" to elimi-
 nate enemies of the PNP in the Kingston ghettos. The
 governing authorities have strenuously denied the allega-
 tion; a coroner's jury investigating the most notable
 example given to support the charge, the police shooting
 in February of a principal ghetto leader, Claudius Massop,
 concluded that 27 policemen are liable to criminal charges
 for the incident. The public prosecutor is pursuing
 the case. Prison conditions are spartan.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Jamaica has no political prisoners and observes habeas
 " Since a state of emergency lapsed in June 1977,
 arbitrary detention without trial has ceased. A "Gun
 Court," established in 1976 as an extraordinary means
 of meeting the serious problem of violent crime, in prac-
 tice has allowed some pre-trial detentions lasting several
 months. The "Gun Court" considers cases involving the
 illegal use or possession of firearms or ammunition.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In regular courts, accused persons receive a full and
 fair public trial, in accordance with consitutional and
 legal guarantees and standards. Certain restrictions
 apply in the "Gun Court," where convictions require minimal
 evidence, cases are tried by judge not jury, and public
 attendance is limited.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Jamaican law requires judicial warrants before entry.
 Although there have been a few allegations of improper
 police entry and search, such practices are not condoned
 by higher authorities.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fullfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education:
 Since 1973 Jamaica's mixed economy has shown negative
 growth. The Government is pursuing restrictive stabiliza-
 tion policies in accordance with an agreement with the
 International Monetary Fund to lay the basis for recovery.
 Despite substantial sacrifice by the Jamaican people,
 only the tourism sector shows signs of renewed dynamism;
 the private sector's confidence has not yet revived.
 The rising cost of imported oil, and severe flooding
 in 1979, have complicated recovery efforts.

 The Government has pledged to reduce disparities in the
 distribution of income, wealth and land. Approximately
 30 percent of the current national budget is addressed
 to social programs that benefit the disadvantaged, and
 reform of the progressive tax system has increased govern-
 mental revenues by about one-third. Through a variety
 of programs, including low-cost leases and the terracing
 of hillsides, the Government is trying to expand access
 by the poor to land. The right to own private property
 is protected.
 Emigration for economic and political reasons has caused
 a grave shortage of medical personnel, for whom the Govern-
 ment has sought some foreign replacements. Malnutrition,
 especialy among children, is a growing problem, although
 the Government maintains programs to improve the nutri-
 tional intake of school children and nursing mothers.
 With 30 percent of the country's population, the Kingston
 metropolitan area suffers overcrowding and inadequate
 sanitary facilities. The Government's public housing
 program is aimed at these problems but suffers severe
 financial constraints.
 Tuition in Jamaica's educational system from the primary
 through the post-secondary level is free or negligible.
 Secondary education is limited in the rural areas. An
 estimated 40 percent of the adult population is function-
 ally illiterate.
 Allegations of official corruption are under investigation
 by the Chief Justice, acting as an independent commission.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are guar-
 anteed in the Constitution and observed in practice.
 Jamaica's sole independently-owned newspaper, The Gleaner,
 is highly critical of the Manley Government's performance.
 The PNP and the Government have mounted a campaign of
 public rallies, statements and libel suits against the
 paper, challenging its veracity and ethical conduct.
 The electronic media are at present government-owned
 and generally exhibit a pro-government editorial policy.
 An application in 1979 to open an independent radio station
 was denied. Public demonstrations and rallies are integral
 to Jamaican politics and frequently staged by the major
 parties. Jamaica's many different churches and religious
 sects are strong, free and flourishing.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 
 
 357
 These freedoms are specifically guaranteed in the Constitu-
 tion. There are no legal restrictions on foreign travel
 or emigration, but controls on the availability of scarce
 foreign exchange inhibit travel abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Jamaica is a constitutional democracy with a two-party
 system and a strong tradition of observing democratic
 norms. Parliament passed legislation in 1979 after long
 negotiations between the two major parties to reform
 electoral practices, especially through an impartial
 electoral commission with oversight responsibility.
 The Government denied a request by the JLP to establish
 a similar commission to oversee the security forces.
 Charges by the JLP that the PNP stole the 1976 election
 by fraud and intimidation are being contested in the
 courts.
 Women are equal to men under Jamaican law, but in practice
 they suffer economic discrimination, particularly lower
 pay and less access to some jobs. The Government, schools,
 and many private organizations are working to change
 a cultural pattern that discourages legal marriage to
 the general disadvantage of women.
 Labor unions operate freely and openly, representing
 about 40 percent of the labor force. The unions have
 a strong voice in the major parties and zealously exercise
 their rights to bargain and strike.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Prime Minister Manley has invited Amnesty International
 to visit any time to investigate allegations of violations
 of human rights. Amnesty International has replied it
 sees no need for such a mission. Jamaica has ratified
 the American Convention on Human Rights.
