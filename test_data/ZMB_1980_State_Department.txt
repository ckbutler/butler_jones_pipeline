 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with a powerful presidency and
 extensive constitutional guarantees of human rights. The
 judiciary enjoys considerable independence and the politi-
 cal system, although limited to a single party, permits a
 substantial amount of political participation. Zambia is
 a vocal supporter of human rights internationally. It ser-
 ves as a country of first refuge for refugees in the region,
 particularly from Namibia and Angola and, until recently,
 from Zimbabwe. The armed conflicts in neighboring Namibia
 and the just-concluded Rhodesian war have placed severe
 strains on the Zambian political and economic system. The
 President exercises special powers of detention and restric-
 tion under the terms of emergency legislation in effect
 since 1964. Within this context the executive branch some-
 times gives national security considerations a higher prior-
 ity than civil rights. In accordance with the constitution,
 parliament reserves the right to suspend basic constitution-
 al guarantees.
 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited under Section 17 of the constitution.
 There have been, however, credible allegations that military
 personnel and police officers have resorted to brutality
 when arresting or interrogating people, especially in prom-
 inent criminal cases and those involving national security.
 The courts have consistently rejected statements obtained
 under duress and the Supreme Court, in particular, has crit-
 icized arresting authorities in this connection. There
 have been no reports that disciplinary action has been taken
 which is sufficiently persuasive to deter such transgressions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 common. Nonetheless, credible charges of maltreatment are
 made.   Zambian prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, unsani-
 tary and have little or no rehabilitative facilities. Prison
 system officials have stated publicly that given a continu-
 ing, acute shortage of funds it is difficult for them to meet
 inmates' basic needs.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention by official or
 quasi-official Zambian security forces, or by elements
 whose activities are condoned by the regime. Through the
 court system, persons arrested or detained have the means
 to hold the state officially accountable for its actions
 taken against them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the state of emergency in effect since independence
 in 1964, the president has the power to detain or restrict
 
 
 314
 movements of individuals. This detention authority dates
 from the British colonial administration and has not been
 revised since, although detention procedures have been
 amended to conform with the provisions of the constitution.
 The effect of these amendments has been to increase the
 president's detention authority. Through the repeated
 application of detention orders the president can prolong
 the incarceration of a detainee indefinitely. Those
 detained under this authority enjoy, nonetheless, certain
 rights, including the right to receive notice of the reason
 for detention, the right of habeas corpus, publication of
 the fact of detention, access to counsel and the right to
 seek judicial review of the detention order after one year
 by an independent and impartial tribunal. The detaining
 authority is not obliged to accept the recommendation of
 the review tribunal, however.
 Amnesty International in its 1980 report emphasizes its
 concern about the use of detention orders.
 Law officers and military personnel also enjoy extraordi-
 nary powers under the state of emergency legislation. Po-
 lice officers of assistant inspector rank or above may ar-
 rest without a warrant and detain an individual for up to
 28 days if the officer has reason to believe grounds exist
 to justify a presidential detention order. The police,
 nevertheless, must supply the detainee with the reason for
 his detention within 14 days or the detention is void.
 Security officers also enjoy broad powers of search.
 The president's detention powers and other emergency powers
 have in the past been used against now deceased political
 opponent Simon Kapwepwe, Zimbabwe-Rhodesian nationalists,
 dissident Namibians, Zairean rebels, striking university
 students and professors, and violators of currency control
 regulations. In most cases detainees are either released
 or formally charged once investigation of their cases has
 been completed -- a process that can take several months.
 At present these powers are applied to many cases where
 ordinary criminal charges would suffice, such as cases in-
 volving currency control. This has prompted strong critic-
 ism from spokesmen of the legal community who urge that po-
 lice detention powers be employed only when there is a clear
 threat to public security.
 The number of persons currently under presidential deten-
 tion for their political views reportedly is small, although
 there may be up to several hundred persons held under the
 provisions of the emergency legislation for crimes of a
 non-political nature. There is no information that suggests
 that political dissidents are serving long-term imprisonments.
 In late October 1980 more than 60 people, including a foreign
 correspondent, were arrested for suspected involvement in an
 alleged coup plot against the Kaunda government. Some of
 those arrested were released less than a month thereafter
 but the majority remain in detention. President Kaunda has
 pledged that their cases will be tried in a court of law.
 Arrests for suspected involvement in externally inspired
 subversion have also taken place and the government has fol-
 lowed regular judicial procedures in handling such cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian government guarantees the right to a fair trial.
 This right, however, is not always observed in the case of
 presidential detainees. The safeguards of English common
 
 
 315
 
 law are provided in court cases. The independence of the
 judiciary is widely acknowledged and is guaranteed by con-
 stitutional provisions. All judges are removable only by
 an independent judicial commission and then only for proven
 misbehavior or inability to perform duties. The Judicial
 Service Commission, which is composed largely of senior
 judicial officials, also selects, subject to formal presi-
 dential appointment, all judges except the members of the
 Supreme Court who are chosen directly by the president.
 individuals who believe their rights have been.or are likely
 to be contravened may apply to the High Courts for redress.
 In preliminary hearings of those arrested in the suspected
 October coup plot the judiciary .is treating the case with
 respect for legality and due process.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Zambian constitution guarantees the privacy of the home
 and search warrants are required under most circumstances
 for government officials to enter a home. In some cases
 involving the deportation of illegal aliens and national
 emergency the sanctity of the home is not respected.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Zambian government devotes considerable resources to
 supply substantial medical, educational and social services
 to the public. Since independence Zambia has made partic-
 ularly great strides in expanding educational opportunities
 at all levels, although the literacy level has risen only
 to approximately 20 percent. Zambia's dependence on world
 copper prices, together with the damaging effects of the
 Rhodesian war, has impaired the government's ability in re-
 cent years tofurnish basic services. Real gross domestic
 product (GDP) grew.at an estimated 0.3 percent per annum
 between 1974 and-1978. In 1979, real GDP declined sharply
 causing real per capita income to fall below its level at
 independence sixteen years ago. Little real growth in GDP
 will be registered in 1980.
 While the GDP has been stagnant or falling, the population
 growth rate has persisted at 3 percentper annum. The aver-
 age income of rural inhabitants is far below the 1979 aver-
 age per capita income of $510 and is estimated to be less
 than one-third the average earnings of urban dwellers.
 Th'is imbalance has generated heavy rural-to-urban migration
 (over 40 percent of the population is urban), producing high
 unemployment in urban areas. Inflation, which reached 20
 .percent in 1977, stabilized at approximately lltpercent in
 1979.
 The 1980 budget concentrates on economic recovery and agri-
 cultural self-sufficiency. Social welfare programs are sub-
 ordinated to overall economic needs. President Kaunda ad-
 vocates the need to diversify the national economy, with
 particular emphasis on developing Zambia's significant agri-
 cultural potential. The proportion of the government's
 development budget devoted to agriculture exceeded 30 per-
 cent in 1978 and 1979. In mid-1980 the president launched
 an ambitious 10-year program to boost the nation's food pro-
 duction. The government's third national development plan
 (1979-1983) allocates the largest share of government invest-
 ments to rural development.
 
 
 316
 
 Despite such efforts the successful development of the rural
 sector remains an elusive goal. Scarce foreign exchange,
 limited managerial skills, faulty planning, and weak govern-
 ment and party institutions continue to detract from the gov-
 ernment's performance in meeting the economic needs of the
 population.
 The gap between the rural and urban areas in terms of income,
 education, housing, nutrition, and the availability of public
 services is vast and continues to increase in favor of the
 urban dweller. An International Labor Organization (ILO)
 report published in 1977 noted that 10 percent of the popula-
 tion (almost exclusively urbanites) claims nearly 50 percent
 of the total income--more than twice that of the income share
 of the lowest 60 percent of the population. Within the urban
 community itself there are also significant inequalities.
 The top 10 percent claims over 40 percent of the total income.
 The bottom 60 percent receives about 25 percent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression and assembly are circumscribed by the
 constitutional ban on all political activity outside the one-
 party structure. Some freedom is permitted within this con-
 straint. For example, the press regularly reports criticism
 of government policies expressed in the national parliament
 and by the general public. The two national dailies are own-
 ed or controlled by the government and the party, but critic-
 ism of government performance is permitted. Both papers were
 sharply critical of government economic policies in 1980 and
 cases of corruption involving incumbent officials were widely
 reported. Such criticism is in large part officiallly in-
 spired or sanctioned.   Direct criticism of the Head of State
 however, or of the basic national philosophy of humanism, is
 prohibited. Section 69 of the Penal Code states that any per-
 son intending to bring the President into "hatred, ridicule
 and contempt" is liable on conviction, to imprisonment for up
 to three years.. Experienced observers report that there have
 been only two or three convictions under this section since
 independence. Censorship of foreign publications exists but
 is not stringent. Freedom of religion is constitutionally
 guaranteed and strongly supported by President Kaunda. Ag-
 gressive or mass proselytizing, especially where large open-
 air meetings are concerned, must, however, be cleared by the
 Ministry of Home Affairs. Jehovah's Witnesses are specifical-
 ly prohibited by presidential order from proselytizing.
 All labor unions come under the Zambia Congress of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU). Member unions are strong defenders of workers'
 interests and enjoy the right to collective bargaining. Under
 existing legislation strikes are permitted only for specified
 reasons and only after all other methods of resolving labor
 management disputes have been exhausted. Although the ZCTU
 nominally operates under supervision from Zambia's single party,
 it maintains its independence of action. ZCTU spokesmen
 frequently question and challenge government policy. The ZCTU
 is regarded by experienced, outside observers as an effective
 and democratic trade union organization.
 Women participate freely in the social, economic and politi-
 cal life of the country. Several hold senior positions in
 the party and the government. They are represented in the
 professions, in the business community and at the national
 
 
 317
 university. At the same time, the majority of Zambian women
 still occupy traditional roles in the society where rapid
 urbanization has served to undermine the importance of such
 roles. Female participation in the wage labor force lags
 far behind that of males. Half of all women in the formal
 sector employment are engaged in occupations among the least
 remunerative.
 Under statutory law, women enjoy full equality with men.
 This is not the case with customary law which relegates women
 to an inferior status, particularly in such areas as inher-
 itance. However, the rules of customary law are diluted in
 practice-as the country becomes increasingly urbanized.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The president may, under emergency powers, restrict the move-
 ment of individuals within Zambia. Foreign diplomats may
 not travel outside a 40 kilometer radius of Lusaka without
 prior written permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 This restriction is enforced. The government reserves the
 right to refuse or withdraw passports to prevent foreign
 .travel by individuals whose activities abroad are.considered
 inimical to Zambian interests. Several businessmen and labor
 leaders suspected of involvement in the alleged October coup
 episode have had their passports confiscated by authorities.
 -?Freedom to emigrate is permitted by the government; however,
 strict currency regulations can make emigration difficult.
 Zambia has been notable for its humane policy of offering
 haven to refugees in the region. During the Rhodesian war,
 Zambia provided refuge to over 60,000 Zimbabwean refugees.
 All of the Zimbabweans save for a handful of administrative
 aides and some students have been repatriated. Zambia cur-
 rently hosts an estimated 17,500 refugees including 11,000
 Angolans and 4,000 Namibians. The consensus of United Na-
 tions High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) officials and
 other refugee agency representatives is that the treatment
 accorded refugees in Zambia is good.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under the 1973 constitution, the United National Independen-
 ce Party (UNIP) became the only legal political party in
 Zambia. Candidates for political office at any level must
 be members of UNIP. Their qualifications are subject to
 close examination by party authorities. In practice the
 Zambian political system is open to individuals of widely
 differing opinions provided they are willing to operate
 within the one-party structure and not challenge President
 Kaunda's preeminent position.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests in recent years for outside
 investigation of alleged human rights violations in Zambia.
