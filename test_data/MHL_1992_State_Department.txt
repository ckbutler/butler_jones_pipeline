 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of 31 small, coral atolls
 scattered over a large area of the central Pacific, compriasn a total land area of
 about 70 square miles. The population, of Micronesian origin, is estimated at 48,000
 and is concentrated primarl y on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls.
 Political legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the popular will expressed
 by majority vote in accordance with a constitution blending British and American
 precepts, including a strong, American-style bill of rights. The le atre consists
 of the Parliament, known as the Nitijels, with 33 members and a Council of Chiefs
 (IroU), the latter serving largely a consultative function on matters dealing with cus-
 tom and traditional practice.
 The executive branch of the Government consists of the President and his ap-
 pointed Cabinet, all of whom are elected members of the Nitu'ela. The President is
 elected by majority vote from among the membership of the Nitijela. The Constitu-
 tion calls for an independent judiciary.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security. Consequently, the Marshall Islands has no security
 forces of its own, aside from national and ocal police forces, which are firmly under
 the control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, and the fishing industry gen-
 erate limited revenues.
 No human rights abuses were reported in 1992.

 U.S. citizens long r   nt in the Marshall Islands operate the country's sole pri-
 vately owned newspaper. The Government publishes a monthly gazette with official
 news and notices only.
 In September Nitijela opposition party member Senator Alik Alik commented in
 the press that his atoll might look into the possibility of commonwealth status at
 the conclusion of the initial 15-year period of the Compact of Free Association in
 2001. The Nitijela passed a resolution calling for a commission of inquiry to inves-
 tigate Alik's possible violation of the Treason and Sedition Act and of his Nitijela
 oath. That resolution was replaced by one which declared the Senator in contempt
 of the Nitijela and suspended him for 10 days. The Senator protested that this ac-
 tion abridged his constitutional rights to free speech and due process of law.

 and association is provided for in the Constitution and observed in practice.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad. There are no
 restrictions on emigration or repatriation. There are no displaced persons other than
 those from Bikini Atoll who left that atoll in 1946 because of scheduled nuclear test-
 ing. Pending further rehabilitation of the area contaminated in the tests, the
 Bikinians remain resident elsewhere in the Marshall Islands and in the United
 States.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right& The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by secret ballot in free and open elections every 4
 years. Suffrage is universal for men and women 18 years of age and older. There
 are no restrictions on the formation of political parties, although political activity
 by aliens is prohibited.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights have been formed.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 family status, or descent. No instances of such discrimination were reported.
 Inheritance of property and traditional rank is matrilineal, with women occupying
 positions of importance within the traditional system. No instances of unequal pay
 for eqa work or sex-related job discrimination were reported.
 Public allegations of violence against women are rare and relate mainly to domes-
 tic conflict. No reliable information about the extent of this problem is available. As-
 sault is a criminal offense, but women are reluctant to prosecute their spouses.
 Women's groups have held infrequent meetings to publicize women's issues and to
 create a greater awareness of the rights of women.
 In April the Government announced that it was withdrawing its endorsement of
 WUTMI, Women United Together in the Marshall Islands. As the umbrella women's
 organization, WUTMI was engaged in a Young Women's Christian Association
 (YWCA) pilot project to involve women at the grass-roots level in development plan-
 ning. The Minister of Social Welfare stated that the reason for the decision to drop
 support for WUTMI was "to give other groups a chance and to encourage all points
 of v        mew.w
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Attorney General interprets this right as allowing the
 existence of labor unions, although to date there have been no initiatives to form
 any. The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, and thus far the Government
 has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no
 bars to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. There are no
 export processing zones. Wages in the cash economy are determined by market fac-
 tors in accordance with the minimum wage and other laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Emploryment of Children.-Marhallese law contains no pro-
 hibition on the employment of children. Children are not typically employed in the
 wage economy, but some assist their families with agriculture, fishing, and other
 small-scale family enterprises. Public Law 1991-125 instituted compulsory edu-
 cation for children ages 6-14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 by local standards. There is no legislation onerning maximum hours or occupa-
