 Cuba is a totalitarian state dominated by a single person,
 Fidel Castro, who is Chief of State, head of Government,
 leader of the Communist Party, and Commander-in-Chief of the
 Armed Forces. With support from a few long-time associates,
 President Castro exercises control over nearly all aspects of
 Cuban life through a network of directorates ultimately
 responsible to him through the Communist Party. The party is
 the only legal political entity and is headed by a
 self-perpetuating elite. All government positions, including
 judicial offices, are controlled by the party. Elections are
 held only to endorse party-approved candidates; there was one
 isolated exception in 1989 (see Section 3). Though not a
 formal requirement, party membership is a de facto prerequisite
 for high-level official positions and professional advancement
 in most areas.
 The Ministry of Interior (MININT) is the principal organ of
 repression and of totalitarian control. It operates border
 and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations,
 determines the legality of associations, investigates evidence
 of nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains pervasive
 vigilance through a series of mass organizations and
 informers. The Ministry underwent structural reorganization
 in 1989 and is now under de facto control of the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces (FAR). The mass organizations attempt to extend
 government and Communist Party control over each citizen's
 daily activities at home, work, and school. Citizens are
 exhorted to ensure ideological conformity and to report
 deviation.
 The Cuban economy is highly centralized and managed by a group
 of advisors close to President Castro. The Government
 controls the means of production and is virtually the
 country's sole employer. In the late 1970's, Cuba began to
 use market mechanisms, but in 1986 the Government reversed
 course and began the ongoing "rectification of errors"
 campaign. It sought to stamp out an emerging informal private
 sector while promoting antimaterialist "socialist morality."
 The abandonment of the liberalization program in favor of more
 orthodox Communist policies has played a major role in the
 Cuban economy's recent stagnation. In 1989 this campaign of
 Marxist economic orthodoxy caused sharp conflicts with Cuba's
 reform-minded socialist trading partners.
 Cubans do not possess equal protection under the law, the
 right to freely choose government representatives, freedom of
 expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, or
 freedom to travel to and from Cuba without restriction. There
 is no independent judiciary, due process safeguards can be and
 are constitutionally circumvented, and defense attorneys face
 severe disadvantages under the judicial system. Aside from
 the churches, which themselves are monitored by the party,
 there is virtually no institutional autonomy in Cuban
 society. All media are Government-owned and remain under
 tight control, and the practice of religion continues to be
 discouraged. Government efforts to monopolize control over
 many aspects of life remain very intrusive.
 The human rights situation in 1989 worsened significantly from
 the previous year. The Government stepped up repression in
 marked contrast to the limited relaxation effected in 1988.
 During the year the Government cracked down on human rights
 groups, executed four uniformed officers without a fair trial,
 anddenied internationally recognized human rights monitors
 
 
 530
 permission to attend a trial of three human rights leaders.
 Efforts by the United Nations Secretary General to implement a
 U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) resolution to follow up
 on reported abuses in Cuba had by'year's end produced little
 response from the Cuban Government. The only positive
 carryovers from 1988 into 1989 included continued releases of
 political prisoners, permission for the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to again interview political
 prisoners, and the slight expansion of the 1988 exceptions
 granted to the churches.
 RESPECT FOR HUIAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 FAR General Arnaldo Ochoa, MININT Colonel Antonio De la
 Guardia, MININT Major Amado Padron, and FAR Captain Jorge
 Martinez were executed by firing squad on July 13 following a
 show trial (see Section l.e.). Although the full story behind
 the Ochoa/De la Guardia case is still unclear, there are
 circumstantial indications that political motivation may have
 played a part in making Ochoa the key figure in. the case and'-
 in sentencing him and three others to death.
 Although not politically motivated, there have been some
 reports of police officers engaging in unjustified use of
 lethal force. In one such example, police investigating a
 petty theft killed a Havana youth, Elisco Canada Coffiguez, in
 June, and in another Julian Cela Cuellar was reportedly shot
 to death in Havana on July 8, for allegedly verbally abusing
 an arresting officer who was breaking up a street fight.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reliable reports of prisoner abuse and beatings rose in 1989,
 with a severity in some cases amounting to torture. There was
 no indication that Cuban authorities undertook investigations
 or disciplinary actions in response t6 charges of such abuse.
 Punishment cells remain in regular use for disciplining
 inmates, in violation of international norms. Rodolfo Frometa
 and Angel Donato Martinez, two "nuevos plantados" (new
 prisoners who refuse prison "ree-ducation"), reportedly were
 held incommunicado in punishment cells in Combinado del Este
 Penitentiary for more than 1 year from 1988 to 1989. In
 January there were multiple allegations that guards had beaten
 and placed in isolation cells several prisoners in Combinado
 del Este ddring a protest by the so-called lancheros (persons
 arrested for illegal attempts to leave the country).
 Cuban Human Rights Party activist David Moya was severely
 beaten in a Pinar del Rio prison for organizing protests
 against prisoner mistreatment, according to the Cuban Human
 Rights Party and his own reports smuggled out in August. The
 beating and use of electric prods on 11 Combinado del Este
 inmates in December 1988 reportedly resulted in two prisoners
 being treated for cranial fractures. The prisoners were
 
 
 531
 protesting the removal of a political prisoner to a prison for
 common criminals. In March and August, dozens of Combinado
 del Este inmates engaged in hunger strikes and smuggled out
 written denunciations of the conditions of their confinement;
 these protests reportedly resulted in several severe beatings
 and frequent confinement in punishment cells.
 Several charges of confinement of political prisoners in
 psychiatric hospitals were reported in 1989. Four dissidents
 were confined in psychiatric hospitals, ostensibly for
 evaluation, for periods ranging from a few days to several
 weeks. None of the four reported mistreatment during their
 hospital stays. One, Julio Soto Angurel, leader of the Jose
 Marti Council of Independent Defenders of Human Rights and
 National Reconciliation, remained at year's end in the Havana
 Psychiatric Hospital, where he was confined after his arrest
 on October 8.
 Following his release in 1989, Cuban Human Rights Committee
 member Jesus Leyva Guerra reported that security police
 detained him in July 1988 and then transferred him to the
 prison ward of the Gustavo Machin Psychiatric Hospital in
 Santiago de Cuba. Leyva said he was forced to undergo
 psychiatric "treatment" and, after he began a hunger strike,
 was subjected to electroshock six times.
 With a sharp drop-off in the number of outside groups
 permitted to visit Cuban prisons in 1989, it was far more
 difficult to appraise current conditions. Physical
 improvements in prison conditions, such as in ventilation and
 sanitation, that were made in 1988 before visits by
 international human rights groups, apparently were largely
 maintained but not expanded during 1989. Local human rights
 monitors assert that punishment cells in provincial jails
 featured harsher conditions of confinement.
 Political prisoners released in 1989 claimed that, while
 conditions remained the same for those incarcerated for
 political offenses, mistreatment of common prisoners increased
 during the year. There were reports of beatings of prisoners
 incarcerated for attempting to leave Cuba without government
 permission. These prisoners, who are treated as common
 criminals, were protesting the Government's refusal to
 recognize them as political prisoners. Reports smuggled out
 of the prisons indicate, however, that political reeducation
 of prisoners has become essentially voluntary since 1988;
 therefore, prisoner protests have largely centered on general
 prison conditions.
 Local human rights monitors reported a notable rise in
 incidents of alleged police brutality by arresting officers,
 often in situations involving minor offenses. These included
 the shooting of Edel Guerrero Licea and Hidelberto Figuerado
 in Palma Soriano at a religious festival in December 1988, the
 August 16 shooting of Iran Sanchez Hernandez (who was
 attempting an illegal departure from the island), and the
 shootings of a Havana youth for "resisting arrest," and a
 16-year-old after a traffic infraction. In none of these
 cases has there been any indication that any police official
 was investigated or punished for such actions. Two other
 incidents ended in death (see Section l.a.).

 CUBA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 245 of the Cuban Law of Penal Procedure requires
 police to file formal charges and either to release a detainee
 or place him at the disposition of a prosecutor within 96
 hours. Authorities are also required to provide suspects with
 a defense attorney within 10 days of arrest. Despite some
 signs that authorities were more concerned to follow legal
 forms, Cuban procedural rights related to arrest continue to
 be widely denied. Article 61 of the Constitution permits
 denial of all recognized civil liberties in the case of anyone
 actively opposing the "decision of the Cuban people to build
 socialism." This article is implicitly invoked by Cuban
 authorities who, in the past, justified lengthy detentions of
 dissidbnts by characterizing them as "counterrevolutionary
 elements."
 Arbitrary arrests and prolonged detentions without trial of
 dissidents increased in late 1988 and continued through 1989.
 At least 18 such arrests, followed by prolonged detentions, of
 dissidents took place in the weeks following the September
 1988 UNHRC visit. Since then, a total of approximately 50
 dissidents have been subjected to punitive actions ranging
 from threats, harassment, and beatings to detentions and
 imprisonment. Cuban authorities used brief detentions ranging
 from several hours to several days to intimidate dissidents
 without formally charging them.
 For example, seven members of the Free Art Association (APAL)
 were detained for months before being charged and brought to
 trial in September 1989. Lazaro Cabrera Puente, Pablo Pupo
 Sanchez, Juan Garcia Cruz, Gilberto Plasencia, and Ramon
 Obregon had been detained since October 1988. Carlos Novoa
 and Jose Mari Becerra had been arrested in January. Amnesty
 International (AI) reported that Novoa had gone on a 59-day
 hunger strike beginning in May to demand that he be charged
 and brought to trial.
 Elizardo Sanchez (President of the Cuban Commission for Human
 Rights and National Reconciliation), Hiram Abi Cobas (head of
 the Cuban Human Rights Party); and Hubert Jerez (head of the
 Marti Committee for Human Rights) were arrested on August 6
 for "disseminating false information" concerning the trial of
 General Ochoa (see Section l.e.). Following their arrests,
 the human rights leaders were confined in the Villa Marista
 detention center for about 6 weeks before being transferred to
 Combinado,del Este prison. According to Sanchez, while in
 Villa Marista they were each held in solitary confinement
 inside windowless 10 foot by 3 foot isolation cells that were
 brightly illuminated 24 hours a day for 36 days prior to their
 November 17 trial.
 Orlando Polo, leader of the "Green Path" ecological-pacifist
 group, was arrested three times in August and September and
 held without being charged for 1 week in the Villa Marista
 detention center-and for 2 weeks in the Havana Psychiatric
 Hospital. In Villa Marista, Polo was interrogated about
 unspecified charges without the benefit of an attorney.
 Several more activists continued to be held at year's end
 without charges. Enrique Acosta Ruiz, Sergio De la Vega
 Gomez, and Lazaro Rosa Arbolez were arrested in April.
 Esteban Gonzalez, Manuel Pozo and two other members of the
 Pro-Amnesty Committee, a group calling for the release of
 political prisoners, were arrested in September. Cuban Human
 
 
 533
 Rights Party activist Edita Cruz was taken into custody in
 November. Altogether, over 25 arrested or detained activists
 were still imprisoned or held without being charged at year's
 end.
 Reliable reports indicated that some prisons were filling up
 again in 1989 after the Government reportedly released over
 8,000 criminal offenders in 1988 under the new penal code. In
 1989 the authorities began a massive and sustained campaign to
 prosecute economic offenders, and this may be adding to the
 prison population. Reports from inside prisons indicate that
 the number of offenders incarcerated for attempted illegal
 departures increased in 1989 although prison sentences for the
 offense remained moderate by Cuban standards. In 1988,
 especially in the months leading up to the visit of the
 UNHRC's Cuba Working Group, many persons arrested for illegal
 departure attempts from the island were not jailed but were
 fined and released with a severe warning.
 Precise numbers of political prisoners in Cuban jails are
 difficult to determine because of the release of hundreds of
 prisoners over the last 2 years, differences in definitions of
 political prisoners, and the Government's traditional secrecy
 about the prison population. Current estimates of the number
 of Cuban political prisoners range from Americas Watch's (AW)
 January 1989 estimate of "several score additional Cubans to
 possibly as many as a few hundred" to the Cuban human rights
 activists's claims of many more. In March 1988, the
 Government stated that there were 455 persons imprisoned for
 crimes against state security, a category which now does not
 include offenses such as illegal departure, contempt, and
 offenses related to the practice of a religion, such as
 conscientious objection. Another indication of the prisoner
 population came from the ICRC, which reported that its
 delegation in May visited 257 prisoners, including some
 convicted of illegal departure, in 10 Cuban detention centers
 including the Havana Psychiatric Hospital.
 During the year Cuban authorities continued to release
 selected political prisoners, including some on the condition
 that they immediately emigrate to the United States.
 According to U.S. press reports, the Government notified the
 U.S. Catholic Conference in November 1988 that it would free
 225 political prisoners, including 44 it had previously
 labeled as too dangerous to release. Cuban authorities
 subsequently did not release the entire group, although at
 least 8 of the 44 "dangerous" prisoners, including "plantado
 historico" Alberto Grau, were freed in 1989. There are three
 remaining "plantados historicos" (long-term political
 prisoners who have refused "reeducation") still in prison.
 Alfredo Mustelier, one of these three who has served 20 years
 of his 25-year sentence, claims that he should be released
 under retroactive provisions of the 1988 Penal Code. He
 undertook two lengthy hunger strikes in 1989 to protest his
 continued incarceration and was gravely ill in December. The
 U.N. Secretary General, members of the U.S. Congress, and many
 nongovernmental organizations have asked President Castro to
 review the cases of Mustelier and the other two "plantados
 historicos."
 Many human rights activists were arrested on April 3 in order
 to forestall their planned demonstration at the Soviet Embassy
 during the visit of President Gorbachev. The demonstrators,
 who wanted to call for support of "glasnost" within Cuba,
 received sentences ranging from 3 to 9 months.
 
 
 534
 The Cuban Penal Code retains internal exile as a sanction
 against convicted offenders, but no instances of forced
 removal or resettlement were reported in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cuban law and trial practices do not meet international
 standards for fair and impartial public trials. The
 Constitution terms the courts independent, yet it explicitly
 subordinates them to the National Assembly and the Council of
 State (Article 122). Judges are elected by the r.ubberstamp
 National Assembly and its lower level counterparts. The
 indepefldence of the judiciary is compromised by the de facto
 subordination of the courts to the Communist Party: there is
 no known case in which a Cuban court has successfully ruled
 against the Government on any political or security matter.
 Civil courts exist at three levels--municipal, provincial, and
 the Supreme Court. All civil courts are presided over by
 panels composed of a mixture of professionally prepared judges
 and lay judges. There is also a system of military tribunals
 which tries certain counterrevolutionary activity cases.
 Defendants have a general right of appeal at the municipal
 level and a conditional right at the provincial level. Cases
 involving maximum prison terms or the death penalty are always
 open to appeal. The Law of Penal Procedure provides that an
 appeal must be presented within 5 days.
 The revised Penal Code (Law No. 62) implemented in 1988
 reduced the number of capital offenses and the length of
 sentences in some cases. The new code did not, however,
 significantly modify the previous definition of political
 offenses, the punishment meted out for them, or due process
 provisions for accused political offenders. Under provisions
 of the revised code, defense lawyers may be excluded until an
 investigation is completed, and attempted illegal departure
 from Cuba remains punishable by up to 3 years, imprisonment or
 a fine of up to approximately $1,000.
 Political offenses, which prevent virtually any form of free
 expression, remained unchanged in the revised penal code,
 which retained the concept of "dangerousness" (Articles 72-89)
 and vaguely defined it as "the special proclivity of a person
 to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest
 contradiction of Socialist norms." If the police determine a
 person is exhibiting such behavior, the offender can be
 brought before a court which may apply police surveillance,
 reeducation, or therapy lasting for from 1 to 4 years. In
 1989 as in 1988, the concept of "dangerousness" appears to
 have been invoked rarely, if at all.
 Cuban evidentiary practices do not meet generally recognized
 international standards. A trial for political offenses
 ordinarily'consists of evidence given by the prosecution's
 witnesses, who are generally employees of state security
 organs. In some cases, the only evidence is the defendant's
 confession, obtained without due process safeguards against
 self-incrimination or coercion. There are usually no defense
 witnesses, although testimony on behalf of the defendant from
 a member of a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (see
 Section l.f.) may be introduced and may contribute to a
 reduced sentence.
 
 
 535
 CUBA
 Cuban law provides an accused the right to a defense attorney,
 but the latter's impartiality and independence are compromised
 by the absence of a private bar association and by ideological
 controls exerted over members of the state-controlled lawyers'
 collectives, especially in defending persons accused of crimes
 against state security. When the legal collectives were
 reorganized in 1984, some 15 percent of then-active attorneys,
 including many active in political cases, were denied
 readmission and thus effectively disbarred.
 Government-appointed defense attorneys generally are poorly
 prepared and unsympathetic towards the defendant. In 1988 the
 visiting New York City Bar Association delegation observed
 Cuban trials for common crimes and found the counsel
 ill-prepared and unaggressive. Typically, defendants and
 lawyers are afforded little time together; in some cases,
 former political prisoners have asserted, clients see their
 counsel only one hour before trial. Others are unable to meet
 at all with their attorneys.
 Observers have noted a reluctance among attorneys to defend
 persons charged with political offenses. Lawyers are
 discouraged from taking political cases because of persecution
 suffered by those who do. Domingo Jorge Delgado, for example,
 was freed in 1988 and allowed to emigrate to the United States
 in 1989, after serving 8 years in prison following his defense
 of a group of persons who had attempted to seek political
 asylum. Former political prisoners have alleged that state
 security officials apply pressure on all persons involved in
 the judicial process, and that those officials, not the
 courts, really decide the fate of the detainee.
 Several prominent cases of dissidents illustrate how the Cuban
 judicial system works in practice:
 Samuel Martinez Lara, Secretary General of the Cuban Human
 Rights Party, was sentenced on April 7 to 9 months in prison.
 Martinez, David Moya, Roberto Bahamonde, and two other members
 of the Cuban Human Rights Party were arrested on April 3 for
 announcing a demonstration, which was to call for "glasnost"
 in Cuba, outside the Soviet Embassy during Soviet leader
 Gorbachev's visit. All were held incommunicado until their
 closed trial 3 days later where, without defense attorneys
 present, they were convicted of "illegal association." Moya
 received a sentence of 9 months and Bahamonde a sentence of 3
 months in prison. In a June 1989 report, AI criticized the
 trials of Bahamonde, Martinez, Moya, and six other imprisoned
 members of the Cuban Human Rights Party, stating that they
 were punished because of their peaceful political and human
 rights activities and that procedures in their trials did not
 conform to international standards for fair trial.
 Bahamonde's and Moya's sentences were subsequently extended
 without any semblance of due process. Two months into his
 prison sentence on June 9, Bahamonde was sentenced to an
 additional year for "illegal economic activities." According
 to a letter smuggled out of prison, Moya was found guilty of
 "contempt" at a courtroom set up in a prison dining room in
 September and sentenced to a further year in prison. Martinez
 was not released upon completion of his sentence on January 4,
 1990
 General Ochoa and 14 other top military and security officials
 received few due process safeguards at their highly publicized
 trial in June and July. Drug trafficking and other serious
 charges were leveled against them first in the official press
 
 
 536
 CUBA
 and then in 2 weeks of show trials. The proceedings were
 influenced by the publicly stated views of President Castro
 and the presentation before the military tribunal by Minister
 of Defense Raul Castro, as well as official media comments
 about the guilt of the accused. Defense lawyers for the
 accused had little time to prepare an adequate defense,
 received little court time compared to the prosecutor, and
 apparently at no time did other than to ask for clemency. The
 accused were sentenced on July 7, their appeal was quickly
 rejected on July 9, and the Council of State confirmed the
 death sentbnces of Ochoa and three other defendants, which
 were carried out later the same day. Al, AW, and the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) condemned
 the trial's procedures and its swift aftermath.
 In mid-1989, defense lawyers in two prominent cases involving
 human rights activists described below were given greater
 pretrial access to their clients than was available in
 previous years. In neither instance, however, was the outcome
 of the case notably altered in favor of the defendants as a
 result of these opportunities for more extensive consultations.
 Prior to the trial of seven APAL dissidents in September, some
 defendants, including Carlos Novoa and Pablo Pupo Sanchez,
 were released on bail and allowed regular consultations with
 their attorneys. After a trial heavily laden with political
 invective, according to eyewitnesses, the seven activists
 received harsh prison sentences ranging from 9 to 21 months on
 charges of "continued illegal association," "failure to report
 a crime," and, in one case, "possession of a firearm." In the
 case of defendant Juan Enrique Garcia, his attorney had
 excused himself one day prior to the September trial because
 the date allegedly conflicted with his vacation.
 In November Elizardo Sanchez and two other human rights
 leaders were tried publicly for "spreading false information"
 on the Ochoa affair; representatives of AW and AI were not
 permitted to enter Cuba to attend. Likewise, the Government
 did not allow two U.S. journalists to appear as witnesses for
 the defense. Two foreign diplomats were allowed to attend the
 proceedings. All three defendants were granted the right to
 defense attorneys, but pretrial consultations were limited.
 At the trial, the accused were allowed to speak freely in
 their own defense. Although the prosecutor requested the
 maximum sentence (4 years) for Sanchez, he was sentenced to 2
 years and the other 2 defendants were given 18 months each.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 .Correspondence
 Official intrusion into private and family affairs remains one
 of the most repressive and pervasive features of Cuban life.
 Government or Communist Party-directed mass organizations
 permeate Cuban society. The State has assumed a virtual right
 of interference, even for those who do not actively oppose the
 Government'and its practices. Beyond promoting ideological
 conformity, many of these intrusions are ostensibly aimed at
 "improvement" of the citizenry.
 The extensive apparatus of the 14ININT decides on the legality
 of all private and public associations, and utilizes an
 intricate system of informers, block wardens, and block
 committees (Committees for the Defense of the Revolution -
 CDR) to monitor and control public opinion. Police searches
 are at times carried out without warrants, as occurred in the
 
 
 537
 homes of several human rights activists in 1989. Authorities
 were more careful than in the past to observe the appearance
 of respect for the rights of those suspected of dissent, but
 Cuban courts automatically issue warrants in security cases,
 thus rendering this procedural safeguard meaningless.
 The authorities possess a wide range of social controls. For
 example, the educational system teaches that the State's
 interests have precedence over all other ties and commitments.
 Teachers, selected in part for their ideological commitment,
 espouse Communist Party doctrine and can sanction students
 whose families question orthodox opinion. Teachers also
 evaluate the political and ideological character of their
 students, which is noted in records carried with each student
 throughout his or her education. Cubans are also pressured to
 join a variety of mass organizations, including the Union of
 Young Communists, despite the supposedly voluntary nature of
 these groups. Outstanding students or workers, according to
 reliable reports, often find themselves coerced into
 membership in such mass organizations.
 CDR's are neighborhood surveillance/security committees tasked
 with closely monitoring the daily lives of individual
 residents. Participation in Cuba's 80,000 CDR's is in
 practice involuntary in urban areas. The Government in 1988
 announced the elimination of one CDR report on the beliefs of
 citizens, but there is little evidence that this change
 significantly altered the role of the CDR's as guardians of
 social conformity. CDR's apparently continue to report
 suspicious activities, such as contact with foreigners,
 reception of foreign broadcasting in the home, conspicuous
 consumption, unauthorized meetings, and criticism of the
 Government. CDR activity, if anything, increased in 1989 as
 the Government undertook a massive campaign aimed at
 corruption and petty economic offenses.
 Former political prisoners are often subjected to
 discriminatory treatment and are relegated to menial,
 intermittently available work, no matter what their education
 or experience. Their children may be harassed in schools and
 sometimes barred from higher or even technical education.
 There was evidence that this discrimination abated in recent
 years and that authorities were attempting to prevent the
 grosser forms of discrimination from being exercised against
 departing immigrants as well. Human rights activists report
 frequent incidents of threats and harassment by government
 officials. Cubans have no right to receive publications from
 abroad and can expect all correspondence with foreign
 countries to be carefully monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Cuban authorities continue to place very extensive checks and
 controls on freedom of expression. The Government does not
 allow direct criticism of the "Revolution," e.g. the basic
 policies and Marxist-Leninist orientation of the Government,
 party or leadership. Laws are enforced against antigovernment
 "propaganda," antigovernment grafitti, and slander or insults
 against government officials. Local CDR's monitor and report
 on expressions of dissent or criticism.
 The electronic and print media are owned by the State or
 party-controlled organizations and operate according to party
 
 
 538
 guidelines. No public forum exists for airing one's views
 apart from the government-controlled media. In 1989 as in
 previous years, the Government used the media as a vehicle to
 indoctrinate the population. Cuban media content reflected
 government views of events and stories tend to congratulate
 the Government for internal successes, primarily economic
 ones. By comparison, Cuban media coverage of Eastern European
 developments was terse but straightforward.
 In 1989, the Government moved to shut down new dissident
 efforts to publish independent newsletters. Thirteen members
 of the Cuban Human Rights Party were arrested for printing and
 distributing several issues of its new bulletin Franqueza
 (Openness). Manuel Gonzalez, Manuel Gonzalez, Sr., and Iris
 Perez received prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 1
 year for producing Franqueza. Copies of a second, unsigned
 dissident newsletter, El Lente (The Lens), appeared
 sporadically during the year.
 Cuban censorship of foreign media in 1989 expanded to include
 reform-minded Soviet publications. In August the Cuban party
 leadership announced it was removing two Soviet journals,
 Sputnik and Moscow Neis, from circulation. The Cuban
 Communist Party newspaper Granma justified the journals' ban
 from circulation by citing their "negative consequences" among
 the Cuban populace. Periodicals from non-Communist countries
 are not available to the general public, and foreign
 broadcasts, apart from U.S.-based Radio Marti, are not heard
 by significant numbers of people.
 The Government extended its intimidation to the foreign press
 on several occasions in 1989. A group of U.S. journalists
 covering the July 26th celebrations reported being warned that
 foreign journalists *ho visit Cuban dissidents or who report
 about them could jeopardize their stay in Cuba and issuance of
 future visas. The Reuters correspondent in Havana was
 expelled from Cuba in July for publishing a report the
 Government found unacceptable.
 Artistic and literary freedom are circumscribed by government
 control. Party and government officials carefully scrutinize
 humor and irony in the arts. In 1989 one art exhibition
 containing pictures which unflatteringly portrayed President
 Castro was closed. A Vice Minister of Culture barred from
 public display a painting which depicted Castro speaking to a
 crowd whose faces were all identical to his.
 Academic freedom is severely limited. Education is the
 exclusive prerogative of the State, and the school system "
 follows Marxist-Leninist precepts as interpreted by government
 guidelines. Academics'can write freely so long as their work
 does not conflict with any government or party policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution does not provide for freedom of assembly or
 association. Any assembly of more than three persons even in
 a private home is punishable by up to 3 months in prison and a
 fine. Organizers of "illicit or unrecognized groups" can
 receive a sentence of up to 9 months (Article 240 of the Penal
 Code).
 There was no known instance in 1989 of authorities approving
 any public meeting by a group not recognized by the Government.
 On the contrary, the Government continued its crackdown
 
 
 539
 CUBA
 begun in October 1988 on dissidents seeking to hold meetings
 or to organize demonstrations. During Soviet leader
 Gorbachev's visit to Havana in April, at least 21 activists
 were arrested in connection with a planned demonstration.
 Four Cuban Human Rights Party members received sentences of
 from 3 to 9 months for "planning an illegal gathering" (see
 Section l.e.).
 Article 208 of the Penal Code. prohibits "illegal or
 unrecognized groups." The Ministry of Justice, in
 consultation with the MININT, determines the legality of all
 organizations. Apart from "recognized" churches and one or
 two groups such as the Masonic Order which are carefully
 monitored by authorities, the small, unrecognized, and thus
 illegal human rights groups represent the only associations
 independent of the State and the party. The authorities
 continued to ignore the applications for legal recognition
 made by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National
 Reconciliation and the Cuban Human Rights Committee over the
 past 3 years.
 Cuban citizens are expected to join party-controlled mass
 organizations, such as the CDR's, the Confederation of Cuban
 Workers, the Federation of Cuban Women, and the Union of
 Communist Youth. Resisting membership makes persons subject
 to a range of unofficial sanctions.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government places restrictions on the practice of religion
 and discriminates against believers, despite the
 Constitution's recognition of the rights of citizens to
 profess and practice any religious belief. Religious
 believers are excluded from membership in the Communist Party
 and thus from almost all executive and leadership positions,
 including posts in the Government, the courts, and the
 teaching profession. Persons who publicly profess their
 religious beliefs may be subject to informal discrimination in
 the workplace and through social pressures on their children
 in school. Practicing Catholics, for instance, have a
 difficult time getting more desirable jobs or being admitted
 into certain fields of study.
 Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials have publicly admitted
 that religious discrimination exists, although they claimed it
 was not authorized. Indeed, there has been a perceived slight
 relaxation of official attitudes toward religion which
 contributed to modest increases in both church attendance and
 baptisms. Catholic Church officials noted in 1989 a growing
 number of youths willing publicly to profess their faith.
 The Government and Communist Party continued to maintain
 restrictions and controls on the activities of organized
 churches. Churches and other religious groups must register
 with the Government and be "recognized."' Recognized faiths
 customarily are permitted to hold religious activities only
 within specifically designated places of worship, but
 permission was granted for services in prisons and some health
 care institutions in 1989. Many Catholic and Protestant
 churches have closed, and new construction has been restricted
 since the Revolution. Four Protestant and two Catholic
 seminaries are allowed to operate, but no other formal
 
 
 540
 religious training schools are permitted. Atheism is taught
 by youth organizations. Churches have no access to official
 mass media. The observance of religious holidays is
 difficult, and most traditional processions are prohibited.
 Christmas is a normal workday.
 Despite these restrictions, relations between the Government
 and recognized churches have improved since the mid-1980's.
 In 1989 the Government demonstrated a greater willingness to
 establish a dialogue with church leaders, and President Castro
 welcomed the prospect of a future papal visit to Cuba. The
 Government slightly expanded the ad hoc exceptions it granted
 in 1988 to recognized churches: admission of foreign clergy
 to work in Cu2a, greater tolerance for religious instruction,
 freedom for clergy to travel abroad, permission for the
 importation of increased quantities of Bibles, and freedom to
 hold conventions. While churches have been granted
 exceptions, they have not, been conceded "rights".
 Since April, clergy have been allowed to visit prisoners who
 have requested their services. The Catholic Church
 established telex links among its diocesan offices and with
 church officials overseas as authorized by the Government in
 1988. The Seventh-Day Adventist church held a national
 congress in Cuba, and foreign Adventist officials were
 permitted to attend in their official capacity. The small
 Jewish community was again allowed to import religious
 materials, and kosher food and wine. Cuban authorities, while
 clamping down on other unauthorized publications in 1989,
 continued to permit limited circulation of an independent
 newsletter published by a Catholic layman. The Government
 allowed access to construction materials needed to rebuild
 some existing churches, but provincial and local officials
 have opposed certain restoration projects. In December 1988
 in Palma Soriana, a parish priest, with the help of his
 congregation, succeeded in restoring and reopening a small
 chapel. Local party officials organized a mob to break up the
 inaugural service. When the priest managed to defuse the
 protest by leading the crowds outside the church in the
 national anthem, he was detained by police for "proselytizing
 and holding a service in public" and released hours later only
 after vigorous public protest.
 Members of certain faiths have suffered active persecution.
 Human rights monitors reported several cases of Jehovah's
 Witnesses arrested for illegal meetings and possession of
 clandestine publications (i.e., Jehovah's Witnesses tracts) in
 1989, including the cases of Ursulo Brito and Samuel Camacho
 Hernandez (sentenced to 6 months in prison), and of Eloy Ramos
 Gonzalez (sentenced to 1 year). In April police reportedly
 infiltrated a Jehovah's Witnesses prayer meeting in Suri and
 staged a raid on the home of Felipe Bofill where prayers where
 being offered for Bofill's gravely ill son. Several persons
 were arrested, tried, and convicted of charges of "illegal
 meeting and possession of clandestine printing."
 Other religious groups Also suffer such repression; in a raid
 in December 1988 reported by the Cuban Human Rights Committee,
 the home of Baptist pastor Eliejar Samado Cazavus of Granma
 was ransacked and religious literature confiscated. Samado
 subsequently lost his job and was forced to rely on small
 donations from his congregation to support his family.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on domestic travel, but Cuban
 citizens require permission both to leave and to reenter Cuba.
 Opportunities for nonofficial foreign travel are severely
 restricted, limited generally to elderly pensioners, church
 officials, and special humanitarian cases for serious family
 illness or death.
 Cuban authorities strictly control emigration but in 1989
 again permitted several thousand persons, including hundreds
 of former political prisoners, to leave the country
 permanently with no right of return. Draft-age males were
 generally not allowed to depart. During 1989 the Government
 continued to deny, without any explanation, exit permission to
 some persons and their immediate families who had already been
 accepted into immigration and refugee admissions programs of
 other countries. For example, the Government has repeatedly
 refused exit permission to Sebastian Arcos Cazabon, the son of
 human rights leader Sebastian Arcos Bergnes.-
 It is a crime to leave the country without authorization.
 Persons who attempt to flee on small boats or inner tubes face
 sanctions ranging from fines to 3 years' imprisonment. The
 number of persons convicted of "illegal" departure reportedly
 rose sharply in 1989 (see Section l.e.). Discrimination
 against intending legal emigrants lessened in 1989, although
 extricating a family from the web of state employment,
 housing, and education remains a complex and often frustrating
 process. Once emigration formalities are completed, all
 family possessions and property go to the State unless
 immediate relatives are able to take possession.
 Cubans traveling as emigrants or refugees to other countries
 have no right to return for a visit or repatriation. The
 Government continued to restrict the number of persons of
 Cuban origin from the United States permitted to visit their
 families in Cuba to 50 persons per week under a worldwide
 quota of 5,000 per year. Persons who came to the United
 States in the Mariel boatlift were routinely denied
 repatriation and the Cuban Government allowed no more than 10
 of them per week to visit Cuba. Entry into Cuba by Cuban
 Americans was suspended entirely for the last quarter of
 1989. The Government reduced to $250 per trip the amount of
 currency visiting expatriates can bring to family members in
 Cuba.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuban citizens have no legal right to seek to change their
 government or even to advocate this righe The only political
 organization allowed in Cuba is the Communist Party. The
 overlapping party and state hierarchy has remained largely
 unchanged for 30 years. Members of the highest governing
 bodies, the Politburo and the Central Committee, are selected
 by a small group of party leaders. Although direct elections
 Are held to fill municipal offices, the provincial assemblies
 and the National Assembly are elected indirectly. Only the
 party and its affiliated mass organizations have the right to
 distribute political materials or to organize electoral
 meetings. All candidates must, in effect, be approved by the
 Communist Party. In March, dissident Roberto Bahamonde
 challenged the system and ran against the Communist Party
 
 
 542
 CUBA
 candidate for a municipal assemjbly seat in Havana. Bahamonde
 lost and was imprisoned on other charges several weeks later
 (see Sections l.d. and l.e.).
 In December 1988, 163 European and American intellectuals
 joined Cuban expatriates in signing an open letter calling for
 a plebiscite on Fidel Castro's rule, following the October
 1988 example of Chile. One month earlier, the Cuban Human
 Rights Party had advocated a plebiscite on whether to repeal
 the Constitution and convoke a constituent assembly.
 Government officials rejected the call for a plebiscite and
 called the comparison with Chile "absurd."
 In 1989 Fidel Castro distanced Cuba from democratizing trends
 sweeping through the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe,
 rationalizing his continued unwillingness to allow greater
 opportunities for Cuban citizens to participate freely in the
 political system.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged.Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights monitors are legally unrecognized and
 lead a precarious existence dependent upon the vagaries of
 government bolicy. The Government continued, in violation of
 its own statutes, to refuse to recognize the applications for'
 legalization submitted in 1988 and 1989 by several such groups
 (see Section 2.b.>'. In its 1988/89 Annual Repbrt, the IACHR
 called on the Government to recognize human rights
 associations and their right to engage in their activities
 freely. The three principal domestic human rights monitoring
 groups are the Cuban Human Rights Committee CCCPDH), the Cuban
 Human Rights Party (PPDHC) and the Cuban Commission for Human
 Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN). There is a host
 of smaller human rights-related groups, most notably the Free
 Art Association (APAL) and the Marti Committee for Human
 Rights, which appeared in 1988. In February 1980, the PPDHC,
 CCDHRN, and Mart-i Committee for Human Rights banded together
 under an umbrella group, the Coordinator of Human Rights
 Organizations.
 The Government's stepped-up crackdown on Cuba's human rights'
 movement was the most significant development in the country's
 human rights situation in 1989. Official policy changed from
 increasing limited tolerance through mid-1988 to-repression
 after the September 1988 visit of the UNHRC Cuba Working
 Group. Since then, the Government has taken or fabricated
 opportunities to harass, detain, or imprison approximately 50
 activists and has, in effect, silenced many of its leading
 domestic critics. Some of the arrested activists had
 presented testieony to the UNHRC Cuba Working Group, although
 their arrests were officially for alleged actions unconnected
 with their testimony. The UNHRC delegation was assured by
 Cuban authQrities that the witnesses would not suffer
 reprisals for their testimony. About 25 of those activists
 arrested or detained, including the leaders of four of the
 five human rights groups named above, remained imprisoned or
 held without charge at year's end (see Section l.d.).
 The atmosphere of increased openness leading up to the UNHRC's
 visit led some human rights activists to attempt to exercise
 what they viewed as their rights to peaceful assembly and
 speech. The Government responded with the pattern of arrests,
 swiftly staged trials, and misdemeanor convictions which began
 
 
 543
 CUBA
 with the October 1988 arrest of six APAL activists and the
 November 1988 arrest of PPDHC leader Tania Diaz Castro.
 In 1989 the Government further clamped down as activists
 continued to test the limits of its tolerance by circulating
 petitions and underground publications and, in one case,
 trying to organize a demonstration. Cuban authorities
 appeared to follow legal procedures more scrupulously, but
 imposed harsher punishments. Elizardo Sanchez's 2-year prison
 term was the harshest sentence meted out to a human rights
 activists in several years (see Section l.e. for details on
 dissident trials). Extralegal harassment continued as well.
 Several human rights activists were beaten by thugs and at
 least eight others were arrested during a November 12 mass;
 incorrect rumors had circulated that prayers would be said at
 the mass to support hunger striking political prisoner Alfredo
 Mustelier. By the close of 1989, members of the human rights
 movement who were not in jail had reduced their public
 activities because of government repression.
 The ICRC was the only monitoring group which visited Cuba in
 1989. Cuban authorities permitted the ICRC to make a second
 annual visit to prisons and to monitor conditions of inmates.
 The ICRC, whose findings are strictly confidential, did report
 that its delegation interviewed 257 prisoners in 10 detention
 centers, including the Havana Psychiatric Hospital. The
 Government denied permission to representatives from AW and AI
 to attend the trial of human rights leader Elizardo Sanchez.
 Following its September 1988 visit, the UNHRC Cuba Working
 Group submitted a 400-page report to its parent commission in
 February 1989. The report detailed extensive human rights
 abuses by Cuba and noted numerous outstanding questions posed
 by the Working Group which Cuban authorities had failed to
 answer. The UNHRC, at its 1989 session, passed a resolution
 charging the U.N. Secretary General to maintain a dialogue
 with the Cuban Government in order to follow up on outstanding
 issues in the Working Group's report. Cuban authorities (who,
 under international pressure in 1988, had invited the Working
 Group to visit) made it clear in their 1989 public statements
 that, notwithstanding the content of the report, they
 considered international attention to Cuban human rights
 practices to be a closed chapter.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a large population of
 persons with mixed racial ancestry. The'Constitution
 expressly forbids discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or
 national origin, and there were no known incidents of direct
 racial or sexual discrimination in 1989. The Family Code of
 1975 equalized pay scales, eliminated sexual discrimination in
 promotions, provided generous maternity leave, and gave
 employed women preferential access to goods and services.
 Public or official expressions of racial discrimination or
 prejudice are rare. The official women's organization, the
 Federation of Cuban Women, is used to mobilize women
 politically rather than to advocate women's rights exclusively.
 There are no official data available on the incidence of
 violence against women. Neither the Government nor society
 condone such violence. Cuban law establishes strict penalties
 for sexual abuse or rape of women, including the death penalty
 for the rape of minors or serious injury to the victim. The
 
 
 544
 CUBA
 Penal Code also provides lesser sanctions for sexual coercion
 of women by authorities or guardians. These statutes appear
 to be enforced with typical severity by the authorities,
 although sexual crimes are never ieported in the press.
 Anecdotal evidence from human rights groups and other sources
 indicates that domestic violence such as wife beating is a
 problem, but a lack of statistical data makes it impossible to
 gauge its true extent. Due to societal traditions many
 victims of abuse are reluctant to file a report or to press
 charges, so it is likely that cases of violence are
 significantly underreported. Women complain of verbal
 harassment in public and expected subordination at home.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives priority to state or collective needs
 over individual choices regarding free association or
 provision of employment; the decision and choices of workers
 are subordinate to the "demands of the economy and society"
 (Article 44). Strikes are not permitted under the law.
 Established Cuban labor organizations are not trade unions in
 any real sense and do not act as a voice for workers' rights,
 including the right to strike. Labor is organized under the
 control of the State and party through one umbrella group, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC). The CTC is affiliated
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions
 and its regional organization, the Permanent Congress of Trade
 Union Unity of Latin America (CPUSTAL). The CTC serves
 primarily as an instrument of the State to enforce political
 and labor discipline, to encourage productivity, to hold down
 labor costs, and to save raw materials. Some CTC member labor
 organizations have served as debating forums for the
 consideration of a limited range of labor issues such as
 worker safety and local working conditions.
 The right to form an independent union is prohibited and even
 discussion of such a step has been subject to punishment.
 Despite increased repression of many dissident groups in 1989,
 however, several embryonic labor organizing groups appeared
 and discussed the need for autonomous representation of
 workers' interests along the lines of the Solidarity movement
 in Poland. Two of these groups, the Independent Trade Union
 Movement and the Free Trade Union, claimed to have gathered
 membership in workplaces in the capital region. These tiny
 groups remain very much on the margins, and even the
 discussion of independent unions is a dangerous form of
 dissent, often characterized by authorities as a form of
 "industrial sabotage." In August Havana ironworker Ricardo
 Figueira Castro, a member of the CCPDH, was arrested and
 charged with enemy propaganda. Figueira had unsuccessfully
 sought a position in his factory's official union with the
 idea of making it more responsive to workers' needs.
 Nevertheless, he began to represent workers' interests
 informally with management and to speak out about the need for
 more independent representation with coworkers. Figueira's
 arrest soon followed.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) again challenged the trade union
 monopoly granted to the CTC in violation of Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association. The Committee asked the Government to
 report what steps it is taking to bring its legislation into
 conformance.
 
 
 545
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Effective collective bargaining does not exist. The State
 Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. There are no known export processing
 zones in Cuba. Since the CTC is an instrument of the
 government policy, antiunion discrimination is not a relevant
 concept except as it applies to the Government's repression of
 independent union groups like those mentioned above.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution and the Labor Code do not contain
 prohibitions on forced labor. Workers do not have full
 freedom to change jobs without official approval. Every
 worker must present a work identification card in seeking a
 new job. This card contains information on performance of
 "voluntary" work, protection of socialist property, political
 consciousness, failure to meet production goals, and
 negligence. In practice, any job change remains under the
 control of'the authorities who grade and evaluate employee
 records that form the basis of the work identity cards.
 Special groups of workers on loan from other jobs known as
 "microbrigades" are employed on special construction projects,
 often working a 60- to 70-hour week of physical labor. Some
 human rights monitors allege that workers refusing to
 "volunteer" for such projects often find themselves victims of
 discrimination or even risk losing their jobs. "Microbrigade"
 workers, however, are reportedly rewarded with priority
 listing for apartments, a very powerful incentive for
 voluntary work.
 Various ILO bodies have found that governmental restrictions
 on the freedom to choose or change employment are incompatible
 with ILO Conventions prohibiting forced labor. Most recently,
 the 1989 report of the ILO Committee of Experts, cited above,
 found provisions of the new labor code imposing "correctional
 labor," and compulsory labor for damage due to negligence, to
 be incompatible with Convention 105 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age is 17; however, the labor code
 provides for exceptions for those aged 15 and 16 to obtain
 training or to fill labor shortages. There is no evidence
 that authorities deviated from these rules in 1989. However,
 all students above the age of 11 are expected to devote 30 to
 45 days of their summer vacations to agricultural work up to a
 maximum of 8 hours per day.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 During 1989 Cuba's minimum wage remained at $140 per month at
 the overvalued official exchange rate or about $20 in terms of
 black-market buying power, plus a "social wage" consisting of
 free medical care and education, along with subsidized housing
 and rationed food. Even with the state subsidies, a worker
 needs to earn substantially more than the minimum wage to
 support a family. The value of the "social wage" in improving
 living standards is diminished by the persistent shortages and
 tight rationing that have become standard features of the
 Cuban economy. For example, most newly married couples must
 live with relatives for years before obtaining their own
 housing and the supression of free farmers' markets in 1986
 
 
 546
 (following a brief experiment with market incentives)
 exacerbated shortages of some foods, although caloric intake
 remains high.
 Maximum hours of work are 44 regular hours per week, with
 shorter workdays for unusually demanding jobs such as
 undergrojund mining. Overtime is limited by law and practice,
 although workers are pressured to engage in additional unpaid
 "voluntary" labor. Workers receive 30 calendar days of
 vacation regardless of seniority or age. Provisions for
 worker safety and controlof pollution generally appear
 inadequate. There is a lack of effective control and
 enforcement mechanisms to ensure worker safety, and industrial
 accidents are apparently frequent.
