 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The Grand Duke is the Chief of State, but his
 duties are mostly ceremonial. Real power rests with the
 12-member Government, headed by the Prime Minister and
 responsible to Parliament, which receives its authority
 through free and fair elections.
 The police and gendarmerie maintain internal order. Both are
 under the control of the Government and respect human rights.
 The country is free from strife, and residents enjoy fair and
 efficient judicial and penal systems.
 Luxembourg is a highly developed, industrialized state with a
 free enterprise economic system and a high standard of living.
 Luxembourg continued its commitment to human rights in 1990.
 Individual human rights are provided for in the Constitution
 and protected in practice, and Luxembourg actively promotes
 respect for human rights internationally. It continues
 efforts to treat its relatively large foreign population
 fairly, and to engage labor unions in the industrial
 decigionmaking process.

 Luxembourg law is a composite of local practice, legal
 tradition, and foreign systems--French, Belgian, and German.
 Except in cases of hot pursuit, police must obtain a warrant
 from judicial authorities before making an arrest. Any person
 detained by'the authorities must be charged and appear before
 a judge no later than 24 hours after arrest. Immediate access
 to a lawyer of one's own choosing is accorded by law. No one
 is held incommunicado. Bail may be granted, depending on the
 circumstances. Preventive detention does not exist, but
 persons may be incarcerated pending trial if so ordered by a
 judge. Exile is not imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg's judiciary is. independent and free from executive
 or military interference. Military courts exist, but civilians
 are not subject to their jurisdiction. Defendants are assured
 the right to legal counsel, at public expense if necessary.
 Charges are formally and clearly stated. Defendants have the

 right to be tried in public, to confront witnesses, and to
 present evidence. They are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty. Verdicts may be appealed by either the defendant or
 the State. An appeal results in a completely new judicial
 hearing, and sentences may be increased as well as decreased.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Luxembourg law and customs are based on regard for personal
 freedom. Neither the State nor political organizations
 arbitrarily intrude into the private lives of Luxembourg
 residents. Police must have a warrant, issued by the
 judiciary, to enter a private home. Electronic surveillance
 may be carried out only when authorized by a judge.

 pornography, there is no censorship of the media. The
 broadcasting industry is privately owned, excepting 4 percent
 which is indirectly controlled by the French Government. The
 print media are also privately owned. The media operate
 independently from the Government. Academic freedom is
 respected.

 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is assured
 constitutionally and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings, and permits are

 practice the religion of one's choice, including: maintaining
 places of worship, training clergy, publishing religious
 material, providing religious education, and participating in
 charitable activities. Foreign clergy work in freedom.
 Statistically, Luxembourg is about 90 percent Roman Catholic.
 Recognized religions are supported by the Government, which
 pays the salaries of clergy of the Roman Catholic, Protestant,
 and Jewish faiths. In addition, local governments may support
 recognized religions by providing and maintaining buildings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration; and Repatriation

 1213
 
 LUXEMBOURG
 elections, held every 5 years, and in local elections, held
 every 6 years. Voting is by secret ballot, with multiple
 candidates for most positions. Luxembourg's large foreign
 population (26 percent) does not have the right to vote, but
 it may exert considerable influence on the political process
 indirectly by joining labor unions or other organizations.
 Representative bodies, including Parliament, are free to
 debate and vote against the Government. Opposition groups,
 including political parties, function openly and .freely
 without fear of government repression. There are no
 restrictions on the participation of women in government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Both local and international human rights groups may operate
 without government restriction. There were no requests to
 investigate human rights abuses. Luxembourg has consistently
 supported international and nongovernmental investigation of
 alleged human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited by
 law. Adequate food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Equal pay for equal work is mandated by law. Women and men
 enjoy the same property rights. Property acquired during a
 marriage is divided equally upon dissolution of the marriage,
 unless a prenuptial agreement exists which stipulates how
 property is to be divided. Family members are protected by
 law. Violence against women is not widespread, and it is not
 tolerated by the Government. Wife beating is prohibited by
 law. Several women's rights groups are active in Luxembourg,
 including those which aid battered women.
 Section.6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to a.ssociate freely, to choose their
 own representatives, publicize views, and determine their
 programs. Slightly more than 50 percent of the labor fQrce is
 unionized. Membership is not mandatory. The two largest
 industrial unions are linked to, but organized independently
 of, Luxembourg's Socialist Party and the Christian Social
 Party respectively. With the exception of government workers
 who provide essential services, all workers have the right to
 strike. Gdvernment workers who may legally strike must
 observe certain conditions, such as -a cooling-off period,
 before implementing'their action.. Strikes are rare. There
 was one strike in 1990, the first in many years, in which
 letter carriers struck for 2 weeks. The action ended when the
 Government agreed to review their grievances.
 Unions are free from government interference and maintain
 unrestricted contact with international bodies in their
 fields. Luxembourg unions maintain affiliation with the
 European Trade Union Confederation and the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution ensures freedom of union activity and
 protects union leaders and members from discrimination.
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively on
 behalf of their members, and this right is applied uniformly
 throughout the country. Worker representatives are required
 in all businesses of 15 or more employees. In businesses with
 over 150 employees, 50 percent of the joint works councils are
 elected by the employees. In businesses with more than 1,000
 employees, one-third of the membership of the boards of
 directors must be employees or their elected representatives.
 An effective system exists to hear and adjudicate employment-
 related complaints. There are no export processing zones, and
 labor law and practice are the same throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist.
 d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children under the age of 15 is prohibited.
 Children are required by law to remain in school until they
 are 16 years old. The Ministries of Labor and Education,
 respectively, oversee the strict enforceient of national child
 labor and education laws. Adolescent workers (ages 15 to 17)
 are provided special protection by law, such as limited
 overtime and a specified number of hours which may be worked
 continuously.
 e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is $5.85 per hour for all workers 18 years of
 age and older. Younger workers are subject to a lower minimum
 wage, set at $3.50 per hour for those 15 years of age. The
 minimum wage rate increases annually until the worker is 18.
 A supplement is added for workers with dependents. Supporting
 a family would be difficult on the minimum wage, although few
 workers receive as little as the minimum wage. Luxembourg
 wages are among the highest in the world. National legislation
 mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required for
 work outside the normal workweek. Work on Sunday is generally
 prohibited, except in certain circumstances such as continuous
 process industries (steel and chemical) and for certain
 workers such as maintenance and security personnel. All
 workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly,
 in addition to paid holidays.
 Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among the highest
 in the world. The Ministry of Labor has oversight 'or the
 stringent inspection system established to enforce legislated
 standards for a safe working environment. Inspectors can
 impose severe penalties. Employed pregnant women receive
 special consideration in the workplace.
