 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule dating
 from 1849, when representative government was introduced. A
 Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister and accountable to the
 unicameral Parliament (Folketing) has responsibility for
 government decisions. The 179 members of the Folketing are
 elected in free and open elections under a complex system of
 proportional representation designed to protect the rights of
 minority parties and to reflect the popular vote. All Danish
 citizens age 18 or over are eligible to vote. Nine political
 parties, covering a broad spectrum of political philosophies,
 are represented in the present Folketing. Since late 1982,
 Denmark has been governed by a four-party minority coalition
 led by Prime Minister Schluter's Conservative Party, but it is
 dependent on support from other parties to maintain a
 parliamentary majority.
 Human rights are highly respected and well protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. The Danish
 Constitution contains provisions which allow one-third of the
 Folketing to demand that a law approved by Parliament be
 subjected to a popular referendum. The Constitution also
 establishes the Folketing's "Ombudsman," to whom any citizen
 can protest if he or she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated
 by any Danish national or municipal authority. Women play a
 leading role in all aspects of public life. (The Danish
 Constitution was altered in 1953 to introduce the principle of
 female succession, and Queen Margrethe II ascended the throne
 in 1972.) Denmark has displayed high concern for the rights of
 minorities living in the Kingdom, particularly for the
 indigenous populations of territories such as Greenland and the
 Faroe Islands, which now enjoy broad powers of home rule. At
 the global level, Denmark participates actively in a number of
 international commissions concerned with the protection and
 preservation of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Danish authorities do not engage in political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are
 prohibited by statutes which are respected in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against torture and inhuman treatment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. In 1983, a rehabilitation
 and research center for torture victims was established in
 Copenhagen. The center, which was opened with a grant from the
 Carlsberg Foundation, is the first and only medical facility
 specializing in the treatment of physical and mental trauma
 associated with torture. Since an estimated 100 foreign
 torture victims seek refuge in Denmark each year, the center
 has primarily limited its treatment to the refugee community.

 Most of those treated have come from Latin America, Africa, or
 Asia.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark can be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested individuals must be taken
 before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge has the
 authority to determine whether the person should be detained in
 pretrial custody or released pending trial. The Constitution
 makes provision for bail. Arrested individuals have access to
 legal counsel of their choice or court-appointed attorneys.
 Non-Danish speakers are provided with interpreters at
 government expense. The occasional use of isolation during the
 pretrial custody period has been criticized in the media.
 Police authorities maintain that isolation is necessary to
 protect the investigation, and the system continues to be used,
 though only in the most serious crimes such as narcotics
 violations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. Exceptions to this principle may
 occur when ordered by the trial judge, who may do so only
 within narrowly drawn parameters. The most common exceptions
 in civil cases occur in paternity and divorce trials. In
 criminal cases, trials are only closed when it is necessary to
 protect the privacy of the victim, such as in rape or child
 molestation cases, or-when it is deemed necessary to protect
 the identity of a witness. Danish courts make extensive
 efforts to obtain the facts of a case, and the rights of the
 accused are carefully protected. All indigent defendants in
 Denmark have the right to a court-appointed attorney at
 government expense. The defendant is free to change the
 court-appointed attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution specifically prohibits unlawful interference
 in the home or in individual privacy. Violation of the privacy
 of communications without judicial sanction is also
 prohibited. These provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Includingt
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark has a free and open society. An individual may express
 an opinion in written or oral form on any matter, subject only
 to the condition that the person can be held responsible in a
 court of law. Media representatives and private individuals
 make full use of the freedom of expression. Criticism of the
 Government or government policy is not a punishable offense and
 censorship is not utilized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations for
 any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings or demonstrations which could constitute a
 danger to the public peace. Approximately 85 percent of Danish
 
 
 970
 wage earners are members of trade unions. Under the General
 Agreement of 1960, workers and employers acknowledged each
 other's right to organize. Labor agreements and legislation
 protect the rights of workers and employers and regulate the
 work environment.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is
 recognized as the established church of Denmark. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all residents of Denmark.
 No one may be discriminated against because of religious
 beliefs. These laws are strictly enforced in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel and to reenter Denmark.
 Refugees and asylum seekers are provided with travel documents,
 when needed, which permit return to Denmark. Forced
 repatriation is not utilized. On October 1, 1983, a new Alien
 Act, which expands protection for the rights of aliens, became
 effective. The new law spells out in detail the rights of
 aliens in Denmark and provides for appeal procedures when
 residence permission is denied. An alien directorate will be
 established January 1, 1984, which will take over the work
 previously handled by the alien police. Measures designed to
 protect the rights of potential refugees or asylum seekers
 include the establishment of a refugee board with authority to
 reverse decisions of the alien directorate and guaranteeed
 access to legal counsel and interpreter service.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Denmark is governed by a Cabinet responsible to the Folketing
 (Parliament). The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen
 after consultation with the political parties represented in
 the Folketing. The present Government, formed in September
 1982, is composed of minority parties under the leadership of
 the Conservatives. Members of the Folketing are selected in
 open elections in which every Danish citizen 18 years or over
 may participate. A political party must obtain at least 2
 percent of the total vote to obtain representation in the
 Folketing. Nine political parties with a variety of political
 beliefs are represented in the current Parliament. The
 Constitution states that parliamentary elections must be held
 at least every four years.
 The Government can be changed by calling new elections or, as
 happened in 1982, by the resignation of the Government in power
 and the formation of a new government composed of parties
 already represented in the Folketing.
 Women actively participate at all levels of the political
 process. They hold positions of authority in political
 parties, local governments, and in the national government.
 Four cabinet ministries (Labor, Interior, Culture, and
 Ecclesiastical Affairs) are headed by women. Some 22 percent
 of the seats in the Danish Parliament are currently held by
 women.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 All Danish citizens and subjects are guaranteed equal
 protection under the law. The territories of Greenland and the
 Faroe Islands have home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. Eskimos
 freely participate in international ethnic organizations such
 as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, which was recently
 recognized by the United Nations and is based in Greenland.
 Even though there are periodic disagreements between the home
 rule authorities and the Danish Government, there have been no
 accusations of human rights violations made against the Danish
 Government before any international organization.
 Denmark is a party to the International Covenants on Human
 Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and various
 other conventions designed to promote and protect human
 rights. Denmark was a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission during the period 1980-82. Denmark was elected to
 the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 1983. The
 Government's commitment to human rights issues is fully
 supported by the Danish population. Freedom House rates
 Denmark among the world's "free" nations.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Denmark's per capita gross national product is approximately
 $12,784. At birth, Danes can expect to live to 75 years of
 age. The infant mortality rate is 7.9 per 1,000 live births.
 The Danish population grew by 0.1 percent in 1982, but a
 population decrease of approximately the same percentage is
 projected for 1983. All school-aged children, including the
 handicapped, have access to free public education, and the
 nation is 99 percent literate. The average Danish diet of
 3,100 calories per day exceeds basic nutritional requirements
 by 10-20 percent.
 Well over 50 percent of the national budget is devoted to
 welfare, housing, labor, and education. Austerity measures
 introduced by the present Government have reduced social
 benefits by approximately three percent. However, this modest
 reduction has not materially altered the extensive welfare
 protection provided to Danish subjects.
 Social benefits are available to all on an equal basis without
 regard to race, creed, or political belief. The Equal Rights
 Council has worked successfully to eliminate laws and
 regulations which contained sex discrimination provisions.
 Women hold positions of authority at all levels of society, and
 the number in senior positions is increasing. However, the
 number of unemployed young women (25 years of age or younger)
 remains significantly higher than the number of unemployed
 young men of the same age group.
