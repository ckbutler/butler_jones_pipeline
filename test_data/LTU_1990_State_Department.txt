 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania, the largest of the three independent Baltic states
 between the two World Wars, was forcibly annexed by the
 U.S.S.R. in 1940. The United States has never recognized the
 incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Lithuania has been subjected to
 the same centralized rule, the same constitution and judicial
 system, and the same restrictions on civil and political
 rights as in the U.S.S.R. However, Lithuanians in 1990
 asserted greater control over their own affairs.
 'The first generally free and fair elections since annexation
 took place on February 24. The Lithuanian Popular Front,
 Sajudis, openly advocated the full restoration of prewar
 independence and won an overwhelming majority in the Supreme
 Council (legislature). On March 11, the Supreme Council voted
 to restore "the sovereign rights" of the Lithuanian State as
 wrell as Lithuania's independence. Sajudis leader Vytautas
 Landsbergis was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council (or
 chief of state).
 The March declaration of independence resulted in contested
 lines of authority within Lithuania. While the U.S.S.R. does
 not recognize Lithuania as an independent state, it does
 consider the Landsbergis Government to be the legal leadership
 of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Lithuania and did not
 generally challenge its authority in areas traditionally under
 republic control. However, the U.S.S.R. moved in some cases
 to counter what it considers to be an usurpation of its
 power.
 The U.S.S.R. maneuvered troops to try to intimidate the new
 Government and the Lithuanian people and imposed an extensive
 economic blockade, including cutting off supplies of oil and
 reducing the flow of natural gas. A normal supply of oil and
 gas was restored after the Supreme Council on June 29 passed a
 resolution committing itself to a 100-day moratorium on its
 declaration of independence, which would take effect
 simultaneously with the beginning of negotiations on
 independence between Lithuania and the U.S.S.R. Only
 preliminary discussions were under way at year's end.
 The primary law enforcement organization is the militia
 (police), the officers of which are predominantly Lithuanian.
 The Committee for State Security (KGB), special troops of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and regular Soviet armed
 forces, which maintain a significant presence in Lithuania,
 are controlled by Moscow. KGB surveillance of political and
 human rights activists continues.
 Despite the economic hardships resulting from the oil and gas
 embargo, Lithuania continues to enjoy a higher overall
 standard of living than that of the U.S.S.R. The economy
 still suffers, however, from its links with the Soviet economy
 and its inefficient, overly centralized banking system.
 The human rights situation continued to improve. Freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion, was widely
 respected. However, progress was limited, both in Lithuania
 and the U.S.S.R., in adopting legislative reforms that would
 institutionalize human rights improvements. In January 1991,
 dozens of unarmed protesters were killed or wounded by Soviet
 troops taking over government and Communist Party buildings in
 the Baltics.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were ho known cases of such killing in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of -permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Lithuanians remained concerned in 1990 about instances in
 which Lithuanian youths were subjected to degrading treatment
 in the Soviet armed forces, leading in some cases to physical
 injuries, psychological trauma, and even suicide. In
 Lithuania, as in the-US.S.R., prisoners are harshly -treated
 during both interrogation and confinement in labor camps and
 prisons. Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners,
 overcrowding, and detention under extremely unhealthful
 conditions are common.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest,.Detention, or Exile
 Although Soviet laws-are written and interpreted so broadly
 that persons may be-arrested and convicted for trying to
 exercise basic human rights, Lithuanian  authorities in 1990
 did not use these laws to arrest political activists.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite provisions for judicial objectivity in both the
 Lithuanian and Soviet Constitutions, the State retains the
 ability to control the judicial process-and arbitrarily
 determine the outcome of trials. Procedural safeguards, such
 as the right to a public trial and to a defense attorney, are
 generally respected but are not sufficient to guarantee fair
 trials.
 There were no known trials on purely political charges in
 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Soviet security apparatus continued to interfere in the
 private lives of Lithuanians through the use of informers, the
 monitoring of communications, surveillance,-nd other neans.
 It did little,- however, in 1990 to intimidate Lithuanians or
 to hinder the transfer of political authority from the
 Communist Party to the Lithuanian Popular Front. Soviet
 authorities continued to monitor contacts between Lithuanians
 and foreign visitors, and Lithuanians assumed that their mail
 and telephone calls were also monitored. These practices
 appeared to have no significant effect, however, on the
 political or personal activities of Lithuanians.

 LITHUANIA
 Section 2 Respectfor Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lithuanian authorities in 1990 fully respected freedom of
 speech and press, allowing the dissemination of all opposition
 views, including those of the small but vocal group of
 Communists loyal to Moscow. The Communist Party retained
 control over many publishing facilities and publications, but
 independent periodicals increased in number and enjoyed wide
 popularity. There was no censorship of published material and
 no interference with the operations of newspapers and
 periodicals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Lithuanians enjoyed full freedom of assembly and association
 in 1990. Lithuanians of all political viewpoints made full
 use of this right in campaigning for the March elections to
 the Supreme Council. An estimated 300,000 Lithuanians
 gathered peacefully in Vilnius to express their support for
 independence on January 11 when Soviet President Mikhail
 Gorbachev visited Lithuania.
 The Lithuanian Constitution provides for the right to
 associate in public organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Lithuanians are free to practice their religion and conduct
 religious education. The Roman Catholic Church, by far the
 largest denomination, has actively supported Lithuanian
 aspirations toward self-determination and independence. There
 were no known instances of arrests or other forms of
 harassment for practicing one's religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 respected in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate is not
 recognized, and persons wishing to leave temporarily are
 generally required to present an invitation from abroad.
 Under Lithuanian law, Lithuanians enjoy full freedom of
 movement within their country. Soviet authorities still
 control border crossing points, customs, and travel by air and
 rail. In 1990 the Soviet Union reinforced its control over
 border crossing points between Lithuania and Poland.
 Lithuanians must carry Soviet passports. During the spring
 economic blockade, Soviet border authorities disrupted the
 normal flow of travel, effectively preventing Western
 officials and journalists from entering Lithuania. Lithuanian
 officials and private'citizens were allowed to cross the
 border.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 For the first time in postwar history, Lithuanians in February
 exercised their right to change the government. In elections
 to the Supreme Council, the Lithuanian people removed the
 
 
 1209
 LITHUANIA
 Communist Party from power and elected representatives from
 among numerous political parties and social action groups.
 The Supreme Council's Chairman, Vytautas Landsbergis,
 functions as Head of State. A Council of Ministers is
 directly accountable to the Supreme Council. Representatives
 of the Lithuanian Popular Front (Sajudis), a loose coalition
 of proindependence political organizations, is the majority
 element in the Council. However, effective economic and
 security control remains in Soviet hands.
 Elections to the Supreme Council are scheduled for 5-year
 intervals by secret ballot and with universal suffrage. There
 is no discrimination, in law or in practice, in the
 participation of women in government and politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no instances in which human rights groups made
 charges of violations or attempted to conduct investigations
 inside Lithuania. The Government in September cosponsored an
 international human rights conference together with the
 Leningrad City Council and Polish Solidarity.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Lithuanian Constitution. Non-Lithuanian
 ethnic groups comprise about 20 percent of the population and
 include largely Russians, Jews, and Poles. The Government has
 publicly committed itself to protect the human rights of all
 elements of the population.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day care service and maternity benefits
 assists women in obtaining and retaining jobs. In general,
 however, women hold less remunerative positions than do men in
 the same professions.
 Lithuanian statistics on the problem of violence against
 women, including wife beating, are unavailable. The official
 Soviet press discussed the issue, and the Soviet Council of
 Ministers established a special branch (headed by a woman) to
 study the problems of wolen. Human rights and women's rights
 groups in Lithuania are aware of the issue but have focused
 their efforts thus far on the broader question of independence
 and freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Until the March declaration of independence, Soviet labor law
 and practice had generally been enforced. The right of
 association as defined by the International Labor Organization
 was virtually nonexistent. After the rise of Sajudis, an
 independent Lithuanian Workers Union was created. It has
 functioned openly since its creation, existing parallel to the
 previously official Communist trade unions and enjoying the
 support of Lithuanian officials, but it does not yet
 effectively exercise trade union functions. The collective
 l.abor -disputes law passed by the U.S.S.R; Supreme Soviet in
 
 
 1210
 LITHUANIA
 1989 was applicable to Lithuania, at least until the
 declaration of independence.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Lithuania have not been free to organize or resort
 to collective bargaining. Wage rates have been established by
 central authorities and supplemented by bonuses determined by
 enterprise management with limited worker participation.
 There are no economic incentive zones in which labor standards
 differ from those elsewhere in Lithuania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition of forced or compulsory
 labor. Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16,
 and the standard workweek is 40 hours. There is no indication
 of widespread violations of these norms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Lithuania are similar to those in the
 Soviet Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical
 Committee, the average monthly wage in Lithuania for blue- and
 white-collar workers was above the Soviet average.
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 48 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports suggest, however, that the law on maximum hours of
 work and health and safety standards are widely ignored.
