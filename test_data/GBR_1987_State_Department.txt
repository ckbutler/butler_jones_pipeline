 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) is a constitutional monarchy, with
 government based on a multiparty, parliamentary democracy. As
 there is no written constitution, human rights are "residual,"
 i.e., assumed unless limited by statute. Human rights
 traditionally have been respected and guarded by the British
 people and their elected governments. The U.K. is a party to
 the European Convention on Human Rights and has accepted the
 jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights over cases
 of alleged human rights violations.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy.
 Persons may own property and pursue their economic interests,
 and the population benefits from a comprehensive social
 welfare program. British law bars discrimination on the basis
 of race, religion, sex, or political opinion.
 Although the United Kingdom has a long tradition of respect
 for human rights, terrorist activity and sectarian violence in
 and related to Northern Ireland has, from time to time, put
 that tradition to the test. Accordingly, while public safety
 in Great Britain is maintained by a civilian police force,
 army units back up armed elements of the Royal Ulster
 Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland.
 On November 15, 1985, the British and Irish Governments
 concluded the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Agreement affirms
 that the status of Northern Ireland will remain unchanged
 unless a majority in the North decide otherwise and provides
 for an Intergovernmental Conference in which the Irish
 Government can advance its views on some aspects of Northern
 Ireland and North/South affairs. The Agreement also envisages
 that the Conference will enhance cooperation between the
 security forces of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
 Although intended to safeguard the rights and identities of
 both communities in Northern Ireland, the Agreement has met
 with opposition, and paramilitary groups on both sides have
 continued their campaigns of violence. Reacting against the
 agreement, Unionist members of Parliament withdrew from the
 House of Commons. Other Unionists turned to strikes,
 boycotts, and suspension of work in local councils and the
 Northern Ireland Assembly. In July 1986, the Secretary of
 State for Northern Ireland halted all work before the end of
 the Assembly's session. No new elections have been
 scheduled. Following the 1987 parliamentary elections,
 Unionist politicians dropped their boycott of the House of
 Commons, and Unionist leaders entered into talks with
 government officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives.
 The Government reported that, during the first 9 months of
 1987, 63 persons were killed by terrorists in incidents
 related to Northern Ireland. Twenty-five were members of the
 security forces. In May 1987, security forces killed eight
 armed members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)
 
 
 1070
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 who were attacking a police station in Loughgall. A civilian
 was accidentally killed in this battle, making a total of nine
 people killed by the security forces in 1987. Since 1969,
 2,597 persons have died in violence related to Northern
 Ireland.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continue the controversial
 use of plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) for
 riot control. In recent years, 16 people have been killed by
 PBR's--over half of them under 16 years of age. Only two have
 been killed since 1982 and no one in 1987.
 In 1984 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling
 for a ban on PBR use in Northern Ireland. While acknowledging
 the danger of PBR's, the British Government contends they are
 less dangerous than live rounds. This view was supported in
 October 1984 when the European Commission on Human Rights
 dismissed as "manifestly ill-founded" a case involving PBR"s,
 ruling that their use was 'acceptable" and "less dangerous,
 than alleged."
 A number of fatal shootings beginning in 1982 invblving
 members of the RUC and the army gave rise to allegations
 including those in Amnesty International's 1987 Report, that
 the security forces in Northern Ireland practiced a
 "shoot-to-kill" policy when dealing with suspected terrorists.
 Investigation of these charges resulted in a report, not yet
 made public, by West Yorkshire Chief Constable Colin Sampson
 to the Director of Public Prosecution for consideration and
 possible judicial action. The long delay in completing action
 on the report has stimulated demands for an independent-
 judicial inquiry, as well as allegations of a cover-up by
 senior police officers.
 In April 1987, the Government announced a decision to draft,
 publish, and bring into force a code of practice for the
 exercise of emergency-powers by the RUC and armed forces in
 Northern Ireland. The code, expected to be published soon,
 will address the emergency powers available to the RUC and the
 armed forces and how they should be exercised.
 b. Disappearance
 Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement, nor do-they sponsor or
 condone such activities.
 The Government reported that during 1987 over 50 persons were
 abducted or illegally held hostage in terrorist and other
 incidents related to Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 British-law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or
 degradinq treatment of prisoners and provides penalties for
 -such abuse. Confessions obtained by such methods are not
 admissible as evidence in court.
 Government policy seeks to prevent abuse of prisoners. In
 January 1986, the Government put into effect a new Code of
 Practice for the police in Great Britain, with provisions for
 disciplinary action.
 
 
 1071
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The Police (Northern Ireland) Order of 1987, which was
 approved by Parliament in May 1987, provides for reform of
 police complaints procedures in Northern Ireland broadly in
 line with changes which were introduced in England and Wales
 in 1985. The new procedures are expected to go into effect in
 1988 with the establishment of the Independent Commission for
 Police Complaints. The new commission will have powers to
 approve officers, including those drawn from other police
 forces in the United Kingdom, to investigate complaints. In
 1987 there were no substantiated charges of mistreatment of
 arrestees during interrogation in Northern Ireland.
 The Government acknowledges that some old British prisons are
 unsatisfactory and that many prisoners live in cramped,
 unhygienic cells. To improve conditions, the Government has
 embarked on a program to build 20 new prisons and to refurbish
 existing ones.
 In Northern Ireland, where 60 percent of the prisoners are
 jailed for terrorist activities, prison conditions differ in
 some respects from those in Great Britain. All prisons in the
 province, except for the two centers for young offenders, are
 maximum-security institutions. This often forces low-risk
 common criminals in Northern Ireland to serve their sentences
 under maximum-security conditions. On the other hand,
 Northern Ireland prisons are generally more modern--five of
 Northern Ireland's seven prisons have been built since
 1970--than those in Great Britain. Northern Ireland prisoners
 also have visitation, mail, and clothing privileges not
 available to those in mainland prisons. In the last several
 years, two new prisons with an extensive range of educacional
 and training facilities have been opened, and the old prison
 in Armagh was closed. Community service programs for certain
 offenders as an alternative to prison have been very
 successful. Northern Ireland's prison population grew by less
 than 1.percent in 1987.
 Complaints continue about "strip searching," particularly of
 women, in Northern Ireland prisons, and Amnesty International,
 in its 1987 Report covering 1986, urged the Government to
 reconsider its policy. These searches involve a visual
 inspection conducted in special cubicles by female officers.
 Body cavity searches are not performed. Strip searching is
 routine for prisoners on first committal and final discharge
 and when making home visits. It is conducted on a random
 basis for prisoners making court appearances or leaving the
 prison temporarily for any reason. Since prisoners who are on
 remand (awaiting trial) are brought to court every 8 to 28
 days, they face the possibility of. more frequent strip
 searching than those who are sentenced. The Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights determined that strip searches
 remain necessary to protect the well-being of guards,
 prisoners, and the community at large. But the commission
 also stated that strip searching is conducted too frequently.
 All visitors to prisons, including government officials, are
 subject to a "rub-down search." This involves an officer
 passing his or her hands over the visitor's clothing.
 Visitors are not strip-searched. Strip searching is also
 conducted at prisons located in other parts of the United
 Kingdom.
 Britain has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the
 Transfer of Sentenced Persons, by which prisoners may be sent
 to their home countries to serve their sentences. Within the
 .United Kingdom, convicts are almost always required to serve
 
 
 1072
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 their prison time in the general region where the crime was
 committed. Transfers can, however, be requested. Prisoners
 from Northern Ireland, for example, who are serving time in
 Great Britain can apply for transfer to Northern Ireland to
 serve their sentences closer to their families. Several such
 requests were approved in 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 British law gives the police broad discretionary powers to
 make arrests without warrant based on reasonable cause.
 Procedures for bail, judicial determination of the legality of
 detention, and suits for false imprisonment are routinely
 utilized.
 Persons arrested without a warrant must be released on bail if
 they cannot be brought before a magistrate's court within 24
 hours. Generally, persons charged with nonserious offenses
 cat be released on bail. However, in some cases where the
 alleged offense is deemed serious, magistrates have repeatedly
 remanded persons for periods totaling up to 18 months before
 trial. In 1987 some 11,000 persons (roughly 20 percent of the
 prison population) were on remand. The average length of time
 between first remand and trial in scheduled cases in Northern
 Ireland declined steadily between 1984 and 1987, and the
 Emergency Provisions Act of 1987 gave the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland authority to specify maximum time limits
 for particular pretrial stages; this authority has not yet
 been utilized. The Home Secretary announced in late 1987 his
 intention to consider a similar system to help limit time on
 remand for detainees in England and Wales.
 British common law allows for the restriction of personal
 liberties by the Government in an emergency situation, subject
 to review by Parliament.  Acting on the premise that the
 fundamental "right to life" has been in serious jeopardy due
 to the violence in Northern Ireland, the Government has
 adopted the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts of
 1978 and 1987, which are applicable only to Northern Ireland;
 and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1984 (originally enacted in 1976), almost all of which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these
 acts permit the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at
 frequent intervals. In addition, Lord Colville was appointed
 in 1987 to provide Parliament with an annual independent
 assessment of the operation of the acts.
 The 1984 Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the police to
 arrest without warrant persons anywhere in the United Kingdom
 whom they reasonably suspect to be involved in'terrorism.
 Such persons may be detained for up to 48 hours without
 judicial review and up to a further 5 days on the authority of
 the Home Secretary. In recent years, the powers of the Act
 have been used when persons were suspected of acts of terrorism
 related'to Northern Ireland, India, and the Middle East.
 In September 1987, the European Commission on Human Rights
 recommended that, in the case of two men detained in 1984
 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act's 7-day maximum
 detention period, the British Government respond to charges it
 had violated the requirement contained in the European
 Convention on Human Rights that a person should be brought
 "promptly to court." The Government quickly announced its
 
 
 1073
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 intention to contest the Commission's findings before the
 European Court of Human Rights.
 Under the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1978,
 the R.U.C., for the purpose of arresting anyone under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, may enter and search without a
 warrant any place where that person is or where the police
 reasonably suspect him of being, and may detain such persons
 for up to 72 hours on their own authority. The Act provides
 similar authority in connection with the arrest of persons
 suspected of having committed, or being about to commit, a
 "scheduled" offense (i.e., one listed on a schedule attached
 to the law). Also under this Act, members of the armed forces
 on duty may arrest without a warrant any person suspected of
 having committed or being about to commit any offense. Such
 persons can be held for up to 4 hours, after which they must
 be transferred to police custody or released. Allegations
 that these limits have been exceeded by the police or the
 armed forces have not been substantiated.
 In Northern Ireland, pursuant to the provisions of the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act,
 arrested persons have the right to a lawyer after 48 hours in
 detention. Some human rights activists charge, however, that
 the -48-hour rule is not always followed.
 An independent review of the 1978 Emergency Provisions Act by
 Sir.George Baker, published in April 1984, concluded that its
 provisions were still necessary. The 1987 act implemented a
 number of Baker's recommendations and provided further rights
 and safeguards for persons detained under emergency
 legislation. On the authority of a senior police officer and
 if specified conditions are met, the exercise of these rights
 may be delayed for a maximum of 48 hours.
 British legal practice provides for the indeterminate
 detention of minors convicted of murder. In Northern Ireland,
 where public attention has focused particularly on this issue,
 there are 41 persons serving such sentences.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. All
 criminal proceedings must be conducted in public, with the
 exception of juvenile court cases and cases involving public
 decency or security. In a trial on charges under the Official
 Secrets Act, the court may be closed at the judge's discretion,
 but the sentence must be passed in public. A national
 independent prosecution service was established in 1985,
 extending to England and Wales a system introduced to Northern
 Ireland in 1972, which provides greater consistency in
 determining which cases are to be prosecuted.
 Juries hear all cases iot covered by antiterrorist legislation;
 these constitute the majority of criminal cases. In Northern
 Ireland, the right to trial by jury was suspended for certain
 terrorist-related offenses because the possibility of the
 intimidation of witnesses and juries raised serious questions
 about the ability of juries to render impartial verdicts. The
 nonjury ("Diplock") courts were established by legislation in
 1973 as a means of dealing with terrorist activity in Northern
 Ireland. The Government remains, committed to the use of jury
 trials whenever possible, and the 1987 Emergency Provisions
 
 
 1074
 -.-UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Act gives-the Lord Chancellor the power to determine-if
 specific "scheduled offense" cases can be heard outside the
 Diplock system.
 Persons convicted by a Diplock court have an automatic right
 of appeal of conviction or sentence to a three-judge Court of
 Appeals, a right not granted to defendants tried before a
 judge and jury. Historically, the rate of conviction in
 Diplock courts of defendants who have pleaded not guilty is
 similar to that of defendants tried before juries. Judges in
 Diplock courts must publish written explanations of their
 decisions.  Nonetheless, there is support for a court system
 in which three judges (instead of one) would preside over
 trials~when a jury trial is deemed impossible.  The Standing
 Advisory Commission on Human Rights has endorsed a change to a
 three-judge system, coupled with a sizable'reductiOn in the
 number of cases heard by Diplock courts.
 The recent reversals on appeal of several convictions in
 earlier terrorism cases have limited the Government's ability
 to obtain convictions based on uncorroborated evidence by
 convicted terrorists ("supergrasses"). Although there were no
 ,"supergrass" trials in 1986 or 1987, the issue remains
 controversial. The evidence of an accomplice has always been
 admissible in British courts, but in nonjury courts the judge
 alone must decide whether the evidence of the "supergrass" is
 credible, bearing in mind the danger of convicting ont
 uncorroboratedevidence. The British Government continues to
 maintain that the use of "supergrass" testimony is important
 intbe legal fight against terrorism. Critics assert such
 testimony places too great an emphasis on assessing the
 credibility of a single witness.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the
 British Government (1975) and the Irish Government (1976),
 permits trial in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland,
 or in Britain of those accused of certain terrorist offenses,
 regardless of where the offense was committed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and custom.
 Warrants are generally required for a police search of private
 premises. However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency
 Provisions> Act of 1978, any member of the armed forces on
 duty or any constable may enter any premises or other place,
 if he or she considers it necessary to do so to preserve peace
 or maintain order. Changes in the 1987 Emergency Provisions
 Act now require a standard of "reasonable grounds of suspicion"
 before a dwelling can be entered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a: Freedom of Speech and Press
 Strongly held tradition, an independent press, and a
 democratic political system combine to seture freedom of
 speech and press. Viewpoints independent and critical of the
 Government are well represented.
 Controversy swirled throughout 1987 over the Government's use
 of the Official Secrets Act to prevent publication of
 "Spycatcher," the memoirs of former U.K. intelligence officer
 
 
 1075
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Peter Wright, and to halt the broadcast of a television
 program giving details of an alleged classified government
 satellite. The issue highlighted the problem faced by many
 democratic governments in determining where freedom of the
 press ends and protection of national security begins. The
 issue was exacerbated by the ready availability in Britain of
 copies of "Spycatcher" published abroad, which were allowed to
 enter the United Kingdom without restriction.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not exercise
 their statutory right to limit the freedom of public assembly.
 However, some critics believe that the 1986 public order law
 gives police too much discretion to restrict public assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 (Loyalist and Republican) involved in terrorism. These
 organizations are specifically listed in the statutes. The
 lists do not include political parties, even those, such as
 the Provisional Sinn Fein, which have close links to terrorist
 paramilitary organizations and openly support violence.
 The summer "marching season" in Northern Ireland presents
 special problems. Because these Unionist marches commemorate
 the traditions of opposing sectarian communities, they are
 controversial and can be a source of public disorder. The RUC
 ,must be notified of all marches and may impose conditions,
 including rerouting, on the organizers. Although the Unionist
 community threatened to defy new laws regulating marches and
 processions, the 1987 marching season saw a noticeable
 reduction in violence, compared to recent years.
 British trade unions have immunities from prosecution for
 normal union activities involving the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike on behalf of their own
 members. These are derived from common law rather than
 statute. The Employment Act of 1980, however, makes unions
 liable under civil law for losses resulting from "sympathy"
 strikes. In the rare instance where the right to strike is
 prohibited, e.g., for police officers, there are other means
 to resolve labor differences.
 The Government does not control, intimidate, harass, or
 persecute unions and other associations, nor does it limit in
 any way their freedom to maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies. However, in 1984 the Government
 prohibited continued trade union membership for public
 employees aVIis highly sensitive communications headquarters
 in Cheltenham on grounds of national security. The ban was
 first overturned and then upheld in the courts. Complaints
 concerning the Government's ban were rejected in January 1987
 by the European Commission on Human Rights which found that
 the ban could be justified on national security grounds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion to all residents. While both England and Scotland
 have established churches, the State makes no direct financial
 contribution to them, and their existence does not limit the
 freedom or access to public life of members of other
 
 
 1076
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 churches. The Government does, however, provide funds for
 church schools throughout the country.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of
 public office except in the case of the Sovereign, who must be
 a member of the Church of England.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, U.K. citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the
 country and in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 includes one exception
 tQ this general principle. The Act gives the Home Secretary
 the authority to exclude or prevent from entering mainland
 Britain anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism
 related to Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in
 Great Britain or has been ordinarily resident there for 3
 years. Similar authority is granted to the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland to exclude persons not native to or
 resident in that province. Only one person has been excluded
 under this law since 1984. Nevertheless, these powers have
 been referred to by many, including the National Council for
 Civil Liberties, as a system of internal exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a government formed on the
 basis of a majority of seats in the House of Commons won in
 freely contested elections held at intervals not longer than
 5 years. Participation in the political process is open to
 all persons and parties, of which there are several,
 representing a broad range of political views.
 For paLliamentary and local elections, all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the franchise. Women have full rights of
 participation and are represented at all levels of British
 life.
 Racial minorities comprise about 5 percent of the total
 population. There are several nonwhite members of Parliament,
 and a number of nonwhite Britons have been elected to local
 government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human-Rights
 The Government generally maintains an open attitude toward
 international inquiries into alleged violations of human
 rights in the United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the
 European Commission on Human Rights in investigations of
 complaints and has taken steps to rectify its own laws and
 policies when they were found not to be in conformity with the
 European Convention.
 The United Kingdom is a party to several human rights
 conventions, participates in international and regional human
 rights bodies, and is the host country to international
 
 
 1077
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 or national or ethnic origin. However, statistical studies
 have shown a black unemployment rate that is nearly double
 that of whites, black concentration in manual jobs, and racial
 discrimination in job recruitment. In 1984 a Code of Practice
 on Employment, proposed by the Commission for Racial Equality
 and accepted by the Government, took effect. Although the
 code does not have the force of law, it is used as a standard
 of good practice by industrial tribunals in racial
 discrimination cases and serves as a guideline for firms in
 eliminating all forms of discrimination.
 Equal status and equal opportun'ity for women in professional
 fields is also provided by law. Enforcement mechanisms have
 been established, and progress toward women's equality is
 visible in many areas, including government hiring. Still,
 women have yet to achieve fully equal status. They hold
 three-quarters of Britain's lowest paying jobs, and the
 average female wage-earner takes home only three-quarters the
 pay of her male counterpart (up from 63 percent in 1970).
 Equal Opportunity Commissions were established in Great
 Britain in 1975 and in Northern Ireland in 1976 to assist in
 the enforcement of these laws.
 Historically, in Northern Ireland, the majority Protestant
 community has controlled much of the local economy and been
 more prosperous than the Catholic community. The reasons for
 this are complex and involve a long history of anti-Catholic
 discrimination by Protestants.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in Northern
 Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat religious
 discrimination against Catholics. These include: reform of
 the electoral rolls; prohibition of religious or political
 discrimination by any level of government; establishment of a
 Commissioner for Complaints to deal with grievances against
 local government; appointment of a Central Housing Authority
 to meet the problem of discrimination in housing; prohibition
 of discrimination in employment; and a special effort to
 recruit more Catholics into the civil service and the police.
 In addition, the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights
 was established in 1973 to monitor human rights. Since 1976
 the Fair Employment Agency has served as the focal point of
 the Government's efforts to end job discrimination. In July
 1987, the Government announced a substantial increase in the
 resources available to the Fair Employment Agency, and a
 revised government guide to employment practice was issued in
 September 1987 to prepare employers to comply with new equal
 employment legislation currently under consideration in
 Whitehall. Within the Northern Ireland civil service, the
 proportion of Catholics reflects their proportion in the
 overall population for those under age 35. In upper age
 groups and in the security forces, Protestants still dominate.
 PIRA assassinations and death threats have largely stymied
 government efforts to recruit Catholics into the police force
 and security-related fields. PIRA has carried out a terror
 campaign not only against police-officers but also against
 persons who provide services to the security forces. For
 
 
 1078
 _.NITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 example, bince 1973, 26 prison staff members have been
 murdered while off duty, and in 1987 the PIRA murdered a man
 who had been teaching prisoners.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minors are allowed to do limited part-time work beginning at
 age 14 and are considered adults for purposes of working hours
 and conditions at age 16.  Working conditions and hours for
 minors are strictly regulated to ensure that a job does not
 interfere with school.
 Although Britain has no national minimum wage, about 43
 percent of the work force belongs to labor unions that set
 their wages with employers. Until recently, organized labor
 resisted the setting of a national minimum wage. For workers
 employed in hotel, restaurant, and services sectors where
 union representation is minimal (about 10 percent of all
 workers), wages councils comprising representatives of
 management, labor, and the public set minimum wages and other
 conditions of employment. The Government has abolished
 minimum wages set by wages councils for persons under age 21.
 Basic rights for all workers, including white-collar
 professionals, are-covered by employment protection
 legislation. Turn-of-the-century legislation limiting working
 hours for women employed in most manufacturing occupations was
 repealed in July 1986.
 The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland is substantially
 higher than that in the United Kingdom as a whole and
 continues to be on average twice as high for the minority
 Catholic population as for Protestants. The number of
 manufacturing jobs in Belfast has dropped by about 50 percent
 in the last 10 years. With few job openings in the private
 sector, it has been difficult to make progress toward ensuring
 that the work force mirrors the religious composition of the
 community. The Government is trying to attract more
 investment to the province and is subsidizing the economy
 through public sector spending. Northern Ireland's shrinking
 economy makes this a necessary part of ending discrimination.
 The new International Fund, organized in support of the
 Anglo-Irish Agreement, is expected to inject a certain amount
 of capital into areas affected by violence and encourage job
 creation.
 Under the terms of the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, the
 Health and Safety Executive enforces strict occupational
 standards of health, safety, and working environment
 conditions. The Health and Safety Commission, consisting of
 management, labor, and public members, supervises the Health
 and Safety Executive and can develop new codes and regulations
 subject to government approval.
