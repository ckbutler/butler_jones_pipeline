 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a functioning democracy whose governing
 authorities are chosen by popular vote. Democratic government
 has a 100-year tradition in Costa Rica. The Constitution
 provides for a government of separate executive, legislative,
 and judicial branches. Free and fair elections for president
 and 57 deputies to the Legislative Assembly are held every
 years. Oscar Arias was elected President in February 1986;
 approximately 80 percent of all eligible voters participated.
 Under the Constitution, the president is barred for life from
 reelection. Members of the Legislative Assembly may be
 reelected but only after at least one term out of office.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's standing army.
 The country's small security forces are subject to strict
 civilian control. Police and national security functions are
 shared by the Civil Guard of the Ministry of Public Security
 and the Rural Guard of the Ministry of Government. The
 Judicial Police, charged with investigating crimes, report
 directly to the Supreme Court. These public security
 organizations observe the procedural safeguards established by
 the law and Constitution.
 Costa Rica has a mixed economy with significant agricultural
 and light industrial sectors. The right to hold private
 property is provided for by the Constitution, and private
 enterprise accounts for 70 percent of the gross-national
 product. The modest economic growth of recent years continued
 during 1988, although underemployment and inflation remained
 worrisome problems.
 The Arias administration continued to demonstrate a strong
 commitment to the long-standing Costa Rican tradition of
 respect for human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not practice, abet, or condone political
 killing, and none was reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of politically
 motivated abductions or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits. cruel or degrading treatment and
 holds invalid any statement obtained through violence. These
 prohibitions are respected in practice. Prisoners generally
 receive humane treatment in Costa Rica. The press-
 occasionally reported alleged incidents of police mistreatment
 of prisoners. After conducting an investigation into these
 charges, authorities dismissed four officers for abuse of
 authority. A procedure has been established to discipline
 police found guilty of similar infractions in the future.
 There appear to.have been no trials or convictions in such
 cases.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Warrants are required for arrests, and the Constitution
 requires that an arraignment take place within 24 hours of
 arrest. Persons detained are entitled to a judicial
 determination of the legality of the detention. However,
 there are occasional press reports of prisoners who did not
 receive prompt judicial resolution of their cases, and who
 remained in detention for long periods before being brought to
 trial. Preventive detention is not practiced.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment. The judiciary is
 generally effective in ensuring that legal and constitutional
 safeguards are observed.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is widely recognized as independent and fair.
 Accused persons may select their own attorneys; access to
 counsel is guaranteed and honored in practice. The State
 provides legal counsel for those who cannot afford to engage
 an attorney. The right to bail is provided for in law and
 observed in practice; however, bail is sometimes denied to
 repeat offenders and is usually denied to foreigners on the
 assumption that they will leave the country before coming to
 trial. Pretrial detention for major offenses, such as
 narcotics trafficking, can last for a period of months.
 Prisoners may be routinely held incommunicado after arrest for
 48 hours and for up to 10 days with the authorization of
 judicial authorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances during 1988 of extralegal
 invasions of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of,
 the Government. Warrants are required to search private homes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of speech
 and press. These freedoms are fully respected in practice.
 Six private newspapers (including two Communist weeklies),
 four private television stations, and several radio stations
 pursue independent editorial policies. The media freely
 criticize the Government, and there is no evidence of
 self-censorship or intimidation.
 Foreign journalists challenged a law requiring accreditation
 by the government-sponsored Costa Rican National Journalists
 Association. The Organization of American States'
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared in 1985 that the
 law is incompatible with the freedom of information provisions
 of the Inter-American Human Rights Convention. As a
 consequence, the Costa Rican "National Reconciliation
 Commission," established pursuant to the 1987 Esquipulas II
 regional peace agreement, concluded in July 1988 that Costa
 Rica was obliged under the Inter-American Human Rights
 Convention to modify existing press legislation.
 Subsequently, the Minister of Information recommended formally
 that the Government remedy this perceived restriction of
 
 
 513
 COSTA RICA
 freedom of the press, and the Minister of Justice formed a
 commission to consider the issue. However, in October 1988
 President Arias came out in favor of the journalists'
 licensing law in a speech to the Costa Rican National
 Journalists Association.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional provisions of freedom of assembly-and
 association are fully respected in practice. Permits a-re not
 required for public meetings. Authorization is needed only
 for parades or similar large-scale gatherings.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. While Roman Catholicism is the official
 state religion,. Costa Ricans-affiliated with a wide range of
 religious groups participate without prejudice in the social
 and political life of the nation. There is no legal bar to a
 non-Catholic being elected President of Costa Rica. The
 Constitution stipulates that the president must be a layman.
 There are no restrictions on religious activity, and foreign
 missionaries and clergy of all denominations work and
 proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad, and both citizens and foreigners are free to live
 anywhere within the nationel boundaries. Neither emigration
 nor a citizen's right of return are restricted. Costa Rica
 supports multinational refugee -programs and has accepted many
 refugees from Central and South America, although the
 continuing influx of Nicaraguan refugees has provoked
 government expressions of concern over strains on the economy
 and social fabric. The Constitution specifically prohibits
 the Government from repatriating any foreigner who may be
 subject to political persecution in his own country, and
 political asylum traditionally has been granted to exiled
 dissidents of various political orientations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Rica is a democracy in which citizens are free to choose
 their government through free, open, and competitive
 elections. The integrity of elections is ensured by the
 independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and election results
 are respected. The Legislative Assembly can and does reject
 executive branch initiatives. Citizens can and do petition
 their elected representatives for legislative redress and
 assistance with government bureaucracies. Women participate
 freely in Costa Rican elections and hold several seats in the
 Legislative Assembly. The nation's second Vice-President is a
 woman.
 The ruling National Liberation Party (PLN) and the opposition
 Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) control 29 and 25 seats
 respectively in the Legislative Assembly. Two rival Communist
 
 
 514
 COSTA RICA
 parties, which freely participate in the political process,
 each hold one seat.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of
 international and private human rights organizations. The
 Inter-American Institute of Human Rights maintains its
 headquarters in San Jose. The Government has invited the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit the country
 whenever it wishes.
 During its January 1988 visit to Costa Rica, the International
 Verification Commission (CIVS) assigned to monitor compliance
 with the Esquipulas II agreement heard testimony from the two
 local Communist parties alleging that the electoral system is
 weighted against them and that there have been instances of
 arbitrary arrests, torture, and disappearances. In its final
 report, the CIVS rejected these accusations as unfounded.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 25,000 Indians, most of
 whom live in traditional communities on 19 reserves which,
 because of their remote location, often lack access to
 schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The
 Government is attempting to improve the quality of basic
 services in the Indian communities. Indians participate in
 the management of their own affairs through the National
 Indian Commission. Nevertheless, some Indian leaders urge the
 Government to devote more resources to improving the welfare
 of the indigenous population.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is
 legally unrestricted. Although women and men generally are
 paid equally for equal work, women generally occupy
 lower-paying jobs. Women are represented in all professions,
 in the ranks of- organized labor, in the private business
 sector, and in the Government. Nonetheless, there have been
 frequent complaints from feminist leaders and others of
 social, occupational, and other forms of bias against women.
 A law designed to supplement existing antisex discrimination
 legislation was introduced in the Legislative Assembly in
 August 1988.
 Costa Rica's population of 30,000 blacks, who reside largely
 on the Caribbean coast, enjoys full rights of citizenship as
 well as other rights and protections, including laws against
 all forms of racial discrimination. However, prejudice toward
 blacks and Indians still exists in some elements of the
 population.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of organized labor to associate, as defined by the
 International Labor Organization, is fully honored. Unions
 are independent of government control and are free to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies such as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 
 
 515
 COSTA RICA
 There is an active Solidarismo movement in the country. The
 AFL-CIO, the ICFTU and other trade union organizations contend
 that solidarismo is an employer inspired and dominated
 alternative to independent trade unions. Leaders of the
 Solidarismo movement claim that it is a legitimate form of
 employee organization, and that Solidarismo organizations and
 their officials are prohibited by law from engaging in-
 antitrade union activities.
 When labor disputes arise within the San Jose metropolitan
 area, the presiding judge of the Labor Tribunal attempts to
 find a settlement that is satisfactory to both labor and
 management. Labor inspectors handle disputes that occur
 outside the capital. If conciliation fails, the case is
 referred to a labor court which must provide legal sanction
 for a planned strike or lockout. Unions have complained that
 this process is complicated, time-consuming, and often
 fruitless. Public sector strikes are illegal.
 Strikes and labor unrest were at low levels in 1988, although
 in June agricultural workers and farmers blocked several
 highways to protest their precarious financial situation and
 specifically to demand government subsidies and easier
 credit. The protesters dispersed peacefully, after several
 days of demonstrating, following a personal appeal by First
 Lady Margarita Penon de Arias. The Government has engaged in
 protracted negotiations with the farmers' union to resolve
 these problems.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Procedures for collective bargaining and arbitration of labor
 disputes are prescribed in law and followed in practice.
 Union organization is not discouraged or impeded in particular
 areas, such as export processing zones. The country's labor
 code states that when one-third of the workers in an operation
 are union members, the employer must conclude a collective
 agreement, if requested. The code also permits employees to
 set up permanent grievance committees to handle both
 individual and collective disputes.
 In spite of guarantees in the labor code, many labor leaders
 claim that the statute--which dates from 1943--is outdated and
 unjust. They cite in particular a clause which permits
 employers to fire workers for *any other grave fault" not
 specified elsewhere in the code as-a mechanism used by
 management to fire would-be labor organizers. A new draft
 labor code, initiated by the Government, is currently being
 studied by unions and other interested groups.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits, and there are no known instances
 of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution provides for special employment protection
 for women and minors and establishes the minimum working age
 at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers
 under 15. The government child welfare agency, in cooperation
 with the Labor Ministry, is responsible for the enforcement of
 these provisions.
 
 
 516
 COSTA RICA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution defines the normal hoursof the workday,
 remuneration of overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation
 rights. It specifies compensation for discharge without due
 cause and the right to a minimum wage.
 A National Wage Board, composed of three members each from
 government, management, and labor, sets minimum wages and
 salaries for all sectors. While violations sometimes occur,
 these regulations are generally respected. The minimum wage
 ranges from $91 to $300 per month, depending on occupational
 field. Workers at the low end of this wage scale often find
 it difficult to maintain a minimum'standard of living.
 Normal work hours are set at 8 hours for daytime and 6 hours
 for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and 36 hours
 respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not
 considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may not
 exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime
 premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work performed in
 excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not
 paid overtime if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This
 law requires that industrial, agricultural, and commercial
 firms with 10 or more workers must establish a joint safety
 committee. The law allows the Government to inspect
 workplaces and to fine employers for violations. However, the
 Government's ability to ensure that minimum conditions of
 safety and sanitation are maintained is limited-by too few
 labor inspectors, especially outside of San Jose.
