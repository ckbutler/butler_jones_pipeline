 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations, is a small, multiracial developing
 nation with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election
 in a multiparty political system. The leader of the party
 obtaining a plurality of seats in Parliament is elected as
 Executive President. Under the 1980 Constitution,
 parliamentary, regional, and municipal elections are held at
 least every 5 years. The next national elections were to be
 held before May 1991; however, at year's end the government-
 controlled Parliament announced its intention to introduce
 legislation to allow the elections to be postponed as
 necessary to develop a new voters' list based on a house-to-
 house enumeration. The People's National Congress (PNC),
 currently led by Hugh Desmond Hoyte, has dominated political
 life since the 1964 elections. In each subsequent election,
 opposition leaders have charged the PNC with electoral fraud.
 In 1990 all political parties agreed to a package of electoral
 reforms and, as of year's end, all parties were expected to
 contest the coming national elections.
 Guyanese social and political life are influenced by the
 polarization of the two main ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese
 and Indo-Guyanese. Urban Afro-Guyanese dominate the ruling
 PNC, the Guyana Police Force (GPF), the Guyana Defense Force
 (GDF), and other security forces; Indo-Guyanese predominate in
 the agricultural and business sectors and the chief opposition
 political party, the People's Progressive Party (PPP). The
 GPF has primary responsibility for maintaining law and order
 throughout Guyana. The police and security forces are
 directly responsible to the civilian Government.
 As part of its economic recovery program approved by the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, the
 Government made major efforts to encourage private investment
 in state-owned corporations. Discussions during 1990 were
 focused on the Government's divestment program which included
 its sugar and bauxite industries, Guayana's two most important
 export earners. The third principal export industry, rice, is
 already primarily privately operated. The Government also
 engaged in talks to sell the state-run telephone, electricity,
 and airline corporations. The recovery program included
 currency devaluations and budget cutbacks. Despite these
 efforts, the economy continued to be plagued by external debt,
 sluggish growth, and a deteriorating infrastructure.
 Devaluations pushed food and transportation costs almost
 beyond the reach of many Guyanese who work at a minimum wage
 of less than $0.50 a day.
 Human rights concerns in Guyana continued to center on police
 abuse of detainees and prisoners and prevalent charges of past
 election fraud. Political attention is now focussed on
 ensuring that the next elections will be free and fair. In
 1990 the Government made concessions on such issues as
 international election observers, a preliminary counting of
 ballots at the polling place, and a complete revision of the
 voters' list. Some opposition groups, however, remain
 skeptical about the implementation of these reforms. The 1988
 split between the government-linked unions and the more
 independent unions remained unresolved, undermining labor's
 independence and strength.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No politically motivated or governmentally-sanctioned
 extrajudicial killings are known to have occurred. Summary
 executions do not take place. However, there were at least
 eight deaths of persons in official custody, reportedly due to
 beatings administered by the police. In early 1990 a civil
 suit against three policemen, the Attorney General of Guyana,
 and the Commissioner of Police for the 1996 death of a
 prisoner while in custody was resolved in favor of the
 prisoner's widow. However, the guilty officers were not
 disciplined or discharged. In another case, the
 Superintendent of Prisons and five prison officers were
 acquitted of charges- of manslaughter in the beating death of
 an Amerindian prisoner. The case was dismissed when the judge
 accepted the argument that no witness could- swear that he saw
 the actual blow to the head that caused the death, even though
 there were witnesses to the beating.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivate& disappearances,
 clandestine- detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torttire and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While torture is prohibited by the Constitution, the Guyana
 Human Rights Association (GHRA) noted an increase in police
 brutality in 1990. GHRA believes that much of this brutality
 arose from the practice of private persons paying police
 officers to settle private matters extrajudicially. In other
 instances, brutality resulted from the desire to extract
 confessions. There were increasing reports during the year
 that some policemen resorted to criminal activ-ity, including
 extortion, intimidation, and assault. The Police Commissioner
 and the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), established in 1989
 and administered by a retired Appellate Court Justice,
 publicly condemned such abuses, and the PCA completed
 investigations of at least 68 of some 256 cases of police
 misconduct brought to its attention. In December, based on a
 PCA investigation, five police officers were charged with
 manslaughter in the October death of a suspect in custody.
 The GHRA, however, continues to charge that the PCA is
 ineffective and biased in favor of the police.
 The treason trial of three PPP members arrested in 1989
 recommenced in October with the defense charging that
 confessions were acquired through coercion. On October 23 the
 judge released all three defendants after he disallowed the
 confessions on which the prosecution's case was based.
 However, the judge apparently precluded any investigation of
 police brutality or misconduct by stating in his ruling that
 there was no evidence of violence or threat by police
 interrogators to obtain the confessions.
 Prison conditions continued to deteriorate in 1990. The
 country's largest prison, built for 300, was housing over 900
 prisoners by year's end. Disease and lack of adequate
 nutrition were prevalent throughout the penal system.

 GUYANA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution mandates that no person may be deprived of
 personal liberty except as authorized by law and also provides
 for judicial determination of the legality of detention.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official,
 only the presumption of guilt by the police officer. If a
 person is arrested and held for more than 24 hours, the law
 requires that he be brought before a court of law to be
 charged. In cases involving political protest marchers who
 were arrested after marching in defiance of the Government's
 refusal to issue permits, the objective apparently was to
 harass them; in every case the marchers were released within
 24 hours.
 The Parliament passed a resolution calling for the repeal of
 the National Security Act; however, no legislation was ever
 introduced to accomplish this, and the Act remains intact. It
 is generally acknowledged that provisions of the Act were not
 utilized in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under Guyana's British common law system, the Constitution
 provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is
 respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system.
 Defendants are granted fair public trials, and appeal may be
 made to higher courts.
 There are no political prisoners or special courts for
 political security cases.
 Some opposition figures have expressed concern over court
 rulings in certain cases involving government interests, such
 as in libel suits brought by government officials. Opposition
 lawyers complain that the judiciary is prone to grant lengthy
 postponements in trials affecting the Government or law
 enforcement officials; however, postponements are routinely
 granted to both the defense and the prosecution. Delays in
 judicial proceedings are most often caused by shortages of
 trained court administrative personnel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the right to privacy,
 although some opposition politicians have alleged incidents of
 government surveillance, particularly at meetings and
 rallies. The laws requiring judicially issued warrants for
 searches were generally respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The constitutional provision for freedom of speech is
 respected, and Guyanese freely criticize their Government and
 its policies. Guyana's publicly owned television station
 ceased to operate during 1990, leaving the two private
 stations as the country's only television broadcasters. These
 stations carried a variety of public affairs and news
 programming with a broad range of views and opinions. The
 Government continued to produce a 10-minute daily news show
 
 
 649
 GUYANA
 which provided relatively even-handed reporting of local
 events. The government-owned Guyana Broadcasting Corporation
 (GBC) took a more aggressive progovernment position during
 1990, with live coverage of the ruling PNC's political rallies.
 In past years the Government, through ownership of the
 country's only daily newspaper and radio station, and the
 issuance of import licenses for newsprint and printing
 presses, maintained varying degrees of control over the
 media. This control, however, has been easing since 1987.
 The independent Stabroek News expanded its publication to
 three times a week in 1999, while the financially distressed
 government-owned Guyana Chronicle had reduce the frequency of
 publication due to a lack of newsprint and extended power
 outages. During the year the Chronicle increasingly
 functioned as an instrument of the Government's policies. The
 three cochairmen of the GHRA were attacked personally in the
 Chronicle.
 The Government was increasingly willing to take retaliatory
 action against persons in the political opposition. One
 prominent businessman was stripped of his chairmanship of two
 government-controlled corporations after he spoke publicly in
 favor of electoral reform. Later the same businessman was
 stopped by police and his driver detained on what- appeared to
 be fabricated charges.
 Individual members of the Government have sometimes brought
 libel suits against publishers, which critics claim were aimed.
 at discouraging press criticism of the Government- A lawsuit
 filed in 1588 by individual p0-lice officers against the GHRA
 over its "Brief on Police Violence" was still being heard in
 the courts during 1990.
 The Government's record on academic freedom continued to be
 good.
 b. Freedom-of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Public Order Act requires police permits for mass
 political meetings, but the Police Commissioner, at his
 discretion and without explanation, may refuse permission for
 a public meeting. During 1990 all political parties and the
 Guyana Action for Reform and Democracy (GUARDY held regular
 public meetings and rallies at locations throughout the
 country without incident. However, two marches, organized by
 opposition political parties in favor of electoral reform, for
 which no permits were issued by the Government, were
 interrupted by the police, and the march organizers were
 detained without charges. They were released after a few
 hours of detention. In September a Catholic nun was attacked
 when she participated in a rally in favor of electoral
 reform. Opposition leaders criticized the slowness of the
 Government to investigate the incident and alleged that the
 attack was condoned by elements within the PNC. In contrast,
 an attack on a man the Government claimed to be a PNC activist
 was aggressively pursued by the Government and the media,
 despite some assertions that it actually was a local brawl
 over a private matter.
 The Government imposes no restrictions on private
 associations, which are not required to be registered and
 which may maintain relations with international bodies as they
 wish.
 
 
 GUYANA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and members
 of all faiths are allowed to worship freely. There are no
 restrictions on travel for religious purposes, nor on the
 training of clergy, religious publishing, conversion,
 religious education, or charitable activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is provided for in the
 Constitution. Travel to certain Amerindian areas requires
 government permission, a regulation dating from colonial times
 designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation.
 The GHRA, opposition politicians, and some clergy contend that
 permits are sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC
 politicians, and that the regulations are being used to
 maintain PNC influence among the Amerindians. Guyanese are
 free to travel abroad, emigrate, and to return. Guyana
 neither receives nor generates refugees. There are no forced
 resettlements or displaced persons, and citizenship is not
 denied on political grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guyanese are free to join or support political parties of
 their choice, but electoral practices have, in the past,
 called into question whether-citizens have effective ability
 to change their Government. The ruling PNC has won every
 election since 1964, but the results of every election since
 1986 have been tainted by opposition charges of electoral
 fraud. Despite the failure of their efforts during 1990 to
 form a. united .coalition to challenge the PNC, opposition
 groups were able to keep pressure on the Government to reform
 the electoral process. In October a delegation from the
 Carter Center in the United States, headed by former President
 Jimmy Carter, obtained agreement from all parties on a
 far-reaching package of reforms, including a reconstituted
 Elections Commission, international election observers, a
 preliminary vote count at each polling place, and a new,
 accurate national voter list. The Government also invited the
 Commonwealth to send an observer mission to the 1991
 elections. The acting Chief of Staff of the Army announced
 that the Army would not intervene -in the election process but
 would be on call to maintain public order.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The GHRA, the most active local human rights group, functions
 without government interference. The GHRA is a
 nongovernmental organization formed in 1979 with support from
 trade unions, professional organizations, and churches, which
 issues periodic press releases and publishes an annual report
 on human rights in Guyana. It gathers information from
 members, victims of abuse, trade unionists, clergy, other
 interested parties, official documents, and newspapers. Some
 leaders of GHRA were instrumental in forming GUARD, which put
 pressure on the Government during 1990 to reform the electoral
 process.
 
 
 GUYANA
 The Government usually regards outside criticism of its human
 rights practices as interference in its internal affairs.
 However, in 1990 the Government invited a Commonwealth
 election observer team and a Carter Center mission to monitor
 the upcoming elections. These groups were permitted to meet
 with a broad spectrum of Guyanese. The Government was less
 enthusiastic about a private October 1990 visit by the
 Caribbean Council of Churches (CCC), which it saw as
 interference in the political affairs of Guyana. The
 President and members of the Government did, however, meet
 with the CCC delegation, as well as representatives of the
 International Foundation For Electoral Systems and the
 National Democratic Institute.
 Section 5 Discrimination'Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for fundamental rights to all
 persons in Guyana regardless of race, sex, or religion.
 Guyanese society and political life continue to be influenced
 by ethnic differences between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese.
 Guyana has a small ethnic Amerindian population, composed of
 nine tribal groups, living in scattered reservations
 throughout the country. Their standard of living is lower
 than that of most Guyanese. The GHRA has alleged that
 Amerindians are subjected to government controI of their
 leaders and land titles, as well as limitations on access to
 their reservations by clergy and other outsIders- The GHRA
 charges that expanding mining operations by the private sector
 has prevented the Government from fulfilling its legislatively
 mandated land distribution to the Amerindians.
 In principle, Guyana's Constitution prohibits discrimination
 on the basis of sex and establishes a commitment to ensure
 equal pay for equal work. A 1988 government-sponsored
 constitutional amendment was passed, rendering the equal pay
 provision unenforceabl except in cases where equal pay for
 equal work is guaranteed by specific- statute. In 1990 the
 parliament passed legislation guaranteeing equal rights to,
 women and legislation which protects women's property claims.
 There are no organizations that focus primarily on women's
 rights. Violence against women, including dcmestic violence
 such as wife beating, is considered by many to be a
 significant problem. However, victims of such abuse
 oftentimes are reluctant to report it to the authorities or to
 press charges, and underreporting of incidents of such
 violence makes it impossible to estimate its true extent. The
 Government does not condone such abuse, but, other than
 providing victims with access to the courts for redress, has
 not recommended additional legislation or other remedial
 action.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 which specifically enumerates a person's right "to form or
 belong to trade unions." Approximately 25 percent of Guyana's
 total work force of about 240,000 are formally organized.
 Most union members work in public sector and in
 government-owned corporations, many of which are to be
 privatized.
 
 
 652
 GUYINA
 There is a tradition of close ties between Guyana's trade
 union movement and political parties, particularly the PNC
 which has controlled the Government (and thus public sector
 employment) for 25 years. Many of the 18 unions in the Guyana
 Trades Union Congress (TUC) are formally affiliated with the
 PNC. In theory, unions are free to choose their own
 officials, but political parties, including both the PNC and
 the opposition parties, wield significant influence over the
 leadership of a number of unions. Trade unionists often have
 dual roles as officials in political parties. President Hoyte
 is the honorary president of the Guyana Labor Union, a member
 of the TUC, and opposition leader Cheddi Jagan holds the same
 position in the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers Union
 (GAWU), which represents 14,000 sugar workers. While the PNC
 has taken a more hands-off approach to the unions in recent
 years, its influence is still felt through leaders with strong
 party ties who have held their union positions for many years.
 Six unions belong to the Federation of Independent Trade
 Unions of Guyana (FITUG), which was originally formed when
 these unions walked out of the September 1988 TUC conference
 to protest heavy-handed electioneering tactics by the PNC.
 Leaders of the TUC and FITUG attempted to negotiate a
 reconciliation during 1990, but efforts at formal
 reunification of the two bodies continued to be blocked by
 unionists with ties to political parties involved in the 1991
 elections.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike. Public
 employees providing essential services are, under normal
 circumstances, forbidden to strike, but a procedure exists for
 the review of grievances by a tribunal appointed by the
 Minister of Labor. Labor disputes are frequently settled
 through consultation and dialog without resorting to strikes
 or other industrial action.
 Unions freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean and
 international trade union and.professional groups. All three
 of the trade union internationals have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Public and private sector employees possess and utilize the
 right to organize and to bargain collectively. This right is
 not codified, however, and employers are not legally required
 to recognize the unions. In 1987 the courts overturned, on
 procedural grounds, a PNC-sponsored amendment to the Labor
 Act, which gave centralized bargaining power for public sector
 employees to the TUC. The provision has not been
 reintroduced, but bargaining for public servants remains
 highly centralized in the TUC-affiliated unions.
 The TUC's traditional ties (through individual unions) to the
 PNC-controlled government reduces the unions' ability to
 negotiate effectively on behalf of workers. After continued
 stalemates over contract talks in 1990, President Hoyte
 announced an across-the-board pay increase for workers in the
 public sector and government-owned corporations that was
 significantly below that demanded by the unions. The
 President's initiative was criticized by labor leaders outside
 the TUC as undermining the negotiation process as well as
 effectively precluding the possibility of an acceptable wage
 settlement.
 
 
 653
 GUYANA
 The Chief Labor Officer and her staff at the Ministry of Labor
 provide consultation and enforcement and conciliation
 services. In 1989, 23 collective bargaining agreements were
 concluded and certified by the Minister of Labor. The
 Ministry has a backlog of cases, and a shortage of manpower
 and transportation severely limit the Ministry's ability to
 meet its mandate.
 The Ministry of Labor reports that there were no known cases
 of antiunion discrimination during 1990, but when such cases
 have arisen in the past, they have been effectively resolved
 through the courts and informal negotiation.
 Guyana does not have export processing zones with special
 exceptions to national labor laws. There are no special areas
 or industries where organizing or collective bargaining are
 impeded or discouraged.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Minimum age laws are set out in the Factories Act and the
 Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act.
 Legally, no person under 14 years of age may be employed in
 any industrial undertaking, and no person under 16 may be
 employed at night, except under regulated circumstances. The
 terms "industry" and "factory" as used in the law have
 been interpreted by the Ministry of Labor to encompass nearly
 all workplaces except offices and retail shops-. According to
 the law, children under age 14 may be employed only in
 enterprises in which members of the same family are employed.
 The local economic situation has forced increasing numbers of
 young children into the work force, however, and it is common
 to see children under 14 selling candy, cigarettes, and other
 items along the road throughout the country. While cognizant
 of the situation, the Ministry of Labor lacks sufficient
 inspectors effectively to enforce existing laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hours of employment are set under the Factories Act and vary
 by industry and sector. Work in excess of an 8-hour day and a
 40-hour week receives payment at an overtime rate.
 Occupational health and safety standards are also prescribed
 in the Factories Act. The Occupational Health and Safety
 Division of the Ministry of Labor is charged with conducting
 factory inspections and investigating charges of substandard
 workplaces and conditions. As with its other
 responsibilities, a shortage of resources has prevented the
 Ministry from adequately carrying out this function.
 Official devaluations and the introduction of a free market
 exchange (cambio) system for currency during 1990 without an
 equivalent rise in wages resulted in a dramatic decrease in
 workers' purchasing power. For many workers wages no longer
 cover the costs of commuting to work. Forty percent of
 Guyana's work force works for the minimum wage which, in
 December 1990, was approximately $0.48 per day for public
 sector workers. There is no universal minimum wage for
 private sector workers, whose wages range above and below the
 
 
 654
 GUYANA
 public sector minimum. The deterioration of the living
 standard of Guyanese workers in general is reflected in
 decreased productivity and increased emigration, particularly
 by skilled workers and professionals.
