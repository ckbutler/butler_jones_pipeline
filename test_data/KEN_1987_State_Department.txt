 KENYA
 Kenya, which has had an elected, civilian government since its
 independence in 1963, has been a de facto one-party state
 almost from independence, and a de jure one-party state since
 1982. The President, Daniel T. arap Moi, maintains firm
 control over both the Government and the party, the Kenyan
 African National Union (KANU). The party must approve all
 candidates for political office. In 1986 there was greater
 centralization of power in the KANU leadership. In 1987 the
 Government reaffirmed its commitment to instituting a new
 queuing (nonsecret) system of voting in party preliminary
 nominations. The queuing system, however, has not yet been
 actually implemented. The popularly elected National Assembly
 of 158 members, plus up to 12 members appointed by the
 President, is usually involved in local and regional issues
 and in responding to the executive's initidtives, e.g., in
 approving the controversial constitutional amendment in
 December 1986 which gave the President increased powers over
 the Attorney General and the Auditor General. Within the
 one-party system there has been considerable electoral
 competition for parliamentary seats. Under the Constitution,
 elections for Parliament must be held every 5 years, and
 parliamentary elections, last held in 1983, are expected in
 1988.
 The Kenyan Armed Forces constitute a small, professional
 establishment with a total strength of about 22,000 members.
 Kenya's internal security apparatus includes the Kenyan Special
 Branch and Criminal Investigation Division Police, and is used
 to monitor and control persons whom the State considers
 subversive. Kenya's Preservation of Public Security Act
 provides for detention for an indefinite period without trial
 in national security cases.
 Kenya's market-oriented, modern economy includes a
 well-developed private sector for trade and light
 manufacturing, as well as an agricultural sector that produces
 sufficent food for local consumption and significant exports
 of coffee, tea, and other commodities. In 1987 lower world
 coffee prices contributed, however, to a growing balance of
 payments problem. Economic growth continues, but at a slower
 rate; unemployment continues to be a serious and growing
 problem.
 Kenyans are free to engage in private economic activity, own
 property, belong to trade unions, practice most religions,
 move freely within the country and travel abroad.
 Nevertheless, human rights concerns in Kenya sharply increased
 in 1986-87 amid reports of torture of prisoners, the detention
 of persons without charges, and questions about the fairness
 of trials of alleged subversives. In most of the cases against
 those alleged to have ties with Mwakenya, a clandestine
 dissident organization, prisoners were held incommunicado for
 prolonged periods without legal representation. There have
 been credible reports that in some cases confessions were
 extracted through torture or ill-treatment or the threat of
 such treatment. Some reports indicated that between 200 to
 300 persons were detained temporarily in 1986, mainly on
 suspicion of belonging to Mwakenya. In 1987 the number of
 arrests and convictions for Mwakenya activities declined, and
 there were fewer allegations of mistreatment. The Government
 of Kenya acknowledged that 14 people were held without trial
 under the Public Security Act during 1987, nine of whom had
 been detained in 1986 and two in 1987. Three of these
 detainees were released in December 1987.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 SECTION 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political assassinations in Kenya in 1987.
 There was a death in police custody of a businessman being
 held for investigation for links to Mwakenya. Evidence also
 emerged of a similar death of a carpenter in police custody in
 1986. In both instances, families have asked for
 investigations, alleging that death resulted from abusive
 treatment. Public judicial inquests into these deaths (Peter
 Karanja and Stephen Wanjema) were under way in late 1987, but
 had not reached any conclusions by the end of the year.
 Altogether, 4 persons are known to have died in police custody
 (see below) under ambiguous circumstances.
 b. Disappearance
 Although Kenyan law requires that an arrested person be
 brought before a court or released within "a reasonable period
 of time," Kenyan authorities have held people for prolonged
 periods without formal charges. In some cases, authorities
 have detained persons and have -failed to acknowledge the fact
 when inquiries were made. According to Amnesty International
 and local reports, at least 25 people were held in this
 fashion in 1987 before it was confirmed that they were in
 police custody. Some were later released, and others were
 formally charged. Two were later officially detained under
 the Preservation of Public Security Act. In a case currently
 before the courts, thfewife of a missing Kiambu farmer learned
 that her-husband had been shot by the police only after she
 retained a lawyer and filed for habeas corpus. Police stated
 that they had shot the man, who had been arrested on suspicion
 of robbery, while he was trying to escape. Despite a court
 order that the police produce the body for examination by
 independent experts, 5 months after the case began the police
 had not done so.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Tortu eis officially proscribed under the Constitution.
 Nevertheless, allegations of torture have been made, and in
 some cases evidence of it has been introduced in the Kenyan
 courts. Torture has been cited in the Kenyan press and has
 been noted by human rights organizations and in the
 international media. Several persons detained on suspicion of
 security-related offenses have stated that they were tortured
 by officers of the Special Branch and Criminal Investigation
 Divisior police at their headquarters in Nairobi. Reported
 methods of torture included confinement for lengthy periods in
 a basement cell flooded with about 2 inches of water, severe
 beatings, deprivation of food and sleep, and various forms of
 intimidation.
 In February 1987, a Nairobi lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria,
 submitted notices to sue the Government for illegal detention
 and torture on behalf of four incarcerated persons, one of
 whom had died in custody. The lawyer was himself detained
 shortly thereafter under the Preservation of Public Security
 Act. Kuria along with two other detainees was released
 December 12. His cases against the Government have not yet
 
 
 138
 KENYA
 been heard. Several defendants in Mwakenya trials have
 complained in court that their confessions were the result of
 torture. Presiding magistrates in these cases have not
 inquired into these alleged offenses. In April 1987, President
 Moi announced a clean-up of the police forces. According to
 the Kenyan authorities, 19 policemen have subsequently been
 investigated or charged. At the end of 1987, however, the
 Government had publicly investigated or prosecuted few if any
 of the alleged abuses.
 In nonpolitical cases, abuse of prisoners has also occurred.
 Several allegations of such mistreatment were reported in the
 Kenyan and international press in 1987. Two people, a Ugandan
 teacher from Kisii in western Kenya and a farmer from Kiambu
 (mentioned above), died in police custody, apparently at police
 hands. The police in the first of these cases were acquitted.
 The second case is still being pursued in court by the victim's
 family. In a Bungoma case, a magistrate ordered a defendant
 to be taken to the hospital after seeing injuries allegedly
 inflicted by the police. In two other recent instances,
 defendants have stated in court that they had been mistreated
 by the police. In cases where torture has been alleged, the
 Kenyan courts have ruled that due process required the
 dismissal of illegally obtained confessions. A magistrate in
 a Nairobi case ruled that statements taken from two defendants
 were inadmissible because they had been tortured during
 interrogation. In a well-publicized case in Machakos, 14
 people were acquitted after confessing to murder when a court
 upheld their claims of having been tortured into making
 confessions.
 Prison conditions in Kenya are poor. Detainees and prisoners
 have complained of beatings, poor food, lack of access to
 medical care, and inadequate facilities. Prisoners often are
 required to sleep on cold, cement floors. The Preservation of
 Public Security Act allows detainees to be held in solitary
 confinement, with no outside contact with family or legal
 counsel, although in some cases lawyers and family members
 have been allowed to visit detainees. Correspondence with
 prisoners is monitored and occasionally not delivered.
 Prisoners are allowed one short visit per month by family
 members. Prison or security officials are usually present
 when detainees or prisoners consult with attorneys or family
 members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution provides that any arrested or detained person
 (except those under the Preservation of Public Security Act)
 shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reasonably
 practicable," and that if such person is not brought within 24
 hours of his arrest or from the commencement of his detention,
 the burden of explanation is on the authorities. In practice,
 however, many arrested persons are held for long periods
 without being charged or taken before the courts. In November,
 six students were held for 13 days without charge after their
 arrests on the University of Nairobi campus. Five of these
 were released an bonds of good conduct. After 15 days of
 detention without charge, the sixth student pleaded guilty to
 a charge of providing information to the Libyan Embassy in
 Nairobi. In one instance in 19a7, an American citizen was
 held for questioning for more than 24 hours without charge and
 without access to a lawyer. Another American citizen was
 jailed for 3 months without notification to the U.S. Embassy.
 
 
 139
 KENYA
 Although Embassy officers eventually gained access to him, an
 initial effort to see him was prohibited by prison officials.
 Mwakenya is a Marxist-oriented organization which is illegal.
 under Kenyan law because it is clandestine and advocates the
 overthrow of the Kenyan Government. Those Mwakenya suspects
 who have'been charged have generally been charged with taking
 an illegal bath to the organization or for possession of its
 literature. In its 1987 Report, Amnesty International
 indicated that over 200 persons had been arrested in 1986,
 mainly for suspected ties to Mwakenya. The number of persons
 apprehended in 1987 for possible'Mwakenya connections appears
 to have decreased. In Mwakenya cases, suspects have been
 arrested secretly and held incommunicado for several weeks
 before being charged 3nd taken before a magistrate or being
 officially detained under the Preservation of Public Security
 Act, which allows for indefinite detention without trial or
 charge. In these cases detainees have been permitted neither
 legal counsel nor access to family during the period of
 incarceration prior to trial. During this period of
 incommunicado detention, many Mwakenya suspects have made
 confessions on which they have subsequently been convicted.
 There have been credible reports that some of these confessions
 were extracted through torture and ill-treatment. Some
 observers have also suggested that Mwakenya suspects, faced
 with the options of indefinite detention under the
 Preservation of Public Security Act or a definite term in
 prison based on a confession and conviction; chose the
 latter. At the end of 1987, the Government claimed it was
 holding 11 persons under the Preservation of Public Security
 Act. Nine of the 11 were detained in 1986 and 1987.
 Neither exile nor the threat of exile is used by the Government
 as a means of intimidation or punishment. Self-exile is a
 course of action sometimes chosen by Kenyan dissidents.
 Several Kenyans have moved to foreign countries and announced
 that they will not return to Kenya for fear of persecution by
 the Government. One of the self-exiled individuals stated
 publicly that he was willing to assume the leadership of the
 Mwakenya movement. In some cases, the Government states that
 these exiles are wanted for questioning for possible criminal
 charges in Kenya, although in most cases the exiles have not
 been formally charged with crimes. The Government has. invited
 some of the exiles to return and publicly announced that they
 would be safe in Kenya. In 1987 none of the people who had
 chosen exile abroad accepted the offer to return.
 Kenya has not ratified the international Labor Organization
 (ILO) convention No. 105 on The Universal Abolition of Forced
 Labor. Forced labor is not practiced in Kenya.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Kenyans have a constitutional right to a fair public
 trial, this right has been circumscribed in most cases
 involving alleged Mwakenya membership or involvement. In 1986
 at least 52 people were convicted for involvement with
 Mwakenya, with another 28 such convictions in 1987. In most
 of these cases, defendants were charged with membership in,
 and taking an unlawful oath to, a subversive organization,
 possessing seditious literature, or failing to report the
 existence of such literature. The Mwakenya trials are held in
 a magistrate's court, open to the public, but usually held
 late in the afternoon without prior announcement, so that the
 defendants' family and the press were often unaware of the
 
 
 140
 KENYA
 time of the trial. Most of the defendants have been held
 incommunicado without charges for significant periods before
 the trial. None of the defendants has been represented by
 legal counsel or allowed to present witnesses. In most cases,
 the defendants have not spoken during the trial. In all
 Mwakenya trials, the defendants have pleaded guilty. In most
 cases, the guilty plea was the only evidence presented against
 them in very brief magistrate court trials. In Kenya, appeal
 of the verdict is not allowed when a guilty plea is entered.
 However, appeal of sentence is permitted.
 The Kenyan judiciary usually exhibits considerable
 independence, although the Government has reportedly put
 pressure on judges in sensitive cases. High Court justices
 are appointed and dismissed solely at the pleasure of the
 President and are thus susceptible to executive pressure. In
 one 1987 case involving the death of a robbery suspect in
 police custody, a judge was taken off the case by the Chief
 Justice after he had threatened to hold in contempt a high-
 ranking security official. In October 1987, Kenya's Solicitor
 General was put on compulsory leave by the Attorney General
 without public explanation. The Solicitor General was later
 replaced. In cases involving detention under the Preservation
 of Public Security Act, judicial authority is limited to
 ensuring compliance with procedural provisions. In most other
 cases, the right to a fair public trial is usually observed,
 although long delays and postponements are common.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts, and verdicts may be
 appealed to the Kenyan High Court. Military personnel are
 tried by military courts, and verdicts may be appealed. Judge
 advocates are appointed on a case-by-case basis by the Chief
 Justice. Members of the press regularly attend and report on
 court proceedings, both civilian and military. Kenyans do not
 have a right to representation by legal counsel, except in
 certain capital cases. Most, but not all, persons tried for
 capital crimes are provided counsel free of charge if they
 cannot afford it. The Government's action in detaining
 without trial an attorney who had brought charges of illegal
 detention and torture on behalf of four political detainees
 could have the effect of intimidating vigorous legal
 representation in security cases (see Section l.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search warrants are not required under the Constitution in
 certain specified instances "to promote the public benefit,"
 which include security cases. Security officials sometimes
 conduct searches without court warrants to apprehend suspected
 criminals or seize property believed to be stolen. The homes
 of suspected dissidents have been entered and searched for
 subversive or incriminating documents. Numerous rooms in
 University of Nairobi residence halls were entered without
 warrants during the November disturbances. Security forces
 reportedly employ a variety of surveillance techniques,
 including electronic surveillance and a network of informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, the exercise of such rights is to some extent
 restricted. The range of allowable discussion in the
 
 
 141
 KENYA
 Parliament is broad on local affairs, but no criticism of the
 President is tolerated, and national issues such as foreign
 affairs are rarely discussed. In 1986 one Member of
 Parliament, who had twice voted against the constitutional
 amendment increasing the power of the President over the
 Attorney General and the Auditor General, was ordered out of
 the Parliament building by the Speaker for the third vote
 because he refused to apolpgize for certain comments he had
 made. He and one other Member of Parliament were briefly held
 by the police without charge in January 1987.
 There is no systematic or formal censorship of the press,
 although .the press practices self-censorship. The press
 confines commentary within widely understood but legally
 undefinedlimits. As an example, the press criticizes
 government policies and occasionally reports unflattering news
 about government officials, but never criticizes the President.
 At times the Government intervenes to tell editors how to
 handle sensitive stories. Pressure has been brought on
 journalists and publications considered to have strayed too
 far from the government line. Some jolirnalists have been
 fired by their news organizations, and several imprisoned for
 seditious activities in the past 18 months. The Kenyan press
 has reported a number of the Mwakenya case trials, even though
 these were not announced in-adVAnce. In ope instance, a
 Mwakenya trial was canceled when the court apparently realized
 that members of the preps were present. A Kenyan journalist,
 Paul Amijia, known to'have covered some Mwakenya cases, was
 detained in August 1987 under the Preservation of Public
 Security regulations and held incommunicado. In November two
 Voice of Kenya employees were detained without charge, but
 both were'subsequently released.
 Government criticism of outspoken clergymen and politicians,
 as well as the detention provisions of the Preservation of
 Public Secdrity Act, discourage public exchange of views on
 s~me political topics. In 1987 the Government increasingly
 c itioizid foreign journalists for alleged bias and
 p evarication in their human rights reporting on Kenya. On
 Ndvember 4, Western journalists covering university
 disturbances were beaten by police at the scene of the
 disturbances and briefly-detained, although they had
 identified themselves as members of the foreign press. A
 positive sign has been that the Kenyan p;ess has been willing
 in some cases to deal with such issues as torture and
 allegations of police corruption and brutality.
 Privately owned ndewspapers and journals are published in
 Kenya. Newspapers, magazines, and books from abroad are
 readily available. Books by Kenyan dissidents in self-exiie
 abroad have been reviewed by the local press and are available
 in Kenya., However, in 1986 a Nairobi newspaper published a
 list of 18 publications that are prohibited in Kenya. More
 than 10 foreign journalists representing major Western news
 organizations are based in Kenya.
 Kenya has a 10-12 member film censorship board under the
 supervision of the Ministry of Culture and Social Sciences.
 While the board must approve all films shown in Kenya, a
 variety of uncut foreign films are available. A 10-member
 television censorship board has established guidelines that
 govern what can be'shown on television. The single television
 station and ill radio stations are owned and controlled by the
 Government.
 
 
 142
 KENYA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of freedom of assembly and association provided for
 in the Constitution are limited by the Public Order and Police
 Act, which gives local authorities wide powers to control
 public gatherings, defined as three or more persons. It is
 illegal to convene an unlicensed meeting, and politicians have
 been investigated or arrested for violations of this statute.
 Licenses to hold public meetings are rarely denied. When
 denied, the grounds usually are that the proposed meeting might
 disturb civil order. With the exception of civil servants, who
 are required to join KANU, Kenyans are not officially required
 to join any political organization. Some Kenyans have
 complained of intimidation and harassment during local KANU
 membership drives. Party membership has in fact become a test
 of one's loyalty to the Government. The party and the
 Government both emphasize, however, that party membership is
 strictly voluntary.
 Labor unions enjoy the right to organize freely, but the right
 to strike is severely curtailed. The only trade union
 confederation, the Central Organization of Trade Unions
 (COTU), is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and maintains friendly relations (though not
 affiliation) with the International Confederation.of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU). COTU also sends observers to the
 congress of World Federation of Trade Unions. Individual
 unions in COTU are permitted to belong to international trade
 secretariats.
 Employers are also free to organize and have formed the
 Federation of Kenyan Employers (FKE) which along with COTU
 sends representatives to the annual ILO meeting in Geneva.
 The Government has formally constituted a tripartite committee
 of government, FKE, and COTU representatives which regularly
 meets to discuss a wide range of labor issues. In 1987 a
 Civil Service Association was formed but without the right to
 bargain collectively or to strike. Kenyen law permits an.open
 shop whereby workers are given a choice whether or not to join
 a union and provides for a check-off system for the collection
 of union dues.
 Complex labor legislation renders strikes virtually illegal.
 Strikes are permitted only when the Ministry of Labor has not
 taken action toward resolution within 21 days from the formal
 declaration of a dispute. In August, after almost 1 month of
 an illegal strike by factory workers in Thika, the Government
 intervened to end the strike when other unions joined it.
 Wildcat strikes do occur; city workers stopped work for a day
 in December to protest the Government's failure to pay wages
 overdue since August. Sympathy strikes, however, are illegal.
 Most union disputes are settled by the parties themselves or
 by appealing to the Industrial Relations Court, a dispute-
 resolution body with a well-earned reputation for fairness and
 impartiality. The Industrial Relations Court is also
 responsible for approving all collective bargaining agreements.
 The Court has become the model for several other industrial
 courts in Africa.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of worship is protected in the Constitution and for
 the most part allowed in practice. Foreign missionaries of
 many denominations are permitted to work in Kenya. In November
 seven Americans were deported after'the publication of a
 
 
 143
 KENYA
 memorandum indicating that they, in collusion with the Ku Klux
 Klan, were plotting the overthrow of the Kenyan Government.
 The missionaries and the U.S. Embassy stated that the
 memorandum was a forgery. The missionaries were deported on
 short notice and were not permitted the opportunity to refute
 the allegation. Nevertheless, it does not appear that
 religious intolerance played any role in their deportation.
 New churches must receive the approval of the Kenyan
 Government to be registered in Kenya. The Church of Jesus
 Christ of Latter-Day Saints has tried without success for 6
 years to obtain registration. The Government has not, however,
 interfered with Mormon meetings during this period. In
 November the Government announced without explanation that five
 churches, including the Association of Jehovah's Witnesses in
 East Africa, had been deregistered. Several of the churches
 have appealed the action, and the Jehovah's Witnesses in late
 November received a stay order from the High Court.
 There is no religious requirement for voting or holding
 office. Clergymen in Kenya have spoken out on political as
 well as religious issues from their pulpits. In 1987
 government leaders criticized some members of the clergy for
 making political statements, e.g., criticism of the queuing
 system. One prominent clergyman was transferred by his church
 from Nairobi to a rural area in a controversy over political
 sermons. He resigned rather than accept the transfer. In
 September 1987, the new Chairman of the National Council of
 Churches of Kenya reaffirmed the duty of the clergy to speak
 out about social and political ills. President Moi confirmed
 that churches have a duty to speak out on social ills.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, Kenyans can travel freely both within Kenya and
 abroad. Travel within Kenya is restricted only by provisions
 of the Preservation of Public Security Act, which limits
 movement of persons considered dangerous to the public
 security. These provisions are rarely invoked. Although
 Kenya does not prohibit emigration of its citizens, the Kenyan
 Government impounded the passports of the wife and children of
 a Kenyan dissident in exile in 1987. In contrast to 1986,
 when a Kenyan journalist was stripped of his citizenship,
 there were no instances of citizenship being revoked for
 political reasons in 1987.
 Kenya continues to accept refugees, despite its own high
 population growth rate and severe unemployment. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that in 1987
 Kenya provided refuge to approximately 12,000 refugees, and
 there are perhaps another 5,000 displaced persons not
 officially registered as refugees. In particular, continued
 unrest in Uganda has prompted several thousand Ugandans to
 enter Kenya. Refugees and displaced persons have not been
 forced to return to their country of origin.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Moi and a small group of advisers control all major
 policy decisions in the Government and the party. The Kenyan
 Constitution prohibits formation of any political party other
 than KANU; citizens cannot, therefore, replace the party in
 power through the electoral process. Since 1964 (when Kenya
 
 
 144
 KENYA
 converted to a Presidential system), the party's candidate for
 President has been unopposed. A number of candidates usually
 have competed for party and national assembly elections.
 Local party branches must clear all candidates for political
 office. In the past, there have been few instances when local
 party clearances have been denied. For the 1988 party
 nomination process, the party leadership has adopted a queuing
 system of voting whereby party members are to queue physically
 for the candidates of their choice on election day, thus
 eliminating the-secrecy of the ballot for the nomination.
 Under the new party rules, no more than 3 KANU-selected
 candidates will be permitted to run in each constituency in
 the general election. Any person who receives 70 percent of
 the vote in the party election will automatically run unopposed
 in the general election, which is by secret ballot. Party
 leaders have stated that the new procedures will ensure that
 candidates in the general election represent more than narrow
 ethnic coalitions. Concern has been expressed that the queuing
 method is a means for the party leadership to tighten control
 over party and general elections and that the 70 percent rule
 would disenfranchise voters who do not join KANU. Parliament
 has not debated the queuing system, and the President has
 warned Parliament against discussion of it.
 In Kenya's postindependence history, neither the President nor
 the Vice President has faced an opposing candidate. Members
 of all ethnic groups are permitted to run for office.
 President Moi has broadened ethnic representation at the
 Minister and Assistant Minister level. Persons from 12
 different ethnic groups hold Cabinet portfolios. Seventeen
 ethnic groups, including one Caucasian, are represented at the
 Assistant Minister level. Three women hold seats in the
 National Assembly, and more than 20 women were elected to
 municipal offices in the 1983 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to criticism regarding alleged
 human rights violations and discourages Kenyans from providing
 outside human rights groups with information. President Moi
 has publicly attacked Amnesty International and other groups
 for meddling in Kenya's internal affairs. Except in public
 statements which attacked Amnesty International's veracity and
 motives, the Government has not replied to the extensive
 Amnesty International survey of human rights in Kenya,
 published in July 1987, which appealed to the Government to
 abandon the use of detention without charge, to institute
 safeguards against torture, and to ensure full due process for
 all those tried.
 There are several Kenyan organizations which address issues
 related to human rights, such as the Law Society of Kenya, but
 none which focuses exclusively on human rights concerns.
 Kenya has not ratified the Organization of African Unity's
 Human and Peoples' Rights Charter adopted at that
 Organization's 1981 summit in Nairobi.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is a diverse country that does not practice legal
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Women remain underrepresented in educational
 
 
 145
 KENYA
 institutions, government, and business, despite recent gains
 and the emergence of influential women in government and the
 professions. Government policy is less of a factor affecting
 women, however, than the traditiohal culture that has long
 prescribed limited roles for them. Women are a crucial factor
 in Kenyan labor and provide approximately three-quarters of
 agricultural labor. Women are likely to retain this role for
 the near future, as there is a continuing migration of men to
 cities in search of higher paying jobs. In the modern sector,
 women frequently earn less than men for comparable work. The
 public law institute has sponsored a campaign to halt violence
 against women, as well as a women's rights awareness program
 which put up signs on buses announcing "violence against women
 is against the law." There are also women's groups in Kenya
 which attempt to educate and help women attaln their rights.
 Some Kenyan ethnic groups still practice female circumcision,
 although the Government has mounted a campaign against the
 practice and prohibits such operations in government hospitals.
 Kenya's Asian community, numbering about 65,000, accounts for
 a large share of the nation's economic output. The
 Government's policy of Africanization of the economy has
 resulted in some Asian emigration, and non-Africans are
 concerned about the long-term implications of the policy.
 Kenya amended its Citizenship Law in 1984, depriving some
 Asians and Europeans of citizenship. Under the present law,
 people born in Kenya of non-Kenyan parents can no longer claim
 Kenyan citizenship.'
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Kenya's population of approximately 21*million is projected to
 double by the early part of the 21st century. Urbanization
 continues to accelerate rapidly, although approximately 80
 percent of Klnyans continue to live in rural areas--many as
 subsistence facmers. The legal minimum age for employment is
 16, but the law is difficult to enforce, and many children
 work at an earlier age as unskilled laborers or domestic.
 employees both in rural areas (especially in agriculture) and
 in urban areas. Kenya has adequate legislation to provide
 acceptable and safe working conditions. The Government,
 however, is often unable to enforce compliance. The maximum
 legally allowed workweek is 52 hours. All workers are
 entitled to at leasE 1 rest day per week, paid sick leave,
 paid annual leave, and holidays. The Government has enacted
 minimum wage legislation based on occupation, age, and
 location. Under current law, the minimum wage ranges from
 about $16 per month for an unskilled laborer under age 18 in a
 rural area to about $88 per month for a cashier in Nairobi or
 Mombasa. A social security system paying retirement benefits
 exists in nascent form.
