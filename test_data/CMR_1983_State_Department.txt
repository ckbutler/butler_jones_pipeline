 CAMEROON
 Cameroon is a one-party state, with power concentrated in the
 Presidency; the electorate plays little role in the selection of
 its officials. Although the Constitution of 1972, which united
 former East (francophone) and West (anglophone) Cameroon, provides
 for a democratic, multiparty state, in fact, Cameroon has only one
 party, the Cameroon National Union. Religious, press, and speech
 liberties are circumscribed by the Constitution to varying degrees.
 Tensions between the francophone and anglophone elements of the
 population still exist and occasionally flare up.
 The year 1983 saw the release from prison of several Jehovah's
 Witnesses held without trial since 1978. Some independent news-
 papers began publishing in 1983, and the news media began
 commenting somewhat more openly on internal politics. However,
 there also were reversals. Several of the new newspapers were
 banned for failure to comply with prepublication laws. Two
 journalists were jailed briefly for articles carried in their
 papers concerning the power struggle which erupted between the
 current and former Presidents. At least one newspaper has since
 reappeared, after complying with prepublication laws.
 In November, at the behest of President Biya, the National Assembly
 revised Cameroon's election law to allow for multiple candidates
 in Presidential elections and amended the Constitution to permit
 the calling of special Presidential elections by a Prime Minister
 who accedes to the Presidency. These elections have been set
 for January 14, 1984.
 The heightened tensions between the current and former Presidents
 gave rise to some increased security measures, including tapping
 of telephones and monitoring of correspondence. Former President
 Ahidjo is currently in self-imposed exile in France. Government
 officials say he is free to return whenever he wishes.
 In late August President Biya announced detection of a plot to
 undermine the security of the state and the arrest of two former
 Ahidjo aides, who were to be tried for complicity in the plot.
 Ahidjo's resignation as party president followed shortly
 thereafter.
 President Biya maintained the policy of his predecessor in renewing
 the state of emergency which has been in existence in portions
 of the country since the violent uprising of the opposition Union
 des Populations Camerounaises Party in the late 1950's and early
 1960's, thus authorizing the suspension of basic liberties in the
 event of political turmoil. This authority, however, has not been
 used within the past year.
 The 1983 legislative elections reflected the inability of the
 Cameroonian electorate to participate meaningfully in the selection
 of its officials. Although more than 2,900 individuals submitted
 their names as candidates, party officials determined which 120
 candidates would fill the 120 national assembly seats. The
 National Assembly subsequently adopted a Presidentially requested
 constitutional amendment increasing its membership to 150 to
 reflect the country's increased population; elections for the
 additional 30 seats will be held in January 1984. Although the
 change in the election law does not create or authorize additional
 parties, it does permit candidates to run for President on the
 slate of nonrecognized parties, or as individuals. The new law
 also requires that those running for President must have resided
 in Cameroon continuously for the five years before the election.
 This effectively eliminates members of the exiled opposition
 from entering the 1984 elections, since they have been living in
 
 
 57
 France for years; it will also prohibit former President Ahidjo,
 who has been absent from Cameroon since the summer of 1983, from
 challenging President Biya in the next elections.
 The new election law does not provide for multiple candidates for
 offices other than that of President. Unless there are other
 changes, therefore, a new National Assembly would still be hand-
 picked by party officials.
 Cameroon's economy continued to thrive in contrast to that of
 many of its neighbors. The World Bank cited Cameroon as only
 one of two African countries which did not see a deteriorating
 economic situation and whose gross national product (GNP)
 increased by more than seven per cent. The new Government
 launched a massive anti-corruption campaign designed to further
 improve the country's economic picture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reports of arbitrary deprivation of life in Cameroon
 during 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance of individuals in
 Cameroon during 1983. Persons arrested for reasons of national
 security can be held indefinitely without trial; their detention
 must be reconfirmed by court order at specific intervals. Amnesty
 International claims that at least four such prisoners have been
 held for many years. No such detention is known to have resulted
 in permanent disappearance or death. Several foreign governments
 and international human rights agencies have made inquiries to the
 Government about the welfare and whereabouts of alleged political
 prisoners with mixed results. In a change in past policy, on
 August 22 the Government announced publicly the arrest of two in-
 dividuals for national security violations. The President stated
 that they will be tried in accordance with due process provisions
 guaranteed in Cameroonian law.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is proscribed implicitly in the Constitution and specific-
 ally in criminal procedures, which make evidence obtained by
 torture inadmissible. In addition, the penal code prohibits
 public servants from using force against any person except under
 specific circumstances, such as resisting arrest. Nevertheless,
 there were credible reports during 1983 of harsh treatment,
 including beatings, during police interrogation and imprisonment.
 In 1983, several policemen were relieved of duty and at least
 two others tried and convicted for violation of these laws.
 Amnesty International has reported allegations of harsh prison
 conditions and ill treatment of detainees, and there are periodic
 reports of unnecessary use of force by the police, ranging in
 severity from bullying to brutality. There have been dismissals
 or prosecution of individuals for such actions.
 Persons under "administrative detention' (i.e., political
 prisoners) are kept in special camps or prisons. There have been
 reports that some of these persons are maintained in totally
 
 
 58
 dark cells for long periods of time. Access to the "administra-
 tive detention" centers by families and friends is reported to
 be severely restricted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Cameroonian law a person arrested on suspicion of committing
 an offense may not be held for more than 48 hours without a court
 order, and this provision is generally observed.   aowever, after
 an investigating magistrate has determined that the case should
 be brought to trial and has issued a warrant to this effect, there
 is no limitation on how long the person charged may be held in
 "preventive detention" pending trial. Accused persons awaiting
 trial constitute the great majority of persons in the prisons at
 Yaounde and Douala. Release on bail is infrequent.
 There are, however, existing legal provisions which can be and
 are used to obtain the release of persons detained illegally.
 Citizens continue to be stopped by local police who harass or
 threaten to detain them unless a bribe is paid. For the most
 part, those detained are released within 24 hours. These actions
 are not initiated or condoned by high government officials and,
 in fact, have come under sharp criticism by the President in his
 anticorruption campaign. During 1983 the Government dismissed
 several individuals involved in this practice.
 Persons may be held in 'administrative detention" under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. This legislation is
 interpreted with restraint. Such detention by regional author-
 ities is initially for one month, renewable twice, and may be
 extended up to an additional six months by the Minister of
 Territorial Administration. During 1983, several Jehovah's
 Witnesses held under administrative detention were released.
 Under the state of emergency which exists in portions of three
 provinces, authorities also may order detention for up to one
 week for persons judged "dangerous to public security," and the
 Minister of Territorial Administration may order detention of
 such persons for up to two months; the order is renewable
 without limitation.
 There are an unknown number of former members of the outlawed
 Union des Populations Camerounaises Party in self-imposed exile.
 The Government has held discussions with some of these individuals
 who desire to return and there have been reliable reports that a
 few have returned. Although there are provisions for public
 trials in the Cameroon criminal procedures code, some are held
 in camera. Defendants in felony cases are provided attorneys if
 they cannot afford to engage their own.
 Generally, persons arrested under administrative detention do not
 disappear, in that their families are told where they are, and
 they are eventually released, although the detention period may
 be a long one. Amnesty International reports that some individ-
 uals arrested during antigovernment protests in 1976 and held
 without trial are still in detention. There are no figures on
 the number of individuals held in administrative detention, but
 the figure is believed to be small. Groups of individuals
 were rounded up in the immediate aftermath and uncertainty of
 the change of power following President Ahidjo's resignation
 in November 1982 amid heightened security concerns. Many, if not
 all, were released within several months. Shortly after taking
 office, President Biya reduced sentences of some convicted
 criminals and released an estimated 1,000.
 
 
 59
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trial by a presiding magistrate is guaranteed by law, and this
 practice is followed with the exception of individuals held
 under administrative detention. Public trials are also guaranteed
 by law, although exceptions for the public good or national
 security are allowed and indeed trials which involve prominent
 persons or which are controversial sometimes do take place in
 camera.
 Magistrates in Cameroon are drawn from a corps of career civil
 servants who must possess law degrees. They are generally free
 from government interference and are considered to conduct fair
 trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with. Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both invasion of the home and tampering with correspondence are
 violations of Cameroonian law. There are reports that police do
 enter h~mese without warrants, however, during periodic searches
 for criminals in the lower income neighborhoods. During the
 heightened tensions which existed in Cameroon following the
 change of government and the arrest of individuals for threaten-
 ing the security of the state, there also were reports of
 government scrutiny of private correspondence, primarily of
 letters and pamphlets entering the country from external dissident
 groups.
 Membership in the country's sole political party, the Cameroon
 National Union, is not mandatory. There have been credible
 reports, however, that zealous local party officials have denied
 routine services, such as a driver's license, to persons who do
 not possess party cards. The Government does not condone such
 actions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of 1972 guarantees the freedoms of expression
 and press. Under Cameroonian law and practice, however, these
 freedoms are restricted. Since coming into office, President
 Biya has promised greater protection for both of these provisions.
 The results to date, however, have been mixed. There is increased
 comment on internal politics in the government-controlled press
 and radio, in the independent press, and among the general
 population. There was a proliferation of independent papers for
 a short period, which were banned when they became too critical
 of the former President and when they failed to comply with
 prepublication laws, which include requirements for a minimal
 bond and a list of reporters. At least one previously banned
 paper has now complied with these laws and is back on the news-
 stands. Two journalists were jailed briefly during this same
 period when their papers published controversial articles on the
 conflict between the current and former Presidents.
 International magazines, which previously would have been
 banned when articles appeared critical to the administration,
 are now permitted on the newsstands. The government-controlled
 Cameroon Tribune also now carries summaries of these foreign
 articles on Cameroon.
 Self-censorship continued to be the rule in 1983 for the
 government-controlled media. One journalist who published a
 
 
 60
 critical article about a prominent political figure was trans-
 ferred for a time to an unimportant post in the Ministry of
 Information and Culture but has been reinstated. This self-
 censorship results in underreporting of internal political and
 other issues. There are fewer restrictions on coverage of
 foreign news.
 Little criticism of the Government is permitted, although there
 have been increased media attacks on government misfeasance and
 malfeasance in recent months in conjunction with the Presidential
 campaign against corruption.
 As the school year opened, university professors expressed the
 belief that there will be more academic freedom and fewer
 government constraints on lecture content and publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed in the
 Constitution but is restricted in practice and in law. The Came-
 roonian penal code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or
 processions without prior government approval, and organizations
 must register with the Government. It is this latter provision
 which has resulted in the arrest of Jehovah's Witnesses, discussed
 below.
 The national labor union, the National Union of Cameroon Workers,
 operates within the framework of the government-controlled single
 national party, and top union leadership is chosen by the Govern-
 ment. Its decisions must be approved by the party, and the
 union cannot have contact with foreign trade union organizations
 without government authorization. Cameroon is a member of the
 International Labor Organization, and union members comprise
 part of the Cameroonian delegation to its meetings. The union
 participates in a government-regulated negotiation process, but
 strikes are illegal. Political activity by the trade union, out-
 side of actions designed to protect economic and other interests,
 is prohibited; by law, any trade association must be approved and
 registered by the state.
 The labor union does not play a major role in Cameroon's political
 life. It has a membership of approximately 200,000 workers in a
 working population of more than three million.
 Striking anglophone students at the University of Yaounde in late
 November and early December were prevented by police from present-
 ing their grievances to the Minister of Education; several were
 clubbed by police. They were later allowed to demonstrate
 peacefully on the university campus. Student strikers in the
 anglophone town of Bamenda were tear-gassed by the police, and,
 following a soccer match in Bamenda, riot squads shot and killed
 one spectator, leading to several days of riots. President
 Biya's appointment of a special commission to look into anglophone
 grievances was reported in the government-owned newspaper. The
 student strikes and Bamenda riots had been subject to a news
 blackout.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is comprised roughly of 20 percent Muslims, 30 percent
 Christians, and the rest animists. Freedom of religion is
 guaranteed in the Constitution and is generally practiced.
 However, there are certain restrictions. Religious groups, such
 as Jehovah's Witnesses, which do not acknowledge the supremacy
 of the state, run afoul of laws requiring registration of all
 
 
 61
 organizations including religious groups. While membership in
 the political party is not mandatory, overly zealous party
 members sometimes demand party cards before performing civic
 duties. This can cause problems for Jehovah's Witnesses because
 they refuse to join the party.
 Missionaries have played a major role in the development of
 Cameroon for centuries and continue to be active in the country
 today. Acts of witchcraft, magic, or divination liable to dis-
 rupt public order or tranquillity or to harm persons or property
 are outlawed with penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment. The
 hierarchy of the Government is drawn from all religious sectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by law.
 In practice, however, police frequently stop travelers for a
 check of identification, tax receipts, or voting cards. These
 checks sometimes develop into incidents of petty harassment.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country and sometimes
 are available only after long bureaucratic delays. Women must
 obtain the permission of their husbands or fathers to leave the
 country. In some cases, these delays may represent attempts by
 the Government to discourage or even prevent departure. The
 Government has also been known to confiscate the passport of an
 individual to prevent him from traveling abroad. Cameroon-
 ians leaving the country must deposit sums sufficient to buy
 a oneway return air ticket for repatriation should they become
 stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on the right of
 voluntary repatriation.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safehaven for hundreds
 of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries as well as
 from countries as far away as South Africa. Chadian refugees
 in Cameroon currently number between 5,000 and 10,000. Refugees
 from South Africa, Zaire, and Angola are also currently residing
 in Cameroon, which has a good reputation for caring for refugees
 within its borders.
 Many of the refugees now in Cameroon entered the country illegally,
 and they are not registered officially as refugees. In some
 instances, they are living and working with members of the same
 tribe in Cameroon; in other instances, entire villages have
 moved across the border from Chad into Cameroon. If they are
 employed, and pay into the official benefit system, they are
 eligible for the same social and government benefits as Cameroon-
 ian citizens. There have been some reports of exploitation of
 Chadian refugees who have entered Cameroon illegally by business
 representatives who pay them less than the going wage. Those
 Chadian refugees legally in Cameroon are sent to the Poli
 refugee camp, where they receive comparable medical care and
 services to those received by Cameroonians. The refugees at
 Poll have established farms; there have been no reports of dis-
 crimination. A number of other refugees, including Namibians,
 are in Cameroon as students.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Cameroon continues to be a one-party state ruled by the President,
 with a minimal role played by the electorate. Following the
 resignation of former President Ahidjo on November 4, 1982, his
 constitutional successor, Prime Minister Paul Biya, took office
 as President. Elections, originally scheduled for 1985, will be
 
 
 62
 held in January 1984, following a Constitutional amendment in
 late 1983 permitting a new President to call early elections.
 While the Constitution implies the legality of other political
 parties, in fact, only one party is permitted -- the Cameroon
 National Union. A recent revision in the election law now
 permits multiple candidates for the Presidency but does not
 specifically authorize new parties. The party elite chooses the
 candidates for local offices as well as for the National Assembly.
 One candidate is chosen for each position by the party and
 submitted to the electorate. There was a minor modification of
 this policy during the 1983 legislative elections when local party
 officials were given a larger role in the selection of nominees.
 The entire decision had rested previously with the members of
 the party's Central Committee in Yaounde.
 Two externally based dissident groups, the Union des Populations
 Camerounaises (francophone) and the Cameroon Action Movement'
 (anglophone), periodically send letters or pamphlets into the
 country. The Government generally succeeds in seizing these
 documents when they arrive.
 Governors, prefects, and Cabinet ministers in Cameroon are
 appointed by the President. The National Assembly plays no
 role in the advising on or consenting to these appointments.
 Local level officials, such as mayors and community councils
 are elected, but the single candidate for each position is
 selected by the party elite.
 Until August 1983, former President Ahidjo retained the party
 presidency. During the power struggle between Ahidjo and his
 successor, the former President resigned and a convention of
 party elite elected Biya president of the party.
 Only those citizens who accept Cameroon's political restric-
 tions, and who limit their actions to the country's one party,
 can play a role in the political process. More than 2,900
 candidates submitted their names to local party officials for the
 120 National Assembly seats open in the May 1983 elections.
 However, the party elite chose a single slate with one candidate
 for each seat and submitted this single slate to the electorate
 for ratification.
 Voter participation is strongly encouraged by the Government,
 although there is no law which requires individuals to vote.
 However, local police periodically stop motorists on election
 day to demand their voting cards, and those not possessing
 such cards on occasion have been detained temporarily or other-
 wise harassed.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International regularly requests information from the
 Government of Cameroon on the status of persons allegedly detained
 without formal charges and without public trial. The Government
 recognizes no obligation to respond to queries about specific
 individuals but has recently stated that each such case is thorough-
 ly investigated. However, Amnesty International states that the
 only responses received from the Government have been denials that
 the individuals in question are detained in Cameroon. In 1980
 Amnesty International requested the Government to permit the
 inspection of prisons by an independent humanitarian organization.
 The request was not acknowledged, and no action is believed to
 
 
 63
 have been taken by the Government; In 1980, former President
 Ahidjo responded indirectly to Amnesty International's criti-
 cism by rejecting the charge that human rights are not respected
 in the country. While there are no organizations within Cameroon
 which observe, report, or contest human rights violations, there
 are individuals who monitor and report on human rights conditions.
 The preamble to the Cameroonian Constitution affirms support for
 the freedoms guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights and the United Nations Charter. In its 1983 report,
 Amnesty International listed its concerns as long-term detention
 without trial of suspected political opponents, poor prison
 conditions, and renewed reports of torture. Freedom House rates
 Cameroon "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cameroon is one of only two African developing countries that
 did not suffer a decline in income in recent years, according
 to a 1983 World Bank report. The country has experienced
 good economic growth in 1983 as a petroleum exporter. Pro-
 duction of raw materials has gone up seven percent. The
 GNP per capita was $792.50 as of 1981. Yet the expansion of
 employment opportunities has not kept pace with either the
 growth in the work force or the intensified national investment
 of 24 percent of the gross domestic product. The rate of infla-
 tion is currently estimated to be about 14 percent.
 The national active labor force participation is 48 percent
 of the population. About 80 percent of the working population
 is engaged in agriculture and related fields. The industrial
 sector employs six percent of the work force in contrast with
 the relatively important tertiary sector, which employs 14
 percent of the working population.
 The labor force in the public sector has increased at an
 annual rate of 6.9 percent, reaching 100,000 in 1981.
 Among persons of ages 15 to 59, the activity rate is 65.2
 percent. Women are underrepresented in this age group,
 having a participation of 50 percent as opposed to 84.6
 percent for men. Unemployment figures are incomplete, but
 in 1980 the Government reported a national unemployment
 rate of six percent, with a substantially higher rate of
 unemployed, 12.2 percent, in the urban areas, than in rural
 areas, where the rate is 4.3 percent.
 Cameroon's population is approximately 9.2 million and is
 experiencing a growth rate of 2.7 percent. The majority of
 the people, 67 percent, live in rural areas; 33 percent are
 urban dwellers. Fifteen percent of the urban population and 40
 percent of the rural population are estimated to live below
 the absolute poverty level. Many of those living below poverty
 level are subsistence farmers, outside the "money economy."
 Most live in remote rural areas where medical and other services
 are minimal or nonexistent. Nomadic tribes, such as the pygmies,
 have resisted efforts to include them in the mainstream of
 Cameroonian life.
 Scanty national income data indicate that 10 percent of the
 population receives about 60 percent of the income. This
 implies that 90 percent of Cameroon's population receives an
 income of less than one-half of the national per capita
 average of $792.50. These differences in part stem from the
 diversities in geographical areas and limited access to in-
 formation, markets, and services.
 
 
 64
 The average Cameroonian has a life expectancy of 47 years.
 Nationally, the infant mortality rate is 133 per 1,000 live
 births. Chronic undernutrition affects 21 percent of the children
 under age five. Among this group another 4.5 percent suffer
 from moderate to mild malnutrition, according to a national
 nutritional survey in 1978. Despite these figures, the ratio of
 calorie supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements is 106.03 percent. Such practices as early weaning,
 as well as intestinal parasites and diarrhea, have contributed
 to infant and child malnutrition, despite the surplus of calories
 available. Malnutrition is more prevalent in rural areas, where
 there is limited or no access to medical care, or adequate trainr
 ing in child care. Other contributing factors to malnutrition
 include illiteracy and an inadequate infrastructure which restricts
 the movement of food from one part of the country to another. Mal-
 nutrition is more often found in Cameroon's least developed
 provinces, particularly the north and the east.
 Some 26 percent of the population is estimated to have access to
 safe drinking water but among this group urban dwellers receive 35
 percent and rural inhabitants 22 percent based on a 1976 estimate.
 The school enrollment rate for children between the ages of six
 and 14 averages 88 percent in urban areas and 46 percent in
 rural areas, with female students underrepresented noticeably in
 the rural secondary schools. At the primary school level there
 are slightly more boys than girls attending school (68.8 percent
 as compared with 61.0 percent between six and 14). Above 15 years
 of age, the number of boys attending school is practically double
 that of girls (29..8 percent as compared with 14.6 percent between
 the ages of 15 and 24).
 There is a primary school enrollment ratio of 103 percent of those
 available to attend. The excess over 100 percent is enrollment of
 students over the expected age of primary students. Although the
 percentage is high, there are marked regional differences in
 access to primary education. School attendance rates are
 one-third the national average in the Muslim north, where only
 22 percent of the children attend school. The national adult
 literacy rate is estimated to be 14 percent.
 Girls are differentially underprivileged as regards access to
 school and subsequent performance. Girls from the southern part
 of the country, although disadvantaged at the level of secondary
 entrance when compared with boys from the same areas, have a
 considerable educational lead over both girls and boys from the
 eastern and northern provinces.
 Statistics are very dated but the trends continue. In 1979, less
 than one-quarter of primary pupils in the northern province were
 girls as contrasted with 44-47 percent in the littoral western
 and center-south provinces, where the high levels of enrollment
 reflect the influence of the Christian religion and education
 since the late 19th century and the corresponding incorporation
 of those areas under colonialism.
 In the largely rural and Muslim-dominated northern province, less
 than one-fourth of all children six to 14 attended primary school
 in 1970. The majority of girls received little or no formal edu-
 cation except in Koranic schools. There is,however, some progress
 in female enrollment. In the francophone provinces, girls
 represented 20 percent of the primary enrollment in 1952, 37 per-
 cent in 1962, and 43 percent in 1970.
 
 
 65
 Sexual inequality increases at the secondary levels both within
 and between regions. One-third of students in nonvocational
 secondary schools in the center-south province in 1975 were girls.
 The figure was 10 percent in the north.
 In 1974, girls made up seven percent of liberal arts students
 from the northern province at the University of Yaounde, 14 per-
 cent from the western province, and 25 percent from the littoral.
 Only two percent in the faculty (graduate school) were from the
 northern and eastern provinces combined, in contrast with six
 percent of male students. Twice as many female students came
 from the center-south as male students from the north.
 Women by law enjoy equal rights with men under the Constitution
 and are politically active in the nation's sole political party
 and labor union. The women's wing of the party has created social
 and education programs aimedat encouraging the economic and social
 productivity of Cameroonian women. Women are represented in the
 modern sector, although not proportionately in the upper levels
 of administration and in the professions.
 There are currently three women in President Biya's Cabinet, one
 minister and two vice ministers. However, there are no women
 governors or prefects, both Presidentially appointed positions.
 Women also hold positions as Ambassador to the United Nations, a
 member of the party's Central Committee, and members of the
 national assembly. As a result of the 1983 legislative elections,
 the percentage of women in the national assembly increased from
 10 to 14 percent.
