 CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy. At year's end, an orderly tran-
 sition was under way to form a new government following the November resignation
 of the minority coalition government led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, which was
 formed after the June 1996 parliamentary elections. In mid-December, Josef
 Tosovsky was named interim Prime Minister, and in January 1998 he was sworn
 in. The bicameral Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term. The country
 has essentially completed the reform of political and economic structures initiated
 after the 1989 "velvet revolution." President Vaclav Havel is an internationally rec-
 ognized advocate of human rights and social justice; he was elected to a second 5-
 year term in January 1998. The judiciary is independent.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police. The civilian internal security
 service, known as the Security and Information Service (BIS), is independent of
 ministry control but reports to Parliament and the Prime Minister's office. Police
 and Big authorities generally observe constitutional and legal protection of individ-
 ual rights in carrying out their responsibilities. However, there were occasional re-
 ports of abuses by some members of the police.
 The Czech Republic has a market-based economy, with over two-thirds of gross
 domestic product (GDP) produced by the private sector. Devastating floods in July
 may reduce growth but could force increased investment and industrial restructur-
 ing. Although external imbalances caused a 10 percent depreciation of the currency
 in May, macroeconomic indicators remain favorable: Low national debt, a low budg-
 et deficit, strong foreign currency reserves, relatively low inflation, and low but ris-
 ing unemployment. Worsening trade and current account deficits were financed by
 strong capital inflows. The work force was employed primarily in industry, retail
 trade, and construction. Leading exports were intermediate manufactured products
 and machinery and transport equipment. GDP per capita reached approximately
 $5,100.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Popular
 prejudice and skinhead violence against Roma remain problems. The discriminatory
 impact of the 1993 citizenship law was mitigated by the constructive implementa-
 tion of a 1996 amendment, although other problems with citizenship persist. There
 is some violence against women. The law on lustration (screening) forbids certain
 pre-1989 Communist officials and secret police collaborators from holding certain
 positions. A law criminalizing defamation of the presidency was abolished.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, and there were no reports of such prac-
 tices.
 The police have undergone significant restructuring, and many new officers have
 joined the force since the 1989 revolution. However, police approval ratings re-
 mained rather low in public opinion polls. Recorded incidents, of crime by police have
 risen in recent years. There have been reports of police shakedowns, physical abuse,
 and malfeasance, often directed at foreigners and Roma.
 In March the Prague 1 district court dismissed a charge of abuse of public office
 against the leader of a 1996 police action at a Prague rck club, during which some
 60 police officers injured several concertgoers with truncheons. The court found him
 to be merely insubordinate and left the police administration to handle the matter
 internally.
 
 
 1055
 The investigation continues into the 1996 case of a policeman charged with abuse
 of public office in connection with a police action in 1995, when the Brno police al-
 legedly used excessive force in breaking up a late-night party outside a theater.
 Some cases of torture from the Communist era have reached the courts through
 the efforts of the Office for the Documentation and Investigation of the Crimes of
 Communism (UDV-see Section .e.). In the first conviction of its kind since 1989
 a Brno court sentenced 85-year-old former secret police agent and prison guard
 Jaroslav Daniel in May to 5 years' imprisonment for his brutality toward prisoners
 in the period from 1948 to 1967. In addition, three former secret police investiga-
 tors, including the father of the current chairman of the Communist party, have
 been charged with abuse of public office in a similar case.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There is overcrowding
 in some prisons. According to the prison authority, as of June the prison system was
 at 112 percent of capacity, and 8 of the country's 33 prisons were 25 percent or more
 over capacity.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 detention, and the Government observes this prohibition in practice. Police may hold
 persons without charge for no more than 24 hours, during which they have the right
 to counsel. The 24-hour rule, enshrined in the Charter of Basic Rights and Free-
 doms was reaffirmed by a Constitutional Court decision early in the year. Pre-
 viously, the police and many courts had interpreted two separate statutes to allow
 the police an aggregate 48 hours to turn a suspect over to a court for arraignment.
 The lack of experienced police investigators, combined with a still-evolving legal
 environment, has contributed to a backlog of court cases. Under the law, pretrial
 detention may last as long as 4 years, with periodic judicial review, for criminal
 charges. If the court does not approve continued detention at any of the legally-man-
 dated review dates, the suspect must be released. In practice few suspects are held
 for longer than 2 years. A possible precedent was set in late 1996 by the Constitu-
 tional Court, which ruled that any period of time in which the accused used delay-
 ing tactics to prevent his case from reaching trial would not count toward the 4-
 year limit. In the case at hand, the accused repeatedly changed lawyers as the 4-
 year limit was approaching. The law does not alow bail for certain serious crimes.
 A suspect may petition the appropriate investigating authorities at any time for re-
 lease from detention. Since 1989 the average length of pretrial detention has in-
 creased from 89 to 212 days in 1997, although that figure has been decreasing
 slightly since 1995. According to the prison service, approximately 35 percent of
 prisoners are currently awaiting trial or sentencing, down from 39 percent in 1996.
 Attorney and family visits are permitted. The authorities follow these guidelines in
 practice.
 The law prohibits exile, and the Government observes this prohibition in practice.
 However, police can and do expel to Slovakia "Slovaks" without proper citizenship
 or residency papers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is impartial and independent in practice. Judges are not fired or trans-
 ferred for political reasons.
 The court system consists of district, regional, and high courts. The Supreme
 Court is the highest court of appeal. In addition, a Constitutional Court rules sepa-
 rately on the constitutionality of legislation. The shortage of qualified judges has
 been largely overcome by the hiring of new personnel.
 The law stipulates that persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open public trials. They have the right to be informed of their legal rights and
 of the charges against them, to consult with counsel, and to present a defense. The
 State provides lawyers for indigent defendants in criminal and some civil cases
 through the bar association. According to the International Helsinki Committee,
 many eligible parties fail to complete the process of applying for such representation
 because it is demanding. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and have the
 right to refuse to testify against themselves. They may appeal any judgments
 against them. The authorities observe these rights in practice.
 In June a student won a court case against the Interior Ministry related to the
 presumption of innocence. The Ministry was investigating the student as a suspect
 in a 1992 attempt on the life of the chairman of the Communist Party by a masked
 assailant. In speaking with the press about the case, the police referred to the stu-
 dent as the perpetrator and not as a suspect. The court ordered the Ministry to
 apologize to the student and pay him damages of about $4,440 (150,000 Kcs). The
 Ministry may appeal to the relevant High Court.
 The 1991 lustration law barred many former Communist Party officials, members
 of the people's militia, and suspected secret police collaborators from holding a wide
 
 
 1056
 
 range of elective and -appointive offices, including appointive positions in state-
 owned companies, academia, and the media for a period of 5 years. In 1995 Par-
 liament extended the law to the year 2000, overriding a veto by President Havel.
 Some other employers also -have required applicants to produce lustration certifi-
 cates proving noncollaboration.
 According to the Interior Ministry, about 15,000 requests for lustration certificates
 were received in 1997, bringing the total since 1991 to 316,000. Some 3.3 percent
 of applicants were denied-because of suspected collaboration. Those who have been
 denied may file a civil suit against the Interior Ministry for a charge similar to slan-
 der.-In the period, from mid-October 1996 to September 1997, 31 such suits were
 filed. Of these 31 suits, about half of those decided to date -were "fully successful,"
 and another quarter have been "partially successful."
 Defenders of the lustration law argue that individuals who systematically de-
 stroyed the lives of others in order to gain advantages for themselves within the
 Communist system should not be entrusted with high state responsibilities. The
 screening process has been criticized, however, because it is based on the records
 of the Communist secret police, records many suspect were incomplete or unreliable.
 The law also has been criticized as a violation of human rights principles prohibit-
 ing discrimination in employment and condemning collective guilt. Many of those
 unjustly accused of collaboration believe that they have suffered diminished career
 prosts and damaged personal reputations. In August the Agenda 2000 report by
 the European Union noted the law's continuing existene with oncern, as did a del-
 egation from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in September.
 A 1993 law defining the pre-1989 Communist regime as criminal and lifting the
 statute of limitations for crimes committed by the Communist Party of Czecho-
 slovakia during its 40-year rule remained in effect, although it has led to few convic-
 tions. The government office responsible for prosecuting cases under this law de-
 scribes its workload as consisting primarily of cases of: Torture (see Section 1.c.);
 border shootings; treason connected with the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czecho-
 slovakia; and state persecution of opponents of the Communist regime. The anti-
 Communist law was upheld by the Constitutional Court in 1993.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a
 court order. The Government complied with this requirement in practice.
 In January the Intelligence Oversight Committee in the Chamber of Deputies sec-
 onded President Havers rejection of charges by the speaker of that body (and leader
 of the- main opposition party) that: There was collusion between the BIS and-the
 Interior Ministry; the secret services were following politicians; and (therefore) there
 were tendencies toward a police state in the Czech Republic. The speaker based his
 charges on alleged internal documents from the intelligence agency, which were
 later found to be forgeries. Neither the President nor the Parliament found evidence
 of serious infractions by BIS agents. Press commentary generally dismissed the
 charges as politically motivated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. Individuals can and do
 speak out on political issues and freely criticize the Government and public figures.
 In September the President signed into law a measure revoking a 36-year-old
 statue on the "defamation" of the President, effective in January 1998. Such action
 had been punishable by prison terms of up to 2 years. In practice, the few persons
 convicted received suspended sentences. President Havel routinely pardoned those
 convicted under the law when they requested it or when his office learned of their
 cases. A separate law on the defamation of the republic remains in effect, and three
 people were convicted of this charge in 1996 (the last year for which statistics are
 available).
 A wide variety of newspapers, magazines, and journals publish without govern-
 ment interference. The capital, Prague, is home to at least a dozen daily newspapers
 with national distribution, as well as a variety of entertainment and special interest
 newspapers and magazines. These publications are owned by a variety of Czech and
 foreign investors.
 The electronic media are independent. There are 4 television stations, 2 public
 and 2 private, and more than 60 private radio stations in addition to Czech Public
 Radio. The leading television channel, Nova, is privately owned, partially by foreign
 investors. In addition, many viewers have access to foreign broadcasts via satellite
 and cable.
 
 
 1057
 A parliamentary commission has broad oversight and power to approve or reject
 candidates for the Television and Radio Council. The Council has limited regulatory
 responsibility for policymaking and answers to the parliamentary media committee.
 The Council can issue and revoke radio and television licenses and monitors pro-
 gramming. By year's end, Parliament had not yet voted on two long-delayed media
 laws: one for print and one for broadcast media. The Communist-era print law does
 not affirm the right of journalists to protect their sources nor ensure the freedom
 of information, and the 1991 broadcast law did not envision private media.
 In April an accredited journalist and advocate of Tibetan independence was de-
 nied access to a press conference given by the Chinese Deputy Premier and hosted
 at the Ministry of Industry and Trade. In response the Czech Helsinki Committee
 called for reform of the 1966 press law to ensure journalists' unhindered access to
 information. There is no evidence of a pattern of such exclusions by authorities.
 The law provides for academic freedom but also forbids activities by established
 political parties at universities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of persons to assemble peacefully. Permits for some public demonstrations are re-
 quired by law but are rarely refused. However, the law forbids political party activ-
 ity at universities (see Section 2.a.). Police generally do not interfere with sponta-
 neous, peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lack a permit. -
 The right of persons to associate freely and to form political parties and move-
 ments is provided for by law, and the Government respected this right in practice.
 Either the Government or the President may submit a proposal to the Supreme
 Court calling for a political party to be disbanded, but there have been no such cases
 since 1989. Organizations, associations, foundations, and political parties are re-
 Tired to register with local officials or at the Interior Ministry but there is no evi-
 aence that this registration is either coercive or arbitrarily withheld. In September
 a draft report to the Cabinet by the Minister without Portfolio called upon the Inte-
 rior Ministry to reexamine the official registrations of organizations propagating ra-
 cial hatred or fascism, but no action has been taken to date. The Communist Party
 is represented in the Parliament and in local government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for religious freedom, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice. The State provides funding to all religions that
 are registered with the Ministry of Culture. There are currently 21 registered
 churches. Under a 1991 law, a church wishing to register for the first time must
 have at least 10,000 adult members, although churches registered prior to this date
 were not required to meet this condition. Unregistered religious groups, such as the
 small Muslim minority, are legally unable to own community property, although
 they are otherwise free to assemble and worship in the manner of their choice. Their
 members can and do issue publications without interference.
 One Christian political party, the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak Peo-
 ple's Party (KDU-CSL), is a member of the governing coalition.
 In July the Government pledged roughly $600,000 to a new Czech-Slovak-Israeli
 foundation to compensate for gold taken from Jewish Slovaks during World War II.
 The amount represents the Czech share of gold that ended up as part of the gold
 reserves of the former Czechoslovakia and was divided along with- other federal
 property on a 2:1 basis during the 1992-93 split of the Czechoslovak federation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel; emigration, and
 repatriation. Czechs who emigrated during the period of Communist rule frequently
 return to visit, or even to settle, and are able to regain Czech citizenship if they
 wish, although to do so they must relinquish their claim to any foreign citizenship.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons. Nonetheless, the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has expressed concern to the Govern-
 ment that its 1993 citizenship law has created a problem of statelessness, especially
 among Roma (see Section 5).
 The Government provides first asylum and cooperates with the UNHCR and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Most migrants used the Czech Re-
 public as a transit route toward the West;however, the country is becoming the
 mal destination for increasing numbers. There are four reception centers for asy-
 lum seekers, six integration centers for recognized refugees, and one humanitarian
 center for Bosnians under temporary protection, which was closed in September.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) work closely with the Interior Ministry to
 ease the refugees' transition into society.
 Asylum seekers filed 1,198 applications for asylum in the first 8 months of 1997
 (latest available statistics), compared with 1,033 for the same periods in 1996. The
 most numerous countries of origin during the most recent 8-month period were Bul-
 garia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Romania. The acceptance rate held steady at 4.7 per-
 
 
 1058
 cent. In recent years, Bulgarians and Romanians made were the most frequent ap-
 plicants for asylum.
 The Government discontinued temporary protection for Bosnian refugees on Sep-
 tember 30. After that date, Bosnians could still remain in the country with long-
 term or permanent residency or with formally recognized refugee status. According
 to the Interior Ministry, as of June, 1,122 Bosnians had obtained either long-term
 or permanent residency. In September there were officially 193 Bosnians under tem-
 porary protection in humanitarian centers and approximately 300 living under other
 arrangements. An unknown number remain in the country illegally.
 Voluntary repatriation of Bosnian refugees began in July 1996. Approximately
 190 Bosnians returned to their homeland on two flights specially chartered by the
 Government in August and September. From February through August the Interior
 Ministry operated an information center for Bosnian refugees seeking information
 on voluntary repatriation. The Government gives each returnee a resettlement sti-
 pend and subsidizes nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) that construct housing
 in Bosnia-Herzegovina for returning refugees.
 The Government continued to devote increased attention to illegal migration into
 the country and took steps with its neighbors to control the movement of people
 across its borders. The Czech Republic has signed readmission agreements with all
 of the country's neighbors and with Hungary, Romania, and Canada. There were no
 reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government by
 democratic means, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Citizens over the age
 of 18 are-eligible to vote by secret.ballot in republic-wide and local elections. Opposi-
 tion groups, including political parties, function openly and participate without hin-
 drance in the political process. Former Czechoslovaks who elected representatives
 to the Czech National Assembly in 1992 and whose current citizenship status is un-
 clear, especially Roma, continue to lack voting rights (see Section 5).
 The minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus resigned in November,
 and a new government was being formed at year's end. In addition to the two right-
 ist and one centrist parties that formed the outgoing coalition, there are also two
 left-of-center opposition parties and one party of the radical right. The Constitution
 mandates elections to Parliament at least every 4 years, base on proportional rep-
 resentation in eight large electoral districts. There is a 5-percent threshold for par-
 ties to enter Parliament. The President, who is elected by Parliament, serves a 5-
 year-term. The President has limited constitutional powers but may use a suspense
 veto to return legislation to-Parliament, which can then override that veto by a sim-
 ple majority.
 There are no restrictions, in-law or in practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics. Nevertheless, relatively few women hold high public office. One of the 16 cabi-
 net ministers-in the pre-November Government and two in the Government named
 in January 1998 were women. The 200-member Parliament includes 29 female dep-
 uties, including 1 deputy speaker. Nine women are senators in the 81-member Sen-
 ate; 1 of the Senate's 4 vice chairmen is a woman.
 No seats are reserved in either house for ethnic minorities. Slovaks, of whom
 there are an estimated 300,000, are almost all "Czechoslovaks" who elected to live
 in the Czech republic after the split. Many serve in high positions in the civil serv-
 ice. For the most part, these Slovaks define their interests in the context of Czech
 politics, not along ethnic lines; there is no Slovak party in the Parliament.
 In contrast, many of the estimated 200,000 to 250,000 Roma have not been fully
 integrated into society (see Section 5). The political culture generally defines Roma
 as outsiders. Roma themselves have not united behind a program or set of ideals
 that would enable them to advance their interests in the democratic structures of
 the country. A few Roma serve in local government structures, and some have been
 appointed to advisory positions in government ministries. There are currently no
 Romani representatives in the Parliament; no seats are reserved for ethnic minori-
 ties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights gups operate without government restriction, and government of-
 ficials are generally cooperative and somewhat responsive to their views. The best-
 known human rights groups are the Czech Helsinki Federation and the Tolerance
 Foundation (really an umbrella organization), but there are many single-issue
 
 
 1059
 that doe   ally important work. The presidency of former dissident and
 rights monitor aclav Havel serves as an important symbol for these groups.
 In each house of Parliament there is a petition committee for human rights and
 nationalities, which includes a subommittee for nationalities. A' government-spon-
 sored Council for Nationalities advises the Cabinet on minority affairs. In this bod,
 Slovaks and Roma have three representatives each; Poles and Germans, two each;
 and Hungarians and Ukrainians, one each. There is also a government commission
 staffed by members of the NGO and journalist communities that monitors intereth-
 nic violence. In September the Government agreed to create a new commission for
 Romani affairs, which is to advise the Government. Observers believe that the com-
 mission offers a significant opportunity to enhance the dialog between the Govern-
 ment and the Romani community.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination. Health
 care, education, retirement, and other social services generally are provided without
 regard to race, sex, religion, disability, or social status. In practice Roma face dis-
 crimination in such areas as education, job opportunity, and housing.
 Women.-The true extent of violence against women is unknown, and public de-
 bate about it is rare, despite the efforts of a handful of women's groups to bring
 the problem to the attention of the public. The press occasionally reported on the
 problem of violence against women and trafficking in prostitutes. Available studies
 indicate that 11 to 19 percent of Czech women report that they have experienced
 sexual violence at the hands of their husbands or partners. According to some legal
 experts, there is an unspoken understanding in the court system that spousal abuse
 should be prosecuted as a crime only if a doctor determines that the victim's condi-
 tion warrants medical treatment for 7 days or more. Since 1989 official police statis-
 tics have recorded 500 to 800 rape cases per year, and approximately 80 percent
 of the cases are solved. A study by the Sexology Institute found that only 3 percent
 of rape victims report the crime. Gender studies experts say that women are
 ashamed to speak about rape and that the police are not equipped to help, either
 by attitude or training. There are state-supported shelters that accept women in
 most major cities and towns. According to NGO's, the situation has improved in re-
 cent years, but there are still not enough spaces to meet the demand.
 Prostitution is legal, although a 1995 amendment to the law on communities pro-
 vides for its regulation by local authorities. Under the Penal Code, trafficking in
 prostitutes is punishable by a prison term of up to 8, years (up to 12 years if the
 victim is under the age of 15). According to the police unit responsible for fighting
 organized crime, the Czech Republic is also a transit country for traffickers in
 women. In February a Czech national who is a known trafficker in women was de-
 tained in Austria. In March police detained a Ukrainian who was trafficking in
 Ukrainian women in a brothel in western Bohemia. A credible NGO that follows
 this problem has concluded that the country is increasingly becoming a destination
 for many prostitutes from farther east.
 Women are equal under the law and in principle receive the same pay for the
 same job. Women were relatively successful in taking advantage of the post-1989
 transformation, due to the absence of social upheaval and low unemployment.
 Women have made deep inroads into the private sector since 1989, and the number
 in agricultural work has fallen by 50 percent over the last decade. Women have
 steadily represented roughly half of the labor force over the same period, although
 they are concentrated in professions in which the median salary is low. According
 to a 1996 survey of employers by the Ministry of Labor, women's median wages
 lagged behind those of men by roughly 25 percent in 1996 (a private survey- pro-
 duced comparable results), although the gap is narrowing. Women enjoy equal prop-
 erty, inheritance, and other rights with men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through programs
 for health care, compulsory education through the age of 15 (through the age of 14
 in special schools) and basic nutrition. Girls and boys enjoy equal access to health
 care and education at all levels.
 Child abuse and trafficking in children continued to receive occasional press at-
 tention in 1997. Since 1990 the number of reported cases of child abuse has roughly
 doubled; this increase appears to be the result of an increased awareness of the
 problem. According to a special envoy of the U.N. Human Rights Commission who
 visited in 1996, there is no evidence of a societal pattern of child abuse. A children's
 crisis center was founded in 1995 and is 70 percent state supported. According to
 its director, around 1 percent of children are neglected, mistreated, or sexually
 abused, but only about one tenth of all cases are registered by the police. In Novem-
 
 
 1060
 ber the police arrested several individuals suspected of using minors to produce por-
 nography.
 Romani children are often relegated to "special schools" for the mentally handi-
 capped and socially maladjusted. Both a government program and various private
 initiatives exist to prepare Romani children for mainstream schools (see Section on
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities below).
 People With Disabilities.-The disabled suffer disproportionately from unemploy-
 ment, and the physically disabled have unequal access to education, especially in
 rural areas. This is less the result of government policy than of a lack of barrier-
 free access to public schools. Most buildings and public transportation are inacces-
 sible to those in, wheelchairs. However, a 1994 Economic Ministry regulation re-
 quires architects to ensure adequate access for the disabled in new building projects,
 and this regulation is applied in practice. Businesses in which 60 percent or more
 of the emproyees are disabled qualify for special tax breaks. Government benefits
 for the disabled are being streamlined. Numerous NGO's are actively working to di-
 minish the disadvantages faced by the disabled. The integration of the disabled into
 society has not been the subject of significant policy or public debate. There is one
 disabled Member of Parliament.
 Religious Minorities.-Religious groups with 10,000 or more adult members may
 register with the Ministry of Culture. Only registered religions are eligible for state
 subsidies. The Jewish community constitutes an exception, since it was recognized
 by the State before 1989. Smaller groups lack a legal mechanism by which-they may
 own community property (see Section 2.c.).
 The Jewish community numbers a few thousand. There were only isolated inci-
 dents of vandalism.against Jewish property. The police confirmed the existence of
 over 20 underground magazines with small circulations propagating fascism, racism,
 and anti-Semitism.
 The Pilsen-north district court sentenced participants in a 1996 international
 gathering of skinheads commemorating the anniversary of Kristallnacht, a series of
 Nazi-inspired mob attacks on German Jews and their property in 1938. About 700
 people assembled in Kozolupy near Pilsen in November 1996 to hear skinhead
 andsplay. Eight persons were charged under a law criminalizing the public expres-
 sion of religous intolerance and obliged to pay fines ranging from roughly $255 to
 $1,275 (8,000 to 40,000 Kcs); a Czech national was also sentenced to community
 work.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-After ethnic Slovaks, the largest minority is
 the Romani population, officially estimated to number approximately 200,000. Roma
 live through~out the ountry but are oncentrated in the industrial towns of northern
 Bohemia, where many eastern Slovak Roma were encouraged to settle in the homes
 of Sudeten Germans transferred to the west more than 40 years ago.
 Roma suffer disproportionately from poverty, unemployment, interethnic violence,
 discrimination, iliteracy, and disease. They are subject to deeply ingrained popular
 prejudie, as is repeatedly affirmed by pubic opinion polls. The State funds tele-
 vision and radio programs for Roma on public stations, as well as supporting
 Romani press publications, and in 1997 there was more and better information
 available on Roma in the mainstream press and other sources. However, efforts by
 foundations and individuals in the education and health fields to improve their liv-
 ing conditions have had only minimal impact. Romani leaders have had limited suc-
 cess thus far in organizing their local communities, which are often disunited and
 where many are reluctant to foster contacts with the majority.
 Interethnic violence is usually perpetrated by skinheads, according to a May re-
 port on security by the Interior Ministry. A March report on racially motivated
 crime in 1996 by the Attorney General's Office found that Roma were the most like-
 ly victims of such crimes, and that the number of incidents continued to rise. This
 may be the result of increased vigilance against such crimes by law enforcement and
 justice personnel since mid-1995. Nonetheless, judges and police officers have been
 reluctant to ascribe a racial motive to anti-Roma violence, even when skinheads are
 involved. For example, in June a judge in Hradec Kralove refused to apply laws re-
 lating to racial motives, ruling that there could be no such motives in Czech-Roma
 conflicts because both belong to the same, Indo-European race. The Justice Ministry
 subsequently lodged a procedural complaint with the Supreme Court related to this
 ruling. Following the complaint, the Supreme Court struck down this interpretation
 of the law in October and returnecthe case for a new ruling.
 There were numerous incidents of violence or intimidation directed against Roma.
 In September a gang of drunken men aged 18 to 24 fired pistols, broke windows,
 and shouted "gypsies to the gas chambers" in front of a house inhabited by Roma
 in Domazlice. During that incident, one 36-year-old Romani woman died of suffo-
 cation during an epileptic seizure apparently brought on by acute fright. The police

 prepared charges against 11 suspects. In February the regional court in Ostrava
 upheld an earlier sentence involving eight youths who had attacked and severely
 beaten three Romani girls in Karvina in 1995. In March the Ceske Budejovice re-
 gional court found four youths guilty of negligence in the death of Tibor Danihel,
 an 18-year-old Rom who drowned after a gang of skinheads forced him into the
 Otava river in Pisek in September 1993. The court found the crime to be racially
 motivated. Two of the youths received sentences of 31 months, a third 22 months,
 and the fourth a 2-year suspended sentence. In connection with this case, a govern-
 ment minister criticized the generally careless work of the state administration in
 investigating and prosecuting racially motivated crime, and a prominent human
 rights activist charged that such delays as seen in the Danihel case contributed to
 other criminals' sense of impunity. In December the Justice Minister fied a com-
 plaint with the Supreme Court questioning whether the defendants were guilty
 merely of negligence in Danihel's death.
 Laws prohibiting racist attacks (normally intended to protect minorities) were
 also invoked against Roma. In March in Louny, five Roma said to be celebrating
 a relative's release fromprison attacked and shouted race-related insults at a group
 of police officers who had come to investigate the disturbance. The local state attor-
 ney charged them with defamation of a nation/race/creed in addition to two other
 charges. In April a police investigator in Breclav filed the same charge against three
 Roma who attacked two skinheads. That charge carries a penalty of up to 3 years
 in prison.
 Verbal attacks against Roma recur frequently in fringe publications. Criminal
 charges were filed against the editors of a magazine belonging to the Association
 for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSC), an extremist, far-
 right political party represented in the Parliament yet shunned by the democratic
 parties, for publishing offensive statements regarding Rema. In one issue of the
 magazine Roma were iened to garbage that must be either recycled or incinerated.
 The investigation is continuing. Some members of the mainstream political culture
 consistently condemned such statements when they were made in a public forum.
 In the larger context, those Rema wishing to integrate face practical difficulties
 in the areas of employment and education. Remani unemployment was estimated
 at 70 percent in a report prepared at the Government's request. According to the
 same report, many unemployed Rema subsist on government support or their earn-
 ings from illegal activities. Some employers refuse to hire Roma and explicitly ask
 local labor ofices to refrain from sending Rmani applicants for advertised posi-
 tions. Most Rema are qualified only for low-paying jobs as manual laborers, since
 very few complete secondary education.
 The integration of Romani children into mainstream schools is frequently impeded
 by language and cultural barriers. Some Remani parents do not send their children
 to school regularly for a variety of reasons, including subtle or overt discrimination;
 the expense of books, supplies, and activities; and because some Romani parents
 doubt the importance of education. According to a 1991 study (the only such study
 available after 1989) less than 20 percent of the sel-identified Romani population
 in the Czech lands had completed elementary school and less than 5 percent had
 completed high school. Such statistics provide only a rough picture of the actual sit-
 uation, however, since a large majority of Rma do not identify themselves as such
 for census-takers.
 A siguificant number of Ro mani children are taken from mainstream schools at
 anearlyaeandsenttostudyat"specialschools"forthesmentallydisabledand
 socially maladjusted. Aorng to unofficial estimates by Ministry of Education em-
 ployees and NGO's, Remani children makeup 60 percent or more of pupils placed
 in these "special schools," although Roma are estimated to comprise only 2 to 3 per-
 cent of the population.
 In 1993 the Government created the framework for a number of year-long pr-
 mgrams (so-called zero grades) to prepare disadvantaged youths for their first year
 nschool. Many districts with high concentrations of Rma participate in the pro-
 gram, which is funded solely by local authorities. Students' participation in the zero
 grades is voluntary, which many observers feel limits the program's effectiveness.
 About half of existing zero grades are organized by special schools for the mentally
 disabled and socially maladjusted; the pupils in these classes frequently proceed di-
 rectly into the special school curriculum and are thus never given the opportunity
 to attend a mainstream school. Nonetheless, there is anecdotal evidence that some
 zero grades are successfully preparing disadvantaged Romani children for main-
 stream schools. A number of private initiatives to prepare Remani children for
 mainstream schools have also emerged in recent years, such as those in Rekycany,
 Ostrava, and elsewhere.

 Roma also face discrimination in housing and other areas of everyday life. In July
 a senator, also the mayor of the Prague 4 district, praised one landlord's efforts to
 move "problem tenants" (widely understood to mean Roma) to an outlying part of
 town. Many journalists and politicians criticized these remarks for appearing to ad-
 vocate a policy of segregation. Some restaurants, pubs, and other venues throughout
 the country routinely refused service to Roma and posted signs prohibiting their
 entry. In some cases, local authorities intervened to have such signs removed.
 In February in the first prominent antidiscrimination case, the Pilsen regional
 court annulled a 1996 decision that found pub owner Ivo Blahout not guilty of dis-
 criminating against Romani patrons, despite videotaped evidence and the incrimi-
 nating testimony of two policemen. The case was returned to a lower court for re-
 trial.
 In December the Kladno district court found the local deputy mayor guilty of in-
 citement to national/racial hatred for closing the municipal swimming pool to
 Romani children in July 1996, fining him about $445 (14,000 Kcs). At the time, a
 hepatitis epidemic was sweeping the town and was particularly prevalent among
 Roma, yet local health officials stated that the measure would not be effective in
 containing the outbreak.
 Czech loma claiming persecution in the Czech Republic and applying for refugee
 status in Canada and Western Europe generated significant discussion. In August
 a private television station broadcast a program on Roma applying for refugee sta-
 ts in Canada, portraying that country as offering asylees' a warm welcome. The
 broadcast spurred hundreds of Roma to sell their possessions to buy airline tickets
 to Canada, and many more attempted to raise the money for airfare. Posters ap-
 peared in Usti Nad Labem urging ema to depart for Canada and offering material
 assistance. A district mayor in the town of Ostrava offered to pay two-thirds of the
 airfare to Canada for Roma living in her jurisdiction if they relinquished the leases
 on their municipal flats. That official was criticized sharply in press commentary
 and by some parliamentarians and rebuked mildly by her party. By October over
 1,200 Roma had applied for refugee status in Canada. Dozens of other Czech
 Romani families appilied for refugee status in the UK, France, and elsewhere in
 Western Europe.
 Faced with this "exodus" of Czech Roma, the Government deliberated the issue
 of Romani integration with a renewed sense of urgency. The Prime Minister met
 with Romani representatives, and an ad hoe group convened by the Office of the
 Government prepared a report on the Romani minority for the Cabinet. In Septem-
 ber the Government approved the creation of a new commission for Romani affairs.
 Government ministries also adopted numerous, related taskings in an effort to fos-
 ter Romani integration, such as expanding the "zero grade" program, training ethnic
 Romani teaching assistants for public schools, attempting to induce employers to
 hire more Roma, and stricter enforcement of consumer protection laws where busi-
 nesses refuse to serve Rma. The President and some politicians urged Roma not
 to leave the country.
 The 1993 Citizenship Law has been criticized by the UNHCR and the Council of
 Europe, although its discriminatory impact was mitigated by the constructive imple-
 mentation of an amendment in April 1996. Under the 1993 law, created at the time
 of the Czech-Slovak split, Czechoslovaks of Slovak nationality ("Slovaks ") were able
 to opt for Czech citizenship until December 1993 (later extended to June 1994)
 under conditions more favorable than those faced by non-Czechoslovaks in the nor-
 mal naturalization process. Nonetheless, "Slovaks" had to present proof of a clean
 criminal record for the previous 5 years and residency in what is now the Czech
 Republic for 2 years. Romani leaders and human rights groups protested that these
 provisions were designed to discriminate against Roma, most of whom were des-
 igated as being of Slovak nationality by a 1969 law. After June 1994, "Slovaks"
 could apply only for naturalization, a more atringnt process.
 The practical result of the law was that an unknown number of "Slovaks" resident
 in the Czech republic at the time of the split-a  at many of them Roma-found
 themselves without Czech citizenship. Some failed to meet the law's requirements;
 others never applied, either out of negligence or ignorance of the consequences.
 Many of these Rema were long-term residents of, or born in, the Czech Republic.
 Without citizenship or residency, these individuals do not have the right to work,
 to health insurance, or to any of the social benefits enjoyed by nearly all citizens
 and residents. "Slovaks" with valid identification may claim Slovak citizenship at
 anytime, although many have no family, property, or other ties in Slovakia.
 Most but not all former Czechoslovaks living in the Czech Republic appear to
 have resolved their current citizenship. The Interior Ministry has never given an
 official estimate of the number of people without citizenship, but approximately
 3,500 applications are currently pending, most of them until proof of release from
 
 
 1063
 
 Slovak citizenship is presented. The Citizenship Project, an NGO sponsored by the
 Czech Helsinki Committee that actively helps former Czechoslovaks through the
 citizenship application process, and which has registered about 3,000 requests for
 assistance from "Slovaks" applying for Czech citizenship, states that many more
 have not applied and that only the Government is in a position to gauge the scope
 of the problem.
 Responding to domestic and international criticism, the Government amended the
 law in 1996, allowing the Interior Ministry to waive the clean criminal record re-
 quirement for individual "Slovaks" resident in what is now the Czech Republic since
 before the 1993 split. By mid-September, 2,077 "Slovaks" had applied for the waiver,
 of these, 2,043 (98.4 percent) were successful and 34 (1.6 percent) were denied; a
 negative decision could be appealed to the Minister of Interior and then to the
 courts. Interior Ministry policy was to deny only those who had committed serious
 crimes. In November the Interior Ministry pledged to grant the waiver to all new
 qualified applicants as well as to previously unsuccessful waiver applicants as well
 as to previously unsuccessful waiver applicants who appeal; however, six individuals
 were who were denied the waiver and subsequently deported are unable to appeal
 the ministry decision unless their sentence of expulsion is overturned by a court.
 In two of those six cases, the Justice Ministry issued a procedural complaint against
 the sentence of expulsion. The Government has taken no steps to publicize its new
 policy.
 Some other practical problems have been addressed. For example, in March the
 Interior Ministry agreed not to require additional criminal registry records (which
 are valid for only 6 months) from prisoners while their citizenship applications are
 pending, although it continued to require them from those in pretrial detention.
 However, other problems persist. The failure of one family member to secure resi-
 dency or citizenship prevents the entire family from receiving certain social sub-
 sidies. "Slovak" applicants who have never set foot in Slovakia, even school-age chil-
 dren, must still obtain an official release from Slovak citizenship. Police who come
 across "Slovaks" without proper citizenship or residency papers can and do expel
 them to Slovakia. A total of 122 Slovak citizens (an indeterminate number of whom
 had long-term ties to the Czech Republic) were expelled and 189 were sentenced to
 "prohibition of stay" in the first half of the year.
 The Citizenship Project sponsored by the Czech Helsinki Committee documented
 over 500 cases of minors in children's homes and foster care arrangements who lack
 Czech citizenship or permanent residency and believes that there are several hun-
 dred more. Typically, the children are ethnic Roma who were formally deemed Slo-
 yak citizens following the Czech-Slovak split. All noncitizen children in foster care
 may claim permanent residency, but this is canceled on their release. Those who
 are released from foster care at age 18 without citizenship or residency lack the
 right to work, register as job seekers at local labor offices, claim social benefits, or
 vote, and are believed more likely to become involved in crime and face deportation.
 Even in children's homes where the directors take an active interest in resolving
 the problem, legal expenses and local bureaucratic intransigence present significant
 barriers. In 1997 the-Interior Ministry cooperated with the Czech Helsinki Commit-
 tee to inform the directors of state institutions about the issue.
 Racism and discrimination in society were the subject of increased attention dur-
 ing the year. The November murder of a Sudanese student in Prague by a skinhead
 was followed by significant antiracism demonstrations around the country and re-
 sulted in considerable public discussion on racism in Czech society. Two suspects
 were taken into custody by year's end. Nonwhite foreigners continued to be at risk
 of physical violence and harassment; police and courts generally responded appro-
 priately. The Prague 4 district court found a local youth guilty of attacking a visit-
 ing Japanese scientist but failed to establish a racial motive; the assailant had al-
 legedly mistaken the victim for a Vietnamese. In June the Brno municipal court
 found one youth guilty of attacking a long-term resident university professor from
 Benin and attributed a racial motive to the attack; the youth had verbally assaulted
 the victim in a tram and kicked him in the face while wearing spiked boots. In late
 November 1996 three youths from Olomouc who had attacked a Pakistani student
 were found guilty and given suspended prison sentences. In March visiting univer-
 sity lecturer of Indian origin was stalked and attacked by youths; he then left the
 country without filing charges, said by friends to fear reprisals.
 Ap proximately 50,000 ethnic Germans ive in the country, most of them elderly.
 In July the Litomerice district court sentenced five members of the far-right SPR-
 RSC, including a Member of Parliament, to fines of about $65 to 160 (2,000 to 5,000
 Kcs) for intimidation. Four of the defendants appealed their sentences. In 1994 they
 disrupted a joint Czech-German ceremony at Terezin to honor those who died dur-
 
 
 1064
 
 ig the transfer of Ethnic Germans out of Czechoslovakia following World War II,
 pelting participants with eggs and kicking wreaths off of graves.
 Also in July, the leader of the SPR-RSC party was charged with inciting national
 and racial hatred for anti-German statements made at a rally protesting the signing
 of the Czech-German Declaration in January. The accused set a German flag on fire
 and said that he regretted that too few Germans had been killed during World War
 H.
 In December Parliament ratified the Council of Europe's Framework Convention
 for the Protection of national Minorities which is to take effect in April 1998.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The law provides workers with the right to form and
 join unions of their own choice without prior authorization, and the government re-
 spects this right in practice. Union membership continued to decline in 1997.
 Most workers are members of unions affiliated with the Czech-Moravian chamber
 of trade unions (CMIKOS). The CMKOS is a democratically oriented, republic-wide
 umbrella organization for branch unions. It is not affiliated with any political party
 and carefully maintains its independence.
 Workers have the right to strike, except for those whose role in public order or
 public safety is deemed crucial. The law requires that labor disputes be subject first
 to mediation and that strikes take place only after mediation efforts fail.
 In February railway workers staged a 48-hour strike, later extended by an addi-
 tional 24 hours, to protest restructuring plans that would have resulted in signifi-
 cant layoffs. The Prague municipal court ruled the strike illegal, and that decision
 was appealed. A deputy minister of transport was ousted during the strike.
 In April 65,000 teachers waged a rolling strike calling for higer pay. The Govern-
 ment and striking teachers agreed to a slight raise in pay and a longer work week.
 In November as many as 100,000 union members and sympathizers staged an or-
 derly demonstration against the Government's economic and social policy in
 Pra ge's Old Town Square.
 unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate with
 and participate in international bodies. This freedom was fully exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining, which is generally carried out by unions and employers on a com-
 pany basis. The scope for collective bargaining is more limited in the government
 sector, where wages are regulated by law.
 There are 11 free trade zones. Their workers have and practice the same right
 to organize and hargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and it is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code stipulates a minimum working age of 15 years, although children who
 have completed courses at special schools (schools for the mentally disabled and so-
 cially maladjusted) ma work at the age of 14. These prohibitions are enforced in
 practice. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government
 effectively enforces this prohibition (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards. The minimum wage is approximately $80 (2,500 Kcs) per month. The mini-
 mum wage provides a sparse standard of living for an individual worker, although
 when combined with allowances available to families with children, it provides an
 adequate standard of living for a worker and a family. Retraining efforts, carried
 out by district labor offices, seek to provide labor mobility for those at the lower end
 of the wage scale. Because of a very tight job market in most of the country, the
 enforcement of minimum wage standards was not an issue during the year.
 The law mandates a standard workweek of 421/2 hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8 2hour workday, as well as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime ordered by the employer may not exceed 150
 hours per year or 8 hours per week as a standard practice. Overtime above this
 limit may be permitted by the local employment office. The Labor Ministry enforces
 standards for working hours, rest periods, and annual leave.
 Government, unions, and employers promote worker safety and health, but condi-
 tions in some sectors of heavy industry are problematical, especially those awaiting
 privatization. Industrial accident rates are not unusually high. The Office of Labor
 Safety is responsible for enforcement of health and safety standards. Workers have
 the right to refuse work endangering their life or health without risk of loss of em-
 ployment.
