 DJIBOUTI
 Despite 1992 constitutional changes that permitted the creation of four political
 parties, President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for Progress
 (RPP), in power since independence in 1977, continue to rule the country. Two main
 ethnic groups hold most political power-. Somali Issas (the tribe of the President),
 and AMars. Citizens from other Somali clans (Issak, Gadabursi, and Dard), and
 those of Yemeni and other origins, are limited in their access to top positions. In
 1994 the Government and a action of the Mar-led Front for the Restoration of
 Unity and Democracy (FRUD) signed a peace accord, ending 3 years of civil war.
 In the accord, the Government agreed to recognize the FRUD as a legitimate politi-
 cal party. The Government named two FRUD leaders to cabinet positions in 1995;
 however, part of the FRUD rejected the peace accord and remains opposed to the
 Government. Two other legal political parties have existed since 1992, the National
 Democratic Party (PND) and the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD); neither holds
 a parliamentary seat or a cabinet level post. In December the ruling party coalition
 that includes the FRUD party won all 65 seats in legislative elections. The elections
 took place without international observers, and the opposition claimed massive
 fraud. Presidential elections are scheduled for 1999. President Gouled implied that
 he would not run. The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The 8,000-member National Police Force (FNP) is responsible for internal security
 and border control, and is overseen by the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of De-
 fense controls the army and the gendarmerie, and a small intelligence bureau re-
 ports directly to the President. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective con-
 trol of the security forces, but there were instances in which the security forces
 acted independently of the Government's authority; some members committed
 human rights abuses.
 Djibouti has little industry and few natural resources. Services provide most of
 the national income. Minor mineral deposits remain mostly unexploited. Only a
 tenth of the land is arable and 1 percent is forested. Outside the capital city, the
 primary economic activity is nomadic subsistence. People are free to pursue private
 
 
 business interests and to hold personal and real property. The part of the annual
 gross domestic product not generated by and for the expatriate community, which
 includes some 10,000 French citizens, is estimated at no more than $250 per capita
 annually.
 The Covernment's human rights record continued to be poor. Citizens have not
 yet been allowed to exercise the right to change theirgovernment. Members of the
 security forces committed at least one extrajudicial killing. There were credible re-
 ports that some members of the security forces beat and otherwise abused detainees
 and sexually assaulted female inmates. Prison conditions are harsh. The Govern-
 ment continued to harass, intimidate, and imprison political opponents and union
 leaders. The Government continued to arrest and detain persons arbitrarily and in-
 fringed upon citizens' right to privacy. Police occasionally jailed or intimidated jour-
 nalists. The Government limited freedom of assembly, and freedom of association is
 restricted. Discrimination against women persists, and the practice of female genital
 mutilation continued to be widespread. Discrimination on the basis of ethnic back-
 ground persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces were responsible for
 one known extrajudicial killing. On January 27, police shot and killed IHassan Aden
 Farah and injured one of-his two passengers, following a car chase. Police reported
 finding numerous firearms in the car and at the victim's home. The Government,
 which had had Farah under surveillance- for some time, said that -he was plotting
 to kill a high-level official and had tried to help a former national treasurer escape
 from police detention during a May 1996 demonstration. The Government has not
 taken any action against the police in connection with this killing. One of the two
 passengers, who was said to be accompanying the victim to find a car part, was re-
 portedly tortured.
 Legal proceedings have begun -against six soldiers accused in the 1995 killings of
 Randa's religious leader, Al I-oumed Souleh,-and an associate; Said-Aramis. The
 Ministry blamed the failure to. bring cases to closure in an expeditious-manner on
 a lack of qualified personnel.
 In September FRD rebel holdouts killed- 11 soldiers (see Section 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1995 abduction of four persons by armed men
 in the north, or in the -1995 kidnaping of a traditional Afar chief at Alalli Dada.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other inhu-
 mane, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments, and torture is punishable by
 15 years' imprisonment. However, one person apprehended while traveling in Has-
 ,san Farah's car was-reportedly torturedcby police (see Section L.a.). There were cred-
 ible reports that police sometimes. beat and otherwise physically abused prisoners
 and detainees. There were'no reports that any police officers were punished for such
 abuses. The police also beat demonstrators (see Section 2.b;). The National Police
 provide all prison guards.
 Prison conditions are harsh and severely overcrowded. Gabede Prison, built for
 350 persons, at times houses nearly twice that number. The Government sometimes
 shortens prison terms to reduce overcrowding. The Justice Ministry estimates that
 60 percent of prisoners are illegal Ethiopian immigrants who have committed crimes
 in Djibouti. Children of female inmates under the age of 5 are sometimes allowed
 to stay with their mothers; authorities say that milk is provided for them. Report-
 edly, prisoners must pay authorities to obtain food. Health care sources reported
 that prison guards rape female-and adolescent inmates. At least one rape victim be-
 came pregnant and required health care. There are no educational facilities within
 the prison. Ministry of Justice officials said that lack of funding hampers their abil-
 ity to provide even minimal services.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continues to maintain an
 office in Djibouti and an ICRC delegate from Nairobi, Kenya made quarterly visits
 to the main prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal protections, arbitrary arrest
 and detention are-problems. The 1995 Penal Code stipulates that the State may not
 detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's formal charge.
 Detainees may be held another 24 hours with the prior approval of the public pros-
 ecutor. All persons, including those-accused of political or national security offenses,
 must be tried within 8 months of arraignment. Nevertheless, the police often dis-
 regarded these procedures, typically arresting persons without warrants and some-
 
 
 93
 times detaining them for lengby periods without charge. The Penal Code provides
 for bail and expeditious trial. Incommunicado detention is used.
 In February in the midst of a teachers' strike, security forces detained four teach-
 ers who were active in their unions. Osman Miguil Wais was accused of inciting oth-
 ers to riot and held for 6 days, Suleiman hmed Mohamed and Mohamed Ali
 Djama were accused of inciting others to riot and held for 4 days, and Abdulazia
 Mohamed was accused of inciting a popular uprising and held for 4 days. Several
 hundred other teachers and sympathizers were detained briefly at the Nagad deten-
 tion center.
 Awaleh Guelleh Assone, who was being held along with four other alleged terror-
 ists for the 1990 bombing of a Djibouti cafe escaped from Gabode prison in Septem-
 ber. The Government's investigation of the attack was ongoing at year's end. In
 April 1996, the French Government issued an international arrest warrant for Na-
 tional Democratic Party president Aden Robleh Awaleh and his wife, Aicha Omar
 Dabar, for their alleged part in the bombing. The two remain free in Djibouti.
 Aicha Dabaleh and her husband Mohamed Kadami were among four FRUD rebels
 extradited from Ethiopia in late September (see Section 2.d.). Dabaleh, who was
 then pregnant, remained in prison until November. Her supporters claimed that she
 only was involved in humanitarian work and should not have been detained.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and magistrates are appointed for life terms. In practice, however, the judici-
 ary is not independent of the executive. Constitutional provisions for a fair trial are
 not universally respected, even in nonpolitical cases, b cause of interference from
 the executive branch. Since ministerial changes in December, the Justice Minister
 is responsible for human rights.
 The judiciary, based on the French Napleonic Code, comprises a lower court, an
 appeals courts, and a Supreme Court. There are no longer "special courts" to try
 cases outside normal judiciary channels. The Supreme Court can overrule decisions
 of the lower courts.
 A Constitutional Council rules on the constitutionality of laws, including those re-
 lated to the protection of human rights and civil liberties. Its rulings are not always
 respected, however. In August 1996, for example, the Constitutional Council ruled
 that the Parliament's Disciplinary Committee had wrongly denied the parliamen-
 tary immunity of three legislators. No action was taken on the ruling. In May the
 Council's president, Djama Amareh Meidal and two other members, Supreme Court
 president Hussein Aganeh, and bank executive Mohamed Aden, were removed from
 their positions on the Council. In contrast, three Appellate Court judges removed
 in May 1996, reportedly for political reasons, were later reinstated in new jobs in
 the Justice Ministry.
 Opposition leaders criticized a Lawyers' Council decision in February to disbar
 Meidal and another attorney, Aref Mohamed Aref. Aref, currently Secretary General
 of the faction of the Democratic Renewal Party (PRD), not recognized by the Govern-
 ment, was a defense attorney for five politicians jailed for criticizing President
 Gouled (see Section L.a.). Other members of the legal profession said that despite
 their laudable human rights work, the two lawyers had acted unethically in other
 cases. A civil suit against Aref is pending. In early October, an outspoken French
 parliamentarian was refused entry into Djibouti to attend Arefs hearing.
 The legal system is composed of legislation and executive decrees, French codified
 law adopted at independence, Shari'a law, and nomadic traditions. Urban crime is
 dealt with in accordance with French-inspired law and judicial practice in the regu-
 lar courts. Civil actions may be brought in regular or traditional courts. Shari'a law
 is restricted to civil and family matters. The Justice Ministry is combining the three
 types of law in a new text designed to promote women's rights and provide greater
 protection of children.
 Traditional Law (Xeer) is often used in conflict resolution and victim compensa-
 tion. This traditional law stipulates that, for example, a blood price be paid to the
 victim's clan for crimes such as murder and rape.
 The Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, and has
 the right to legal counsel and to be examined by a doctor if imprisoned. Although
 trials are officially public, Daher Ahmed Farah was tried and convicted privately.
 Legal counsel is supposed to be available to the indigent in criminal and civil mat-
 ters. Court cases are heard in public before a presiding judge and two accompanying
 judges. The latter receives assistance from two persons-assessors-who are not
 members of the bench, but who are .thought to possess sufficient legal sophistication
 to comprehend court proceedings. The Government chooses assessors from the pub-
 lic at large, but credible reports indicate that political and ethnic affiliations play
 a role in the selection.
 
 
 In early January, five political prisoners arrested in August 1996 were released.
 The five Moumin Bahdon Farah, the former Justice Minister and Foreign Minister,
 A   ed Boulaleh Barreh, the former Defense Minister, Ai Mahamade Houmed, the
 former Industry Minister, Ismael Guedi Hared, the former Presidential Cabinet Di-
 rector, and Abdillahi Guirreh, a former ruling party annex president, had been con-
 victed of inciting to violence, using tribalism  or  litical ends, and disseminating
 false information.
 The five had claimed in a published statement that President Gouled rules by ter-
 ror and force and without regard to the Constitution; they were sentenced to 6
 months in jail, fined $1,200 each, and prohibited from seeking elected office for a
 period of 5 years. Although the prisoners were released after serving their terms,
 the election ban remains in place. On December 17, police prevented Moumin
 Bahdon Farah from leaving his home to attend an opposition political rally. Also on
 December 17, police detained a ruling party member of the National Assembly ac-
 tive in the opposition, Mahdi Ibrahim Guellah, for 8 hours.
 There are no other political prisoners remaining.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and
 communications. The law also requires that the authorities obtain a warrant before
 conducting searches on private property. However, in practice the Government does
 not always obtain warrants before conducting such searches, and it reportedly mon-
 itors and sometimes disrupts the communications of some regime opponents.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press; however, at times the Government restricted this right in practice. The law
 prohibits the dissemination of false information and regulates the publication of
 newspapers. The Constitution prohibits slander.
 In October government security forces seized equipment form the office of the
 Unified Front of the Djiboutian Opposition (FUOD) in order to prevent it from pub-
 lishing newsletters and communiques, and detained the FUOD's vice-president for
 12 hours. By year's end, the FUOD's equipment had not been returned. In October
 police also seized printing equipment from the office of the PRD faction not recog-
 nized by the Government.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations. It also owns the principal
 weekly newspaper, La Nation. The official media generally are uncritical of govern-
 ment leaders and government policy. There are several opposition-run weekly and
 monthly publications that circulate freely and openly criticize the Government.
 However, journalists, and even vendors of opposition papers, are occasionally jailed
 or intimidated by police.
 There are no specific laws or criminal sanctions that threaten academic freedom.
 In general, teachers may speak and conduct research without restriction, provided
 that they not violate sedition laws.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to free assembly is
 provided for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this right
 in practice. However, the Ministry of Interior requires permits for peaceful assembly
 and monitors opposition activities. While permits generally are approved, the Gov-
 ernment commonly uses a show of police force and threatening tactics to intimidate
 and discourage would-be demonstrators. Some opposition leaders effectively prac-
 ticed self-censorship and, rather than provoke a government crackdown, refrained
 from organizing popular demonstrations. In several cases during the 1996-97 school
 year, poiice beat and detained demonstrating teachers. Police briefly detained hun-
 dreds of teachers' union members who participated in a strike in February (see Sec-
 tion 6.a.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association provided that certain legal
 requirements are met. The Constitution provides for four political parties. The Gov-
 ernment took advantage of an absence of leadership in the main opposition party,
 the PRD, following the late 1996 death of its leader, and conferred legal recognition
 on the weaker half of the party. Police detained, pro-activist Daher Ahmed Farah
 on October 12, and charged Farah in a closed hearing with illegally operating a po-
 litcal  arty illegally publishing a newspaper, disseminating false information, for-
 gery (or the use of party seals), usurping a title, and organizing an illegal dem-
 onstration. Daher was given "provisional liberty" on November 1 (see Section i.e.).
 Nonpolitical associations must register and be approved by the Ministry of Inte-
 rior.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim. There are also a small number of Catholics. The Government im-
 poses no sanctions on those who choose to ignore Islamic teachings.
 
 
 95
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox,
 and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may perform
 charitable works, but proselytizing, while not illegal, is unofficially discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution allows freedom of movement. This right may be lim-
 ited only by law.
 In general citizens may travel or emigrate without restriction or interference.
 However, some Afar leaders have had their passports revoked or denied, and Mus-
 lim women unaccompanied by a spouse or adult male have been prohibited from
 traveling to certain Gulf countries. Authorities seized the tickets and passport of a
 dissident member of the National Assembly in September as he attempted to leave
 the country to attend a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union in Cairo, Egypt.
 His documents had not been returned by yearend.
 Djibouti hosts 70,000 to 100,000 refugees and illegal immigrants from neighboring
 countries, equal to about one-fifth the population. The U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) assists 20,000 Somali and 1,000 Ethiopian residents of
 Djibouti's three refugee camps. Some 1,500 Ethiopian and Somali urban refugees
 are registered with the UNHCR in Djibouti City. There has been no major repatri-
 ation since the UNHCR's 1994-96 repatriation of 35,000 Ethiopian refugees and mi-
 grants from the capital.
 Up to 18,000 Afars sought asylum in Ethiopia during the 1991-94 civil war in
 Djibouti. At least 10,000 are said to have repatriated spontaneously since the 1994
 t eace accord. According to Ethiopian authorities, some 8,000 remain in Ethiopia.
 ecause the displaced Afar were not in refugee camps, and because Afars are Midig
 enous to Ethiopia and Eritrea as well, it is difficult to estimate their number. Early
 in the year, the Government officially welcomed Afars to return, and several promi-
 nent former resistance figures did so. However, the killing of 11 Djiboutian soldiers
 by FRUD rebel holdouts on September 1 led to renewed tensions and a crackdown
 on suspected "sympathizers" in the north. In connection with the September 1 inci-
 dent, in late September, the Ethiopian government extradited at least four Afar
 leaders who were living voluntarily in exile (see Section 1.d.). While the army has
 been ordered to vacate Afar homes and land occupied during the conflict, some areas
 still appear contrlled by the soldiers. In October there were reports of enhanced
 cooperation with the Government of Ethiopia in combating armed Afar movements.
 In October, eight Djiboutian Mars were reportedly deported by Ethiopia with no
 legal mandate. By mid-November, 15 FRUD leaders were reportedly in detention.
 In the week before the December legislative elections, there were several minor
 clashed between the army and the Mfars; there were few casualties.
 In November the Government expelled Sudanese refugee Osman Hassan Babiker
 to Ethiopia: he had been under the UNHCR protection. The Government stated that
 Djibouti was not Babiker's country of first asylum, and therefore he was not quali-
 fied to be a refugee in Djibouti. The UNHCR objected to the Government's action,
 which disregarded the procedures that the Government had agreed to with the
 UNHCR.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment, in practice citizens have not yet been allowed to exercise fully this right.
 The RPP has carefully controlled the implementation of the new four-par  system
 to suppress any organized opposition. The RPP alliance with the legal FRU party
 won all 65 seats in the December legislative elections. The elections took place with-
 out international observers amid opposition claims of fraud. Presidential elections
 are scheduled for 1999. President Gouled, who has held that office since independ-
 ence in 1977 and was reelected in 1993, has implied that he would not seek that
 office again.
 In 1992 a voter referendum approved a measure to limit the number of political
 parties to four. However, this result was never codified into law. The opposition
 groups, the FUOD, the Daher Ahmed Farah faction of the PRD, and the Group for
 Democracy and the Republic (GDR), which were not permitted to contest the elec-
 tions because they are not recognized parties, joined to form the Coordination Com-
 mittee of the Djiboutian Opposition (CCOD).
 The 1994 peace agreement between the Government and the FRUD required that
 FRUD members be included in senior government positions. Two FRUD members
 who were named to the Cabinet in June 1995 remain in office. The government-rec-
 ognized faction of the FRUD was registered as a political party in 1996 and held
 its first congress in April. The unrecognized FRUD faction includes members who
 
 
 refused to accept the terms of the peace accord, as well as Afars extradited from
 Ethiopia in-September (see Section 2.d).
 Ytough legallyentitled to participate in the political process, women are largely
 ,excluded from senior positions in government and in the political parties. There are
 no women in. the Cabinet or in Parliament. Khadija Abeba, president of the Su-
 preme Court is the highest ranking female official. She and six women serve as
 judges, and one is a director in the Ministry of- Foreign Affairs. While women have
 the. right to vote, there were na female candidates in the December legislative elec-
 tions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude. Regarding-International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Discrimination based on ethnic background limits the role of members of minority
 clans in government and politics. The Issa; the dominant Somali clan, control the
 ruling party. The President's subclan, the Mamassan, wields disproportionate power
 in a airs of state. Afurs hold a number of high ministerial posts, but are not so well
 represented at lower levels. Somali clans other than-the Issa, and Djibutians of
 Yemeni origin, are at present unofficiallylimited to one ministerial post each. There
 are also in formal limits on the number of-seats -for each group in the Parliament.
 The Government remains hostile to the formation -of local human rights groups.
 The Government has arrested .and released Mohamed Houmed Souleh, the leader
 .of the Association for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties (ADDHL), several
 times since 1993 for criticizing military abuses in the -civil conffict. He stopped
 speaking publicly.in.1996. Credible sources reported that the Government hired
 Souleh on the-condition that he limit the ADDHLs criticism of the Government. The
 Union of- Djiboutian Women (.UNFD) and the Djiboutian Association for the Pro-
 motion of the Family (ADEPF) promote the rights of women and -hildren. No other
 local human rights groups exist. The ICRC visited the country during the year as
 did Education International (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of-language, race,
 sex,.-or religion; however, discrimination against women and ethnic minorities per-
 sists. In particular, the Government's enforcement of laws to protect women and
 children is weak.
 Women.-Violence against women exists but reported cases-are few. The Govern-
 ment has been concerned about the problem of rape, and the 1995 revised Penal
 Code includes sentences of up to 20 years in, prison for rapists. More than 100 such
 - cases have been tried. Violence against -women is normally dealt with within the
 family or clan structure rather than in the courts. The police rarely intervene in
 domestic violence incidents, and the media report only the most extreme examples,
 such as murder.
 Women legally possess full civil rights, but in practice, due to custom and tradi-
 tional societal discrimination in education, they play a secondary role in public life
 and have fewer employment opportunities then men. Few woman work in manage-
 rial and professional positions, and women are largely confined to trade and sec-
 retarial fields. Customary law discriminates against women in such areas as inher-
 itance, divorce, property ownership, and travel (see Section 2.d.). Educated women
 increasingly turn to the regular courts to defend their interests.
 Children.-The Government devotes almost no public funds to the advancement
 of children's rights and welfare. A few charitable organizations work with children.
 Primary education is compulsory. However, the Government does not monitor com-
 pliance. Approximately 20 percent of children complete secondary education.
 According to an recent report, as many as 98 percent of females 7 years or older
 had undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by
 international health experts as damaging to bth physical and psychological health.
 FGM is traditionally performed on girls between the ages of 7 and 10. In 1988 the
 UNFD began an educational campaign against infibulation, the most extensive and
 dangerous form of FGM. The campaign has had only a limited impact on the preva-
 lence of this custom, which is pervasive in rural areas. After the 1995 U.N. Women's
 Conference in Cairo, Egypt, the UNFD declared that all forms of mutilation should
 be forbidden. The revised Penal Code that went into effect in April 1995 states that
 "violence causing genital mutilation" is punishable by 5 years imprisonment and a
 fine of over $5,600 (one million Djibouti francs). However, the Government has not
 yet convicted anyone under this statute. The efforts of the JNFD and other groups
 appear to be having some effect, at least in the capital city. Some health workers
 reported a precipitous drop in the number of hospitalizations related to FGM in
 
 
 Djibouti City. Many believe the incidence of infibulation has decreased, although no
 systematic data are available on the problem. U.N. and other experts believe that
 lesser forms of FGM are still widely practiced, and that the most extreme procedure,
 infibulation, is still common in rural areas.
 The Government has not addressed other forms of child abuse, which are often
 lightly punished. For example, when a child is raped or abused, the perpetrator is
 usually fined an amount sufficient to cover the child's medical care. The Govern-
 ment has not used provisions of the Penal Code to deal with child abuse more se-
 verely.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Although disabled per-
 sons have access to education and public health facilities, there is no specific legisla-
 tion that addresses the needs of the disabled, and there are no laws or regulations
 that prevent job discrimination against disabled persons. The disabled have dif-
 ficulty finding employment in an economy where at least 60 percent of the able-bod-
 ied adult male population is underemployed or jobless.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The Government continued to discriminate
 against citizens on the basis of ethnicity in employment and job advancement. The
 Issa, the dominant Somali clan, control the ruling party, the civil and security serv-
 ices, and the military forces.
 While Mars hold a number of high ministerial positions, they do not appear so
 well represented at lower levels. Clans other than the Issa and citizens of Yemeni
 origin are unofficially limited to one ministerial position each. There are also semi-
 official limits on the number of seats for each group in Parliament.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocition.-Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided that they comply with legally prescribed require-
 ments. Since 1992, unions are supposed to be free to join or form other confed-
 erations. The state body, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers (UGTD) and the
 Democratic Labor Union (UDT) formed a confederation in 1995 and have gained in-
 creasing support despite government harassment. In the small formal economy,
 about 70 percent of workers are members of the combined UDT/UGTD confed-
 eration. Previously the Government controlled individual unions by making mem-
 bership mandatory in the state-organized labor confederation. To counter the UDT/
 UGTD, the Government created the Djiboutian Labor Congress (CODJITRA), com-
 posed of Ministry of Labor officials. At its June meeting, the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) determined that the Government had violated the ILO constitu-
 tion by not allowing a member of the UDT/UGTD confederation to join the workers'
 delegation at the meeting. The headquarters of the UDT/UGTD confederation,
 sealed off by the Government in May 1996, remains closed, and their bank accounts
 remained frozen at year's end.
 The law requires representatives of employees who plan to strike to contact the
 Interior Ministry 48 hours in advance. All strikes during the year were legal. Al-
 though the labor law prohibits employer retribution against strikers, the teachers'
 strike in February resulted in police beating, arbitrarily arresting, and detaining
 teachers and union leaders and briefly detaining hundreds of union supporters (see
 Sections 1.d. and 2.b.). The Government also suspended, fired, or transferred scores
 of teachers active in the union to less desirable assignments in rural areas. In some
 cases, union leaders were forcibly evicted from government-provided housing. Begin-
 ning in January, the Government stopped providing public housing for civil servants
 and delayed paying housing stipends.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations
 abroad. The UDT has been a member of the ICFTU since 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the legal
 right to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Rela-
 tions between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wage rates are
 generally established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor
 guidelines. In disputes over wages or health and safety problems, the Ministry of
 Labor encourages direct resolution by labor representatives and employers. Workers
 or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Ministry's in-
 spection service, but critics claim that the service suffers from poor enforcement,
 due to its low priority and inadequate funding. The law prohibits antiunion dis-
 crimination, and employers found guilty are legally required to reinstate workers
 fired for union activities. However, the law does not appear to be enforced.
 An export processing zone (EPZ) was established in 1994. Firms in the EPZ are
 exempt from the Government's social security and medical insurance programs. In-
 stead, they must provide either government or private accident insurance. The mini-
 
 
 mum wage in the EPZ is approximately $1 per hour. Although the regular work-
 week is 40 hours, in the EPZ it is 45 hours. An employee who works for the same
 firm in the EPZ for at least 1 year has the right to 15 days' annual leave, compared
 with 30 days in the rest of the country (see Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits all forced or
 compulsory labor including children; while this is generally observed, security forces
 reportedly sometimes compel illegal immigrants to work for them under the threat
 of deportation.
 d. tatus of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits all labor by children under the age of 14, but the Government does not
 always enforce this prohibition effectively, and a shortage of labor inspectors re-
 duces the likelihood of investigation (see Section 6.c.). The minimum age for the em-
 ployment of children is 14 years, and the law is generally respected. However, a
 shortage of labor inspectors reduces the likelihood of investigations being carried
 out. Children are generally not employed for hazardous work. Children may and do
 work in family-owned businesses, such as restaurants and small shops, at all hours.
 e.Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only a small minority of the population is en-
 gaged in wage employment. The Government administratively sets minimum wage
 rates according to occupational categories, and the Ministry of Labor is charged with
 "enforcement. The monthly wage rate for unskilled labor, set in 1976, is approxi-
