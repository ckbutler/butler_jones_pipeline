 ESTONIA
 Estonia, an independent state between the two World Wars, was
 annexed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)
 in 1940 as a constituent republic. The United States does not
 recognize the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia has been generally
 subjected to the same centralized rule, the same constitution
 and judicial system, and the same restrictions on civil and
 political liberties as in the U.S.S.R. Political power has
 been exercised by the leadership of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union, which tightly controlled the activities of local
 government and Communist party structures in Estonia.
 Estonians have utilized liberalization in the U.S.S.R. in the
 past few years to gain more control over their own affairs.
 In November 1988, in response to demands for political
 democracy and human rights, the Estonian Supreme Council
 (legislature) adopted a "Declaration of Sovereignty,"
 proclaiming that its laws superseded those of the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet. In November 1989, the Estonian Supreme
 Council officially noted that Estonia had been illegally
 occupied and incorporated into the U.S.S.R. in 1940. In March
 1990, for the first time since 194G, free elections were held
 nationwide, and the People's Front, a coalition of democratic
 forces, won a majority of seats in the Supreme Council. Edgar
 Savisaar became Prime Minister.
 On February 24, elections were held for an Estonian Citizens'
 Congress after a year-long petition drive had registered over
 700,000 citizens of the prewar Republic of Estonia and their
 descendants. The Congress' aim is to restore that republic.
 On August 7, the Estonian Supreme Council declared that the
 U.S.S.R. law of August 6, 19-40, on the admission of Estonia
 into the U.S.S.R. was not hinding and could not serve as a
 basis of relations.
 The primary law enforcement organization is the militia
 (police). The Committee for State Security (KGB), special
 troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and regular
 Soviet armed forces, which maintain a significant presence in
 Estonia, are controlled by Moscow. During 1990 the Estonian
 militia underwent a series of reforms. Through an agreement
 with the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, Estonia was
 supposed to take over control of the militia in January 1991.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Estonians resent the
 fact that much of the national income they create is
 transferred to other republics and that most major economic
 enterprises are controlled by central ministries in Moscow.
 They also complain about a continuing decline in the quality
 and quantity of food supplies and consumer goods. In an
 attempt to gain more control over the Estonian economy, the
 Supreme Council implemented an "economic border" plan on
 October 15. Prices for bread, meat, and dairy products were
 substantially increased as the Supreme Council reduced food
 price supports. At the same time, an economic border regime
 was declared with the aim of controlling the flow of goods and
 people in and out of Estonia. By.year's end, however, the
 border regime was not fully operational.
 The human rights situation continued to improve. Freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion was widely

 ESTONIA
 respected. Free elections were held. However, progress was
 limited, both in Estonia and the U.S.S.R., toward legislative
 reforms that woild institutionalize human rights improvements.
 In January 1991, dozens of unarmed protesters were killed or
 wounded by Soviet troops taking over government and Communist
 Party buildings in the Baltics.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 -Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of such killing in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Harsh treatment of prisoners occurs during both interrogation
 and confinement in labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric
 hospitals. Physical and psychological abuse of prisoners,
 overcrowding, and detention under extremely unhealthful
 conditions are common. Prisoners went "on strike" several
 times during the year, refusing to eat or work in protest
 against prison conditions and low wages for their work. The
 Government established a commission in October to examine
 prisoners.' claims and complaints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted so broadly that
 persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to exercise
 their basic human rights. During 1990, however, the
 authorities in Estonia did not use these-laws to arrest
 political activists.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Despite provisions for judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State retains the
 ability to control the judicial process and arbitrarily
 determine the outcome of trials. Procedural safeguards, such
 as the right to a public trial and to a defense attorney, are
 generally respected but are not sufficient to guarantee fair
 trials.
 There were no known trials on purely political charges in
 1990, and no Estonians were known to be imprisoned for purely
 political reasons at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Soviet authorities continued to interfere in personal life
 through the use'of informers, the monitoring of mail and
 telephones, surveillance, and other means. The security
 apparatus did little, however, to intimidate Estonians or to
 hinder the expansion of social and political activism which
 continued in 1990.

 ESTONIA
 Contacts between Estonians and foreigners continued to be
 monitored, despite a considerable increase in such contacts
 during 1990. Although many Estonians continued to assume that
 telephones and mail were monitored, they exhibited little fear
 of using these means of communications to express their views.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In 1990 freedom of speech was widely respected. The
 authorities tolerated public expression of virtually any
 viewpoint, including criticism of Estonian officials and calls
 for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet "occupation" troops
 from Estonia.
 Estonian media expanded their coverage of political subjects.
 Besides advocating Estonian independence and opposing the
 presence of Red Army troops in Estonia, the media frequently
 criticized the Communist Party as well as the central
 Government in Moscow. The media provided extensive political
 coverage of the positions of candidates in both the March 18
 Supreme Council elections and the February 24 elections to the
 Estonian Congress. Estonian television even offered live
 coverage of the three sessions of the Estonian Congress.
 Despite this openness, many publications remained under the
 formal control of official organizations or the Communist
 Party. The number of independent publications also expanded
 during 1990; among them were those published by the Estonian
 People's Front, the Estonian Heritage Society, the Jewish
 Cultural Society, and other nonofficial organizations.
 Unauthorized (samizdat) publications were also produced and
 distributed, although the number of samizdat declined as the
 official press increasingly reflected a wide range of opinions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 A 1988 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet decree sets out guidelines on
 demonstrations and meetings, but the Estonian Supreme Council
 declined to adopt relevant implementing legislation.
 In practice, Estonians were allowed to hold mass meetings and
 demonstrations without official hindrance in 1990.  For
 instance, on March 14, during the election campaign to the
 Estonian Supreme Council, thousands of ethnic Russian
 supporters of Intermovement, a Russian nationalist group
 opposed to Estonian independence, gathered in Tallinn on
 Fr-eedom Square. Two days later, the Estonian Popular Front
 held a mass rally in support of Estonian independence at
 exactly the same spot. The authorities did not interfere with
 either event.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Estonian Supreme Council passed legislation guaranteeing
 freedom of conscience and freedom of religious proselytism.
 Christmas was celebrated for the third consecutive year as an
 officially sanctioned holiday, and religious services were
 regularly shown on television. Furthermore, church property
 which had been confiscated in the 1940's began to be returned
 by the Soviet State.

 ESTONIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 possible in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate is not
 recognized by Soviet law.' Persons wishing to leave
 temporarily must present an invitation from abroad. Many
 Soviet Jews in Estonia were denied permission to emigrate in
 previous years, but the upsurge in Soviet Jewish emigration
 has had a positive effect on Jewish emigration from Estonia as
 well.
 Although travel abroad is limited by restrictive legislation
 and arbitrary enforcement, bureaucratic procedures are
 considerably less cumbersome in Estonia than in the U.S.S.R.
 as a whole. For the third consecutive year, the number of
 Estonians visiting the United States and other Western
 countries increased. Leading figures in all of the Republic's
 main political movements, including the People's Front and
 groups favoring immediate Estonian independence, visited
 Western countries to present their views. An unprecedented
 number of Estonian-Americans, other emigres, and persons of
 Estonian descent were able to visit Estonia in 1990, with many
 visitors permitted to visit areas that are formally "closed"
 to foreigners. On several occasions during the year, however,
 American citizens were denied permission to visit because of
 their participation in the independence movement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1990; for the first time in postwar history, Estonians were
 given the opportunity to determine the composition of their
 own parliament and government. On March 18, free,
 multicandidate elections were held to the Estonian Supreme
 Council. A Popular Front Government was voted into power as
 Communists were overwhelmingly rejected at the polls.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for investigations are known to have been made in
 1990. The Government generally welcomed foreign and
 nongovernmental observers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited by the Constitution. Tensions between ethnic
 Estonians and Russians, however, are always near the surface
 in Estonia where a low Estonian birthrate and an official
 Soviet settlement policy have caused the ethnic Estonian
 proportion of the population to fall from 92 percent in 1939
 to approximately 60 percent in 1990.
 Ethnic Estonians continued to complain that they could not
 always conduct business in their own language and that
 immigrants from the U.S.S.R. receive favored treatment in the
 provision of housing and other social services.
 
 
 1142
 ESTONIA
 Ethnic Russians, on the other hand, complained that new laws
 passed by the Estonian Supreme Council discriminated against
 non-Estonian ethnic groups. Russians were concerned about a
 detailed language law, passed in 1989, which required that
 incumbents of certain managerial and service positions
 eventually be bilingual. Russians also felt threatened by new
 immigration laws passed by the Supreme Council on June 26
 which limited immigration to 0.1 percent of the population per
 year and which made it difficult even for relatives of
 permanent residents of Estonia to immigrate to Estonia. New
 regulations to prevent nonresidents of Estonia from purchasing
 goods--and particularly the "economic border" law which set up
 barriers to the free export of food out of the Republic--also
 irritated ethnic Russians.
 The 1989-90 campaign by the Estonian Congress to register
 prewar Estonian citizens and the subsequent elections to an
 Estonian Citizens' Congress alarmed many Russians as well.
 Although the Congress movement encouraged ethnic Russians and
 other post-1940 immigrants to petition for citizenship (and
 subsequently allowed the "petitioners" to elect nonvoting
 delegates to the Congress), only 18,000 ethnic Russians
 registered.
 While major ethnic tensions in Estonia divide the Estonian and
 Russian populations, most ethnic groups have formed officially
 recognized cultural societies which work closely with the
 Estonian People's Front on proposals to, enhance their cultural
 autonomy. A law to protect the rights of national minorities
 was adopted by the Supreme Council in December 1989.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day care service and maternity benefits
 assists women in obtaining and retaining jobs.
 Estonian statistics on the problem of violence against women,
 including wife beating, are unavailable. The official Soviet
 press discussed the issue, and in 1989 the Soviet Council of
 Ministers set up a special branch (headed by a woman) to study
 the problems of women. Human rights and women's rights groups
 in Estonia are aware of the issue but have focused their
 efforts thus far on the broader questions of independence and
 freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice has generally been enforced in
 Estonia. The right of association, as defined by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO), has been virtually
 nonexistent. Although the Constitution grants Soviet citizens
 the right to form trade unions, attempts to exercise this
 right independently of the state-controlled union had always
 been repressed. New professional associations with no ties to
 Moscow were created in 1989, but it is not yet clear whether
 they will effectively exercise trade union functions.
 A dual effort to reform Estonian labor legislation and
 practice began to take shape in 1990 with adoption of a new
 law on trade unions and moves toward comprehensive overhaul of
 the official trade union organization. The law cites ILO
 standards and provides for trade unions to exist as
 independent organizations with the right to strike to defend
 workers' interests. It is too soon to judge the practical
 
 
 1143
 
 ESTONIA
 effects of these proposed changes, which are consistent with
 the stated goals of the Estonian economic autonomy plan.
 In addition to the politically motivated strikes by at least
 40,000 predominantly Russian workers protesting against the
 new Estonian election law, a few other brief strikes were
 reported in the Estonian press. There were no reports of
 repression against strikers in 1990.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in Estonia generally have not been able to organize or
 engage in collective bargaining. Virtually all workers in the
 U.S.S.R. automatically become members of an affiliate of the
 official Soviet trade union organization, the All-Union
 Central Council of Trade Unions (restyled in October as the
 General Confederation of Trade Unions), in order to be
 entitled to government social welfare benefits. There are no
 economic incentive zones in Estonia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor. Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16.
 There -s no indication of wi-despread violations of this law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Estonia are similar to those in the
 U.S.S.R. According to the Soviet State Statistical Committee,
 however, the average monthly wage in Estonia for blue- and
 white-collar workers was well above the Soviet average.
 The standard workweek is 40 hours. The average workweek is 40
 hours for most white-collar workers and 41 hours for most
 blue-collar workers. Soviet law establishes minimum
 conditions of health and safety. Press reports suggest,
 however, that legislation on maximum, hours of work and health
 and safety standards are widely ignored.
