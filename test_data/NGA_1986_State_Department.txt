 NIGERIA
 President Ibrahim Babangida came to power in a military coup
 on August 27, 1985, overthrowing the military government of
 Major General Muhammadu Buhari that had seized power from
 civilians in December 1983. A 28-member Armed Forces Ruling
 Council (AFRC) is the main decisionmaking organ of the
 Government, while a 22-member Federal Cabinet presides over
 the Government's executive departments. Military governors,
 appointed by the President and assisted by mixed military/
 civilian executive councils, head Nigeria's 19 state
 governments. The 1979 Constitution remains partially in
 effect, but significant provisions, namely, those guaranteeing
 free elections, the existence of political parties, and the
 right to due process and habeas corpus, are suspended. The
 Government has pledged to return the country to civilian rule
 by 1990. The appropriate form and structure for a
 postmilitary government was publicly debated during 1986.
 Legislation at both the federal and state levels continues to
 be promulgated by decree. All decrees are exempt from
 challenge in the courts. The Government enforces its authority
 through the federal security apparatus: the national police,
 the military, and the State Security Service (SSS). No
 separate law enforcement agencies exist at the state and local
 levels.
 Nigeria, with an estimated 100 million people, is Africa's
 most populous country. It has a mixed economy in which the
 Government plays a major but declining role in all important
 sectors. On June 27, 1986, President Babangida announced a
 major program of structural adjustment, featuring a Second-
 tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), which allows the supply
 and demand of foreign exchange to determine the SFEM exchange
 rate. With the introduction of the SFEM on September 26,
 import licensing procedures, price controls, and many other
 Government restrictions were liberalized or abolished to help
 stimulate domestic production and employment, overcome public
 sector inefficiencies, and increase nonoil exports.
 In 1986 the Babangida Government continued to demonstrate a
 commitment to restoring some of the human rights formerly
 protected by the 1979 Constitution but seriously circumscribed
 in 1984-85. Judicial commissions, appointed in late 1985,
 reviewed the cases of all pending and conditionally released
 detainees, as well as the cases of all persons convicted by
 military tribunals, created under 1984 decrees, of corruption,
 currency violations, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and
 petroleum smuggling. The AFRC generally upheld the
 commissions' recommendations, confirming detainees' releases
 or slating them for future trials, and releasing prisoners or
 reducing their sentences. The AFRC also provided for judges
 to head future special tribunals, established an appeal
 procedure for all persons convicted by the tribunals, and
 reduced penalties to make them more appropriate to the
 offense. The death penalty was abolished for cases of people
 convicted of oil smuggling and drug trafficking.
 The Government in 1986 moved decisively against potential
 violent opposition. Ten military officers were executed in
 March for coup plotting in late 1985 following trial and
 conviction by a special military tribunal. The officers had
 access to legal defense counsel and exercised their right to
 appeal their convictions. The Government also introduced
 banning from political life as retribution for the misdeeds of
 former politicians. In June 1986, President Babangida
 
 
 226
 NIGERIA
 announced that all former politicians would be excluded from
 holding public office and participating in partisan politics
 for 10 years following the resumption of political activity.
 Former civilian President Shehu Shagari and his Vice President,
 Alex Ekwueme, have been banned from politics for life. In June
 the Government temporarily closed 20 institutions of higher
 education and banned the leading student organization in the
 wake of nationwide campus demonstrations protesting police
 killings of at least 4 students during a student strike at a
 northern university.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was no evidence of politically motivated killing in
 Nigeria at government instigation in 1986. In October a letter
 bomb killed the editor-in-chief of a weekly newsmagazine that
 had published investigative articles on controversial topics
 such as Nigerian involvement in drug trafficking and the
 dismissal of a key government official. Speculation about the
 incident includes unsubstantiated allegations of government
 involvement. A government investigation is underway.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports or allegations of torture. A portion of
 the 1979 Constitution which is still in effect outlaws torture
 and the mistreatment of prisoners. Nigerian law provides that
 such excesses be dealt with in criminal or civil proceedings.
 Prison conditions remain poor because of severe overcrowding
 and insufficient funds for basic necessities. According to
 unconfirmed newspaper reports, approximately 100 members of a
 northern religious sect arrested following a 1984 uprising have
 since died of hunger and malnutrition.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Babangida Government has retained the authority to detain
 persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state security or
 harmful to the economic well-being of the country under
 Decree 2 of 1984, the State Security (Detention of Persons)
 Decree. This decree suspends the 1979 constitutional guarantee
 of the right to habeas corpus and cannot be challenged in any
 court of law. In response to public outcry, the Government
 rescinded a 1986 amendment to Decree 2 that would have extended
 the maximum initial detention period from 3 to 6 months and
 given detention powers to the Inspector General of Police as
 well as to the Chief of General Staff.
 In June the Government detained leaders of the Nigeria Labor
 Congress (NLC), some for up to 2 weeks, to head off a
 nationwide labor demonstration called in sympathy with students
 protesting the death of a number of students on a university
 campus in northern Nigeria during confrontations with the
 police in May. The Government also detained, and subsequently
 released without prosecution, several members of the Academic
 
 
 227
 NIGERIA
 Staff Union of Universities while investigating their
 involvement in the campus disturbances. In April newspapers
 reported the detention of several unnamed former politicians.
 In one known case, former National Assembly member Tanko
 Yakassai was held by security officials for 31 days.
 Speculation at the time connected his detention to an April 18
 warning to former politicians to stop defying the 1984 ban on
 political activity. Four of the soldiers acquitted in March
 of coup plotting remained in custody afterwards for several
 months despite their acquittals.
 In 1986 a judicial panel headed by a Supreme Court judge
 reviewed the cases of approximately 1,700 persons detained
 under Decree 2 during the Buhari Administration (1984-85),
 many of whom had already been released. A government white
 paper published in July upheld most of the panel's
 recommendations absolving many of the detainees of wrongdoing
 and recommending others for formal charging and trial. Among
 those absolved by the panel and released after publication of
 the white paper were former President Shehu Shagari and Vice
 President Alex Ekwueme, both held for 31 months without
 charge. Both are now banned for life from political activity
 and restricted to their local government areas. About 800 of
 the former detainees, mainly former politicians and public
 office holders, are to be prosecuted for corruption by a
 special tribunal named in September under Decree 3, Recovery
 of Public Property (Special Military Tribunal). Still in
 detention without charge are former Head of State Muhammadu
 Buhari and his Chief of Staff, Tunde Idiagbon.
 No Nigerian has been exiled. Self-exiled politicians are free
 to return home with the caveat that those suspected of crimes
 will be subject to prosecution.
 The Military Government does not use forced labor as a means of
 political coercion or as a sanction against free expression.
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution provides that "no person shall be
 required to perform forced or compulsory labor." The latter
 excludes community service programs such as the National Youth
 Service Corps and environmental clean up campaigns.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1984 decree modifying the 1979 Constitution left the
 judiciary relatively unscathed, although special military
 tribunals were established outside the regular judicial
 system, notably for corruption cases. The judiciary is
 composed of both federal and state courts and includes
 procedures for appeals from state high courts to the Federal
 Court of Appeals and to the Federal Supreme Court. There are
 also constitutional provisions providing for the use of
 Islamic and local tribal law in civil cases.
 Provisions of the 1979 Constitution still in force guarantee
 persons charged with crimes a fair public trial in civilian
 courts within 3 months from the date of arrest. However,
 cumbersome administrative procedures and inefficiency sometimes
 result in prisoners being held for extended periods before
 being charged or tried. During routine inspections of prisons
 in 1986, High Court chief judges exercised their right to
 release detainees found to have spent more time in prison than
 they would have if they had been convicted for their alleged
 crimes. Trials are public and adhere to constitutionally
 guaranteed individual rights. In capital cases, the Government
 provides counsel for indigent defendants. In other cases,
 
 
 228
 NIGERIA
 indigents must rely for counsel on the Nigerian Legal Aid
 Society which has limited resources. In March the Government
 amended the Legal Aid Act of 1976 to extend assistance to
 persons with incomes up to approximately $500 per year at
 current exchange rates.
 The Babangida Government used a special military tribunal,
 constituted under Decree 1 of 1986, to try 23 persons for
 alleged complicity in a December 1985 coup plot. Ten persons,
 all members of the armed forces, were sentenced to death and
 executed in March. The tribunal acquitted six defendants and
 gave others jail terms. Although their trial was held in
 camera, the Government allowed military lawyers to defend the
 accused, a judge-advocate to advise tribunal members on points
 of law, and observers from the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)
 and the Ministry of Justice to witness the trial. NBA
 observers later stated that lengthy accreditation procedures
 kept them from observing most of the trial. The observers
 never made their observations public. Appeals to the chiefs
 of the military services were denied, and the Armed Forces
 Ruling Council (AFRC) upheld the convictions before sentences
 were carried out.
 The Buhari Government issued decrees that removed certain
 crimes, including corruption crimes, from the jurisdiction of
 the civilian judicial system to special military tribunals.
 These decrees remain in effect. In keeping with its human
 rights commitment, however, the present Government established
 judicial review commissions composed of distinguished civilians
 and military officials to conduct an extensive review in 1986
 of detentions and convictions under these decrees. The AFRC
 then amended the decrees to restore a measure of due process
 to the extrajudicial procedures.
 The commissions, acting essentially as appellate courts,
 forwarded their findings to the AFRC which in most cases upheld
 the panels' recommendations for release, acquittal, reduced
 sentences; or future trial. While supporting reduced prison
 terms for many former politicians convicted of corruption, the
 AFRC frequently added a specified period of exclusion from
 public office and involvement in partisan politics to the
 convict's penalty. Following disposition of the cases under
 review, the Government amended the 1984 decrees. Amendments
 added an appeal procedure (through a Special Appeal Tribunal),
 a guarantee that judges would head all tribunals, and abolished
 the death sentence for a number of offenses. Recommendations
 of the Special Appeal Tribunal are subject to confirmation by
 the AFRC. With the change in the composition of the corruption
 tribunals operating under the Buhari-era decrees, the Nigerian
 Bar Association lifted its 1984 boycott of the corruption
 trials which had been called in protest over the absence of
 legally trained tribunal members. Future corruption trials--
 nearly 800 cases are pending--may be conducted in public
 rather than in camera. At the swearing in of two new
 corruption tribunals in September, the officiating judge
 cautioned the press to report accurately on the trials. At
 the end of 1986, the reconstituted corruption tribunals had
 heard only one of the pending cases.
 On several occasions during 1986 the Babangida Government
 reiterated its commitment to uphold the integrity of the
 judiciary and to redress past judicial wrongs. On the ground
 that there may have been a miscarriage of justice, the
 Government dismissed a judge and released a popular jailed
 musician who said the judge had later admitted privately to
 
 
 229
 NIGERIA
 convicting him for currency trafficking in 1984 under pressure
 from government officials. The judge subsequently denied the
 charge. This celebrated case had been regarded by some
 observers as evidence of government interference with the
 judiciary during the Buhari regime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions
 of the 1979 Constitution still in force guarantee rights of
 privacy in the home, correspondence, and communications.
 General surveillance of the population by the State is not
 practiced. Forced entry into homes without a warrant is not
 generally permitted. Under the Buhari regime police and
 members of the Nigerian Security Organization occasionally
 entered homes and offices without a warrant when seeking
 evidence in corruption cases. There is no political
 enforcement of social, cultural, or religious codes.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The modified Nigerian Constitution continues to guarantee
 freedom of expression and press. There was no evidence of
 overt government censorship of the media in 1986, and
 President Qabangida granted a full pardon to two journalists
 who had each spent I year in jail for conviction under an
 abrogated 1984 decree that curtailed freedom to publish
 information about government officials. Nevertheless,
 government officials did appeal to journalists on several
 occasions to be responsible in practicing their profession.
 In at least two instances, the Government moved against
 journalists considered to have overstepped government bounds.
 In February a judicial panel charged and convicted a journalist
 of contempt of court for writing a news magazine article
 critical of the panel for its controversial ruling exonerating
 former President Shehu Shagari and Vice President Alex Ekwueme
 of wrong-doing and recommending their immediate release from
 detention. The journalist appealed the conviction. A radio
 journalist was detained briefly after making an erroneous
 broadcast that the Voice of America had reported that Nigeria
 was about to accept an International Monetary Fund loan, a
 controversial domestic political issue.
 The 1979 Constitution reserves to the Federal and state
 governments the right to own and operate radio and television
 stations. Nigeria has a lively press, and there are no
 restrictions on ownership of print media. Among the vast
 array of Nigerian daily newspapers are four privately owned
 national dailies with large circulations, one daily owned by
 the Federal Government, and another in which the Federal
 Government owns a majority share. Some states operate their
 own daily newspapers. In some states, privately owned dailies
 compete with state papers. Four weekly news magazines vie for
 national readership.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution guarantees the right to peaceful
 assembly and association in trade unions and special interest
 associations. The provision granting persons the right to
 form or join political parties remains suspended. Decree 9 of
 
 
 230
 NIGERIA
 1984, still in force, dissolves all political parties and
 authorizes the Government to dissolve any other group
 considered to have objectives similar to those of a political
 party. Frequently during 1986, government officials reminded
 former politicians publicly that the ban on political activity
 and organizing remains in effect. In June President Babangida
 announced the exclusion of former political figures from
 participation in partisan politics for a period of 10 years
 from the resumption of political activity. All former national
 and state elected and appointed government officials and
 political party leaders from the 1979-1983 civilian era are
 expected to be affected by the ban, although the Government
 has already exempted one politician from the ban and indicated
 that there may be other exceptions.
 In January the Government lifted bans on the Nigerian Medical
 Association (NMA), the National Association of Residential
 Doctors (NARD) and the National Union of Nigerian Students
 (NUNS), an organization virtually supplanted during its 6-year
 proscription by the Nati6nal Association of Nigerian Students
 (NANS).
 In June more than 20 institutions of higher education were
 closed, and NANS was banned, in the wake of nationwide campus
 demonstrations protesting the police killing of students during
 student disturbances at Ahmadu Bello University in May. The
 Government publicly stated that four persons died during those
 disturbances. Accusations by the media that fatalities were
 higher and that police abuses took place at Ahmadu Bello
 University are unconfirmed. Following the events, members of
 the mobile police unit which responded to the disturbances
 were charged with culpable homicide and suspended pending an
 investigation into their conduct. The results of the
 investigation have not been made public. In December the
 Minister of Education lifted a ban, in effect since June, on
 student organizing on individual campuses.
 Despite guarantees in the 1979 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 28 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, there are instances where government decrees and
 policy continue to act to restrict labor freedoms. A 1978
 decree created a single central labor body, the Nigeria Labour
 Congress (NLC), forcibly merged a number of unions into
 42 industrial unions, and deregistered all other unions. The
 Government has not responded to the 1982 ILO committee of
 experts finding that this decree violates ILO Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize,
 to which Nigeria is a party. The 1978 decree also created
 senior staff associations for white collar workers, which a
 1986 decree explicitly excluded from NLC membership, forcing
 two such associations to withdraw. Since 1975 government
 policy has permitted international labor affiliation only with
 the ILO and the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 its affiliated Pan-African Labor Federations. In May the
 Government prevented the African regional meeting of the
 International Transport Worker's Federation (ITWF), an
 affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, from taking place in Lagos on grounds that the
 membership of the local host union in the ITWF violated
 government policy. Government policy does permit, however,
 informal "fraternal relations" with foreign unions and
 secretariats as long as there is no formal affiliation.
 Although Nigeria's union leadership generally has been
 democratically elected and independent of government control,
 
 
 231
 NIGERIA
 an exception occurred in October when the Government gave
 state-appointed administrators temporary control of two unions
 paralyzed by leadership disputes. The Government cited as its
 authority the 1985 National Economic Emergency Decree which
 granted the Government broad authority until December 1986 over
 labor matters. Nigerian law and practice provide that the
 terms and conditions of labor will be determined by collective
 bargaining agreements between management and trade unions.
 However, a national wage freeze imposed in 1984 remains in
 effect. Wage cuts imposed by decree in 1985 on all public and
 private sector employees, without regard to preexisting
 contracts or union consultation requirements, to finance a
 National Economic Recovery Fund were lifted in October. Some
 categories of low-paid workers received a full refund of their
 mandatory contribution.
 The 1976 Trade Disputes Decree, which governs industrial
 disputes, provides for mediation by an industrial arbitration
 panel and a national industrial court and forbids strikes and
 lockouts while disputes are under mediation by these bodies.
 Although this decree has been applied in past disputes, it has
 not always had the intended effect of curtailing strike
 activity, as workers have often ignored it, and the Government
 has not always enforced it. Workstoppages, numbering up to
 several hundred a year during the 1979-1983 civilian era, were
 rare in 1985 and 1986, reflecting both the weakened bargaining
 position of unions because of depressed economic conditions
 and the impact of warnings by the military Government that it
 would not tolerate "industrial indiscipline."
 All Nigerian workers 16 years or older may join trade unions,
 with the exception of members of the armed forces and
 designated employees in the essential government services
 sector. Employers are obliged to recognize trade unions and
 must pay a dues checkoff for employees who are members of a
 registered trade union. Nevertheless, some unions, especially
 small ones, are in serious financial difficulty following 4
 years of depressed economic conditions. The establishment of
 closed shops is prohibited.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of religious
 belief, religious practice, and religious education are
 generally respected throughout Nigeria. Reports continue
 of harassment of Christians by state officials in the
 predominately Muslim North through the imposition of excessive
 bureaucratic requirements for church construction projects and
 occasional refusal of permission to build. There are no
 restrictions on numbers of clergy trained nor on contacts with
 coreligionists in other countries. Religious travel, including
 the Hajj, is permitted and in some cases officially supported.
 Missionaries and foreign clergy, though limited by quotas, are
 permitted to enter Nigeria. Some states require licenses for
 religious services outside churches and mosques.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities of
 Nigeria surfaced in January when Nigeria became a member of
 the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Christians,
 who comprise an estimated one-third of Nigeria's population,
 charged that the move contravened a constitutional provision
 declaring Nigeria a secular state and demanded Nigeria's
 complete withdrawal from the organization. Muslims, who
 comprise about 45 percent of the population, argued that
 
 
 232
 NIGERIA
 Nigeria, with the largest Muslim population in black Africa,
 should be a member of the organization and denied that
 membership made Nigeria an Islamic state. Government promises
 to retain Nigeria's multireligious character and the secular
 status guaranteed by the Constitution failed to assuage
 Christian fears, but Nigeria did not participate in any OIC
 activities during the year. At the height of the tensions, in
 a city with a large proportion of both Christians and Muslims,
 Muslim blockage of an Easter procession of Christian worshipers
 resulted in violence that left several persons injured and one
 church damaged. The Government has proposed the formation of a
 council on religious affairs to "regulate" religious matters.
 Christian leaders oppose the idea of a council with regulatory
 authority.
 The 1982 ban on the Maitatsine religious sect remains in
 effect. The group still exists, however, and is apparently
 being closely monitored by the police. Police sporadically
 announced arrests of "religious fanatics", probably references
 to suspected members of the sect. Members of the group
 arrested following the 1984 Maitatsine uprising in Gongola
 State are still in custody. They may remain so indefinitely,
 according to newspaper reports quoting the state's Attorney
 General, for lack of witnesses willing to testify against them
 in court. More than 100 have reportedly died of hunger and
 malnutrition since their arrest.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles citizens to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside where they wish. The same
 provision prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the denial of
 entry to or exit from Nigeria to any citizen. In general,
 these provision have been observed. In April police announced
 the restriction of public office holders from the civilian era
 (1979-1983) to their states of origin or domicile and required
 them to report to police commissioners within 24 hours,
 surrender their passports and other travel documents, and
 thereafter report to the police each Monday. Although a
 number of former politicians complied with the order, others
 did not, apparently without retribution. The order, which was
 intended to control movements of former public officials
 pending the outcome of on-going investigations, may have
 become irrelevant in light of the July publication of the
 government white papers disposing of the cases under review by
 judicial panels.
 Nigeria's land borders, closed since April 1984, were opened
 in March. The Government announced in September that passport
 validity will revert from 2 to 5 years. Nigerians travel
 abroad in large numbers, and many thousands are studying
 abroad. Exit visas are not required.
 There has been no forced resettlement of Nigerian citizens.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria supports and cooperates with the the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees who has an office in Lagos. No
 known penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have
 emigrated, settled abroad, or acquired another nationality.
 However, Nigeria does not recognize dual nationality, and
 naturalization in another country does not release Nigerians
 from Nigerian laws.
 
 
 233
 NIGERIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC), a 28-member group of
 military officers headed by President Babangida, is the highest
 political authority in Nigeria and the principal decisionmaking
 body in the Government. There is no elected legislative body,
 and political parties are prohibited. The AFRC promulgates all
 laws by decree, and all decrees are exempt from challenge in
 any court of law. The President appoints a Federal Cabinet,
 currently composed of 22 military and civilian ministers in
 almost equal numbers, which presides over the executive
 departments and comprises the Council of Ministers. Military
 governors head the 19 state governments. Together with the
 President, the 19 state governors constitute a National
 Council of States.
 President Babangida has set 1990 as the date for returning
 Nigeria to civilian rule. Although no formal political
 structures exist to allow popular input into government
 decisionmaking, Babangida has encouraged the public to become
 involved in deciding what form the next civilian government
 should take. In January the President appointed a 19-person
 political bureau to organize and implement a nationwide debate
 on Nigeria's political future and to synthesize public
 commentary into recommendations for him by the end of the year.
 Like the public debate in 1985 over acceptability of an
 International Monetary Fund stabilization loan, the 1986 debate
 on Nigeria's political future was conducted in the media, in
 the forums of professional organizations, and in written
 testimony provided directly to the political bureau by a wide
 range of persons, including university professors, businessmen,
 religious leaders, and former politicians.
 The composition of the current Government reflects greater
 ethnic and religious diversity than any government in the
 recent past. However, there are currently no women on the
 AFRC or in the Federal Cabinet, although some women serve as
 commissioners in state governments.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Babangida Government has pledged that it will uphold basic
 human rights. The Human Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar
 Association (NBA) monitors the domestic human rights situation
 and has consistently spoken out against human rights abuses.
 The NBA objected strongly to the Government's move to extend
 its detention powers, and the Government rescinded the decree
 in question. At least two other groups also monitor human
 rights in Nigeria. One, the Nigerian Council of Human Rights,
 an independent organization formed in 1985, issued a statement
 commending the Government for amending 1984 decrees but called
 for repeal of the decree allowing detention without trial.
 Another group, Citizens for Human Rights, commended the
 Babangida Government for its human rights record. The
 Government has taken no measures against these organizations
 or their individual members for their watchdog activities.
 The former chairman of the NBA human rights committee continues
 to hold the post of Attorney General and Minister of Justice.
 Nigeria hosted two recent international human rights
 conferences, including the Pan African Conference on Human
 Rights and Africa's Cultural Heritage in September. Speakers
 
 
 234
 NIGERIA
 included Nigeria's former Head of State General Yakubu Gowon,
 who returned from self-exile in the United Kingdom to
 participate. Amnesty International maintains an office in
 Lagos and circulates a monthly newsletter. Its annual human
 rights reports receive press attention.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status,
 There is no official policy of systematic discrimination among
 Nigeria's diverse ethnic and religious groups, and laws do not
 overtly favor one group over another. The Government generally
 makes a conscious effort to strike a balance among different
 groups in its decisionmaking and in appointments to key
 governmental positions. However, Nigeria has a long history
 of tension among the diverse ethnic groups, and tradition
 continues to impose considerable pressure on individual
 government officials to favor their own ethnic or religious
 group. Allegations of favoritism persist.
 Women have always had economic power and have exerted influence
 in Nigerian society through women's councils or through their
 family connections. There has been a dramatic increase in the
 number of women who have university degrees and who have become
 professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior government officials, media figures, and business
 executives. But despite a degree of economic independence,
 women suffer legal discrimination, experience social
 inferiority, have virtually no representation in the political
 arena, and despite their achievements, are often discriminated
 against in employment. The pattern and specific features of
 discrimination against women vary according to the ethnic and
 religious diversity of Nigeria's vast population. In some
 states, husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining
 employment or passports. In many states, a widow cannot
 inherit her husband's property, which in the absence of
 children usually reverts to the husband's family. Women do
 not receive equal pay for equal work, and male professionals
 receive fringe benefits not extended to their female
 counterparts. Female circumcision, which has never become a
 major public issue, is still practiced in many areas.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Nigeria's 1974 labor decree establishes a 40-hour work week,
 prescribes 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and sets a minimum
 wage for commerce and industry of 125 naira per month, equal
 to about $40 after the September devaluation. The labor law
 prohibits employment of children under 15 in commerce and
 industry, restricts other child labor to home-based
 agricultural or domestic work, and allows the apprenticeship
 of youths aged 13-15 only under specified conditions. It
 contains general health and safety provisions, some aimed
 specifically at young and female workers, enforceable by the
 Ministry of Employment, Labour, and Productivity. Employers
 must compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of
 those fatally injured in industrial accidents.
