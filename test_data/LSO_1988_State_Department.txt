 LESOTHO
 Since a 1986 coup, a Six-member Military Council, led by Major
 General J. M. Lekhanya, has ruled Lesotho. The Military
 Council formally conferred all legislative and executive power
 on Moshoeshoe II, the previously powerless King of Lesotho.
 The Military Council and the King rule by decree; however, an
 appointed Council of Ministers, which includes civilians,
 administers the day-to-day operations of government. During
 1988 the military regime continued its ban on "political
 activity," giving no indication when Lesotho might revert to
 constitutional rule, which was abolished by former prime
 minister Jonathan in 1970.
 The Lesotho Paramilitary Force (LPF) of about 2,000 troops is
 responsible for internal and external security. The LPF is
 assisted by a small police force. Public security
 deteriorated in 1988 with the outbreak of widespread criminal
 activity and with many reports of police indiscipline and
 abuses of authority.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on its neighbor for
 trade, finance, employment, and access to the outside world.
 About half of the male labor force is employed in South
 Africa's mines, and remittances from workers (more than $150
 million annually) are a critical factor in the economy,
 especially in financing imports. Lesotho is also a member of
 the Southern African Customs Union which groups together
 Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa in a common
 tariff union and free trade zone. The South African currency
 circulates freely in Lesotho and is on a par with the local
 currency as a result of Lesotho's membership in the rand
 monetary area. With South African assistance, the gigantic
 ($2 billion) hydroelectric Lesotho Highlands Water Project
 finally moved toward the implementation stage in 1988.
 In 1988 human rights continued to be tightly circumscribed
 under the military Government. In a possibly significant
 breakthrough, Ntsu Mokhehle, the aging exiled leader of the
 Basotho Congress Party (BCP), returned to Lesotho for the
 first time in more than 14 years for direct talks with the
 Government about conditions for national reconciliation.
 While no settlement was reached, Mokhehle and the Government
 pledged to continue the dialog. In February the Government
 imposed a State of Emergency (SOE) due to a dramatic increase
 in often violent criminal activity, including armed robberies
 and cattle rustling. It was renewed in August for another 6
 months. The SOE gave the police broad powers of arrest,
 search, and seizure without a warrant. It also contained an
 indemnity clause to shield the police against legal action
 brought against them for actions taken under the emergency
 regulations. The Government used its new powers forcefully to
 crack down on criminal activity, and in the process reportedly
 arrested a number of persons and sometimes used excessive
 force in interrogating suspects. Lesotho's judiciary remained
 vigorous, and the High Court annulled the SOE in April on a
 procedural technicality. (The Government quickly removed the
 technicality and reinstituted the SOE on April 29.) There
 were several unexplained killings with political implications
 of persons in police custody in 1988. The Government took no
 known disciplinary action against law enforcement officials
 for illegal acts under the emergency regulations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killings
 A government investigation failed to identify the perpetrators
 or provide details of the brutal 1986 murders of former
 Ministers of Information and Foreign Affairs, Desmond Sixishe
 and Vincent Makhele and their wives. Similarly, there were no
 further revelations concerning the deaths in March 1986 of two
 senior Royal Lesotho Defense Force officers who had opposed
 the coup and who subsequently died while in official custody
 on charges related to events during the 1986 coup. Inquest
 reports, dated November 25, 1986, concluded that the two
 officers died from injuries sustained while in custody,
 including in one case severe burns to the victim's body. The
 Maseru Magistrate Court indicated, however, that it was unable
 to identify the person or persons responsible for these acts.
 A reputed member of the African National Congress (ANC),
 Mazizi Maqekeza, was shot and killed in his hospital bed on
 March 15 while undergoing treatment for a wound he sustained
 in a February 25 shootout with Lesotho police. The motives
 and identity of the killer were not determined, although South
 African involvement was suspected. Another suspected ANC
 member was killed in the February shootout.
 Samuel Nhlapho, one of four hijackers of a bus carrying 71
 passengers, including Catholic nuns and children, was captured
 by police following a bloody shootout which also involved
 South African commandos and Lesotho security forces. The
 captured hijacker, who was allegedly a member of a renegade
 faction of the Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), the military
 wing of the BCP, died while in official custody. His three
 accomplices and two hostages were killed in an exchange of
 fire when the bus was stormed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 The State of Emergency gave the police extensive powers of
 arrest, search, and seizure without a warrant, and led to a
 reputed decline in police discipline. The police exercised
 these powers arbitrarily in some cases. In particular, there
 were frequent reports of beatings and harsh interrogation of
 suspects during the period of heightened criminal activities,
 which peaked in July.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During the SOE, established procedures remained in effect for
 normal civil and some criminal cases, including the right of a
 detainee to an early determination of the legality of his
 detention. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as
 amended in 1984, makes provision for the granting of bail.
 Under the Act, the High Court is the only judicial body
 empowered to grant bail in cases of armed robbery or suspected
 homicide.
 
 
 171
 LESOTHO
 SOE regulations superseded the Criminal Procedures and
 Evidence Act in certain categories of crime. Specifically,
 the SOE listed armed robbery, burglary, car theft, and
 livestock theft as offenses against which emergency powers
 were directed. Under emergency regulations, police can arrest
 and detain a suspect without warrant or charge up to 14 days.
 They may also conduct searches and seize suspected stolen
 goods without a warrant. On his written order, the Minister
 of Defense and Internal Security may detain a suspect
 indefinitely without trial. The security authorities used SOE
 powers widely to arrest and interrogate criminal suspects.
 In political cases, the Internal Security (general) Act of
 1984 applies. This Act-provides for preventive detention
 without charge or trial for up to 42 days (the first 14 days
 on order of the police; the second 14 days on order of the
 police commissioner; and the final 14 days only on order of a
 government Minister). Detainees may be held incommunicado for
 up to 14 days. During the second stage of the detention,
 ministerially appointed "advisors" (all government employees
 to date) report on the health of the detainee, investigate
 whether the detainee has been involved in subversive
 activities, and advise the Minister of Defense and Internal
 Security on the need for continued detention. Detainees under
 the Act may make representations on their own treatment only
 through the advisor. The 1984 Internal Security Act also
 allows for detention of witnesses in security cases.
 At the end of 1988, there were no known political prisoners in
 Lesotho. Despite the broad provisions of SOE regulations and
 the Internal Security Act, cases of detention for political
 purposes were rare. Since enactment of the SOE in February,
 only a handful of detention orders (only six are known) were
 issued, and these were successfully challenged in court,
 normally within a day or two. None was issued by the Minister
 of Internal Security, under either the Internal Security Act
 or the SOE.
 The military Government's general amnesty for exiled Basotho
 remained in effect. An unspecified number of exiles returned
 in 1988, but significant numbers remained outside the country,
 primarily in South Africa. The Government publicly declared
 that all Basotho citizens are free to return without fear of
 retaliation for past activities, and it reportedly gave this
 assurance to Ntsu Mokhehle during May 20 discussions in
 Maseru. At the end of 1988, negotiations between Mokhehle and
 the Government were continuing over precise conditions, which
 from the government side included the demand that Mokhehle and
 his exiled supporters not engage in politics. Religious
 leaders, reflecting a public desire for national
 reconciliation, became deeply involved in the negotiations
 (see Section 2.c.).
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary consists of a Court of Appeal, the High Court,
 magistrate courts, and customary or traditional courts which
 exist largely in rural areas to administer customary tribal
 laws. The courts have acted to limit infringements of law on
 numerous occasions in past years, as in the case of its April
 15 annulment of the State of Emergency on procedural grounds.
 Court decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel and public trial.
 
 
 172
 LESOTHO
 Under the system of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there
 is no trial by jury. Members of the High Court serve in an
 advisory capacity to military tribunals and provide guidance
 on questions of legal procedure and substance. This service
 is available to both prosecutors and the accused.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both State of Emergency regulations and the Internal Security
 Act provide police with wide powers to stop and search persons
 and vehicles and to enter homes or other places for a similar
 purpose without a warrant.  In general, the military
 Government has had a better record of respect for these
 individua.l rights than the previous civilian regime. In 1988,
 however, there were increased numbers of violations of
 individual privacy by state authorities, according to local
 opposition press reports. Lesotho's most celebrated case of
 1988 involved alleged police raids on the homes of two local
 businessmen and their legal counsel suspected of SOE
 violations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of
 expression but subordinates this freedom to the protection of
 national security. Following the January 1986 coup, a formal
 ban-on politics was announced. This placed stringent
 restrictions on freedom of speech and political assembly. In
 particular, government edict no. 4 prohibits individuals and
 groups from making political speeches and from publishing or
 distributing political party materials. In spite of this ban,
 numerous persons met privately to discuss politics, and
 leaders of Lesotho's five principal political parties made
 joint public statements in 1988 criticizing the military
 Government and calling for an immediate restoration of
 civilian rule, including if necessary with outside
 intervention in Lesotho's domestic affairs. Municipal
 elections will be held in January 1989 and may provide an
 indication of how smoothly Lesotho can return to civilian
 rule. The military Government made no attempt in 1988 to
 inhibit such political discussion, and there were no known
 reprisals.
 Opposition viewpoints were routinely expressed in two
 Sesotho-language weekly newspapers published by the Roman
 Catholic Church and the Lesotho Evangelical Church, but the
 editor of the Mirror Newspaper, reportedly a South African
 national, was deported in December. A new privately owned
 English language newspaper started publication in 1988 and was
 very critical of the Government. The Government controls the
 official media (one radio station and a weekly newspaper) and
 ensures that they faithfully reflect government views.
 However, the Government rarely used them to attack its critics.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Government's ban on "politics" was not
 interpreted to require the dissolution of existing political
 parties, but the ban does preclude political meetings and
 rallies. Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups
 continued to hold regular meetings.
 
 
 173.
 
 LESOTHO
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open
 religious practice is permitted and even encouraged.
 Christianity is the dominant faith of the majority of Basotho,
 with the principal denomination being Roman Catholic. There
 is a significant Protestant minority as well, which is
 composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the Anglican
 Church, and a number of other smaller denominations.
 Conversion is permitted, and there is no apparent social or
 political benefit or stigma attached to belonging to any
 particular church. There are no bars on missionary activity
 or work by foreign clergy. Churches play a large role in the
 administration of Lesotho's primary and secondary education
 system and are responsible for the day-to-day operation of
 most schools. In 1988 there was disagreement between the
 Government and the major churches over the exclusionary
 admissions policies of certain parochial schools.
 Most church groups support the military Government's call for
 national reconciliation, and religious leaders from the major
 denominations have been outspoken in asking the Government to
 redouble its efforts to reintegrate Ntsu Mokhehle and his
 exiled LLA into the country's political life. Church leaders
 are also determined to participate directly in the
 reconciliation efforts, but the Government has increasingly
 resisted church involvement in the process--presumably because
 some of the church leaders often supported Mokhehle's
 positions--and in May the Government suspended its 2-year
 dialog with religious leaders on this political issue.  it
 called on church leaders to patch up their own differences
 before the church-state dialog could be resumed. The
 Government briefly detained several church leaders at the
 border in October on their return from South Africa where
 allegedly they had met with Mokhehle.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the
 country and across national boundaries, although the
 Government does not hesitate to restrict passports in
 political cases, as in the case of a trade union official in
 1987 (see Section 6.a.).
 The refugee flow from South Africa slowed markedly in 1988 to
 only a few refugees per month. These persons have been
 accorded fair treatment, in line with Lesotho's international
 obligations. Those refugees affiliated with South African
 liberation groups are given expeditious transit to third
 countries for resettiement. Some 350 refugees without such
 affiliation have been allowed to resettle in Lesotho.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Basotho people currently do not have the freedom to
 replace the existing regime, nor do they play an active role
 in the qoverntng process. The military Government, which
 assumed powet in January 1986, announced that it intends to
 Eemd,j n place intLl a process of national reconciliation is
 
 
 174
 LESOTHO
 completed. No time frame for this process has been announced,
 nor has any schedule been set for return to civilian rule,
 elections, or constitutional revision. In contrast to the
 past, there was very little discussion in 1988 of an elected
 national council as a first step toward constitutional
 government, but the Government has begun a process of local
 elections starting with the Maseru district elections in
 January 1989.
 The highest ranking woman in the Government is the Minister of
 State for Youth and Women's Affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been unresponsive on human rights matters.
 It ignored the call in April by representatives of Lesotho's
 five political opposition parties for Amnesty International,
 the Organization of African Unity, and certain members of the
 British Commonwealth to investigate alleged human rights
 violations under the SOE. The opposition call was made
 following the High Court's aorogation of the SOE on the basis
 that it was not promulgated according to established legal
 procedures.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social status
 Most citizens of the Basotho nation speak a common language
 and share a common historical and cultural tradition.
 Nonindigenous citizens have generally married into the Basotho
 ethnic group, which tends to be inclusive and assimilative in
 character. Expatriate communities are small and not
 considered to be a major factor in the country's political
 life. Asians (primarily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and white
 South Africans are active in the country's commercial sector
 and are less favored than Basotho nationals. The military
 Government has announced a policy aimed at "indigenization" of
 the country's retail commercial sector and has called upon
 expatriate owners to transfer their businesses to Basotho
 nationals. It is unclear whether this transfer would involve
 compensation. Exiles from South Africa have from time to time
 encountered some discrimination, since they are often viewed
 as magnets for real or imagined South African political or
 armed intervention.
 The Government has not yet seriously addressed the issue of
 women's rights. In Lesotho these rights are limited by law
 and custom, including in the areas of property and contracts.
 For example, a married woman cannot apply for a loan without
 her husband's written consent. Despite their secondary
 status, women in Lesotho traditionally have been the
 stabilizing force in the home and in the agricultural sector,
 given the absence of over 100,000 Basotho men who work in
 South Africa. More female than male children complete primary
 and secondary schools. Women are strongly represented in all
 professions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lesotho is a party to the 1948 International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Convention on Freedom of Association and
 
 
 LESOTHO
 has also adopted most other ILO conventions dealing with
 worker rights. The imposition of the SOE in 1988 did not
 affect worker or trade union rights.
 The previous Government supported the formation of a new
 umbrella trade union confederation. Subsequently, 24 of
 Lesotho's 28 independent trade unions formed the Lesotho
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (LCFTU) which held its
 first convention in May 1985. The military Government
 supported non-LCFTU unions in the formation of another
 federation, the Lesotho Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU). In
 1987 the military Government designated the LFTU, the much
 smaller federation, to represent Lesotho at the ILO annual
 conference in Geneva.
 The problem of which union should represent Lesotho at
 international labor conferences--the LCFTU or the
 LFTU--surfaced again in 1988. After its proposal for
 rotational representation was rejected, the Government decided
 that neither federation would be allowed to represent workers
 at the 1988 ILO conference. Since then the Government has
 pressed for accommodation between the two rival federations to
 form a single national labor confederation. Results of this
 effort remained unclear at the end of the year.
 While a legal right to strike exists for workers in
 nonessential services, in practice the procedure for calling a
 strike is so lengthy and cumbersome that it discourages legal
 strike actions and accounts for the prevalence of wildcat
 strikes. The 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Law
 enumerates lengthy procedures which must be followed before a
 strike is called. The last general strike was in 1961. There
 were several wildcat strikes in 1987 and 1988 against foreign,
 export-oriented companies linked to the Lesotho National
 Development Corporation (LNDC) over minimum wage rates. These
 strikes normally ended in compromise and were generally of
 short duration. The latest wildcat strike took place in
 September. There was a subsequent wildcat strike at the
 Lesotho flour mills, a state-owned corporation, during which
 more than 300 employees were dismissed. The Government
 declared the strike illegal and instructed workers and
 management to engage in negotiations which resulted in a 5
 percent wage increase for workers.
 The LCFTU is a member of the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordination Council, the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Lesotho authorities confiscated the passport of LCFTU
 Secretary General Simon Jonathan in June 1987 when he returned
 from the ILO conference where he challenged the credentials of
 the government-appointed labor representatives to the ILO
 annual meeting. The Government's prohibition on Jonathan's
 travel ended in March, and he is now free to travel abroad.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize and
 bargain collectively These rights were established in the
 1964 Act and in the 1967 Employment Act, as amended in 1977.
 There is also an unfair labor practices tribunal whose mandate
 is to investigate unfair labor practices and safeguard worker
 rights. A government-appointed labor commission is also
 charged with, inter alia, monitoring wage and working
 conditions, and accepting, reviewing, and investigating worker
 complaints. Efforts are now underway, with assistance from
 
 
 176
 LESOTHO
 the ILO, to reform Lesotho's outdated industrial relations
 system. Lesotho has several industrial estates grouping
 together companies, mostly textile and apparel firms, engaged
 in manufacturing for export. There are no prohibitions
 against organized labor in these export zones, and labor laws
 are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibitions of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There are no forced or compulsory labor practices in Lesotho.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.
 Sixteen is the legal minimum age for employment. In practice,
 however, children under 16 may be employed in family-owned
 businesses. There are prohibitions against the employment of
 working age minors in commercial, industrial, or nonfamily
 enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working
 conditions. Basotho minors under 18 years may not be
 recruited for employment outside of Lesotho.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Roughly 60 percent of Lesotho's active male labor force works
 in the Republic of South Africa, mainly in gold and coal
 mines. At least 70 percent of the remainder are engaged in
 traditional agriculture. The rest are employed mainly by the
 Government and in small industries in Lesotho. A majority of
 Basotho mineworkers are members of the South African National
 Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Because the NUM is an
 extraterritorial worker organization, it is not permitted to
 engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 Lesotho's 1967 Employment Act spells out basic worker rights,
 including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest period of least 24
 hours, 11 to 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for public
 holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate light,
 ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees, and to
 install and maintain machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. In practice, these regulations are generally followed
 only within the wage economy. Enforcement mechanisms,
 however, are weak. With help from the ILO, the Government is
 in the process of revising its national occupational and
 health safety standards.
 Wages in Lesotho are extremely low. The Government sets
 minimum wages for various types of work, ranging from $48 a
 month for light unskilled labor to $93 dollars a month for
 semiskilled jobs, both well below the poverty line of about
 $146 per month. The present wage schedule was established by
 a tripartite wages advisory board in 1987 as an interim
 measure. Government salaries were increased in 1988, and
 there are growing pressures for an increase in minimum wages.
 Many employers in Lesotho now pay more than minimum wages in
 an effort to attract and retain motivated employees.
 In the nation's traditional society, life and working
 conditions for the country's young "herdboys" tend to be much
 more rigorous and demanding than conditions in the modern
 sector. Their quasi-pastoral life, however, is considered a
 prerequisite to eventual manhood and is a fundamental feature
 of Sotho life, tradition, and culture.
