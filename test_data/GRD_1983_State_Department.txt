 GRENADA
 During calendar year 1983, Grenada saw three phases of
 government: the People's Revolutionary Government of Maurice
 Bishop, the anarchic period of the Coard-Austin coup, and the
 interim government formed by Governor-General Paul Scoon.
 Like other former British colonies in the Eastern Caribbean,
 Grenada adopted a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy at
 the time of independence in 1974. Sir Eric Gairy, the first
 Prime Minister, was accused by his opponents of personal
 corruption, of rigging the 1976 elections, and of using his
 .police auxiliary" force, the "Mongoose Gang," to intimidate the
 opposition by violence. As a result of these abuses, many
 Grenadians welcomed the 1979 coup led by Bishop. The coup was
 the first nonconstitutional change of government in the
 Commonwealth Caribbean.
 Despite promises by the Bishop regime for an early return to the
 parliamentary system, to hold elections, and to uphold human
 rights, his Government did not fulfill these commitments. In
 1981, Freedom House included Grenada among those countries which
 had registered "significant declines in freedom." In its 1982
 report, Freedom House characterized Grenada as "not free."
 Shortly after taking power, the Government suspended the
 1974 Constitution and imprisoned certain former government
 officials, leaders of rival opposition parties and many ordinary
 citizens considered a threat to the revolution. Many of the
 former prisoners have described incidents of torture, brutality,
 and inhumane conditions while they were in prison. One hundred
 and three political prisoners are believed to have been in
 custody on October 25, 1983. Prior to the arrival of the
 multinational peacekeeping forces on that date, the Government
 had admitted holding only 78.
 Prime Minister Bishop justified the continued detention of
 political prisoners by arguing that "every revolution creates
 dislocation." The Government also curtailed press freedom by
 closing the only independent pre-coup newspaper, as well as two
 other journals following the publication of their first issues.
 Long-smouldering dissension between hardliners and more moderate
 Marxist-Leninists within the People's Revolutionary Government
 broke into the open in September, when Bishop was stripped of
 most of his substantive powers by the Central Committee of his
 party, the New Jewel Movement. In mid-October, Maurice Bishop
 was put under house arrest. Cn October 19, he was freed by a
 large crowd of supporters and escorted to People's Revolutionary
 Army headquarters at Fort Rupert. In response to this effort to
 reverse the coup against Bishop, an armored personnel carrier and
 soldiers with automatic rifles fired indiscriminately on the
 crowd, killing an unknown number of-people and wounding many
 more. Bishop and several others were detained and taken inside
 Fort Rupert, where he and three other Revolutionary Government
 ministers were murdered.
 A new group, the Revolutionary Military Council, under the
 titular leadership of Revolutionary Army Commander General Hudson
 Austin, abolished the Revolutionary Government and declared a
 four and a half day long, 24-hour island-wide curfew with
 violators "to be shot on sight." The airport was closed, and
 communications with the outside world were cut off.

 567
 In the midst of these events, Governor-General Sir Paul Scoon,
 the legal head of state of Grenada, sent a secret message to the
 heads of government of the other island states appealing for
 help. The six other members of the Organization of Eastern
 Caribbean States -- the regional Eastern Caribbean economic and
 security organization of which Grenada was a member -- invoked
 the security provisions of the 1981 agreement establishing the
 Organization, and called on Barbados, Jamaica, and the United
 States for assistance.
 U.S. and Caribbean military forces landed on the island on
 October 25. After a brief period of combat, Austin and his
 leading supporters were detained. The one hundred and three
 political prisoners, some held since the coup of March 13, 1979,
 were released. Secret military agreements between Grenada, the
 Soviet Union, Cuba, and North Korea were discovered, as well as a
 huge cache of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies on
 the island, far beyond what would be needed for self-defense.
 Grenadian public response to the peacekeeping force was
 overwhelmingly favorable.
 On November 15, the Governor-General appointed an Advisory
 Council to serve as an interim government until elections could
 be held. When naming the Advisory Council, the Governor-General
 described it as a nonpolitical body with responsibility to
 prepare for democratic elections and to provide policy guidance
 to government ministries. The interim government also has the
 task of starting the process of rebuilding the economy, the civil
 service, the police force, and the educational system. The
 Governor-General and the Advisory Council have expressed their
 intention to schedule elections as soon as possible, allowing
 sufficient time for new candidates to emerge and to develop
 organizations to fill the vacuum created by several years in
 which there had been no democratic political activity. A
 Supervisor of Elections has been appointed and voter registration
 has been announced for March-May 1984 with elections expected by
 the end of the year. The 1974 Constitution has been restored.
 Grenada remains a member of the CARICOM economic/trading
 community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the OAS,
 and the U.N.
 In its first ordinance, the interim administration lifted the
 state of emergency and created an Advisory Tribunal to review the
 cases of persons under detention. The ordinance also stated
 that, except for cases that would "endanger public safety",
 detainees must be released or formally detained within 72 hours
 of being apprehended. The Tribunal reviewed the cases of all
 detainees, concluding that some 39 prisoners fell under the terms
 of the new ordinance and should continue in detention. These
 include Bernard Coard and General Austin. Additional measures
 assure that detainees have access to counsel and are held under
 safe conditions in accordance with the guarantees of the 1974
 constitution.
 The Grenadian authorities emphasized their commitment to
 human rights and the rule of law. The interim Government, among
 its earliest actions, assumed responsibility for the security
 detainees, and reinstated the 1974 Constitution, with its
 protections of civil rights, religious freedom, and a free
 press. The interim Government's first ordinance created special
 commissions to advise the Government on reform in the civil
 service, including police and prisons; organizing for democratic
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 37
 
 
 568
 national elections; and procedures for trying the security
 detainees. The interim Government has said that it has a firm
 commitment to due process and fair, public trials for the
 security detainees. Revival of some political activity is
 evident pending full reestablishment of governmental and social
 institutions. Former Prime Minister Eric Gairy returned to
 Grenada on January 21, 1984, and the New Jewel Movement, Bishop's
 party, opened an office on the same date.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 As noted above in discussing the chronology of recent events,
 former Prime Minister Bishop, three other ministers (Whiteman,
 Creft, and Bain) and two prominent labor leaders were summarily
 executed by the Revolutionary Army on October 19, 1983 at Fort
 Rupert. It is still not known how many other Grenadian citizens
 were killed in that incident, when Revolutionary Army personnel
 fired on a large crowd of Bishop supporters and others jumped
 over the high wall of Fort Rupert to avoid being shot. Estimates
 vary widely between 17 and 70. The interim Government plans to
 appoint a tribunal to investigate the events of October 19.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there are no reports of disappearances, temporary or
 permanent detentions were rarely acknowledged by the
 Revolutionary Government. In mid-1983 a Government legal
 official admitted to only 78 persons being detained at Richmond
 Hill prison for security reasons without charges. Following the
 October 25 landing, however, a total of 103 political prisoners
 were believed freed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The political prisoners freed by the rescue operation have
 reported numerous instances of harsh treatment of inmates at
 Richmond Hill prison, including inadequate diet, poor sanitary
 conditions, harsh and arbitrary visitor regulations, and lengthy
 solitary confinement. Most physical and mental abuse appears to
 have occurred during arrest and initial interrogations. There is
 ample physical evidence that prisoners were also abused during
 detention. Among the prominent detainees who have provided
 details of their imprisonment are Jerome Romain, Winston Whyte,
 and Antonio Langdon. The latter has reported his experiences in
 detail.
 Antonio Langdon, a Grenadian citizen living in the United States,
 was detained as a counterrevolutionary when he visited Grenada in
 connection with settling the estate of his deceased mother.
 After his release October 26, 1983, Langdon reported in an
 interview published by the New York Times that he had been
 repeatedly beaten and kept in isolation because of his objections
 to detention and to prison conditions. On one occasion, a guard
 shot Langdon in the chest and arm, at close range, apparently as
 a consequence of his defiance. Langdon said he was treated for
 
 
 569
 his wounds in a hospital, but, while there and under the
 observation of Cuban doctors, he was further tortured by, among
 other things, the insertion of steel rods or wires into his back.
 Episcopal Archdeacon Huggins reported several other cases of
 detainees being shot, apparently for reasons of discipline or to
 extract information. He was permitted to conduct weekly services
 at Richmond Hill Prison, which enabled him to monitor treatment
 of the prisoners. Lloyd Noel, Bishop's first attorney general,
 reported that Winston Crowe, a political detainee, was shot three
 times with an AK-47 rifle in the thigh and testicles. Another
 detainee, Michael Mark, was shot in both feet with a revolver.
 Other reports of torture or abuse include that of:
 a family named Pascal, a mother and her four children, who were
 detained in 1980 and accused of giving food to
 counter-revolutionaries accused of an attack on Revolutionary
 Army personnel. They were charged under the anti-terrorism law
 but never tried. On Christmas Eve, 1980, the two teenage boys,
 Richard and Matthew, were repeatedly taken from the cell where
 the family was held and beaten unconscious.
 St. Clair Rice, a policeman under both the Gairy and Bishop
 regimes and originally a supporter of the Revolution, was
 detained in 1979 and accused of counterrevolutionary activities.
 He was held at Fort Rupert for two weeks, during which he reports
 that he was frequently tortured and severely beaten. Rice said
 that he witnessed savage beatings of other prisoners with wooden
 clubs and iron pipes and saw detainees tortured by beating their
 fingers with iron pipe until the nails came off. Rice has stated
 that a senior Revolutionary Army officer supervised the torture.
 Rice claims that at least one such incident was reported by
 friends to Maurice Bishop, who suspended the officer from duty
 for three weeks.
 Anthony Mitchell was an original member of the Jewel Movement in
 1971 and of Maurice Bishop's reorganized New Jewel Movement in
 1974. With Teddy Victor and others, he resigned in 1978 because
 of ideological disagreements. Following the 1979 revolution.
 Mitchell accepted a government position but was asked to leave
 after two weeks, again for ideological reasons. On October 15,
 1979 he was arrested with nineteen others accused of
 counterrevolutionary activity. For thirty days he was confined
 in handcuffs in a dark cell and let out only occasionally for a
 shower. Mitchell reported that he was beaten when first arrested
 but not subjected to physical torture thereafter. However, he
 was threatened and subjected to mock executions while
 blindfolded. Mitchell was released on November 16, 1982 after
 three years, without ever seeing a lawyer, prosecutor, or
 magistrate, and never having been tried.
 Questions have been raised regarding certain actions by U.S. and
 Caribbean military forces during operations. These questions
 focused on the detention camp at Point Salines. interrogations of
 Grenadian and foreign nationals, warrantless search and seizure
 of private property, and psychological warfare operations.
 The multinational U.S./Caribbean Peace Force acted in support of
 the Governor-General and under his authority. On November 1,
 1983 the Governor-General decreed a state of emergency and
 directed several steps designed to aid Grenadian national
 
 
 570
 security. Criteria were established to accomplish three main
 objectives: (1) to identify, locate, and apprehend Cubans in
 hiding; (2) to identify, locate, and apprehend persons who
 threatened Grenadian security and order or who were involved in
 events leading to and actions in the October 19 massacre; and (3)
 to locate arms caches. U.S. military forces acted with the
 Caribbean Peace Force in these security activities.
 The detention center at Point Salines was a large, open area
 enclosed by wire. Shelter for the original Cuban detainees was
 spartan but adequate. Cooking facilities and showers were
 installed while military personnel still had none and slept on
 the ground, in the open. While the detention camp was in
 operation, screening was conducted quickly and the detainees were
 either released or sent to Richmond Hill. By mid-November
 everyone was released except for forty-eight security detainees
 who were transferred to the prison. Nine of the security
 detainees were subsequently discharged.
 All interrogations were conducted confidentially. During this
 time, a few detainees were observed bullying and intimidating
 others. They were separated from the main group and housed in
 specifically built wooden structures to maintain discipline and
 to protect the other detainees. These measures lasted only a few
 days and ended with the closing of the camp in mid-November.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In suspending the Constitution in 1979, the Revolutionary
 Government empowered itself to arrest persons without warrant for
 suspected counterrevolutionary activity. The Government (and the
 Revolutionary Military Council in its short-lived existence)
 utilized this power to round up persons it suspected of
 anti-government activity. Few detainees were charged, and those
 who eventually were released were not informed of the reasons for
 their arrest. In one case a detainee, Teddy Victor, was
 convicted and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment; after serving
 that sentence, he was handed a new detention order on the day he
 was to be released. Another detainee, Kenneth Budhlall, was
 freed of all charges during trial but immediately redetained.
 (Both were freed October 25.) Detention was for an indefinite
 term at the pleasure of the state. The arrest warrants
 ("preventive detention orders") issued most political detainees
 reads
 "Whereas I am satisfied with respect to (name,
 address) that to prevent him acting in a manner
 prejudicial to public safety, public order or the
 defense of Grenada, or with a view to subverting or
 sabotaging the People's Revolutionary Government it is
 necessary to provide for his preventive detention.
 Now therefore I, Minister responsible for maintenance
 of public safety and public order, do order that the
 said (name, address) be detained in such place and
 under such conditions as I may from time to time
 direct.
 "Grounds for detention. That the said (name) on the
 (date) day of (month, year) is reasonably suspected of
 counseling and conspiring with other persons to take
 actions of such a nature that was likely to endanger
 
 
 571
 public safety, public order or the defence of Grenada
 or to subvert or sabotage the People's Revolutionary
 Government. Dated this (date) of (month, year).
 Signed M. Bishop, Minister of National Security."
 Lloyd Noel, a long-time political opponent of Prime Minister
 Gairy, became 8ishop's first attorney general. He resigned in
 1980 because of his dissatisfaction with practices of the
 Revolutionary Government in the legal area, including the
 treatment of political prisoners. Noel resumed private law
 practice and became involved in providing legal services to
 political prisoners. Noel was detained December 19, 1981. He
 later reported that he was kept in a nine by ten-foot cell until
 July 10, 1982, after which he was permitted access to the
 corridor for brief exercise periods. He was never charged or
 permitted legal counsel, but two 15-minute visits per month were
 allowed. Noel reported.that Indian doctors working with the
 public health authorities visited on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
 each week. He described prison food as minimally adequate and
 said he had limited access to the prison library.
 According to the former attorney general, the suspended
 Constitution and laws of Grenada limited continuous confinement
 in a cell to a maximum period of twenty-one days. Court approval
 was required for longer periods. Such confinement was unlimited
 under the Revolutionary Government. According to Noel, prison
 officials could arbitrarily tighten restrictions for reasons of
 discipline or any other reason. Noel reported that routine
 treatment of political prisoners was more severe than that of
 prisoners convicted of ordinary crimes, who were allowed greater
 exercise and recreation.
 Following the establishment of the interim Government a new law
 went into effect giving the interim Government full legal
 responsibility for all security detainees currently in
 detention. Under the interim Government, as of November 16,
 police still retained the right to detain individuals on
 suspicion without a warrant but could hold them only for a
 maximum of three days, whereas under the Revolutionary Government
 they could be held indefinitely. All detainees are entitled to
 legal representation. A special tribunal reviews every case and
 makes recommendations to the Advisory Council. One hundred
 fifty-three persons are now being detained, of which 39 are
 security-detainees and 114 are common criminals convicted by the
 Grenadian courts during the period of New Jewel Movement rule.
 Several delegations of international human rights organizations
 have visited Grenada to examine the status of the "security
 detainees" as well as general state of civil liberties on the
 island. They have received the full cooperation of
 Governor-General Scoon and the Caribbean Peace Force. Included
 were representatives of Amnesty International, the American Civil
 Liberties Union, Americas Watch, and the American Friends Service
 Committee. Members of the U.S. Congress also made a fact-finding
 trip. They met with the Governor-General and members of the
 interim Government, U.S. and Caribbean officials, former
 political prisoners, and other private citizens. Some toured
 Richmond Hill Prison and interviewed detainees.
 The ICRC has expressed general satisfaction with prison
 conditions and made several recommendations regarding minor
 problems and deficiencies. The ICRC recommendations, including
 
 
 572
 construction of separate exercise yards for security detainees
 and regular convicts, were implemented as quickly as possible.
 Daily family visits were authorized soon after the detainees were
 sent to Richmond Hill. Visits by legal counsel were also
 authorized. The interim Government has stated that defense
 attorneys must be qualified to practice law (admitted to the bar)
 in Grenada. Grenadian law states that, to be admitted to the
 bar, a person must be credentialled by the Council for Legal
 Education and Studies (CLES), the credentialling body for
 graduates of the University of the West Indies' several
 campuses. The law also permits graduates of law schools in
 Commonwealth common law countries to be called to the Grenada
 bar, although the Council can require additional education or
 testing at Caribbean facilities if it so desires. In addition,
 and it reportedly is unique in this, Grenada recognizes legal
 qualifications from Canada and admits Canadian law school
 graduates to its bar. A person not meeting these criteria cannot
 be admitted to the bar.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The preventive detention tribunal system had the effect of
 removing political cases from the judicial system and denying
 affected citizens a fair public trial. Of the more than 100
 political prisoners whose incarceration has been confirmed, most
 were held under the preventive detention regulations.
 Approximately 20 were charged under the 1980 Terrorism Law. The
 political detainees who were brought to trial by the
 Revolutionary Government were tried under that law which
 suspended their constitutional right to a jury and emphasized
 confessions to members of the Government's security forces as
 evidence.
 The traditional legal system, based on British common law,
 continued to operate for ordinary criminal offenses, with the
 accused having the right to counsel and normal legal remedies.
 The independence of the judiciary was generally respected in
 non-political civil and criminal cases under the Revolutionary
 Government.
 The Office of the Grenada Director of Public Prosecutions is
 bringing in a team of lawyers from the Caribbean to help draw up
 formal charges against those persons suspected of involvement in
 the violence of October 19. Investigations are now underway with
 the assistance of police advisers from other Commonwealth
 countries. The Government intends to try the detainees as soon
 as the cases are ready for presentation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Revolutionary Government had given the police force and the
 People's Revolutionary Army the power to make searches and
 arrests without warrant. Searches made under the umbrella of
 *national security' were used to harass opponents. The
 Revolutionary Government placed their homes and businesses under
 open surveillance, and sometimes confiscated their personal
 property and disconnected their utilities.
 The Grenada police force, under new leadership, is being
 retrained and restored to a more traditional nonpolitical role.
 Grenada has obtained the assistance of its Caribbean neighbors to
 
 
 573
 provide a temporary peacekeeping force and assistance in
 rebuilding the police force. There are no current plans to have
 an army or defense force.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The People's Revolutionary Government continued to suppress these
 freedoms in 1983. The New Jewel Movement remained the only
 political party and controlled all newspapers. It remained
 illegal to publish any other local newspaper or new journal.
 (The only permitted publications were the Grenada Newsletter, a
 circular of regionally prominent journalists Alister and Cynthia
 Hughes, and a newsletter of the Chamber of Commerce.)
 Harassment of Grenadian correspondents of Western news agencies
 continued in 1983. Various international bodies and press
 representatives, particularly the Caribbean Union of Journalists,
 continued to condemn the Government for denying freedom of the
 press and to call for the release of imprisoned Grenada Voice
 editor Leslie Pierre and others. Grenada is a party to the
 Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. The Revolutionary
 Government refused to attend a September 29, 1983 hearing at the
 office of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in
 Washington on a petition filed before the Commission in December
 1980 by a group of Caribbean newspaper publishers. The petition
 charged that the Government of Grenada had violated the human
 rights of its citizens by:
 1) Failing to allow them to participate in government, as no
 elections had been held since the Bishop regime came to power by
 armed coup in March 1979.
 2) Failing to respect the right 1f freedom of thought and
 expression in Grenada particularly through the closure of the
 Torchlight and the Catholic Focus newspapers. (The Voice was
 closed after the petition was filed.)
 3) The confiscation without compensation of the Trinidad Express
 shares in the Torchlight.
 In November 1983, the Revolutionary Government-banned Grenada
 Voice, with technical and financial assistance from newspapers in
 Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad, resumed publication on a weekly
 basis. The interim Government has restored a free press.
 There apparently were no attempts to prevent Grenadian students
 from enrolling in and attending off-island institutions of higher
 learning. However, students were strongly encouraged by the
 Government to accept scholarships to Cuban, Soviet, East
 European, and Libyan universities. Mail tampering and electronic
 surveillance of telephone calls occurred under the Revolutionary
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 With the exception of the October 19 freeing of Bishop and the
 march to Ft. Rupert, there were no known instances of popular
 assembly in opposition to the Revolutionary Government.
 
 
 574
 By appointing its supporters to positions of influence and
 arresting several independent labor leaders, the Government had
 gradually gained control of most local labor unions. With the
 exception of one union, the Seamen and Waterfront Workers Union,
 whose members include about 10 percent of the work force, all
 other unions were headed or heavily influenced by Government
 sympathizers. The umbrella labor organization, the Grenada Trade
 Union Congress,-was Government-controlled. Although on paper
 Grenada had a liberal labor code, the Government reserved the
 right to declare any strike a political act and thus could take
 retaliatory action against any union.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Grenada is predominantly Catholic and Anglican. The
 Revolutionary Government attempted to discourage religion,
 particularly with the younger generation. Proselytizing was
 forbidden, and there were reports of Government efforts to
 promote atheism. Although there was no consistent pattern of
 harassment against churches, the Government maintained its ban on
 the Catholic newspaper. The churches were under constant
 pressure 'to support the Revolution' but the PRG did not
 interfere directly with religious worship.
 The Anglican archbishop of the West Indies, Sir Cuthbert
 Woodroffe, stated on September 28, 1983 that there had been no
 interference with the activities of the Anglican Church in
 Grenada under the Revolutionary Government. ,
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, under the Revolutionary Government there was no
 restriction on freedom of travel within the country, except for
 entry into zones restricted on natiobal security grounds, chiefly
 near Cuban and certain Government installations. However, the
 Government had the power to restrict the movement of any
 individual to certain geographical areas, including placing him
 under house arrest. Foreign travel remained unrestricted for
 most citizens. Released political prisoners were in most cases
 prevented from traveling outside Grenada, however, and were
 usually required to report to authorities every two weeks after
 release.
 Barbadian, United States, and United Nations authorities in
 Bridgetown received requests for assistance from several
 Grenadian ex-detainees who had fled the country. Some assistance
 in the form of identity documents, residence permission, and
 subsistence was arranged.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 From March 13, 1979 to October 25, 1983, Grenada remained tightly
 controlled by a small group within the New Jewel Movement. No
 elections of any type were held under the Bishop government.
 Very soon after the March 1979 coup, Prime Minister Bishop
 declared there would no longer be a Westminster-style
 parliamentary system in Grenada. The Government in mid-1983 set
 up a commission to draw up a new constitution. Prime Minister
 Bishop stated the process would take time and that elections
 would be held, at the earliest, in four years. It had not been
 
 
 575
 specified whether these elections would include multiple
 candidates or parties. Government statements indicated an
 increasing preference for establishing a form of "new democracy",
 based on consultation through "mass organizations" rather than
 traditional elections. Decisions appear to have been actually
 made by the Central Committee and Politburo of the New Jewel
 Movement, at first by discussion and voting among the small group
 belonging to these bodies. In October 1983 the growing conflicts
 between factions of the New Jewel Movement was resolved by
 dismissal of members of the losing faction from official
 positions, their arrest, and their execution on October 19.
 Individuals and opposition groups which attempted political
 activity without Government authorization were detained,
 harassed, or suppressed. A one-party state evolved.
 Under the interim Government, the political process is guaranteed
 by the 1974 Constitution. Political activity has resumed, and
 planning for elections is underway.
 .Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1983 there was no significant improvement in the People's
 Revolutionary Government's attitude or response to outside
 expressions of concern over the human rights situation.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), sent two
 representatives in October 1983, but they were unable to inquire
 into the condition of political detainees because of, first, the
 political turmoil and then the October 19-24 curfew. Later, they
 rendered humanitarian service by assisting in the repatriation of
 Cuban personnel and dependents, and their wounded and the dead,
 following the rescue operation. The ICRC subsequently inspected
 prison conditions at Richmond Hill and has indicated it will
 continue to monitor the human rights situation in Grenada. Other
 delegations which have recently visited Grenada include
 representatives of Amnesty International, the American Civil
 Liberties Union, Americas Watch, and the American Friends Service
 Committee.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report covering events in 1982
 expressed concern over the detention without trial of suspected
 opponents of the Government, and over several death sentences.
 Freedom House, in its report prepared before the change in
 October, called Grenada "not free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Grenada's economy has traditionally been based on agriculture,
 with the three main crops being cocoa, bananas, and nutmeg.
 Tourism, once a major earner of foreign exchange, had experienced
 a sharp decline after the revolution of 1979. Grenada has the
 smallest manufacturing sector of any country in CARICOM,
 contributing only 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
 Over the past three years the fastest growing sector in the
 economy was government services, increasing from 18 percent of
 GDP in 1978 to over 40 percent in 1982. A large portion of the
 funds that paid for that jump came from Cuba, Soviet Bloc
 countries, and Libya.
 
 
 576
 After taking power in 1979, the Bishop Government began several
 social welfare programs, concentrating on primary health care,
 education, adult literacy, and women's rights. These programs,
 carried out with technical and financial assistance from abroad,
 particularly from Cuba, brought about some improvement in these
 sectors. On the other hand, ideological re-education and
 Government propaganda campaigns were also pursued, with political
 indoctrination classes mandatory for all Government employees.
 Although Grenada recorded positive real growth over the past two
 years, that was almost exclusively a result of a major increase
 in the construction sector, most of it related to the
 international airport project. Production in the agricultural
 sector either stagnated or declined. Tourist arrivals were down,
 the occupancy rate during the '82-'83 season was less than 30
 percent. The Government increased taxes and increased its
 borrowings from the banks, resulting in a private sector that was
 unable to invest because of lack of funds or unwilling because of
 uncertainty over future government actions.
 The interim Government is faced with the task of revitalizing
 agriculture, and tourism, reassuring the private sector,
 repairing utilities and roads, and creating a large number of new
 jobs to take care of those currently unemployed and new job
 seekers. Its early pronouncements indicate it is considering
 cutting taxes, divesting itself of public enterprises and
 improving the investment climate for foreign companies.
 Grenada's population has been declining for several years, since
 the growth rate of 1.3 percent has effectively been erased by
 emigration. Something of an accelerated brain-drain has
 occurred, but many farmers and others left because of the poor
 economic outlook and/or the Revolutionary Government. Reliable
 estimates place the 1983 population in the 85,000-100,000 range.
 The infant mortality rate is 22.2 per 1000 live births. Literacy
 was 97.8 percent in 1970 and should be close to 99 percent
 today. 100 percent of the urban population and 77 percent of the
 rural had access to safe water in 1975. Primary school
 enrollment is 100 percent.
