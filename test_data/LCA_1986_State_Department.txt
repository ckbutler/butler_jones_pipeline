 ST. LUCIA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, St. Lucia has a
 multiparty parliamentary democracy. The current Prime
 Minister, John Compton, was elected in May 1982.
 St. Lucia has experienced more than 4 years of stable
 political conditions and sustained economic growth. High
 unemployment remains a source of potential instability, but it
 is anticipated that elections will be held within the next 18
 months as required by law.
 The police are the only security force in St. Lucia. A small
 Special Service Unit has been established within the police
 force and has received some paramilitary training. St. Lucia
 also is developing a coast guard. Though small, these forces
 are imbued with traditions of integrity, professionalism, and
 respect for human rights.
 St. Lucia continues to have an excellent human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killings for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No such incidents were reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest or imprisonment
 and provides that persons arrested be brought before a court
 within 72 hours. The Government honors these provisions in
 practice. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or other
 forms of extralegal detention or forced exile in 1986. The
 Women and Young Persons Acts prohibit forced or compulsory
 labor; the law is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution mandates public trials before an independent
 and impartial court and guarantees the provision of legal
 counsel to indigents. Accused persons are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. The regional West Indies Court of
 Appeal, long known for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's
 appeals court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary search, seizure,
 and entry are observed by the authorities. There were no
 reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private
 lives of individual citizens in 1986.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees of free speech and press are
 respected in practice. St. Lucia has two newspapers
 reflecting contrasting opinions. The television station is
 privately owned. The Government owns and operates Radio St.
 Lucia, and a religious organization operates another radio
 station. The Government does not censor the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal restrictions on public meetings in St.
 Lucia. Political opposition groups organize and conduct
 activities freely.
 Workers have the right to form trade unions, conduct union
 activities free of government intervention, and engage in
 collective bargaining. Strikes in the private sector are
 legal if government-sponsored efforts to resolve disputes
 fail. Unions represent the majority of wage and salary
 earners and play a prominent role in the nation's economic and
 political life.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination in St. Lucia. The
 majority of the population is Roman Catholic.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees these rights, and they are honored
 in practice. The Government revoked the passports of 16 St.
 Lucian citizens to prevent their travel to Libya in 1983,
 alleging that the group was to receive terrorist training.
 It still holds the passports of several of the original 16,
 thus restricting their travel outside St. Lucia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Lucia has a parliamentary system of government under which
 citizens have a genuine choice of parties, policies, and
 officials. Political activity is vigorous. Opposition
 parties play an active role in and out of Parliament, where
 they hold 3 of 17 seats. Parliamentary elections last were
 held in 1982 and by law must be held again before May 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 International human rights bodies filed no reports or requests
 for investigations in 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women in St.
 Lucia. Women are well represented in government and the
 professions. As more women take advantage of public schooling
 and other government programs, the participation of women in
 other sectors of society is expected to increase.

 week is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers are guaranteed a
 minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. Although no minimum wage
 is established by law, a government-established wage council
 reviews wage rates in different sectors and makes
 recommendations which generally are accepted as having the
 force of law.
