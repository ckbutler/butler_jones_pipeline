 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko has dominated an authoritarian governmental sys-
 tem since seizing power in a 1965 military coup. Under the pressure of economic
 crisis and domestic unrest, Mobutu in 1990 announced a "transition to democracy."
 Four years later, it remains far from complete. A National Conference (CNS) inves-
 tigated official wrongdoing, drafted a new Constitution, and selected Etienne
 Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba, Mobutu's most implacable political foe, as Prime Minister.
 Denouncing the authority and decisions of the CNS, Mobutu dismissed Tshisekedi
 in 1993 and appointed a defector from Tshisekedi's own Union for Democracy and
 Social Progress (UDPS) Party, Faustin Birindwa, as Prime Minister. Refusing to
 recognize Mobutu's authority to remove him, Tshisekedi presided over a parallel set
 of governmental institutions until June, while most of the basic functions of govern-
 ment came to a halt.
 In mid-1994 Mobutu's political allies and opposition leaders finally negotiated an
 end to the political impasse and established a transition Parliament (the HCR-PT)
 which elected the opposition Union of Independent Democrats's Kengo Wa Dondo
 as transition Prime Minister. Under the agreement, ministerial positions are di-
 vided equally between Mobutu supporters and the opposition. The UDPS and some
 smaller opposition groups continue to insist on Tshisekedi's legitimacy and refuse
 to accept Kengo's election or the portfolios reserved for them.
 President Mobutu generally retained control of his carefully built overlapping se-
 curity forces, a crucial factor in the transitional process. The President's brother-n-
 law, General Baramoto Kpama Kpata, heads the Civil Guard, while Mobutu's ethnic
 kinsman General Nzimbi Ngbale heads the Special Presidential Division (DSP). The
 regular armed forces, which include the Gendarmerie, are poorly trained, poorly dis-
 ciplined, and not effective as an internal or external security service. Moreover,
 members of the security forces, unpaid for months on end, frequently prey on civil-
 ians. There was one instance of large-scale armed forces pillaging, in the town of
 Mbana-Ngungu. Members of the armed forces have also been implicated in numer-
 ous cases of small-scale armed robbery, extortion, and pillage.
 The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, with little of the hard currency
 revenue traditionally generated by the mining and minerals industry, itself now
 crippled by deteriorating infrastructure and lack of new investment. Diamond ex-
 ports-much of them from outside reulated channels-are now the mainstay of the
 country's hard currency revenues. a the economy contracted, public employees
 went unpaid for months at a time, and corruption, blackmail, extortion, and embez-
 zlement eme endemic. At year's end, the Kengo Government was still struggling
 to wrest control of the Central Bank from Mobutu, and to halt an influx of illegally
 printed currency that pushed the annual inflation rate to 7,800 percent. Zaire has
 had no government budget since 1992.
 Both the security forces and the military continued to commit widespread abuses,
 including extrajudicial killings and infr igement upon individual rights in the con-
 tinuing disintegration of state authority. The security forces continued to threaten,
 torture, and illegally detain officials and others. Some political demonstrations pro-
 ceeded unhindered, but police disrupted others with threats, arrests, beatings, and
 detentions. The present Government jailed and prosecuted only a few soldiers and
 no officials for human rights abuses. Provincial officials continued to incite ethnic
 strife leading to massive displacement and deaths in Shaba, although on a smaller
 
 
 scale than the unprecedented violence in 1993. The central Government tolerated
 it until August, when the Prime Minister traveled to the area and publicly rep-
 rimanded the Shaba governor. The military and vigilantes frequently committed
 acts of violence, usually with impunity. Prion conditions, already life-threatening,
 deteriorated further, although the Government did release sick prisoners.
 RESPEOT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The undisciplined security forces
 committed numerous extrajudicial killings; in some cases these were linked to per-
 sonal rivalries. With only token wages--often none-for months at a time, many sol-
 diers and gendarmes resorted to robbery and extortion, sometimes killing their vic-
 tins or bystanders. Human rights observers, the press and eyewitnesses reported
 several dozen such fatal altercations, many committed by uniformed personnel. It
 is highly likely that additional incidents went unreported, especially in Zaire's re-
 mote interior. In January security forces shot and klled a Kinshasa currency ven-
 dor, and a soldier beat a taxi driver to death; the soldier was tried and imprisoned.
 In October a military tribunal sentenced a warrant officer and several enlisted
 troops to jail for killing a Goma businessman.
 However, the Government neither investigated nor punished the perpetrators in
 most cases, hindering efforts to determine the number of killings and the extent of
 the security forces' involvement. In several cases, poorly trained soldiers put down
 disturbances using lethal force.
 In April elite security forces put down armed mutiny in Mbanza-Ngungu and re-
 prtedly killed suspected looters. Human rights monitors reported that a series of
 confrontations between security forces and local residents left at least two civilians,
 a gendarme, and a soldier dead in Bukavu during several days of intermittent riot-
 ing in January. The disturbances began when gendarmes investigating a looting en-
 tered a home and wounded a resident; a crowd of civilians then beat one of the gen-
 darmes to death. Over the next several days, security forces and others looted
 homes and businesses, wounded mre people, and killed a security guard. Two days
 after the oriial altercation, a Civil Guard killed a vendor, and civilian bystanders
 in turn killed hi. Credible eyewitnesses have rgfuted earlier reports that security
 forces killed three bystanders in June when authorities arrested opposition leader
 Lambert Mende a a rally in Mbuji Mayi.
 There were no known cases in which security forces deliberately targeted political
 opponents or others for summary execution. In a killing that may have had political
 overtones, journalist Pierre Kabeya of Kin Matin was reportedy abducted, then shot
 to death in June. However, the motives and the perpetrators of the killing remain
 unknown. In a November case that mrem   an  eslved, journalist Adolphe Kavula
 of the newspaper Nsemo was found semiconscious severao days after he disappeared
 from his Kinshasa home and died shortly after. The Kengo Government investiga-
 tion found no evidene of foul p lay, but several human rights meonitors beleve secu-
 f         abducted, then fatally wounded Mr. Kavula.
 th  Disappearance.-There were several reports of disappearances; however, given
 teadministrative breakdown throughout the country, some of these incidents may
 be cases of criminal kidalping rather than politically motivated disappearances. Al-
 though security forces frequently hold detainees incommunicado or in secret jails,
 they typically do not attempt to conceal the fact of detention (see Section 1.d.).
 There were scattered reports of abductions in which unidentified assailants de-
 tained, threatened, and sometimes beat journalists or opposition politicians before
 releasing them. In one such abduction, apparently linked to the Union of Independ-
 ent Republicans (UFERI) Party's campaig of ethnic intimidation in Shaba provine,
 assailants believed to be members of the UFERI Youth Wing (JiFER   demanded
 that a public administrator give up his job in favor of a native of Shaba. In most
 abduction cases, a political motive is not apparent.
 c. Torture and Other Crudl, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law forbids torture, security forces regularly ignore this prohibition.
 The use of torture is widespread, and the authorities, including the judiciary, rarely
 investigate claims of torture. Securit personnel frequently beat prisoners in the
 process of arresting or interrogating them. There were numerous reports that pris-
 oners, including political opponents of the Mobutu regime, were struck, burned, or
 suspended upside down for-long periods of time.
 The press and human rights groups reported that undisciplined and often unpaid
 security forces routinely resorted to robbery, carjacking, extortion, and random acts
 of violence against ordinary citizens. Numerous rerrts from human rights monitors
 and the press describe cases in which criminals hievedto belong to the security
 
 
 284
 forces beat, raped, or threatened their victims before stealing from them. Top mili-
 tary officials have informed their troops that they will prosecute such abuses in
 military courts; in some cases, they did so. For example, officials discharged 30 sol-
 diers tried them as civilians, and jailed them for their participation in the looting
 of Mbanza-Ngungu in April (see Section L.a.); military courts convicted 3 of a 1993
 pillage of a private residence in Kinshasa, and convicted 2 others of the abduction,
 rape, and beating of a civilian couple. Many more such cases, however, are neither
 investigated nor punished. Prime Minister Kengo failed to implement his promise
 to disarm all security force members whose jobs did not require weapons ior their
 current duties.
 Conditions in most of Zaire's 220 prisons and places of detention remain life-
 threatening. Human rights groups recorded two deaths from malnutrition in
 Kinshasa's Makala central prison in May, and six deaths in the Kananga prison in
 May and June. During the first half of the year, the central Government all but
 ceased to provide prisons with operating funds; consequently, virtually the only food
 and medical care was that provided sporadically by relatives and private charities.
 Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases are rampant. Inmates in Makala sleep on
 the floor and have no access to sanitation, potable water, or adequate health care.
 Numerous reports on prisons in the interior suggest these conditions are both typi-
 cal and widespread. Prime Minister Kengo's Justice Ministry publicly deplored pris-
 on conditions and appealed for international assistance but has made no concrete
 improvements. However, in August Justice Minister Kamanda released 48 ill and
 malnourished prisoners. Abuse of prisoners is common. In November at the end of
 a fact-finding tour, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Roberto Garreton
 emphasized the problem of prison conditions, noting he had witnessed evidence of
 abuse, including torture.
 The Zairian rison Fellowship, religious organizations and the International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross (ICRC)report that they have regular access to prisons na-
 tionwide. In some cases, however, the Government's unpublicized creation of new
 unofficial detention sites circumvents their access. Measures taken to separate men
 women, and juvenile prisoners are often inadequate. Authorities have not targeted
 women for abuse, although rape sometimes occurs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Zairian law, serious offenses pun-
 ishable by more than 6-months imprisonment, do not require a warrant for tie ar-
 rest of a suspect. Any law enforcement officer having the status of 'judicial police
 officer" is empowered to authorize arrest. This status is also vested in senior officers
 of each of the security services. The law provides that detainees be brought before
 a magistrate for a hearing within 48 hours of arrest. If grounds for arrest are pre-
 sented, the magistrate may order detention for an initial period of 15 days, followed
 by renewable 30-day periods.
 In practice, the Government uses arbitrary arrests to intimidate political oppo-
 nents. Political arrests increased during periods of heightened opposition activism,
 either in connection with general strikes, demonstrations, or the politicized atmos-
 phere surrounding the June 14 election of Prime Minister Kengo. Authorities rarely
 ile charges, obscuring the precise motive for political arrests. Typically, police de-
 tain such prisoners for several days or weeks, then grant provisional liberty without
 arraignment.
 Political prisoners and others are often detained incommunicado, with irregular
 or no access to legal counsel. Human rights monitors report cases in which corrupt
 local officials use detention as a means of extortion, arresting people on fabricated
 charges, only releasing them after a payment of a "fine." Human rights monitors
 estimate that police detained and questioned a half-dozen people about opposition-
 sponsored general strikes. For example, police arrested two opposition leaders after
 general strikes, Pierre Mankwamya in January and Olenga Nkoy in May. They de-
 tained both for several weeks, questioned them about the organization of the
 strikes, and released them without formal hearings. In another case with political
 overtones, authorities arrested UDPS leader Leon Kadima Muntutu on July 5, ques-
 tioned him about illegal currency exchanges, then released him over 2 months later
 without charge.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political detainees due to detention in
 clandestine and remote locations and military facilities. In mid-August, the Kengo
 Government reported that virtually all prisoners were detained "for cause," and that
 none was being held for purely political reasons.
 Security forces detained opposition leaders, sometimes very briefly, in an apparent
 effort to halt or head off political demonstrations. Security forces arrested up to 80
 people when they broke up a January demonstration by the Lumumbist Palu Party.
 They released most detainees within hours, but held eight Palu leaders for several
 days.
 
 
 Police detained Lambert Mende a spokesman for the opposition Holy Union, for
 several hours when he tried to address a rally in Mbuji Mayi in June; on August
 16, police detained three oppition labor leaders, Enos Bavela, Beainin
 Mukulungu, and Kibsawa Kwabene, for mot of the day when they attempted to or-
 ganize a demonstration in Kinshasa.
 In an incident that still remains unexplained, police detained former Prime Min-
 ister and chief of the radical opposition Etienne Tshisekedi on June 12 when he
 went on or near a military base. They released Tshisekedi himself hours later with-
 out charge but kept three body guards and a driver who were arrested with him in
 custody or 2 mon   s without charge.
 Seventy percent of the inmates of Makala prison were officially awaiting trial.
 Human rights and religious organizations suggest the problem is at least this severe
 elsewhere, with as many as 80 percent of inmates awaiting trial in some prisons
 in the interior.
 The Transition Act of 1994 specifically forbids exile, and there were no known
 cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Despit constitutional prvisions, the judiciary is
 not independent of the executive branch, and the executive branch often mapu-
 lates it. Zaire's civil and criminal codes are based on Belgian and customary law.
 The legal system includes lower courts, appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and
 the Court of State Security. Adherence to acceptable legal procedures varies consid-
 erably. Charges of misconduct against senior government officials must be filed di-
 rectly with the Supreme Court. Corruption is pervasive, particularly among mag-
 istrates who are poorly paid and poorly trained. The judicial system is further ho-
 bled by shortages of personnel, essential supplies, and intimidation of justices.
 There is a system of separate military tribunals with an appeals structure that par-
 allels that of civilian courts. Decisions from the military tribunals may be appealed
 to the Supreme Court.
 The Transition Act provides for the right to a speedy public trial, the presumption
 of innocence, and legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. Defendants have the
 right to appeal in aiicses except those involving national security, armed robbery,
 and smuggling, which are adjudicated by the Court of State Security. The law pro-
 vides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in all proceedings
 before the Supreme Court, and in other cases when requested by a court. In prac-
 tice, the authorities frequently ignore these protections. Many defendants never
 meet their counsel or do so only after months of detention and interoation. The
 judiciary ceased to function for several months when judicial workers struck to pro-
 test the nonamnt of public employees. Most cases are heard only when defendant
 and plaintiff pay all court costs, including salaries, a situation which encourages
 corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Secu-
 rity forces routinely ignore the Constitution's provision for the inviolability of the
 homo and of private correspondence. They ignore the requirement for a search war-
 rant, entering and searching homes at will, Under the pretext of searching for arms,
 troops entered and looted the home of a leader of the radical opposition in Kinshasa;
 troops also looted the home of an urban commissar in Kolwezi. Human rights mon-
 itrs and the press report numerous other instances in which gangs believed to be
 security forces entered and looted private homes someties abusing or threatening
 the residents. In many of these cases, simple robbery, rather than political intimida-
 tion, appeared to be the motive. Citizens widely assume that the Government mon-
 itors mail and telephone communications.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 jlicts.-Regional government officials continued to provoke ethnic clashes in Shaba
 province and to ex e inhabitants originally from the neighbo g provinces of East-
 ern and Wesrn Kasai    many of whom have lived in ShaBa for several generations.
 Throughout most of the year, provincial Governor Gabriel Kyungu Wa Kumwanza
 continued to publicly blame Shaba's economic problems on the Kasaians. On several
 occasions, militant members of Kyns seRI party blocked entry to Kasian
 Lubas at their places of employment, biocked Kasaian farmers from working in their
 fields, and in general impeded passage of non-:habans. These attacks began to de-
 cline in mid-1994, especially aftr Prime Minister Kengo's August visit to Shaba,
 when he publicly reprimanded Kngu for persecuting the Kasnians. As a result of
 intimidation and the violent clashes of previous years, Kasaians continued to leave
 Shaba province. Most of them are thought to have returned to impoverished farming
 communities in Eastern Kasai, although many remain crowded into certain towns
 in northern Shaia, where they depend on international assistance for survival.
 Other political rivalries touched off sporadic incidents of violence. In July a group
 of UDPS supporters, who are frequently found in the street in front of opposition
 
 
 286
 leader Tshisekedi's residence, seized three uniformed soldiers and beat them se-
 verely. Subsequently, a larger grouP of soldiers arrived and beat several UDPS sup-
 porters and bystanders in retaliation. During the ensuing melee, shots were fired,
 several peple were hurt, Tshisekedi's home was damaged and some of his posses-
 sions looted.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Presa.-The Constitution and the Transition Act provide
 for the right to express opinion, but the Government restricts this right. In practice,
 the press and public discussion are freer than before President Mobutu ended the
 one-party state. During the latter half of the year, for example, opposition leaders
 have significantly increased their presence on the airwaves.-Nonetheless, sporadic
 local attempts at control and intimidation frequently occur. Newspaper publishers
 are required to deposit copies of each issue with the Ministry of Information prior
 to publication. An ambiguous ordinance on 'press freedom" which fails to define
 "freedom of the press" also serves to promote self-censorship and intimidate journal-
 ists, as does outright intimidation and violence. For example, security forces ab-
 ducted, threatened, beat, and detained journalists before releasing them (see Section
 2.b.).
 Human rights monitors reported cases of outright intimidation. Security forces
 searched and ransacked the Kinshasa offices of L'Analyst, forcing employees to va-
 cate the premises. They also jailed a journalist for Le Point du Zaire for denouncing
 the embezzlement of humanitarian assistance by President Mobutu's Popular Move-
 ment for the Revolution (MPR) Party chairman. Several other journalists and edi-
 tors in the print media claimed security forces threatened them, subjected them to
 obvious surveillance, or summoned them for interrogation. The editor of LEssor
 Africain went into hiding when he received such a summons. The editor of La Ref-
 erence Plus obeyed his summons; security forces subsequently questioned him for
 several hours.
 In May a court sentenced a printer to 4 months' imprisonment for distribution of
 leaflets calling for a general strike.
 In January Shaba provincial governor Kyungu suspended the Lubumbashi news-
 paper Mukuba for an article deemed 'seditious," and he also suspended Taifa editor
 Crispin Luamba for "being a normative." One month later, the Government fined
 Le Soft for its article on the Information Minister's embezzlement of funds. In an
 ongoing case, the Government ordered Solidariteto divulge its sources for an article
 threatening the pillage of local churches.
 On occasion, the Government or security forces interfered with the distribution of
 newspapers. In April elements of the Military Action and Research Service seized
 and burned newspapers sold by small vendors in Kinshasa. The governor of
 Maniema ordered a man arrested and detained for a month for bringing opposition"
 newspapers from Kinshasa into the province.
 The Kengo Government allowed many foreign journalists to report throughout the
 year. However, in March the Birindwa government investigated and expelled a Bel-
 gian documentary cinema producer.
 Although numerous newspapers are published in Kinshasa, their impact largely
 remains confined to the capital and a few major cities. Only the government-con-
 trolled radio and, to a much lesser extent, television, reach mass audiences. The
 Zairian Radio and Television Office fired 9 of the 12 reporters in the broadcast
 media whom it had suspended the previous year, apparently for excessive independ-
 ence in reporting.
 The Government generally respects discussion within the university community
 but restricts the right to publish.
 b. Freedom of Peacejul Assembly and Association.-The right of the people to as-
 semble peacefully has never been firmly established. The Government requires all
 organizers of public meetings to apply for a permit. In February the governor of
 Kinshasa issued an additional decree arbitrarily forbidding all political demonstra-
 tions while the Parliament is in session; the decree still stands.
 Security forces repressed several political demonstrations, some of them violently.
 In January they broke up a demonstration by the Lumumbist party Palu, beating
 the participants and arresting several dozen persons. They released many of the
 participants within hours but detained eight for several days. They also disrupted
 two other Palu demonstrations, in January and in May, in similar fashion.
 At times, the Government tried to prevent demonstrations by denying permission
 or arresting the groups' leaders. The Government denied permission to the pro-
 Tshisekedi UDPS to demonstrate in February and in May. A human rights monitor
 reported that security forces arrested a UDPS supporter when he tried to organize
 a demonstration. In August security forces arrested three leaders of the UDPS-ori-
 
 
 287
 ented CIDT Union Confederation who were attempting to lead a small demonstration
 of public functionaries. The security forces detaned the union leaders for several
 hours, until the Justice Ministry ordered their release. The UDPS did, however,
 hold a major rally in June without incident, in sharp contrast to a rally that the
 Government violently repressed in 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no legally favored church or religion, but the
 Transition Act and the Constitution previously in effect limit religious freedom by
 authorizing the Government to regulate reliious sects.
 The 1971 law regulati  religious organizations grants civil servants the power
 to establish or dissolve religious groups. This law restricted the process for official
 recognition; however, officially recognized religions are free to establish places of
 worship and to train clergy. Most _reognized churches have external ties, and for-
 eign nationals are allowed to proselytize. The Government generally does not inter-
 fere with foreign missionaries.
 There has ben no further known persecution of the Jehovah's Witnesses. How-
 ever, the Supreme Court in 1993 ordered the Kengo Gove    nt to pay damages
 to the church because the Mobutu government had-banned it in 1986 as a danger
 to the national interest. The Government has reportedly not yet paid these dam-
 ages.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts freedom of movement. All citizens, refugees
 and permanent residents must carry identity cards. Police and soldiers erect check-
 points on major roads to inspect papers. Security forces frequently use such i
 tions to extort money from travelers at airports, ferry ports and roadblocks. In July
 a decree by Prime Minister Kengo banned such roadblocks. Subsequent reporting
 indicates that, while there have been sporadic improvements in some areas, many
 roadblocks remain, particularly in remote areas of the interior.
 Passports and exit permits are available, in principle, to all citizens, often at exor-
 bitant cost from corrupt officials. There continue to be sporadic cases in which secu-
 rity forces harass human rights monitors and opposition politicians who attempt to
 leave the country. In some of these cases security forces confiscated travel ocu-
 ments or other papers, forcing people to delay their travel.
 Zaire was the destination of one of the largest refugee movements in history
 when over 1 million Rwandans poured into the eastern border towns of Goma and
 Bukavu in a 5-day period. The influx quickly overwhelmed the Government's mate-
 rial and administrative resources and created security concerns of alarming 'propor-
 tions. Undisciplined Zairian security forces robbed and extorted goods from refugees
 and relief agencies. Further complicating the security situation, the ranks of the ref-
 ugees included an estimated 33,000 retreating Rwandan troops and an unknown
 number of militiamen. While the armed forces confiscated many weapons at the bor-
 der crossing, weapons were smuggled through checkpoints and across remote border
 areas, contributing to insecurity in the camps. At year's end, former Rwandan mili-
 tary and government officials still controlled most of the refugee camps. They in-
 timidated both the refugees who wished to return home and relief workers. Citing
 concerns for their security and that of the refugees, numerous relief organizations
 threatened to halt operations in the camps, unless an international security force
 was established there. By year's end, at least one, Medecins Sans Frontieres/France,
 had shut down operations in the camps for security reasons. The Zairian Govern-
 ment has sought assistance from the international community in providing security
 for the camps. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) esti-
 mates that 1.1 million Rwandan refugees remain in Zaire.
 Early in 1994, only 40,000 Burundian refugees remained of some 90,000 who had
 fled 1993 fighting, but continued instability in Burundi caused additional Burun-
 dians to enter, increasing the Burundian population to 125,000. Many of the newly
 arrived Burundian refugees live in camps, and virtually all depend on assistance
 from international agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). Zaire also
 hosts stable refugee populations of Angolans Sudanese, Ugandans, and others. In
 November, in an action protested by the UNHCR, Zaire forcibly repatriated 37
 Rwandan refugees who were accused of committing crimes in Zaire.
 Some 90,000 Zairians have sought asylum in neighboring countries. The Govern-
 ment deals with prospective returnees individually, and there is no evidence of dis-
 crimination.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Transition Act mandates the rights of citizens to change their government,
 but the Mobutu regime continues to deny this right. The 4-year program for transi-
 tion to democracy remained stalled through much of the year. In 1993 President
 
 
 288
 Mobutu installed Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa-in defiance of constitutionally
 mandated procedures. The Birindwa Government continued to exercise power
 through the first half of the year. The Tshisekedi Government, which had held
 power previously, refused to step down.
 In 1994, seeking to end the political impasse, Mobutu and opposition leaders nego-
 tiated a Transition Act, which led to the election of opposition leader Kengo Wa
 Dondo as Prime Minister on June 14. Since then, Kengo's Government announced
 its intention to propose legislation establishing election procedures, and otherwise
 prepare the legal and administrative basis for holding free and fair elections by mid-
 1995, as mandated by the Transition Act. The Kengo Government introduced in De-
 cember legislation to establish an electoral commission. However, since President
 Mobutu continues to maintain authority over many government operations through
 his control of key units of the military and the administration, including the Central
 Bank, and the Tahisekedi opposition remains intransigent, the outlook or legitimate
 1995 elections remains highly uncertain.
 There is no official discrimination against the participation of women or minori-
 ties in politics. However, there are only 2 women in the Cabinet, and only about
 30 women in the 748-member transition Parliament. Although citizens, Pygmies liv-
 ing in remote areas take no part in the political process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental Zairian human rights organizations, including the
 Zairian League of Human Rights, the Voice of the Voiceless (VSV), the Zairian Asso-
 ciation for the Defense of Human Rights (AZADHO) and the Zairian Prison Fellow-
 ship have reported and documented human rights abuses and issued reports on the
 Government's attitude regarding its responsibility to protect these rights and to
 meet the basic human needs of the population. Although human rights organiza-
 tions generally were able to work unhindered, there were several episodes of harass-
 ment. They also encountered delays in registration, unlike the treatment provided
 other organizations which do not focus primarily on human rights abuses.
 Security forces confiscated AZADHO publications when that organization's presi-
 dent attempted to travel to the United States in January. After delan  his travel
 a week, the AZADHO president left Zaire without further incident. In the province
 of Haut Zaire, local authorities forbade, a VSV representative from holding a human
 rights seminar without the express permission of the provincial governor. When no
 permission was forthcoming, the representative held the meeting anyway, without
 incident. However, authorities jailed another VSV representative working in Haut
 Zaire for several hours when he inquired about several prisoners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the Transition Act forbid discrimination based on eth-
 nicity, sex, or religious affiliation. Nonetheless, the Government continues to dis-
 criminate in some areas, and legal and societal discrimination continues as well.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice women are relegated to a
 secondary role in society. They are the primary farm laborers and small traders and
 are exclusively responsible for child rearing. In the nontraditional sector, women
 commonly receive less pay for comparable work. Women tend to receive less edu-
 cation than men. Although women work in the professions and the civil service, only
 rarely do they occupy positions that permit them to exercise authority over male
 professionals. Few have attained positions of high responsibility. Women are re-
 quired by law to obtain their spouse's permission before engaging in routine legal
 transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank account, accept-
 ing employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987 revision of the Family Code per-
 mits a widow to inherit her husband's property, to control her own property, and
 to receive a property settlement in the event of divorce. However, in cases where
 the inheritance is contested, little effective intervention is likely from the dysfunc-
 tional judiciary. The press and human rights groups generally ignore the question
 of domestic violence, despite its common occurrence.
 Children.-Government spending on children's programs is nearly nonexistent.
 Most schools, for example, only function in areas where parents have formed co-
 operatives to pay teachers' salaries.
 There are no documented cases in which security forces or others target children
 for specific abuse, although children suffer from the same conditions of generalized
 social disorder and widespread disregard for human rights that affect society as a
 whole.
 
 
 289
 Female genital mutilation is not widespread, but is practiced on young girls
 among isolated groups in the North.
 Indigenous People.-Societal discrimination continues against Zaire's Pygmy pop-
 ulation of 6,000 to 10,000. There were no known reports of conflicts between Pyg-
 mies and agarian populations in 1994.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Zaire's population of about 40 million in-
 cludes over 200 separate ethnic groups. Four indigenous languages have national
 status. French is the language of government, commerce, and education. Political of-
 fices have generally been proportionally allocated among the various ethnic groups,
 but members of President Mobutu's Ngbandi ethnic group are disproportionately
 represented at the highest levels of the security and intelligence services.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings and
 government services for the disabled. Special schools, many with missionary staff,
 use private funds and limited public support to provide education and vocational
 training to blind and physically disabled students.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and legislation provide for the
 right to form and join trade unions to all workers except magistrates and military
 personnel (including the gendarmes and national police).
 Before 1990 the law required all trade unions to affiliate with the National Union
 of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), the single legally recognized labor confederation which
 was an integral part of the only lega political party, he MPR. When political plu-
 ralism was permitted in April 1990, the UNTZA disaffiliated itself from the MPR
 and reorganized under new leadership chosen through elections deemed fair by out-
 side observers. Although UNTZA remains the largest union, almost 100 other inde-
 pendent labor unions and centrals are now registered with the Labor Ministry, some
 of them affiliated with political parties or associated with a single industry or geo-
 gra hic area.
 e law recognid the right to strike; however, legal strikes rarely occur since
 the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal proce-
 dures. Labor unions have not effectively defended the rights of workers in the dete-
 riorating economic environment.
 Most public sector employees, including judicial sector workers, struck sporadi-
 cally throughout the year to protest nonpayment of salaries. Three day-long politi-
 cally directed general strikes, on January 19, May 27, and July 8, halted most activ-
 ity in Kinshasa and in some provincial capitals. Although the general strikes dem-
 onstrated the power of the opposition, they did not have a significant impact on
 worker issues.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. UNTZA participates actively in
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and the Union Central of Zaire is
 affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-The law provides for the right
 to bargain collectively, and an agreement between the UNTZA and the Employers
 Association provided for wages and prices to be negotiated jointly each year under
 minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned until 1991, broke
 down as a result of the rapid depreciation of the currency. Continuing hyperinflation
 has encouraged a return to pay rates individually arranged between employers and
 employees; collective bargaining still exists, at most, on the level of the individual
 enterprise.
 The collapse of the formal economy has also resulted in a decline in the influence
 of unions, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buyer's market for
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although this regulation
 is not strongly enforced. In the public sector, the Government sets wages by decree;
 public sector unions act only in an informal advisory capacity.
 There are no export processing zones in Zaire.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years. Employers may legally hire minors 14 and older with the con-
 sent of a parent or guardian, but those under 16 may work a maximum of 4 hours
 per day; youth between 16 and 18 may work up to 8 hours. Although the law bars
 minors under 18 from a wide variety of jobs deemed dangerous or unhealthy, au-
 thoritis do not jgenerally enforce these regulations. Employment of children of all
 ages is common in the informal economic sector and in subsistence agriculture. Nei-
 ther the Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for enforcement, nor the labor
 unions, make an eff        orce child labr laws. Larger enterprises do not com-
 monly exploit child labor.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most Zairians are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by Government decree in 1990, continued to be irrelevant due to rapid infla-
 tion. Most workers relied on the extended family and informal economic activity to
 survive.
 The maximum legal workweek (excluding volunta      overtime) is 48 hours. One
 24-hour rest period is required ever 7 days. The Laor Code specifies health and
 safety standards. The Ministry of Labor is officially charged with enforcement of
 these standards. However, the International Labor Organization Committee of Ex-
 perts again expressed concern about the inadequacy of reporting during previous
 years, blaming this unsatisfactory performance on the dearth of human and mate-
 rial resources provided to the Ministry. There are no provisions in the Labor Code
 permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 penalty.
