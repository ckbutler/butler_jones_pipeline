 BENIN
 Benin is a small and poor country where a military Govern-
 ment holding power since 1972 has embraced Marxism-Leninism
 as the guiding principle of political life. A Constitution
 was drafted in 1977 and is scheduled to be implemented
 following the closely controlled elections held in November
 1979. It provides for a panoply of political, civil and
 economic rights but generally subordinates liberties to
 decisions of the single political party and of the state. In
 theory as well as in practice there are no real restraints on
 the arbitrary use of power. The regime is not, however,
 brutal or repressive in its day-to-day dealings with peo-
 ple. The major threats to human rights which have occurred
 in recent years have been episodic, rooted largely in ten-
 sions connected with alleged plots to overthrow the Govern-
 ment. In 1979, the political atmosphere was stable. So-
 called revolutionary goals -- development, mobilization
 of the population, and production -- take precedence over
 the individual's right to protest, or oppose governmental
 decisions. The regime attaches high importance to economic
 development and the betterment of life at the rural level.
 Minorities, including women, are treated in an even-handed
 way by official government policy, but some historic inequal-
 ities are difficult to overcome.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 While there is no organized or systematic use of torture
 in Benin, there are indications that the police and the
 military treat suspects harshly and with occasional physical
 violence during detention and interrogation.- It is extremely
 difficult to gather facts concerning mistreatment, since law
 enforcement authorities are not accountable or subject to
 public scrutiny. Reports of cruel treatment during deten-
 tion, including lack of food and sanitary facilities and the
 imposition of other physical discomforts, are common.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Arbitrary and harsh treatment seems fairly common in the
 immediate post-arrest period. Arrests sometimes take
 place on the basis of fragmentary information or as the
 result of "denunciations," which the Government encour-
 ages as a way of showing revolutionary zeal. Detention
 prior to formal elaboration of charges can be of long
 duration -- weeks or even months in the case of common
 criminals and sometimes indefinitely for so-called political
 offenses. Prisoners generally have access to their families
 for food, etc., after an initial period of private interro-
 gation. Lawyers have similar access to their clients,
 although recourse to legal representation seems rare.
 Consular access is satisfactory once established, although
 procedures for providing information about the arrest of
 foreign nationals are erratic. There is no evidence of
 summary executions in Benin.

 c.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are believed to be some 25 political prisoners in
 detention, although figures are impossible to substan-
 tiate. Most of these seem to be held on vague charges
 of having supported previous regimes or of posing a political
 threat to the Government. Some detainees, like the three
 former Presidents, Ahomadegbe, Maga, and Apithy, are under
 house arrest rather than in prison. Their lives are reported
 to be not uncomfortable. The Government does not deny that
 it holds some political prisoners. While those accused of
 such offenses have no formal recourse against arbitrary
 detention, political arrests seem to have diminished in the
 past two years.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In 1979, 100 persons -- mercenaries and politicians who
 collaborated with them -- were condemned to death in absentia
 for participating in the abortive 1977 mercenary raid on
 Cotonou. Trial was by the Supreme Revolutionary Council, a
 50-member military and civilian body sitting as a special
 court. Identifications of those condemned were established
 primarily on the basis of documents left behind by the
 mercenaries. No official request for extradition was made.
 As far as the Department of State knows, no formal sentence
 of death in this or in other cases has ever been carried out
 oy the present Government. For offenses falling outside the
 political and security sectors, offenders are generally
 tried under the French colonial code. There are plans
 to establish a new criminal and civil code and a new judi-
 ciary system once the present state of emergency ends and the
 new Constitution goes into effect.
 In cases of corruption, the Council of Ministers appoints
 a Commission of Inquiry. When officials are implicated
 as in several recent cases, they have been arrested for
 short periods but released shortly thereafter, and demoted or
 excused from governmental service. In no case has a public
 trial been held. Low-level cases of corruption are delegated
 to an ad hoc "Committee of Suppression," which generally
 metes out fines and demotions. All cases of corruption are
 reviewed by the Council of Ministers.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are no formal safeguards against intrusion into
 the home, although the Department of State is unaware
 of specific instances of intrusion.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Economic policy is aimed mainly at helping the poor. The
 present regime has revamped the Government's planning and
 administrative apparatus to centralize control of the
 country's limited resources and to give a more socialist
 orientation to development efforts. The Government has
 organized agricultural extension services to provide rural
 areas with both technical and ideological instruction.
 Government-sponsored committees of women and youth
 are increasingly active. The labor unions belong to a
 
 
 15
 national federation firmly controlled by the Government,
 and wage increases are held down to encourage local in-
 dustry and reduce urban-rural income differences. The
 regime has intensified efforts to improve health services
 and educational opportunities. Forty percent of the Govern-
 ment budget goes to education, and hundreds of new schools
 have been opened in the past two years. However, educational
 expansion has been hampered by the lack of qualified teachers
 (many fled the country in search of higher pay or freer
 political atmosphere) and by efforts to remodel the educa-
 tional system to accord with the regime's political ideology.
 The tax system has been made more progressive by the present
 Government, but owing to lax enforcement it has not produced
 a major redistribution of wealth.
 Corruption is still pervasive and in 1979 the Government
 continued to conduct well-publicized investigations of
 corruption in several agencies.
 Although the Government has established basic education
 and rural development as top priorities, efforts to alter
 social and economic structures radically have often met with
 negative results. Attempts to hold down food prices aggra-
 vated shortages, and Government-owned industries suffer from
 poor management and low productivity. However, governmental
 policies appear to be well intentioned, and officials seem
 prepared to adjust policy in the face of unforeseen diffi-
 culty. Government decisions in 1979 established a category
 of economic crimes such as bad management, poor accounting,
 and failure to turn a profit, but did not establish the means
 to enforce such decrees.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 I    Assembly
 The Government's abrogation of the previous constitution
 and its effort to transform Benin into a Marxist-Leninist
 state based on the principles of "scientific socialism"
 led to suppression of independent political and labor
 activity, demonstrations, free expression and any other
 activities implying criticism of the regime. Effective
 political participation is limited to a small group
 within the Government, the sole political party, and the
 Council of Ministers. A 336-member National Assembly
 was elected in November 1979. Nominations were by
 popular consultation, but the final choice of candidates
 was made by the Party Central Committee and submitted on
 a "yes" or "no" basis to the population at the polls.
 The press is Government-controlled and distribution of
 Western publications is limited. The free practice of
 most religions is allowed, but the Kerekou Government,
 concerned about the power of local cult practices, has
 tried to curtail traditional religious ceremonies. Cults
 nevertheless flourish. Christians have been harassed
 occasionally, but churches continue to function normally.
 The only sect against which drastic action has been taken
 is the Jehovah's Witnesses, who refused to acknowledge
 the legitimacy of th  revolutionary Government. All
 
 
 16
 expatriate members of this sect were expelled in April 1976
 and their property confiscated. Discussions are underway
 about compensation.
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of speech, press,
 thought, assembly, association and demonstration. Article
 136 guarantees individual liberty to all citizens of the
 People's Republic of Benin. Legally, women have equal status
 and the right to vote, but the social structure often dis-
 criminates against them. The Government strongly supports
 family planning and birth control. Women have a major role
 as traders and entrepreneurs in non-Muslim areas of the
 country.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on the movement of Beninese
 citizens within the country. Travel restrictions on for-
 eigners have been effectively eliminated by general non-
 observance during the past year. The Government does,
 however, control emigration and foreign travel. Passport
 applications by persons lacking compelling reasons to
 return to Benin (students and the unemployed, for example)
 are rejected. Citizens wishing to visit a neighboring
 country for which passports are not required must have
 the written authorization of the Ministry of the Interior.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Such freedoms as existed in Benin were suspended with
 the abrogation of the former constitution in 1972. The
 new Constitution makes provision within a one-party context
 for an assembly elected by universal adult suffrage. The
 People's Revolutionary Party remains the most important
 single element in the new political system.
 Grass-roots democracy on a limited scale has been organized
 since 1975. Precinct delegates are elected by the people at
 mass meetings. The delegates then choose the commune level
 representatives, who in turn elect the Mayor. The Mayor is
 responsible to the Government-appointed district chief. The
 local delegates have no power except to carry out the orders
 of the Government.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Records Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is not aware of any requests for
 outside investigation of human rights conditions in Benin.
 The Government would likely view such requests as inter-
 ference in its internal affairs. In its 1977 report, Amnesty
 International noted the obstacles to its investigation and
 confirmation of reports on political prisoners in Benin.
