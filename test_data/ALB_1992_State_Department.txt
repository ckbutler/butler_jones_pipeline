 ALBANIA
 Albania continued in 1992 on the path of establishing a multiparty democracy
 with legal guarantees of human rights. Albania began the year ruled by an interim
 government which had taken oMce after the opposition withdrew from a Socialist-
 dominated coalition government in December 1991 because of disagreement over the
 pace of economic reform. The mandate of the interim government was to administer
 the country until after new elections scheduled for March 22. The March parliamen-
 tary elections, generally considered to be free and fair, replaced the ruling Socialist
 Party of Albania (the former Communists) with the first freely elected, non-Com-
 munist Government since before World War II. President Ramiz Alia resigned, and
 Parliament elected as President Dr. Sali Berisha of the majority Democratic Party.
 The President named Aleksandr Meksi as Prime Minister, who formed a coalition
 Government composed of representatives of the Democratic, Republican, and Social
 Democratic Parties.
 In August the Government appointed a new commission composed of constitu-
 tional experts and representatives of various political parties to draft a constitution.
 It replaced the 1991 constitutional commission appointed by the previous govern-
 ment. Meanwhile, the 1991 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions continued to
 serve as a substitute for a constitution. The new Parliament amended the law to
 strengthen presidential powers, especially as to government appointments, judicial
 administration, and local government affairs. In the spring a Constitutional Court
 was created with exclusive authority to consider constitutional questions. Par-
 liament also created the Supreme Judicial Council comprised of the President, the
 Minister of Justice, the Attorney General, and representatives from the judiciary,
 which has the sole authority to appoint, discipline or remove judges, prosecutors,
 and high-level Justice Ministry officials.
 Widespread food shortages resulted in serious outbreaks of violence in late 1991
 and early 1992. In response Parliament enacted a law creating the Rapid Deploy.
 ment Force (RDF) with the authority to use force against public disorder, terrorist
 activities, and vandalism, to search homes, businesses, and vehicles, and to arrest
 persons under certain circumstances, although the initial legislation did not delin-
 eate those circumstances. The RDF was believed responsible for the death of a stu-
 dent by beating, but there was no investigation of the incident. From January
 through March 22, food riots broke out in several cities, reportedly sparked by local
 Socialist leaders who refused to distribute foreign humanitarian assistance. At least
 two Albanians were killed and many wounded by security forces. Again, there was
 no formal investigation. Law and order became a central issue in the national elec-
 tion campaign.
 After the elections, the new Government quickly restored order. It dismissed
 many holdovers in the security service, recruited younger replacements, and encour-
 aged police to enforce the laws and investigate crimes. However, the National Intel-
 ligence Service (SHIK), which replaced the Sigurimi secret police in 1991, reportedly
 continued arbitrarily to summon and interrogate persons suspected of illegal or
 questionable activities. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which
 the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis,
 were $157 million. Defens spending has been reduced and, due to the fiscal reali-
 ties of the economy, should continue.
 Albania hopes to convert its highly centralized command economy into a market
 economy. For lack of domestic capital, it is seeking foreign investment. The Meksi
 Government took steps to try to reverse the rapid decline of the economy which had
 brought the unemployment rate to about 80 percent. Agricultural production in-
 creased substantially, apparently as a result of far-reaching privatization, although
 Albania must still import about one-half of its food needs. Industrial production and
 employment improved only slightly. Parliament enacted laws on the banking sys-
 (689)
 
 
 tern, foreign investment, control of state enterprises, and the freeing of prices in an
 effort to move the economy toward a free market system.
 Although observance of human rights improved during the year as the Govern-
 ment and the courts implemented the 1991 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions,
 serious problems remained. In February the People's Assembly passed an election
 law which barred ethnically based parties from participatig in the March elections
 and appeared aimed at the Omonia Party, an ethnic Greek party which won five
 seats in the 1991 elections. Omonia fielded candidates through a front party, the
 Unity for Human Rights Party, which received government approval.
 Tensions between Albanians and ethnic Greeks increased, fueled by fears of eth-
 nic Greek irredentism and reports that Greek military personnel were physically
 abusing Albanian illegal aliens before deporting them. In February crowds attacked
 and looted six Greek-owned businesses in Saranda.
 In August a pro-Socialist demonstration in Polican erupted into confrontations
 with the police in which 17 people, including 5 children, were injured (see Section
 6.a.).
 The rule of law and principle of an independent judiciary were not yet respected
 in practice. Specialized police forces, created in response to increasing crime, have
 wide-ranging authority with little, if any, institutional oversight (see Section 1.f.).
 Uniform judicial procedure has yet to be fully implemented or practiced in Albanian
 courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings in 1992. Between January and April, however, there were several
 incidents in which police and security forces used firearms against demonstrators,
 killing at least two persons. In late February, 2 persons were killed and 26 wounded
 in Lbrazd when they raided food warehouses. Security forces opened fire on and
 wounded an unknown number of rioters trying to seize donated food in Lushne and
 Pogradec. There was no official investigation of the incident.
 On February 27, members of the Rapid Deployment For (RDF) pulled a student,
 Leonard Arapi, from a bus and beat him. He died of his injuries 2 days later in a
 Tirana hospital. The RDF provided no explanation for its action, nor was anyone
 charged with Arapi's death. Again no official investigation was conducted.
 The trial of four men accused of having murdered four Democratic Party activists
 in Shkoder on April 2, 1991, began on December 9, 1992. On December 26, all five
 defendants were found guilty of murder. The defendants, all former police, Ministry
 of Interior, or Commnuist Party officials, were given sentences of between 16 and
 20 years.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no reported disappearances in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degraing Treatment or Punshmnt.-
 The Criminal Code prohibits the use of physical or psychological force during inves-
 tigations and provides penalties for those found guilty of a use. Opposition politi-
 cins have al eged that SHIK agents harassed and intimidated ther members on
 various occasions.
 Despite the por economic situation, prison conditions do not a ppear to threaten
 the lives and health of prisoners. Although some prisoners may be transferred to
 solitary confinement or have their privileges restricted for disciplinary purposes, all
 p~risners have the right to appeal the guards' disciplinary decisions to the prison
 director and to the Ministry of Public Order, though to what extent decisions are
 reversed is not known. Some have even sent letters to the Helsinki Commission
 complaining of food and living conditions. Prisoners may receive food, mail, and
 other packages. They are permitted to vote in all elections. Juveniles between 14
 and 18 years of age are detained in separate facilities.
 In one widely noted case, two brothers were publicly hanged in the city of Fier
 after being tried and convicted of the murder of a family of five, including a7-
 month-old chld. The two were left dangling, heads uncovered, for 2 hours efore
 famil, members were allowed to remve their bodies. Many Albanians were shocked
 at this callousness, and the Albanian Helsinki Committee prtested the incident to
 President Berisha.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exdle.-Ther were no reports of arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile.
 Police or prosecutors with evidence that a person has committed a crime may
 order the person into custody." Persons in custody may only leave their resi-
 dences wit the   rosecutor's approval. Bail, in the form of money or poperty, may
 be  reuired  if it is believed  t  h  r son  m v  nnt.  ,   fr thf   ,nit  ,
 
 
 691
 If the prosecutor believes that the person may leave Albania prior to trial or is
 a danger to society, he may order that person's arrest. In practice, more people are
 arrested than held in "custody." Within 48 hours of the arrest the polce are re-
 uied to rport to the prosecutor on their investigation and on the evidence linking
 e spe        the crime. The prosecutor has 72 hours after the arrest within whici
 to decideto go to trial or to order the person's release.
 Defendants have the right to hire a lawyer. If a defendant cannot afford one, the
 court often requests the newly founded Lawyers' Association to provide one. The de-
 fendant may meet counsel in private as frequently as desired and has the right to
 have counsel present when he meets with the prosecutor.
 The defendant or his lawyer has the right to appeal the arrest ordered by the
 prosecutor in the court of first instance. The hearing must be held within 7 days
 of the arrest in the presence of the prosecutor, the defendant, and defense counsel.
 There is no appeal of the decision of the court on this matter. The court system at-
 tempts to fo  w these procedures as closely as possible, but a severe shortage of
 train~ed, experienced legal professionals slows down the process considerably.
 e. Denial of Fair Pub  TriaL-The judicial system is comprised of the courts of
 first instance (also known as district courts), the Court of Appeals, and the Court
 of Cassation. Each of these courts is divided into three jurisdictions: criminal, civil,
 and military. A separate Constitutional Court (also known as the High Court or the
 Supreme Cwurt) can take jurisdiction of any case giving rise to a question of on-
 stitutional interpretation. The Court of Cassation hears  al from district courts,
 while the Constitutional Court reviews only those cases which require interpretation
 of the Constitution. After the March elections, President Berisha proposed Tour new
 members for the Constitutional Court and the Parlianment five. All were confirmed.
 Respeted lawyers and legal scholars were appointed to replace Communist-era
 au                                              se er.
 Ue *Parliament has the authority to appoint and dismiss judges on the Constitu-
 tional Court and the Court of Cassation. Akll other judges are appointed or dismissed
 by the Supreme Judicial Council. Judges have a lifetime appointment and may only
 be relieved of their duties by the Parliament (in the case of the Constitutional Court
 and the Court of Cassation) or the Supreme Judicial Council (in the case of other
 courts) if they die, resign of their own accord, or are convicted of a serious crime.
 A number of old regime" judges (especially in the higher courts) resigned in antici-
 pation of being fired or were fired immediately following the March elections. These
 resigations or firings took place before the new law detailing the responsibilities
 of tl~eParliament and the Supreme Judicial Council's duties in the hiring and firing
 of judges was passed. That law was passed in the spring of 1992. Many district and
 local courts continue to be staffed by Communist-era judges.
 The rule of law and priciple of an independent judiciary were not yet firmly es-
 tablished in practice. IiiAugust a Tirana judge was reprimanded by the Supreme
 Judicial Council (and according to some accounts, dismissed), reprtedy because
 President Berish disagreed with the judge's decision to let a defendant (who hap-
 pened to be another judge) out on bail. Protesting this compromise of the independ-
 ence of the judiciary, the other judges demanded a meeting with the President. In
 what some sources described as a deliberate work stoppage, the judges ceased work
 and met with President Berisha. As a result of the meeting, the judge was rein-
 stated.
 In September General Prosecutor Makaim Haxhia was dismissed from his post
 after a pariamentary vote of no onfidence. Democratic party leaders in Parliament
 who voted to fire him said he had not moved quickly or forcefully enough to compile
 evidence against former regime officials believed to have committed crimes. When
 some parliamentarians noted that removal from office should be based on concrete
 evidence and charges of malfeasance, the Democrats charged Haxhia with improper
 conduct regarding the appointment of the deputy prosecutor for the city of Vlore and
 p resented evidence that he had manipulated the selection. Haxhia alleged that he
 had run afoul of the government leadership because he refused to order the arrests
 of persons accused of crim~s but against whom there was not sufficient evidence.
 Haxhia was tried and convicted in December on the charges which Parliament
 cited when it removed him from office. He was fined the equivalent of one-half of
 1 month's salary. Courtroom procedures and the application of rles of evidence
 were inconsistant and did not meet international standards. For example, defense
 motions, subpoenas, and calls for certain witnesses were ignored by the court.
 The Law on Mdjor Constitutional Provisions provides that a trial must be held
 in public, unless it might divulge national security information. If convicted, the ac-
 cused has the right to appeal the decision within 5 days to the Court of Appeals.
 If the defendant wishes to appeal again, the Court of Cassation reviews the case
 and renders the final verdict. Deliberations on a new constitution that would further
 
 
 692
 strengthen the judicial system are ongoing, but it is unclear when any such changes
 might take effect.
 The Association of Former Political Prisoners, formed in 1991, seeks redress from
 the Government in the form of assistance with housing and schooling for prisoners'
 children or grandchildren. The Association sought pardons for those accused of anti-
 state activities, espionage, or being in the service of foreign states who were not cov-
 ered by the October 1991 parliamentary decrees overturning the convictions of most
 political prisoners. According to the Lawyers' Association, those convicted under pre-
 March 1992 penal procedures do not have the right to appeal their convictions, even
 though they were convicted without the right oa defense lawyer or subsequent ap-
 peal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not address these issues, though it
 does state that Albania guarantees "the human rights and fundamental freedoms
 as accepted in international documents.*
 Between January and March, when crime was increasing and law and order was
 a sensitive political issue, Parliament approved a number of measures, which re-
 main in effect, that created three new police organs-the Rapid Deployment Force,
 criminal police, and target police-and empowered them and those already in exist-
 ence with wide-ranging authority.
 The RDF is authorized to use force against a breakdown in order, terrorist activi-
 ties, vandalism, and arson. The forces are attached to the Ministry of Public Order
 and in times of emergency are under the command of the local chief of police and
 the local executive committee chairman. These units are also at the disposition of
 the Council of Ministers. They have the right to search residences and businesses
 when they suspect "a flagrant violation of the law" or in the event of natural disas-
 ters, including fires and accidents. They may institute road blocks and search vehi-
 cles and may take into custody and transport to the nearest police station any indi-
 vidual who refuses to identify himself when asked to do so.
 Another January law created the "criminal police" as another special police unit.
 This new unit is authorized to use special means and advanced anticrime technical
 methodology to obtain information pertaining to investigations in which it is in-
 volved, though the scope of its jurisdiction is not defined. The criminal police are
 also authorized to use orce "when necessary." These units are permitted to obtain
 information directly from the suspect, though the law states that the individual
 should offer the information "of his own free will," and are expected to exchange in-
 formation with SHIK, military intelligence, state police, and international law en-
 forcement organizations.
 Finally, the "target police" units have the duty to protect the security of economic,
 political, social, and cultural objectives," as well as 'juridical and physical persons."
 These units report directly to the Council of Ministers. These police have the au-
 thority to detain persons and to search offices and businesses.
 Plans to open and examine the files of the Sigurimi (the former secret police) are
 being developed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions
 does not specifically address freedom of speech. In practice, freedom of speech, in-
 cluding freedom to criticize the Government and government officials, is sometimes
 restricted. Albanians discuss openly the issues of the day.
 Opposition parties, with the exception of the Communist Party, independent trade
 unions, and various societies and groups may publish their own newspapers. Many
 papers, however, are constrained by shortages of newsprint. Some political party
 newspapers have reduced distribution and frequency of editions. Liko Vima, a news-
 paper in the Greek language, is published in the southern city of Gjirkaster.
 Radio and television remained state monopolies. Albania has one television sta-
 tion, while each major city has its own radio station. Since November 1991, Par-
 liament has exercised direct control over television, with some oversight duties dle-
 sgated to an Executive Committee of Radio and Television. The Executive Committee
 is comprised of 11 members from outside the Parliament. In June 1992, Parliament
 amended the 1991 law to give the Executive Committee the authority to make pro-
 gramming and editing decisions on its own. Although this distances such dcisions
 from Parlament per se, there is no mechanism to ensure (or encourage) any
 independance from government control of radio and television's editorial policies or
 programming decisions. The Executive Committee meets weekly to review past pro-
 gramming and to approve footage for the coming week's programs. Socialist critics
 nf the ('overnnwnt al lpge that televisinn served the interests of the ruling Demo-
 
 
 693
 cratic Party. Some controversial interviews and programs were not aired, reportedly
 at the request of political and governmental leaders.
 The Ministry of Education sets a standard course outline for all levels of edu-
 cation which all persons enrolled in particular majors must take. Professors are able
 to substitute texts and teach their courses in whatever manner they see fit, within
 the general guidelines set in Tirana. The ethnic Greek cultural organization Omona
 supports the establishment of a chair of Greek studies at the "university" in
 Gjirokaster, although the Albanian Ministry of Education opposes this ste p at this
 time. The Ministry of Education closed the Faculty of Philosophy at the University
 of Tirana until its curriculum can be reformed. Examinations  have been instituted
 for admission to the Faculty of Law which previously had been based on political
 influence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assem.' and Associaion.-The Law on Maor Constitu-
 tional Provisions guarantees political pluralism and provides that political parties
 be fully indepndent from statc institutions, including military and security forces.
 Political parties ma not be formed on an ethnic or religious basis. Parties with rep
 resntatives in Parliament are eligible for government funding. During the Marc
 election campaign, the Socialist government permitted all ra e byae opposition
 parties to proceed without any disruption. Several Socialist party rallies were bro.
 ken upPby opponents, incidents which Socialist leaders protested to then President
 Alia and several international organizations.
 After the Party of Labor (Communist Party) changed its name to the Socialist
 Party in June 1991, a small breakaway group formed a Communist Party and won
 minuscule support in the March elections. Nevertheless, in July Parliament passed
 a law banning all ancist racist, antinational, Marxist-Leninist, Enverist (followers
 of former dictator Enver duoxha), and Stalinist" parties, including the Communist
 Party. Deputies in Pariamnt, including the Socialists, declared that, as the Con-
 stitution states Albanias economy is based on the free market, only parties which
 Auport this view have the right to exist. The Constitutional Court upheld the prohi-
 bition of the Communist Party.
 An organization must apply to the Ministry of Justice to e officially certified. It
 must declare an aim or purpose which is not contrary to the constitution or laws
 of Albania. It must describe its organizational structure and acount for bth public
 and private funds it receives. The Constitutional Court upheld a prohibition of the
 activities of a group of former military officials who had failed to gt the necessary
 authorization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion has been established in both theory
 and practice. The Government legalized the private and public practice of religion
 in 1990. The Law on Mtjor Constitutional Provisions declares Albania to be "a secu-
 lar state" which "rspects the freedom of religious faith and creates conditions to
 exercise it."
 Controversy over the appointments of the Archbishop and three bishops of the Al-
 banian Autocephalous Orthodox Church focused attention on the Government's role
 in church affairs. In May the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul named three bishops
 of Greek origin to the Dioceses of Korea, Berat, and Gjirkaster. Under public pres-
 sure to approve only ethnic Albanian candidates for such positions, although there
 were none qualified, the Government refused to age to their installation. When
 an ethnic Greek, Anastas Janullatos, was named Orthodox Archbishop of Albania,
 a storm of protest erupted Anastas was installed, and the Government has tacitly
 accepted him until an ethnic Albanian replacement can be round.
 Questi on   nerning property confiscated by the Communists from religious orga-
 nizations have yet to be resolved.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patliation.-There   re sno oner any restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country, and regulations on foreign travel and emigration have been revised.
 Passports are available to all citizens, and the practice of limiting them to specific
 countries of destination was abandoned in 1991. A presidential edict in Jul opened
 the way to dual citizenship for Albanian-born citizens of all foreign countries; how-
 ever, some citizens who let as refugees in 1990 and returned from the United
 States and Western Europe in 1992 encountered difficulties when departing the
 country again.
 As in 1991, thousands of would-k economic emigrants attempted to flee Albania,
 principally through the port of Durres anoed ovend to Greece. Approximately
 10,   young men began walking to Durres afiar rumors circulated in Tirana that
 ships in port would take them to Italy. Afterth  were turned back peacefully from
 Durres, they attempted to enter the diplomatic quarter in Tirana in hope that West-
 ern countries would       s ive them visas.
 
 
 694
 In January 1992, offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) approved a grant
 of $1.6 million to inform Albanian citizens of opportunities for legal migration to
 other countries. After the March elections, the Ministry of Labor, Social Assistance,
 Ex-Political Prisoners, and Emigration was founded. The Government has empha-
 sized developingtraining programs at home and promoting employment opportuni-
 ties in Western Europe to ease unemployment pressures in Albania.
 The Government was looking at contingency plans in the event large numbers of
 refugees were forced to flee from Kosovo to Albania. By October some 2,000 ethnic
 Albanians had already arrived in Albania, most of whom fled Kosovo to avoid the
 draft. Neither the Government nor the UNHCR had a program, so the refugees
 often stayed with families who agreed to take them in.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions provides citizens with the right to
 change their government 'by free, general, equal, direct and secret ballot.' Under
 this Law and the law adopted for the March parliamentary elections, voters directly
 elected 100 of the 140 deputies, while the remaining 40 were apportioned on the
 basis of nationwide party vote percentages, with a minimum 4-percent threshold.
 The election campaign and actual balloting in the March elections were judged by
 most international observers to have been free and fair. Opposition parties had good
 access to radio and television and were unhindered in publishing their newspapers.
 International observers, however, witnessed serious voting irregularities in plain
 view of ethnic Greek election officials in favor of the Unity Party in ethnic Greek
 areas. Some non-Greek Socialist and Democratic Party candidates in ethnic Greek
 areas and one ethnic Greek candidate of the Unity for Human Rights Party were
 harrassed.
 The opposition Democratic Party won 62 percent of the popular vote and 92 of
 140 seats in Parliament. The Socialist Party polled 27 percent, giving it 38 seats.
 Other parties winning representation were the Social Democrats, Unity for Human
 Rights, and Republicans.
 The President was elected by a minimum two-thirds vote of the Members of Par-
 liament. After the March election, President Ramiz Alia resigned, and the chairman
 of the Democratic Party, Dr. Sali Berisha, was elected to replace him. He appointed
 Aleksandr Meksi as Prime Minister, who formed a coalition Government of Demo-
 crats, Republicans, and Social Democrats.
 During the campaign for parliamentary elections in 1991, Omonia, the national
 political and cultural organization of the ethnic Greek minority, constituting 3 to 5
 percent of the population, had been permitted to field candidates. The law governing
 the March elections, however, allowed only political parties, not ethnic organiza-
 tions, to participate in the elections. Omonia protested to international organiza-
 tions, and although Omonia was not allowed to take part, a new party, the Unity
 for Human Rights Party, was created by Omonia leaders and ran candidates pn-
 marily in the ethnic Greek areas of southern Albania.
 The law regulating local elections, which were held in July, provided for direct
 election of local officials. The local elections, however, did not match the March elec-
 tions in terms of organization. The Socialists topped the Democrats in the number
 of actual candidates elected by a margin of 47 percent to 36 percent of some 5,000
 positions at stake. Other smaller parties, including the Social Democrats, the Re-
 publicans, and the Unity for Human Rights Party, each won races in approximately
 3 percent of the districts.
 In 1992 an independent Albanian group, the Society for Free Elections and Demo-
 cratic Culture, was established to monitor elections and to assist with the country's
 difficult transition to democracy.
 There are no impediments, in law or practice, to the participation of women in
 politics or government, but few women competed in the elections or won office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Albania's irst domestic human rights association, the Forum for the Defense of
 Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, changed its name in March to the Alba-
 nian Helsinki Committee. The organization took an active and public role in defend-
 ing human rights and remained independent of the Socialist and Democratic Gov-
 ernments. The International Helsinki Commission expressed concern about the abil-
 ity of the local Helsinki Committee to maintain its independance from the govern-
 ment.
 
 
 695
 Delegations from the International Helsinki Commission made several visits to
 Albania, during which they conferred with political officials and representatives of
 the ethnic Greek minority, and visited prisons, mental hospitals, and other state fa-
 cilities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 While no official statistics exist regarding the sizes of various ethnic communities
 in Albania, ethnic Greeks are the most organized and receive the most attention and
 assistance from abroad. Ethnic Greek leaders believe there are about 70,000-80,000
 ethnic Greeks in Albania, with an equal number of ethnic Greek Albanians now liv-
 ing in Greece. Vlach leaders claim their community (which speaks a Romance lan-
 guage) numbers close to 300,000, although this is unlikely. Small ethnic Macedonian
 villages exist in the northeast, as well as Serbian communities. Without any provo-
 cation or encouragement, the small Serbian community in Shkoder recently left Al-
 bania to return to Serbia.
 Two distinct groups of Roma (Gypsies), the Jevg and the Arrixhi (Gabel), reside
 in Albania. The Jevg are more likely to be settled in urban areas and more inte-
 grated into the Albanian economy than the Arrixhi. There is seldom intermarriage
 or contact of any significant kind between the two groups. In 1992 Jevg Roma in
 Albania formed an association to present the Government with various cultural de-
 mands. Both groups encounter societal discrimination.
 Government officials have professed publicly their su pport for full minority rights
 in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter
 of the CSCE. Ethnic groups have demanded government funding for education in
 their primaiy languages. These demands have not been met by the Albanian Gov-
 ernment, which cites the desperate lack of funds.
 Members of the Greek minority can receive schooling in the Greek language for
 the first 5 years of primary school. Omenia pressed for classes in the Greek lan-
 guage through the 8th grade, with the option to continue through secondary school.
 The group wanted the Government to approve funds for the creation of a chair in
 Greekstdies at the Univerity of Gjirkaster. A primary school was approved for
 Saranda but has not yet been established.
 On February 13, in the southern city of Saranda, a large crowd of Albanians
 stoned and looted six Greek shops. Police present at the scene, reportedly fired
 shots in the air after most of the damage had been done. Four persons, identified
 as the ringleaders, were subsequently arrested. The crowd was incited by news re-
 ports that an Albanian national, Agur Emini, found by Greek authorities to have
 entered Greece illegally, was beaten, abused and set  ire by military personnel or
 border guards and then left for dead at the border.
 Tensions between ethnic Greeks and Albanians increased in other southern cities
 as thousands of ethnic Greeks were bussed back by Omonia from Greece to vote in
 the elections. Omonia and the Unity for Human Rights Party continue to argue
 that, in accordance with various international commitments, the Government should
 permit ethnic organizations to participate in elections even though they are not con-
 stituted as political parties.
 Vlachs also demanded government-funded education in their language. They also
 wanted the Government to allocate 2 or 3 hours per week of television and radio
 time for them to air cultural programming, as well as funds to restore several early
 18th-century churches and monasteries that have deteriorated over the years. In
 August Albania and Macedonia agreed that Macedonia will fund Macedonian-lan-
 guage education in several villages near the border.
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not address women's rights. Al-
 though women have equal access to higher education, they are not accorded full,
 equal treatment with men. Domestic violence undoubtedly exists, but no statistics
 are kept. Police are seldom called to intervene in cases of family abuse, and women
 almost never bring charges against spouses.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers obtained the right to create independent
 trade unions in 1991. The Independent Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania
 (BSPSH) was formed as the umbrella organization for a number of smaller unions.
 There were several serious conflicts and splits within the Confederation during
 1992. Both the Socialist and Democratic Governments avoided any involvement in
 the internal affairs of the BSPSH. A separate, rival federation continued to operate
 in close cooperation with the Socialist Party. That federation-the Confederation of
 Unions-was a continuation of the "official federation of the Communist period. In
 1992 civilian workers in the defense industries organized a union, as did teachers.
 
 
 696
 The Miners' Union broke away from the BSPSH to create its own association in Sep-
 tember. Coal miners and oil workers founded a new Energy Workers' Union.
 According to the Law on Constitutional Provisions, all workers, with the exception
 of employees of military enterprises, have the right to strike. Public sector workers,
 both white and blue collar, have freely formed independent unions and enjoy the
 right to strike, but are barred from taking part in "political," rather than "eco-
 nomic," strikes. Newly organized teachers staged a 1-day protest strike to highlight
 demands for higher wages, which the Government granted.
 All large enterprises remain state owned. Union leaders were disappointed with
 the Law on State Enterprises, which denies unions a major role in the management
 of factories. Labor disputes flared openly in August when unemployed workers from
 a munitions factory in Polican clashed with police, and 17 people, including 5 chil-
 dren, were injured. In the course of a demonstration, Socialist union leaders took
 the chief of police and another officer hostage leading to a 2-day standoff. Prime
 Minister Meksi ordered the RDF to Polican, a~er which a peaceful settlement was
 negotiated.
 The BSPSH has observer status in the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions in Brussels and close working ties with the American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of International Organizations and Italian unions. Individual Alba-
 nian trade unions have ties with their corresponding trade secretariats in Brussels
 and elsewhere.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment have the right to organize and bargain collectively, except members of the
 armed forces, civilian personnel employed in the armed forces, and employees of cer-
 tain state administrative organs. In practice, unions deal directly with the Govern-
 ment, since very little privatization has occurred outside of the retail and agricul-
 tural sectors.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by the
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions, and no cases of forced labor were reported
 in 1992.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions sets the minimum age for employment at 14. Persons between the ages
 of 14 and 16 may only work 5 hours per day. Working conditions for those over 16
 are not legislated. Although the law mandates education through the eighth grade
 and prohibits work by those younger than 14, there are no enforcement mechanisms
 to curb either truancy or child labor. In rural areas, children are often called on to
 assist families with agricultural work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Current law does not address working condi-
 tions, although this subject is likely to be addressed in a new constitution, when
 enacted. Working conditions in Albania's few operating industrial sites are poor.
 While there is no minimum wage in Albania, the Government does provide some
 unemployment compensation which is drawn by a significant portion of the work
 force. It is extremely difficult to survive on this amount, and the average employed
 worker makes little more. There is no legislated workweek but full-time employment
 (if there were enough economic activity to create such employment), would be 48
 hours.
