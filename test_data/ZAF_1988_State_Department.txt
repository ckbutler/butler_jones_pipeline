 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa's laws codify the doctrine of apartheid, which
 prescribes the basic rights and obligations of people
 according to their racial or ethnic origin. The country's
 black majority (73.4 percent of its population) suffers from
 pervasive, legally sanctioned discrimination based on race in
 political, economic, and social aspects of life. The
 "colored" (mixed-race) and Asian minorities (9.1 percent and
 2.8 percent of the population respectively) also suffer from
 extensive racial discrimination, although to a somewhat lesser
 degree than South Africa's black population. While the
 Government claims that South Africa is a parliamentary
 democracy, blacks continue to be denied the right to vote in
 national elections and.the right to be represented in
 Parliament. Until 1984 South Africa's national political
 institutions were reserved for whites (14.7 percent of the
 population). A new Constitution, implemented in 1984, created
 a tricameral Parliament with separate chambers for whites,
 "coloreds," and Asians. The terms of the Constitution ensure
 continued parliamentary control by whites over key affairs.
 In addition, the executive branch (headed by a state president
 with extraordinarily strong powers) continues to be controlled
 by whites.
 Since 1948 the Afrikaner-dominated National Party, presently
 led by State President Pieter W. Botha, has been responsible
 for the development of the complex legislation and
 institutions comprising the apartheid system. Central to this
 policy of separate, racially based political institutions was
 the creation, beginning in the 1950's, of 10 "homelands" to
 which blacks were assigned on the basis of ethnic background.
 These homelands comprise only 13 percent of South Africa's
 area and are generally fragmented bits of land in impoverished
 rural areas. Since 1976 the Government has granted
 "independence" to four homelands, thereby stripping an
 estimated 8 million South African blacks of their South
 African citizenship. South Africa is the only country that
 has recognized the "independence" of these homelands. Outside
 the homelands, a growing black urban population, increasingly
 detribalized, of over 10 million persons are forced, under
 apartheid legislation, to live in massive, segregated
 townships on the periphery of the big cities.
 Since the late 1970's, the South African Government (SAG) has
 introduced piecemeal reforms that ameliorate some aspects of
 apartheid but do not threaten continued white control of the
 nation's key political structures. At the same time, black
 opposition to apartheid has increased dramatically, as many
 reforms are widely regarded as attempts by the Government to
 freeze blacks out of national political participation. In
 1988 the Government also came under increasing pressure from
 parties advocating stricter enforcement of apartheid laws and
 suppression of antiapartheid activity.
 White control of the Government is backed by a powerful
 defense and police establishment, especially the South African
 Defense Force (SADF), with over 95,000 active duty personnel
 and nearly 400,000 reservists, and the South African Police
 (SAP), with 56,000 members. In recent years the SADF has been
 used to assist SAP in internal security matters, especially in
 patroling the black townships. The National Security
 Management System (NSMS), established to coordinate
 intelligence services and government departments, has in the
 last few years assumed greater influence over several aspects
 
 
 320
 SOUTH AFRICA
 of government policy designed to minimize and suppress black
 discontent, including setting "levels" of state of emergency
 detentions as well as providing development assistance and
 social services. The NSMS, staffed primarily by police and
 military officials, is in many ways a "parallel government,"
 accountable only to the cabinet-level State Security Council,
 which is chaired by the State President and includes South
 Africa's leading military, intelligence, and security
 officials. During 1988 the Government continued to increase
 special black security forces known as "instant police"
 (because of the brevity of their training) and in some cases
 gave tacit support to conservative black vigilante groups.
 South African security forces have, in effect, a free hand in
 operating in tandem with police forces in the "independent"
 homelands.
 Apartheid laws discriminate against blacks in housing,
 employment, and education, and serve to perpetuate a gross
 income disparity between whites and blacks. Starting in 1984,
 a serious economic downturn aggravated the suffering of black
 South Africans and helped to fuel political unrest. Since
 1987 the overall economic situation has improved, and
 indicators suggest an annual real growth rate of about 2 to
 2.5 percent over the next 2 years. Local economists, however,
 have estimated that an annual real growth rate above 5 percent
 is necessary for the economy to absoxb the roughly 300,000
 black entrants into the labor market each year. An even
 higher rate of growth would be necessary to reduce present
 black unemployment, which is estimated at 25 to 30 percent and
 as high as 50 percent in the homelands.
 The human rights situation in South Africa continued to
 deteriorate in 1988 as the Government took additional harsh
 measures to repress opposition to apartheid, including
 nonviolent political activity. In February the Government
 effectively banned 17 antiapartheid organizations, including
 the United Democratic Front (UDF), a loosely organized
 national movement of more than 600 antiapartheid groups, and
 prohibited the largest union, the black-controlled Congress of
 South African Trade Unions (COSATU), from engaging in
 political activities; in 1988 a total of 32 organizations were
 banned. The state of emergency (SOE) was extended in June for
 the third consecutive year, with even tougher restrictions on
 antiapartheid groups and the media. These tight SOE
 restrictions further reduced available information about the
 current situation, including the number of detentions and the
 extent of political violence. Best estimates at the end of
 1988 indicated the Government had used the emergency powers to
 detain hundreds of key nonwhite opposition leaders and
 organizers. At the end of the year, an estimated 1,500 people
 were being held without charge, down slightly from estimates
 at the end of 1987; hundreds of these have been held
 continuously since the imposition of the June 1986 SOE. While
 the number of detained children decreased in 1988, reports
 regarding torture of detainees, including some under age 18,
 continued. On the postive side, towards the end of the year
 the Government released several prominent political prisoners
 and commuted the death sentences of the Sharpeville Six, who
 had been convicted of murder for their presence in a crowd
 that had killed a township official. At the same time,
 commutations were granted to two white policemen convicted of
 murdering a black man while on duty.
 There were waves of political violence emanating from various
 quarters, and overall political violence during 1988 appeared
 
 
 321
 SOUTH AFRICA
 to be at or above 1987 levels, though still below 1984-86.
 The shadowy war between the African National Congress (ANC)
 and South African Security Forces continued, with a disturbing
 increase in attacks on civilian targets. South African
 security forces and/or rightwing sympathizers were suspected
 of involvement in the unsolved killing of youth activist
 Sicelo Dhlomo, the assassination of ANC Paris representative
 Dulcie September, attacks on ANC targets in neighboring
 countries, including an attempt on the life of ANCtheorist
 Albie Sachs in Maputo, and a series of mysterious political
 killings and bombings directed against antiapartheid groups.
 There were, however, fewer instances in 1988 than in previous
 years of overt South African military intervention in
 neighboring countries.- The ANC, with a major change in its
 military wing at the beginning of 1988, was suspected of
 involvement in numerous bomb explosions aimed at civilian
 targets, in part to disrupt the municipal elections held in
 October. In addition, violence between rival black
 organizations, e.g., clashes between UDF supporters and Chief
 Buthelezi's Zulu-led Inkatha movement, continued at a high
 level in Natal. While townships in the rest of the country
 remained quiet relative to the 1984-86 period, occasional
 attacks on black "collaborators" continued. Candidates in the
 October municipal elections were particular targets.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political violence continued to plague South Africa in 1988.
 Accurate statistics on the number of deaths related to
 political violence remained difficult to obtain due to
 restrictions on reporting incidents of unrest. The Government
 claimed that the level of unrest continued to decline under
 the SOE. Incidents of violence have probably remained below
 the peak 1984-86 levels. However, even the Government's daily
 reports suggested violence above 1987 levels during 1988.
 Monitoring groups estimated that at least 846 people died
 between June 1987 and June 1988, compared to some 695 during
 the same period a year earlier.
 Political killings stemmed from different sources.  During
 1988 court cases and out-of-court settlements continued to
 reveal police excesses and suggested the existence of police
 "death squads" operating completely outside the law both
 inside and outside the country. In March uncontradicted
 police testimony at the murder trial of a South African
 policeman gave direct evidence of SAG responsibility for the
 killings of three ANC members in Swaziland in July 1987. In
 September a number of senior police officials from the Ciskei
 homeland were arrested for the July 1987 murder of Institute
 for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa (IDASA)
 organizer Eric Mntonga. On January 12, Sithembele Zokwe was
 fatally shot 2 hours after his detention by Transkei security
 police. Two members of the Transkei police have been charged
 with murder in the incident. South African involvement was
 widely suspected in the murder of ANC Paris representative
 Dulcie September in March and the attempted assassination by
 car bomb of ANC member Albie Sachs in Mozambique in April, but
 these cases remained unsolved. Morever, South African
 security forces continued to carry out raids into other
 neighboring countries. In March and June, SADF attacks in
 
 
 322
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Botswana killed four and critically wounded an unarmed
 Botswana policeman.
 It was widely suspected in 1988 that white militant extremists
 were involved in some bomb attacks, including on religious
 property. In any event, mysterious bomb blasts directed
 against antiapartheid groups and trade unions and killings of
 antiapartheid activists continued throughout 1988. In August
 a powerful and sophisticated bomb wrecked Khotso House in
 Johannesburg, the headquarters of the South African Council of
 Churches and several other antiapartheid groups, injuring 21
 people. Offices of the Community Resources and Information
 Center (CRIC) in Johannesburg, an antiapartheid research
 group, have been the target of numerous arson attacks, the
 latest in April destroying most of the organization's
 documents. In October the headquarters of the Southern
 African Bishops' Conference, located in downtown Pretoria, was
 destroyed in an early morning firebomb attack. Seven
 overnight visitors, including two bishops and a nun, narrowly
 escaped serious injury or death. South African security
 forces have never caught or brought to trial the perpetrators
 of any of these bombings.
 In January Sicelo Dhlomo, a youth activist who had appeared in
 an American television production about apartheid, was found
 murdered a few days after he had been questioned by police. A
 close friend of Dhlomo's was murdered in early June after
 being threatened by police. Nearly all mysterious killings
 occurring in previous years remained unsolved.
 The conflict between the ANC and South African security forces
 continued with an increase in ANC attacks on "soft targets"
 (where civilians are likely to be injured or killed) inside
 South Africa, although ANC spokesmen have denied any change of
 strategy. There is evidence of divisions within the ANC
 leadership on the question of attacking civilians. A major
 reshuffle in the leadership of the military wing of the ANC
 (Umkhonto we Sizwe) took place in early 1988. The new leaders
 are reported to be popular with young blacks inside South
 Africa. It also appears that the external (Lusaka-based)
 organization does not have complete control over its
 operatives once they have entered South Africa or over its
 sympathizers in the country. Other organizations, such as the
 Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), may also be involved in attacks
 in South Africa.
 In the first 8 months of the year, the civilian attacks
 included at least 40 explosions, killing at least 17 people
 and injuring approximately 200. On March 17, a bomb exploded
 outside the Krugersdorp magistrate's court, killing 3 and
 injuring 20. On April 15, there were two blasts near a cinema
 complex in Pretoria, killing one. On May 26, two bombs
 exploded in central Pretoria, injuring four. On June 3, 4
 persons were killed and 19 injured by a bomb blast at a
 shopping center in Roodepoort, near Johannesburg. On June 22,
 10 people were injured, including 2 pregnant women who
 suffered miscarriages, in a blast at a video game arcade in
 Johannesburg. A June 30 explosion in a Pretoria fast food
 restaurant injured 18. A car bomb exploded near a rugby
 stadium in July, killing 2 and injuring 39. Also in July, 1
 woman was killed and 56 people injured when a bomb wrecked a
 crowded Wimpy's restaurant in Benoni, near Johannesburg.
 There were numerous reports of clashes between government
 forces and ANC guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the
 
 
 323
 SOUTH AFRICA
 country. On March 29, the SADF reportedly killed four
 suspected ANC commandos in a shootout in the Venda
 "independent" homeland. In June the SAG announced that
 security forces had killed nine ANC commandos attempting to
 infiltrate near the Swazi border. In May police arrested four
 white alleged ANC members near Pretoria and reportedly
 confiscated a weapons cache which included a SAM missile. The
 SAG claimed in June that 19 ANC members had been killed and at
 least 106 arrested since the beginning of the year. The
 Government also claimed that two PAC members were among four
 people killed in a shootout with South African security forces
 at a roadblock in July.
 In Natal political factional fighting between UDF and COSATU
 supporters and members of Chief (KwaZulu) Gatsha Buthelezi's
 Inkatha movement continued. Peace negotiations between the
 two groups were concluded in early September when COSATU and
 Inkatha leaders signed an agreement condemning past violence,
 pledging to cease acts of intimidation, and establishing a
 complaints adjudication system, which is now in place.  An
 estimated 789 people died in the Pietermaritzburg area between
 June 1987 and September 1988. The violence peaked during the
 October 1987-February 1988 period, then abated somewhat before
 accelerating again in July and August, when 101 people died.
 While the Inkatha-COSATU agreement had a calming effect in the
 Peitermaritzburg townships, violence in other areas in Natal
 continued, with 80 to 100 deaths reported in October and
 November. In December vigilantes killed 11 people in an
 attack on a prayer meeting near Greytown.
 Outside Natal, the townships remained quiet relative to the
 1984-86 period. However, renewed violence between black
 factions in the KTC squatter camp near Cape Town (named after
 the Kakaza Trading Center grocery store on the edge of the
 camp) resulted in 8 deaths and the destruction of over 600
 dwellings early in the year. In February an aborted coup in
 the "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana left five dead
 and led to the intervention of the SADF.
 There were occasional attacks on township government
 officials, black policemen, and other suspected
 "collaborators" in 1988. In March three black municipal
 policeman were killed in the Pretoria township of
 Atteridgeville. In May a Soweto meeting of the conservative
 black Sofasonke Party was attacked with grenades, resulting in
 5 deaths and 37 injuries. Two Sofasonke candidates for the
 Soweto Council were killed during the year.
 b. Disappearance
 In recent years many people have disappeared into police
 custody for long periods. Some are suspected by friends and
 associates to have been killed by security forces. South
 African law and SOE regulations do not require notification of
 a person's family, lawyer, or any other person in the event of
 his or her detention, and they prohibit the unauthorized
 publication of the name of any detainee if "the prevention of
 or combating of terroristic activities" is the stated reason
 for the detention.
 Maisha "Stanza" Bopape, a CRIC staff member and township
 activist, disappeared in June. Police claim that Bopape
 escaped from custody, but his associates believe that he was
 killed. The case of Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organization
 leaders Sipho Hashe, Champion Galela, and Qaqawuli Godolozi,
 
 
 324
 SOUTH AFRICA
 who disappeared in May 1985, remained unsolved. According to
 local human rights groups, during 1988 numerous persons said
 by police to have been released from detention had disappeared
 with no trace.
 It is difficult to know in many instances if persons who have
 disappeared have been detained. Since August 1986, the
 Minister of Law and Order periodically has tabled lists of SOE
 detainees in Parliament, but these lists, which include only
 detainees held for at least 30 days, appear to be incomplete.
 As of the end of 1988, these lists constituted the
 Government's only official public accounting of emergency
 detainees. Human rights monitoring groups estimated that
 substantial numbers of detainees have not been named in the
 Government's lists and maintained that in most cases family
 members were not informed of emergency detentions.
 Following the June 1986 state of emergency declaration, and in
 the wake of subsequent crackdowns on various opposition
 organizations, many black activists left the country
 surreptitiously or went into hiding to avoid detention. These
 circumstances further complicated the task of accurately
 accounting for the many persons who reportedly have
 disappeared. Government press curbs imposed in December 1986
 prohibited news reporting on detention cases and on unresolved
 litigation concerning detentions without prior government
 clearance, which made the task of accounting for missing
 persons still more problematic.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Internal Security Act (ISA) allows for lengthy periods of
 incommunicado detention during which authorities are not
 obliged to present formal charges, a situation which provides
 considerable potential for police abuse of detainees.
 During 1988 court testimony and numerous sworn affidavits and
 court applications provided strong evidence of claims by
 lawyers and human rights activists that severe beatings and
 torture are a common experience for security detainees. Laws
 exempting law enforcement officials from both criminal and
 civil liability for "good faith" acts undertaken in enforcing
 the state of emergency have been cited by many observers as
 giving police a license to engage in abusive conduct.
 Affidavits submitted to a court by a number of KwaNdebele
 residents detail extensive detentions and torture in the
 homeland. In January the Pretoria Supreme Court issued an
 order restraining the KwaNdebele police from assaulting two
 emergency detainees and keeping them in unhygienic conditions.
 In April an application submitted to the Pretoria Supreme
 Court alleged that Peter Mokaba, the detained president of the
 South African Youth Congress, had been kept chained to a chair
 for days by his interrogators. Jackie Seroke, the editor of
 Skotaville Publishers, testified in court that he had been
 blindfolded, assaulted, and kept naked after his arrest in
 September 1987. Alfred Makeleng, a 27-year-old trade unionist
 and UDF activist held without charge for over 2 years, died in
 August after being transferred to a hospital in a brain-dead
 state. Although an official inquest ascribed his death to
 natural causes, his trade union associates and lawyer charged
 that Makeleng's known medical problems had been ignored by
 prison authorities despite repeated complaints and requests
 for medical attention.
 
 
 325
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Numerous incidents of torture involving young detainees, many
 under the age of 18, occurred at the Protea police station in
 Soweto. A number of sworn affidavits were submitted
 supporting urgent court applications which sought to restrain
 police from assaulting various detainees. The State did not
 contest the applications, and a number of the young detainees
 involved were released. In June the British Broadcasting
 Corporation broadcast a documentary detailing torture suffered
 by child detainees, supported by photographs and interviews.
 According to the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) at
 the University of the Witwatersrand, there are currently 40
 lawsuits pending in the Transkei arising out of alleged
 unlawful activities of the security police, including unlawful
 arrest, assault, and torture. CALS detailed a case study of
 one Mrs. Matoti, who was subjected to having a canvas bag full
 of dirty water placed over her head, with the mouth of the bag
 held tightly around her neck in order to suffocate her.
 According to CALS, many Transkei detainees claimed to have
 experienced this method of torture. There was also widespread
 evidence of torture in the other "independent" homelands of
 Venda, Ciskei, and Bophuthatswana.
 Amnesty International's 1988 report (covering 1987) stresses
 the wide variety of techniques used to torture and mistreat
 detainees, especially political detainees, including the use
 of the water bag over the head, electric shocks, and
 rhinoceros-hide whips.
 Although the Government made no serious sustained effort in
 1988 to hold erring police and other security force members
 accountable for abuse of detainees, there were some
 indications that the Government was concerned about the
 deteriorating image of the police. In June three Johannesburg
 police officers who were the subject of numerous complaints
 resigned following their transfer to less active posts. In
 May two white policemen were sentenced to death after
 conviction for the unprovoked assault and murder of a black
 man while on township duty. The State President later
 commuted the sentences to 15 and 20 years in prison. At the
 same time, two Johannesburg policemen facing death penalties
 for a drug-related murder had their sentences commuted to 15
 and 25 years. In KwaNdebele, where abusive behavior by police
 was rampant, the commissioner of police and his deputy were
 transferred in June.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The ISA authorizes the Minister of Law and Order to order
 detention without trial for varying--in many instances
 unlimited--periods of time. Under Section 28 of the ISA, the
 Minister of Law and Order may issue "preventive detention"
 orders allowing for detention for up to 180 days in "unrest
 situations." Under section 29, police officials have broad
 powers to detain people for interrogation when offenses such
 as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting a revolution are
 suspected. People detained under the ISA may receive visits
 from their attorneys .and families only at the discretion of
 the commissioner of police. This permission is often denied.
 Many people detained under Section 29 have been held for long
 periods without any questioning taking place.
 On June 10, 1988, the Government renewed for another year the
 June 1986 state of emergency. Under the emergency, SADF
 members and police officers down to the rank of constable are
 
 
 326
 SOUTH AFRICA
 empowered to detain persons for up to 30 days. Police station
 cells may be used as the place of detention for the first 14
 days only, after which detainees must be transferred to prison
 cells unless the commissioner of police grants an exception.
 After 30 days the Minister of Law and Order may extend the
 detention for an indefinite period of time, limited only by
 the duration of the SOE. Emergency detainees may be denied
 access to lawyers and have no right to a hearing before the
 Minister extends the detention. They are frequently kept in
 solitary confinement.
 As in 1987, black trade union officials and members of the UDF
 were particular targets of state of emergency detentions. At
 the end of 1988, most of the national leadership of the UDF
 remained in detention, and it was estimated that three of
 every four detainees were members of the UDF or affiliated
 organizations. The Government has detained the entire
 executive committee of the UDF-affilated National Educational
 Crisis Committee (NECC), an umbrella organization of parents,
 teachers, and students, which had entered into negotiations
 with the Government to end the widespread school boycotts of
 1986. Opposition political leaders charged that many people
 were being detained under the emergency regulations on dubious
 evidence, often on the word of informers, who themselves may
 have been under pressure to accuse others.
 The Government has detained more than 30,000 people since the
 June 1986 declaration of a state of emergency. Monitoring
 groups estimate that only about 4 percent of those detained
 have been convicted of any criminal offenses. At the end of
 August, the Government listed the names of 18,911 people held
 for over 30 days since June 12, 1986. In April CALS estimated
 the total number of people detained in the 10 months since
 June 12, 1987 (including detentions of less than 30 days) at
 5,000. At the end of September the Government acknowledged
 that 1,000 people were in detention. Human rights monitoring
 groups estimate that about 1,500 people were in detention at
 the end of the year, and believed that as many as 800 of these
 detainees were part of a core group held for over 2 years,
 with no indication of when they would be freed. In late 1988,
 there were increasing reports that many of these long-term
 detainees were suffering from serious health and psychological
 problems. The Government's refusal to provide specific
 statistics or complete lists of those being held made it
 difficult to confirm estimates of the number of detainees.
 Statistics on detentions failed to account fully for what
 appeared to be a common police tactic of detaining political
 activists, especially youths, and holding them for a few hours
 or overnight, during which time they were interrogated,
 threatened, and often beaten. In addition, many people have
 been arrested on criminal charges during incidents of unrest.
 At least 2,000 people, many of them under the age of 18, were
 serving sentences for "public violence" as a result of
 convictions stemming from incidents of political unrest.
 There were hundreds of detentions early in the year in the
 Pietermaritzburg and Natal Midlands area; almost all those
 detained were UDF activists, with no known detentions of
 vigilantes or Inkatha members. At least 452 people were
 detained in the "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana
 following the aborted February coup. Most were later released
 or charged with treason.
 Before the Detainees' Parents Support Committee's (DPSC)
 effective banning, it estimated that 25 percent of the
 
 
 327
 SOUTH AFRICA
 estimated 30,000-plus people detained since June 1986 were
 under the age of 18 at the time of their detention. In
 February Law and Order Minister Vlok stated that 1,338 persons
 under the age of 18 were detained under the SOE in 1987, 290
 of these 15 and under. This figure did not include those held
 for under 30 days.
 The activist National Medical and Dental Association stated in
 June that between January and May its doctors had examined 3
 recently released ex-detainees between the ages of 10 and 14,
 and 13 between the ages of 15 and 17. In March Vlok confirmed
 that 234 SOE detainees age 17 and under were being held in
 nonhomeland South Africa, 169 of them in Natal. In early July
 the office of the Black Sash in Johannesburg listed 50
 16-year-olds and 58 17-year-olds in detention in the
 Transvaal. No statistics were available on child detainees in
 the rest of the country.
 Many political figures, community and human rights activists,
 lawyers, churchmen, trade union officials, journalists, and
 others have been detained under the state of emergency.
 Prominent figures remaining in detention at the end of 1988
 included Easterft Cape activists Edgar Ngoyi, Henry Fazzie, and
 Mkuseli Jack, along with virtually the entire leadership of
 the UDF in the Eastern Cape. Peter Mokaba, president of the
 South African Youth Congress (SAYCO) was detained in March.
 Two persons detained since 1986, law professor Raymond Suttner
 and New Nation editor Zwelakhe Sisulu, were released in late
 1988 but severely restricted (see below). In September UDF
 leaders Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli, along with NECC
 president Vusi Khanyile, escaped from detention and took
 temporary refuge in the U.S. Consulate General in
 Johannesburg. They left the Consulate General on October 19
 after the Government publicly stated that they would not be
 redetained. At the end of the year, none of the three were in
 detention, and no restrictions had been placed on them.
 The ISA authorizes the Minister of Law and Order to issue
 "banning" orders severely restricting the activities of any
 person judged by the Minister to be endangering law and order,
 threatening state security, or "promoting the aims of
 communism" or an unlawful organization. According to the
 South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR), over 1,400
 South Africans have been banned at some time since 1950.
 While the Government appears to have abandoned the practice of
 formally banning persons under the ISA, the effective banning
 of persons has returned under the guise of SOE "restrictions."
 These restrictions can include, among other things,
 prohibitions on travel outside a city or district, strict
 curfews, prohibitions on attending meetings or talking to
 journalists, and requirements to report daily to the local
 police station (as often as twice a day).
 Under the new SOE legislation of February, restriction orders
 were served on 13 prominent antiapartheid activists, including
 UDF copresidents Archie Gumede and Albertina Sisulu and UDF
 treasurer Azhar Cachalia. An estimated 500 to 1,000 persons
 had been restricted by the end of the year. New regulations
 published in September allow the Government to restrict people
 simply by publishing their names, with no need to serve the
 orders personally. Banishment is still practiced in the
 "independent" homeland of Transkei.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The South African judiciary is headed by the Appellate
 Division of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein and six regional
 Supreme Courts. All judges of South Africa's higher courts
 are white, as are the vast majority of its magistrates. They
 are appointed to the bench by the State President. They serve
 until age 70 and cannot be removed from office except by
 impeachment by Parliament. By tradition, judges of the
 Appellate Division and the Supreme Courts are appointed to the
 bench from the ranks of the elite corps of South African
 Supreme Court practitioners ("advocates").
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Dutch and Enqlish
 jurisprudence. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including
 capital crimes, are tried in the Supreme Courts.
 Determinations of guilt or innocence are made by the presiding
 judge or magistrate. Juries were abolished in 1969. Judges
 in capital and other serious cases are empowered to appoint
 two assessors, who serve as factfinders and who have the power
 to overrule the presiding judge on questions of fact but not
 on questions of law.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty, although Parliament has modified this general
 presumption of innocence for many security offenses. The ISA
 effectively places the burden of proof of innocence on an
 accused for a number of offenses enumerated in the Act. Both
 security-related and common crimes cases are tried in civilian
 courts. Security trials are sometimes held in remote
 locations, far from metropolitan areas, apparently in order to
 reduce attendance at such cases by journalists, diplomats,
 human rights observers, and supporters of the accused.
 Because of case backlogs, postponements, and the practice of
 hearing cases concurrently, criminal trials, and particularly
 security cases, can sometimes take months, even years, to
 complete.
 Defendants in criminal cases, including "political" cases,
 have the right to counsel, but recent studies showed that 90
 percent of those convicted in ordinary criminal cases had no
 representation. While conceding that a shortage of lawyers
 and lack of legal aid funds make guaranteed representation for
 all unattainable at the present time, the Natal Supreme Court
 ruled in June that Natal courts must ensure legal
 representation for the accused in cases where the lack of a
 lawyer constitutes "a denial of fundamental fairness."
 Lawyers for Human Rights established a major pro bono project
 during 1988 which aims to have 2,000 participating lawyers
 donating 5 days per year each, the first large-scale effort of
 its kind to be undertaken in South Africa. Courts usually
 appoint counsel in capital cases where the defendant can not
 afford his or her own lawyer.
 While South Africa's high courts have traditionally maintained
 a high degree of integrity and independence, the power of the
 South African judiciary at all levels is circumscribed by
 stringent security legislation--tightened yet further in
 1988--and by the jurisprudential principle of parliamentary
 sovereignty, under which judges possess no authority to alter,
 strike down, or refuse to enforce properly drafted and enacted
 acts of Parliament. Nevertheless, the courts have been the
 
 
 329
 SOUTH AFRICA
 focal point for much litigation to counter human rights
 abuses. In some instances, the Government has admitted abuses
 and reached out-of-court settlements. In the initial months
 of the June 1986 emergency, the courts ordered a small number
 of detainees freed and declared some emergency regulations
 unlawful. In most cases, however, the Government rewrote and
 reissued the regulations in ways effectively preventing
 further court challenges. Moreover, the courts have
 consistently stated that the state of emergency itself was
 lawfully declared. An Appeals Court decision in September
 held that an emergency regulation could not be invalidated
 even if it were "unreasonable" or "vague," a ruling which will
 severely limit further legal challenges to the SOE.
 There have been indications in recent years that the
 Government has steadily increased its political influence over
 the judiciary. In an unprecedented step, the Government in
 1987 asked the Chief Justice of the Appeals Court to remain in
 his position past the mandatory retirement age of 70,
 apparently in order to prevent a more liberal justice from
 succeeding him. In 1988 the Chief Justice did retire, and the
 Government's appointment of his successor appeared to be
 without political bias. There was evidence that under the
 former Chief Justice important security-related cases were
 heard only by more conservative, progovernment judges.
 It is increasingly evident that the SAG sees long political
 trials as a means of keeping prominent activists out of
 circulation for extended periods of time, even if many
 defendants are eventually acquitted. One study found that 133
 political trials under the ISA and other statutes were
 completed in 1987 involving 792 people, of whom 563 were
 acquitted or had the char ges against them dropped. As of
 August, there were 62 ongoing political trials involving 691
 accused. Recently published surveys also reveal a low
 conviction rate for those charged with public violence.
 According to government statistics, in the 1986/87 period
 there were only 1,746 convictions for public violence out of a
 total of 5,233 prosecutions.
 The case of six death row prisoners known as the "Sharpeville
 Six" attracted international calls for clemency throughout the
 year because of fears that their executions would further
 aggravate the situation in South Africa. The Six had been
 convicted of murder under the controversial legal doctrine of
 "common purpose" because they were present in 1984 when a
 crowd accused the deputy mayor of the township of Sharpeville
 of being a "collaborator" and burned him to death. There was
 no evidence that any of the Six had assisted in the actual
 murder, and a state witness said he had been threatened and
 assaulted by police, and thereby coerced into making a
 statement falsely implicating two of the Six. In November,
 after'all court appeals had been rejected, the State President
 commuted the sentences to terms of imprisonment ranging from
 18 to 25 years. At the same time, he commuted the death
 sentences of four white policemen who had been convicted of
 murder (see Section l.c.).
 The Delmas/Pretoria "treason" trial, considered the most
 significant security/political trial in a generation,
 concluded in November after more than 3 years. Eleven of the
 original 22 defendants, all members of the UDF, Azanian
 Peoples Organization (AZAPO), and various black civic
 organizations, were convicted of terrorism, treason, or both
 for their antiapartheid activities during the upheavals of
 
 
 330
 SOUTH AFRICA
 1984-1986. The court accepted the State's claim that the UDF
 and other antiapartheid organizations had followed the
 dictates of the ANC and promoted a violent revolution to
 overthrow the Government. The terrorism convictions were
 based largely on assertions that the defendants led meetings
 or produced documents which they should have foreseen would
 lead to violence, or that the defendants failed to object to
 calls for violence by others. The State's case was based
 primarily on purported ANC and UDF documents which, under the
 Internal Security Act, are presumed to be genuine unless
 disproved by the defense. Some legal experts believe that the
 Delmas/Pretoria convictions open the door for prosecutions of
 many other antiapartheid activists on "treason" or "terrorism"
 charges. Those convicted of treason were three prominent UDF
 officials-, Popo Molefe, Moses Chikane, and Patrick Lekota, as
 well as Tom Manthata of the Soweto Civic Association, who was
 the only defendant convicted of both treason and terrorism.
 The three UDF officials had been denied bail and kept in
 custody throughout the unprecedentedly long trial. On
 December 5, the top leaders convicted received sentences
 ranging from 10 to 12 years. At the end of the year, appeals
 were pending. One of the major issues on appeal involved the
 trial judge's unprecedented dismissal of one of the two
 assessors in March 1987 for having signed a UDF petition. The
 judge rejected a defense motion for mistrial in the wake of
 that action. Some legal experts observed that appeal
 proceedings in the case could continue for another 2 years or
 more.
 ANC leader Nelson Mandela, imprisoned since 1962, continued to
 serve a life sentence, despite intensified calls for his
 release. Mandela's hospitalization in August for tuberculosis
 raised questions about conditions in his prison. He was
 subsequently moved to a private clinic, then to a house within
 the enclosed grounds of Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. The
 Government offered to allow Mandela's family to visit him more
 freely, but Mrs. Mandela refused anything more than her
 regular 40-minute visits until all political prisoners were
 released. ANC leader Walter'Sisulu also remains in prison.
 Mandela and Sisulu's ANC colleague Govan Mbeki, who was
 released in 1987, continued to be subjected to stringent
 travel and contact restrictions. The Government released two
 other long-term political prisoners in November--Zeph
 Mothopeng, a leader of the PAC, and Harry Gwala of the ANC.
 Both were seriously ill when they were released.
 In September a magistrate's court freed Jerszy Ras, a South
 African convicted of killing an American citizen. The judge,
 citing "extenuating circumstances", noted that Ras had been
 drunk and was provoked by the American's criticism of
 apartheid.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid involves the Government in extensive
 regulation of social, personal, and family life. A person's
 identification as a member of an ethnic group or race is based
 on definitions and decisions of the Government under the
 Population Registration Act. Under this law, every child born
 in South Africa must be registered and classified according to
 race. In cases of dispute, such as when the parents' racial
 classification is not known, a racial classification board is
 empowered to weigh pseudoscientific "evidence" and to issue a
 verdict on a person's race.
 
 
 331
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Under apartheid, association in many social settings is not a
 matter of free choice. The Separate Amenities Act allows
 public premises to be reserved for the exclusive use of
 persons of a particular race, and a substantial degree of
 social segregation, "petty apartheid," still legally exists in
 South Africa. In recent years, however, the Government has
 expanded the scope of administrative exceptions to apartheid
 laws and has allowed most restaurants, hotels, theaters,
 cinemas, private hospitals, parks, libraries, and other public
 facilities, upon application, to admit persons of all races.
 Many but by no means all private establishments have opted for
 "multiracial" status.
 Following the October elections, in which the Conservative
 Party gained control of over 60 municipalities in the
 Transvaal, numerous localities made plans to resegregate
 municipal facilities. Boksburg, near Johannesburg, was the
 first town to begin implementing such measures. Blacks in
 surrounding townships mounted an effective consumer boycott
 which forced several Boksburg businesses to close and
 decreased revenues of many others by up to 88 percent.
 The Government has allowed local option decisions on some
 social apartheid issues such as segregation of business
 districts. Some local authorities, notably in the urban
 centers of Johannesburg and Cape Town, have used their limited
 discretion to desegregate facilities under their control,
 while others have not. By the end of the year, approximately
 100 "white" city governments had desegregated specified
 business districts under an amendment to the Group Areas Act
 permitting such action in commercial areas. Many of these
 districts were on the peripheries of the cities, however.
 Blacks are permitted only to occupy, not to own, premises in
 these areas. In late 1988, the central Government repealed
 all national laws mandating employment discrimination, but
 municipal and provincial bylaws and regulations continue to
 discriminate against blacks--or against professions engaged in
 predominantly by blacks, such as street vending.
 Despite these exceptions in petty apartheid, the Government's
 policy remains, to the extent possible, to move blacks into
 the homelands or to keep them (and "colored" and Indians) in
 designated townships. The Group Areas Act (GAA) of 1950
 reserves all land in South Africa for whites, except for those
 areas designated for blacks, Indians, and "coloreds," and
 requires residential areas to be generally segregated on the
 basis of race. Blacks are'dsqualified from owning and from
 occupying land in urban areas not designated for them and from
 owning land in rural areas outside the 10 homelands, with the
 minor exception of "black spots"--land owned by blacks or
 religious missions prior to the enactment of the land acts.
 Authority to designate black urban areas is established by the
 Black Communities Development Act of 1958.
 Interracial couples must reside in the area designated for the
 less advantaged racial group, vitiating the benefits of the
 repeal of the miscegenation laws in 1985. Notwithstanding the
 GAA, a number of so-called gray areas exist in some major
 cities, where blacks, coloreds, and Asians reside in
 technically white areas, often without government
 interference. Some private schools in white-designated areas
 admit black, colored, and Asian students.
 In early 1988 the Government warned of a major crackdown on
 those violating the GAA. Although the number of criminal
 
 
 332
 SOUTH AFRICA
 charges brought under the Act remained relatively low,
 investigations apparently increased, and many people
 reportedly agreed to move rather than face prosecution. In
 late 1988, the Government tabled new group areas legislation
 described as "reform" but widely seen as a major step
 backward. While providing that certain residential areas
 might eventually be opened to all races, the legislation
 further restricts rural and periurban squatting, heavily
 penalizes illegal squatters and their landlords, and allows
 for compulsory summary eviction of squatters and effective
 confiscation of land. This legislation has been held up
 repeatedly by resistance from opposition parties of the left,
 including the majority in-the Indian and "colored" houses of
 Parliament and could face major amendments before enactment.
 For black Africans, even the right to reside permanently in a
 segregated urban township is not available if one is deemed a
 "citizen" of one of the "independent" homelands. Such persons
 are regarded as aliens in "white" South Africa, and,
 notwithstanding their birth in South Africa, are technically
 subject to restrictions similar to those for any foreigner
 (see also Section 2.d. and Section 3). They must obtain work
 permits in order to reside in urban areas of "white" South
 Africa, and if they succeed in obtaining a work permit, they
 may not be accompanied by their spouses and children.
 Hundreds of thousands of such persons are forced by housing
 shortages to reside away from their families, often in
 overcrowded single-sex dormitories in urban areas.
 The Government owns virtually all urban black township
 property and subsidizes a program of rental housing. Local
 authorities in the black townships administer the program and
 collect rents. In 1986 Parliament granted blacks the
 opportunity to acquire permanent land tenure in the
 townships. After 2 years, however, only an estimated 42
 houses had been sold to blacks on a permanent tenure basis,
 apparently due to bureaucratic delays.
 Many urban townships lack soie or all modern amenities, such
 as electricity and running water, but continue to become more
 crowded as rural poverty drives people to seek jobs in urban
 centers. In South Africa (excluding the "independent"
 homelands) an estimated 18 to 20 million people, most of them
 black, do not have electricity. The restricted amount of land
 available in the townships has driven up prices for housing
 lots and led to corruption among township officials
 controlling the allocation of these lots. Some declared
 townships are little more then permanent shantytowns with
 "houses" constructed of fiberboard and corrugated iron. The
 shortage of housing for blacks--which some estimates place as
 high as 750,000 units--also has led to large squatter
 communities.
 A 1987 report by the Black Sash organization estimated that
 some 5 million South African blacks were without adequate
 shelter. Townships are often located at extraordinarily long
 commuting distances from cities, where most employment
 opportunities for South Africa's blacks are found. A 1985
 President's Council's report found that some 70 percent of
 black commuters spent more than 3 hours daily traveling
 between home and work.
 The Land Acts bf 1913 and 1936 limit land ownership in rural
 areas to whites. Blacks are allowed to live in nonhomeland
 rural areas only with the permission of white landowners;
 
 
 833
 SOUTH AFRICA
 nearly all are farm laborers whose numbers and freedom of
 movement are regulated by a number of other acts. In addition
 to the GAA, these acts are the chief statutory bases for the
 South African Government's practice of "forced removals."
 Under these laws over the last three decades, the Government
 has forcibly relocated black South Africans from "white" land,
 often to areas in the homelands with hopelessly inadequate
 infrastructure and insufficient land and water for profitable
 (or even subsistence) agriculture. The South African Council
 of Churches (SACC) has estimated that since 1961, the
 Government has forcibly resettled approximately 3.5 million
 blacks, "coloreds," and Asians. Government figures issued in
 1984 asserted that 2 million blacks had been resettled since
 1960.
 In July 1987, the State President pledged that there would be
 no forced removal "unless it is accompanied with the provision
 of better living conditions." However, in recent years the
 Government has tried to coerce removals by refusing to
 maintain the already limited infrastructure of black
 communities it seeks to remove and engaging in physical
 threats and aggressive actions aimed at convincing reluctant
 people to "agree" to move.
 The Government continued its efforts to move the 8,000
 remaining residents of the 60-year-old black community of
 Oukasie, near the town of Brits, to a more isolated site near
 the Bophuthatswana border. Many of these people opposed
 removal on the suspicion that the community where they would
 be resettled would eventually be incorporated against their
 will into the "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana, a move
 that would strip them of their South African citizenship. In
 April the SAG declared Oukasie an "emergency camp," a move
 widely seen as a prelude to the forced removal of township
 residents. Service charges were increased by 50 percent.
 Community leaders opposing the removal were detained or forced
 into hiding.
 The people of the Mogopa clan, forcibly removed from their
 traditional home to arid land in 1984, remained in a
 resettlement camp and accused the Government of reneging on
 promises made during 1987 negotiations to provide them with
 arable land outside the homelands. In the western Transvaal
 town of Koster, the Government has also attempted to remove a
 black township located close to a white area, in this case to
 a new township nearby. An April ruling of the Pretoria
 Supreme Court, which nullified a regulation requiring people
 moving to the new area to demolish their houses in the old
 area, at least temporarily stymied attempts to depopulate the
 old township.
 In the Lawaaikamp settlement outside George in the Southern
 Cape, municipal authorities seek to use the Group Areas Act to
 evict approximately 2,000 black residents who have resisted
 strong pressure to move. The Government proclaimed the area,
 where blacks have lived for 40 years, for the exclusive use of
 "coloreds" in June 1987. Municipal authorities have initiated
 legal action to evict the residents despite strong "colored"
 support for the right of blacks to remain there, and
 vociferous local and international protest.
 Studies completed during 1987 indicated that the Government's
 policy of settling blacks on arid land far from population
 centers was beginning to have serious consequences for
 nutrition as well as housing. The Operation Hunger
 
 
 334
 SOUTH AFRICA
 organization, in a survey of malnutrition, reported that South
 African rural blacks, particularly those in the "independent"
 homelands, may be more impoverished than rural Africans in
 neighboring countries. Malnutrition is also a serious problem
 in severely congested and depressed periurban resettlement
 areas such as Botshabelo, near Bloemfontein. Botshabelo and
 other such areas have been "disowned" by the Government in
 anticipation of their incorporation into homelands.
 Various laws give police the authority in specific
 circumstances to enter homes without a warrant, including
 situations where an officer has reason to believe a warrant
 would be issued but that the delay caused by first obtaining
 the warrant would defeat the purpose of the search. In
 practice;. police often enter and search homes of black
 activists as a means of intimidation, often in the early
 morning hours. South African security forces rely on a large
 network of informants as well as physical and electronic
 surveillance techniques to gather information about South
 African citizens, particularly antiapartheid activists.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While South Africans speak relatively freely on most issues,
 the SOE and security and legislation limit discussion of many
 politic al themes. Some segments of South Africa's largely
 white-owned press continued, when possible, to engage in at
 times vigorous criticism of the Government and its policies.
 However, SOE regulations severely impair freedom of expression
 and press by making even reporting of "subversive statements"
 (e.g., encouraging strikes, boycotts, or the promotion of
 disinvestment) a criminal offense. The regulations also ban
 television coverage, still photography, sketching, and radio
 recording from areas covered by the SOE. Media may not report
 on police or security force operations in -unrest situations,"
 except as information, always limited, is released by the
 Government. Penalties for infractions include fines up to
 $8,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. It is also a
 criminal offense to publish material on political unrest,
 detention cases, the treatment of detainees, and various types
 of political activity without prior government clearance.
 In 1988 the press in South Africa came under increasing
 pressure. Regulations published in 1987 streamlined the
 method by which publications can be censored and gave the
 Minister of Home Affairs the personal power to close a
 publication for up to 3 months without explanation. In April
 the Minister exercised these powers, closing New Nation for 3
 months and South for 1 month. Several other papers, including
 the Weekly Mail, received official warnings. Then in August
 police seized copies of a Weekly Mail issue which included a
 story on resistance to conscription and in November banned the
 Weekly Mail for 1 month. These new measures further curbed
 the ability of journalists to report on activities such as
 labor disputes, "extraparliamentary" organizations, and life
 and thought in the black community. New SOE regulations
 issued in June contained significant new restrictions on the
 press, most notably by requiring all "news agencies" outside
 the mainstream media to register with the Government. More
 detailed restrictions were also placed on reporting of
 unrest. The Government later withdrew the registration
 requirement, largely for technical reasons. New regulations
 also prohibited the press from quoting anyone considered to be
 
 
 335
 SOUTH AFRICA
 a spokesman for any organization restricted under the February
 regulations.
 The current regulations are sufficiently vague to create an
 atmosphere of uncertainty among journalists, resulting in a
 situation where self-censorship is rife, and opposition
 newspaper editors must surrender ultimate editing
 responsibility to their lawyers. Most opposition publications
 cannot afford the expensive legal advice required to publish
 stories which may test the limits of the regulations. While
 there were no known convictions of journalists in 1988 under
 the various laws or regulations, some were detained (see
 Section l.d.). In addition, journalists have experienced
 various forms of harassment, including the theft of personal
 papers, vandalism of cars, and the stoning of their houses.
 In recent years the Government has also impeded the flow of
 information from South Africa by refusing visa requests by
 foreign journalists or by subjecting them to inordinate delays.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals,
 with the exception of newspapers), the importation,
 possession, and publication of politically or morally
 "undesirable" works is prohibited. Materials subject to
 censorship include those found to be "indecent or obscene,"
 "blasphemous," or "prejudicial to the safety of the state."
 Decisions of the Publications Appeal Board are not subject to
 judicial review, except in rare instances. In July the Board
 approved the antiapartheid movie, "Cry Freedom," but the
 Police Commissioner subsequently banned the film under the
 emergency regulations after one showing.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). With some exceptions, SABC
 reflects progovernment viewpoints in both its news reporting
 and editorial policy. While the Government professes that
 SABC is politically independent, a wide range of the political
 spectrum, from the liberal Progressive Federal Party to the
 rightwing Conservative Party, characterizes the SABC as an
 editorial arm of the ruling National Party. The dismissal of
 SABC Chief Riaan Eksteen in April was widely seen as heralding
 the network's further subordination to the Government.
 Academic freedom has come under increasing pressure from the
 Government. In February a court decision overturned the
 Government's 1987 legislation enabling it to cut subsidies to
 universities which allowed political demonstrations. In June
 senior academics from the University of Durban-Westville were
 subpoenaed to appear in court to answer questions about their
 knowledge of student activists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Internal Security Act seriously obstructs freedom of
 assembly, as it gives magistrates the power to ban or impose
 conditions on the holding of public meetings and to close off
 areas to the public to prevent prohibited gatherings. Police
 can also ban meetings under the SOE regulations. A ban on all
 outdoor gatherings except sports events or specially
 authorized meetings, in effect since 1976, was renewed again
 in 1988. Restrictions on funerals of political activists or
 victims of political violence were maintained, limiting the
 number of mourners and prohibiting political speeches. Police
 frequently arrested persons in the townships on charges of
 participating in illegal gatherings. In February police used
 
 
 336
 SOUTH AFRICA
 water cannons to disperse prominent church leaders and others
 who had marched on Parliament in Cape Town to protest
 government restrictions on antiapartheid organizations. In
 September security police sealed off the University of Cape
 Town, the site of a proposed antiapartheid conference
 involving 75 organizations opposing the October municipal
 elections, and detained more than 30 persons.
 Freedom of association was sharply curtailed in February when
 the Minister of Law and Order prohibited 17 antiapartheid
 organizations, including the UDF, DPSC, and AZAPO, from
 performing almost all activities and restricted COSATU to
 nonpolitical activities only. In August the Minister
 similarly restricted the End Conscription Campaign (ECC). In
 November, following a racially motivated mass murder in
 Pretoria, the Government restricted the ultrarightist Blanke
 Bevrydigings Beweging (BBB), but resisted calls to similarly
 restrict the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), a much more
 significant white supremacist organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 South Africa has a wide variety of religious denominations,
 and the Government generally respects freedom of worship.
 Religious organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other
 activities without interference as long as they do not
 seriously challenge government policies. As with other
 aspects of South African life, individual church congregations
 are often organized along racial lines, but most religious
 organizations (including a growing number of predominantly
 white congregations) challenge apartheid on moral grounds.
 The Defense Act provides alternative service options for
 religious objectors to national military service (only whites
 are drafted). A total of 959 religious objectors were granted
 community service between mid-1984 and the end of 1987,
 according to the monthly journal of the Dutch Reformed
 Church. The great majority of these (787) were Jehovah's
 Witnesses. Members of mainstream churches are granted such
 alternative service only in rare instances. Conscientious
 objectors on nonreligious grounds continue to be subject to a
 maximum 6-year sentence for refusing to serve. Following a
 highly publicized trial, Dr. Ivan Toms was sentenced in March
 to 630 days' imprisonment for refusing to serve in the SADF.
 In July David Bruce and in December Charles Bester were
 sentenced to the maximum 6-year terms on the same charge. The
 three objected to participating in the apartheid-enforcing
 functions of the SADF. In November Toms was freed on bail
 pending an appeal of his case.
 With the restrictions on black extraparliamentary opposition,
 church leaders found themselves in the forefront of the
 antiapartheid movement. This resulted in growing tension
 between the Government and churchmen such as Anglican
 Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu; Rev. Allan Boesak,
 President of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches; and Rev.
 Frank Chikane of the South African Council of Churches
 (SACC). Archbishop Tutu continued to challenge the Government
 by supporting calls for sanctions. He and other church
 leaders challenged the SOE restrictions by openly calling for
 a boycott of the October municipal elections. Such remarks
 drew heavy criticism from government officials and rightwing
 politicians, but the Government took no legal steps. However,
 an orchestrated campaign was mounted against Archbishop Tutu,
 featuring highly publicized anti-Tutu protests involving paid
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 demonstrators and the distribution of leaflets in the
 townships. In March Rev. Boesak, head of the "colored" branch
 of the Dutch Reformed Church, said that he had received
 repeated death threats. Mysterious bomb attacks destroyed
 SACC headquarters in August and the headquarters of the
 Southern African Catholic Bishops* Conference in October, (see
 Section l.a.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since the repeal of the pass laws in 1986, black South African
 citizens are no longer required to carry government-issued
 passes in order to prove to law enforcement officers their
 right to be present in an urban area. While this represented
 a significant reform, a de facto system of influx control has
 been maintained through urban housing shortages, antisquatting
 laws, and sanctions against employers who hire "illegal
 aliens" from the four "independent" homelands. Regulations
 requiring "citizens" of "independent" homelands to obtain work
 permits for employment in the rest of South Africa could
 provide a basis for future "deportations" of large numbers of
 people to the "independent" homelands.
 Assignments of blacks to homelands take place irrespective of
 the wishes of those assigned and without regard to the fact
 that they may not have been born in, or ever lived in or even
 visited, their putative homeland. When a homeland is granted
 "independence" by the Government, blacks assigned to that
 homeland lose their South African citizenship and receive the
 "citizenship" of the homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks
 have lost South African citizenship under this policy by South
 African legislation granting "independence" to four
 homelands: Transkei (1976); Bophuthatswana (1977); Venda
 (1979); and Ciskei (1981). A 1986 law provided for
 "restoration" of South African citizenship to a limited class
 of blacks who were denationalized as a result of homeland
 "independence" grants--those with "permanent residence" rights
 in South Africa. The Government has estimated that this
 reform will apply to only about 1.75 million of the 4 million
 "citizens" of "independent" homelands residing outside those
 homelands.
 The travel documents needed to travel abroad or emigrate
 legally generally are not difficult for whites to obtain,
 although some white antiapartheid activists have been denied
 passports. Blacks assigndd to an "independent" homeland
 usually cannot obtain South African passports as the
 Government takes the position that they are not citizens of
 South Africa. In some instances, this has the effect of
 deterring international travel as some blacks refuse to travel
 on a homeland passport, insisting that the Government recognize
 them as citizens of South Africa. In 1982 the Rand Supreme
 Court ruled that the Minister of Home Affairs has the absolute
 discretion to revoke or refuse to issue a passport without
 giving any reasons for his action. The Government regularly
 refuses passports to persons whom it regards as radically
 critical of the status quo.
 Although South Africa is not a party to international
 conventions on refugees, as many as 225,000 Mozambicans have
 entered South Africa, most of them fleeing civil strife in
 their country. An estimated 35,000 of these refugees within
 the homelands of Kangwane and Gazankulu have been allowed to
 remain by the homeland authorities. However, Mozambicans
 
 
 338
 SOUTH AFRICA
 outside these areas are often hunted down and forcibly
 repatriated to Mozambique without an interview. The South
 African Government has no judicial process by which these
 persons can seek refugee status or appeal a decision to return
 them to Mozambique. Some 21,000 Mozambicans were
 involuntarily repatriated in the first 8 months of 1988.
 Relief assistance in the homelands is provided by South
 African private and voluntary organizations as well as by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the
 Government permits access by international observers to areas
 where these refugees are found.
 The Government has taken harsh measures to prevent the entry
 of people into South Africa from Mozambique, including the
 erection of a lethally charged electrified fence along a
 portion of the border with Mozambique. The electric fence
 claimed at least 16 lives in the first 6 months of 1988.
 The SACC estimates the total number of South African exiles to
 be 250,000 or more. The number of South Africans who are
 officially registered as refugees in neighboring countries and
 benefit from assistance from the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees has not grown significantly since 1985 and remains
 approximately 22,000. Most of these refugees are affiliated
 in some way with one of the antiapartheid organizations in
 exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The extent to which South African citizens have the right to
 change their government democratically depends on race. The
 majority of them, the blacks, have no such right. The new
 Constitution created a tricameral Parliament with separate
 chambers for whites, "coloreds," and Asians. The respective
 groups are represented in the tricameral Parliament on a
 racial ratio of 4/2/l--white/"colored"/Asian. Members of each
 house are elected fxom separate, racially based voter rolls.
 Each house has primary responsibility for its "own affairs,"
 i.e., legislation affecting its own racial constituency. The
 State President has complete discretion to decide which issues
 of general concern are to be treated by all three chambers.
 If the three chambers fail to reach consensus on "general
 affairs" legislation, the bill may be referred to the
 President's Council, an appointed body controlled by the
 ruling white National Party, for a ruling. If the bill is
 ruled on favorably by the President's Council, the bill is
 deemed to have been passed by Parliament. The lines between
 "own affairs" and "general affairs" are not always precise.
 Matters that are usually considered general affairs include
 foreign policy, defense, national security, and black
 affairs. Education is normally dealt with as an "own affair"
 but is subject to general laws prescribing norms and standards
 for salaries, curriculum, and examinations.
 The terms of the new Constitution and the existence of a white
 majority in Parliament ensure control by the white House of
 Assembly over key general affairs. While there is opposition
 in the House of Assembly, the majority National Party has
 controlled South African political power and legislative
 affairs since its first parliamentary victory in 1948. Within
 the National Party, opinions on reform of the apartheid system
 range from moderate to reactionary. Internal differences are
 in theory resolved in party caucuses, but in practice the
 
 
 339
 SOUTH AFRICA
 State President, who is also the National Party leader,
 resolves disputes.
 The ruling National Party controls 123 of the 178 white House
 of Assembly seats. As the National Party-led Government has
 moved to introduce modest changes in the apartheid system,
 there has been a backlash against reform in the white
 Afrikaans electorate which has helped the rightwing groups.
 The moderate white party, the Progressive Federal Party (PFP),
 lost considerable ground in the last election. In 1987 the
 Conservative Party replaced the Progressive Federal Party as
 the official opposition, gaining, along with the far rightwing
 Reconstituted National Party (HNP), 30 percent of the total
 white vote. In the October municioal elections, the
 Conservative Party made gains in the rural and industrial
 Transvaal but failed to make inroads elsewhere in the
 country. The National Party maintained majorities in the key
 races in Pretoria and Johannesburg and in most other areas.
 The PFP held its ground and announced plans to form an
 alliance with other liberal parties.
 Political participation for blacks, who have no representation
 in Parliament, remains limited to a franchise in their
 respective homelands or, in the case of urban blacks, to a
 franchise enabling them to vote for black local government
 officials. In 1988 the Government continued to be committed
 to the "grand apartheid" scheme of eventually giving
 "independence" to more homelands. Setbacks in the courts (see
 Section 1. e.) and instability in these areas hampered
 progress toward such "independence" during 1988. The
 situation in strife-torn KwaNdebele, which had been slated to
 be the fifth homeland to become "independent," remained
 unresolved at the end of the year. Homeland leaders such as
 Enos Mabuza (Kangwane), Gatsha Buthelezi (KwaZulu), and
 Mogoboya Ramodike (Lebowa) maintained that they would not
 accept "independence."
 More than 10 million blacks live in townships near white urban
 areas. The only voting rights they are able to exercise are
 those granted under the Community Councils Act of 1977 and the
 Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The latter Act elevated
 the formal status of black municipal authorities to that
 enjoyed by white municipal governments. However, black local
 governments still face critical problems of inadequate
 financial resources and lack of political credibility. There
 were incidents of violence against candidates for black
 municipal councils (see Section l.a.) and councillors continue
 to be viewed by most blacks as collaborators with the
 Government. In many areas, seats on town councils remain
 vacant due to community opposition, and many who serve on
 these bodies are forced to live in guarded, fortified
 compounds. Lack of black support for local government
 structures was evidenced in the October municipal elections,
 when at most only 11 percent of blacks eligible to vote went
 to the polls, despite the Government's spending more that $2.5
 million to promote the elections in the townships and harsh
 measures used to suppress calls for an election boycott.
 The Government has proposed some formulas to give blacks a
 limited role in the political process beyond municipal
 councils. Legislation in 1985 replaced all-white provincial
 councils, which oversee utilities and other local services,
 with multiracial Regional Services Councils (RSC's), with no
 racial group to hold more than 50 percent of the seats. The
 
 
 340
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Government, however, has failed to draw any blacks with
 popular support into the RSCs.
 In 1986 the Government proposed a National Council, a body to
 which blacks would be elected or appointed to serve in an
 advisory capacity regarding a new constitutional political
 structure for South Africa. The National Council has been
 denounced by all major extraparliamentary groups as a device
 to give the appearance but not the reality of power sharing.
 In June the National Council proposal was absorbed into a new
 Constitutional Development Bill, with indirect elections of
 Council members replacing the previous proposal for some
 direct elections. The bill was approved by all three houses
 of Parliament, but at the end of 1988 the Government had still
 not succeeded in persuading any credible black leaders to
 participate in the Council.
 The ANC met with groups of nonblack South Africans outside
 South Africa to discuss the future of South Africa on several
 occasions in 1988. In October the ANC scheduled meetings with
 officials of-South African rugby and soccer associations to
 discuss the sports boycott, but the meetings were canceled
 after the South African Government publicly denounced them.
 No women presently serve as ministers in the Government. Two
 women serve as members of the State President's Council. Five
 of the 178 seats in the Parliament's white House of Assembly
 are held by women. The "colored" House of Representatives has
 two female members, and the Asian House of Delegates has one.
 Women have generally achieved more success in electoral
 politics at the local than at the national level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government extends little cooperation to various United
 Nations bodies or private organizations attempting to
 investigate the Government's'human rights record. Since the
 October 1986 vote of an international Red Cross conference in
 Geneva to expel a South African Government delegation from the
 conference, the Government has permitted the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to maintain only a reduced
 staff in South Africa. In recent years the Government has
 allowed the ICRC to visit only those prisoners convicted under
 the ISA (who comprise only a small percentage of those held
 for political reasons). The ICRC continues to negotiate with
 the Government for access to all prisoners convicted of
 security-related offenses, including those detained under the
 state of emergency. In 1988 to protest the Government's lack
 of response on this issue, the ICRC did not visit any category
 of prisoners.
 Even after the February restrictions, many South African
 organizations continued to observe, report, and contest human
 rights violations in the country. Lawyers for Human Rights,
 the Black Sash, the Legal Resources Center, the South African
 Council of Churches, the University of the Witwatersrand
 Center for Applied Legal Studies, the Human Rights Trust in
 Port Elizabeth, and other groups were actively involved in a
 wide range of human rights issues and assisted persons who are
 aggrieved by the apartheid and security laws. In September
 several of the groups established the Human Rights Commission
 to monitor human rights violations and issue regular reports.
 
 
 341
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Activists involved in these and other human rights monitoring
 organizations are subjected to personal harassment, such as
 office break-ins, sabotage of automobiles, threatening phone
 calls, opened mail, and sometimes loss of jobs. Some of these
 acts are undoubtedly carried out by rightwing groups outside
 of government, but many other incidents bear all the hallmarks
 of organized campaigns directed by the security police. A
 number of human rights activists and lawyers have been
 detained.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 South Africa's black majority and, to a somewhat lesser
 extent, the "colored" and Asian communities, suffer from
 pervasive, legally sanctioned discrimination based on race in
 political, economic, and social aspects of life. For example,
 per capita expenditure for education is about six times
 greater for whites than for blacks. Black enrollment at
 "white" universities has been growing slowly. After the
 1984-86 political unrest, which disrupted education in many of
 the country's townships, most black students ended their
 school boycotts in 1987. Security forces maintained a strong
 presence around schools in many of the major townships, and
 student activists were often harassed or detained. In April
 police and high school pupils clashed in the Western Cape, in
 some of the worst unrest in the area since 1985.
 Women of all races in South Africa suffer varying degrees of
 legal, cultural, and economic discrimination, most of which is
 based on tradition rather than codified in law. Women
 traditionally earn lower wages than men and are generally
 underrepresented in the country's political and business
 establishment. Black women are considered under many aspects
 of South African law as perpetual minors. However, Parliament
 passed legislation in 1988 which brought marriage laws for
 blacks into line with laws governing marriage between whites.
 Black women married subsequent to the enactment of the act
 have legal rights to community property accumulated during the
 marriage. Maternity benefits are not guaranteed to women of
 any race'under South African law, and pregnancy is a legal
 basis for dismissal from a job. A women's rights movement has
 taken hold in South Africa, and women's organizations, often
 multiracial, have been at the forefront of the struggle
 against both race and sex discrimination.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Relations Act gives private sector employees the
 right to join labor unions, although the Government places
 considerable restrictions on trade union activities. In 1988
 more than 2 million workers were union members in a labor
 force of 12 million. Well over a million of these union
 members were black, compared to about 100,000 black union
 members in 1979 when major reform legislation, in the wake bf
 the Soweto riots and the recommendations of a subsequent
 commission of inquiry, granted blacks full status as employees
 and the right to form trade unions independent of direct
 government control. Migrant workers from other countries also
 are permitted to join unions and hold office. In addition to
 representing the workplace interests of their members, black
 trade unions have increasingly assumed the role of voicing
 black worker demands for political rights. In February,
 
 
 342
 SOUTH AFRICA
 however, the Government issued Order no. 335 which prohibited
 COSATU, the largest union federation, from engaging in
 political activities, including publicity campaigns which make
 political demands on government. The State permitted a
 special COSATU congress called in May to develop responses to
 the restrictions, but a COSATU-organized conference of
 antiapartheid groups was banned in September. Four COSATU
 officials and two top officials of the Postal and
 Telecommunications Workers Association (POTWA) were restricted
 to the Johannesburg magisterial district and were required to
 be in their homes from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. for period of
 approximately 12 days.
 Except for public sector employees, the right to strike, long
 enjoyed by white workers, was extended to all workers
 regardless of race in 1979. Work stoppages triggered by
 collective disputes or occasionally political issues have been
 a commonplace occurrence in the 1980's. The wave of strikes
 which characterized 1987 abated sharply in 1988. Acts of
 violence against unions also declined, but several union
 offices were vandalized and the headquarters of the Transport
 and General Workers Union destroyed by a firebomb. No arrests
 were made in connection with the incidents. POTWA and the
 South African Railway and Harbour Workers union (SAWHWU),
 which waged lengthy strikes in 1987, appear to have been
 targeted for state harassment. Several of their officials
 were detained in late 1987 and 1988.
 In September the Labor Relations Amendment Act of 1988, the
 Government's response to the widespread strikes during 1987,
 was enacted and came into effect. The Act places further
 limitations on the right to strike, weakens the Industrial
 Court, and is widely viewed as favoring employers over
 unions. In June COSATU and the smaller National Council of
 Trade Unions (NACTU) organized a 3-day work stayaway, one of
 the most effective in South Africa's history, to protest the
 legislation. There is a pending freedom of association
 complaint regarding this Act filed by COSATU which, because
 South Africa is not a member'of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), has been referred to the U.N. Economic and
 Social Council.
 There are no legal restrictions on union affiliations with
 regional or international labor organizations; both COSATU and
 NACTU, by choice, have decided not to seek such affiliations.
 However, numerous affiliates of COSATU and NACTU, as well as
 independent unions are affiliates of trade secretariats such
 as the International Metalworkers' Federation and the Miners'
 International Federation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The South African Labor Relations Act gives private sector
 employees the right to organize labor unions and to engage in
 collective bargaining. During 1988 significant sets of
 negotiations involved the National Union of Mineworkers and
 the Charmber of Mines and the National Union of Metal Workers
 and the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation. The
 State does not interfere with union organizing in the private
 sector and has generally not intervened in the collective
 bargaining process. Industrial Court decisions in
 labor-management disputes appear balanced.
 The Labor Relations Act does not cover the approximately 2
 million farm workers and domestic servants, or, with the
 
 
 343
 SOUTH AFRICA
 partial exception of municipal employees, public servants.
 Most public sector employees do not have the right of
 collective bargaining, and none have the right to strike.
 South African labor relations law does not cover the
 homelands, which with the qualified exception of KwaZulu, do
 not have labor legislation to match the-post-1979 reforms
 passed by the South African Parliament. With the partial
 exception of KwaZulu, there have been reported efforts by the
 authorities to discourage workers from organizing trade unions
 in the homelands.
 The Mines and Works Act, which became effective in 1988,
 repealed job reservation for whites in certain skilled mining
 occupations, removing the last statutory authorization of
 racially based job discrimination. However, the implementing
 regulations providing for eligibility standards for applicants
 may still limit black advancement. The Industrial Court ruled
 during the year that racial wage discrimination is an unfair
 labor practice.
 Export processing zones do not exist, and labor legislation is
 applied uniformly throughout nonhomeland South Africa.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no constitutional or statutory prohibition against
 forced labor in South Africa; however, Dutch-Roman common law
 does not permit forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibits the
 employment of minors under the age of 15 in most industries,
 shops, and offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors
 under 16 from working underground. Trade unions, however,
 allege that child labor is common. There is no restriction on
 the age at which a person may work in agriculture.
 e. Acceptable Conditions Of Work
 The Labor Relations Act of 1956 provides a mechanism for
 negotiation between labor and management to set minimum wage
 standards industry by industry. At present, some 101
 industries come under the provisions of the Act. There is no
 legal minimum wage in South.Africa. The Institute for
 Industrial Relations' survey found an average minimum monthly
 wage in negotiated settlements with unions in 1988 to be
 approximately $250. Various surveys estimated the minimum
 household subsistence level for a black family of six in the
 Johannesburg area to be $211 to $316 depending on survey
 assumptions. (It should be noted that the official exchange
 rate, upon which these figures are based, understates the
 domestic purchasing power of the rand.) The Occupational
 Safety Act sets forth minimum standards for working conditions
 and employment, including a standard workweek of 46 hours in
 most industries, as well as vacation and sick leave. The
 Machinery and Occupational Safety Act mandates minimum
 standards for the design and use of certain types of
 industrial machinery, and the standards are enforced.
 Attention to health and safety issues has increased in recent
 years in part due to pressure from black trade unions.
 Throughout 1987 and 1988, regulations setting standards under
 the Machinery and Occupational Safety Act of 1983 were issued,
 
 
 344
 SOUTH AFRICA
 including regulations for workplace environmental standards,
 asbestos, and general and electrical machinery. The
 regulations are administered by inspectors of the Department
 of Manpower. According to Department statistics, there were
 400 fatalities in industrial accidents in 1987 compared to 421
 deaths in 1986. Building and construction was the most
 dangerous industry.
 Safety issues are particularly contentious in the mining
 industry which is governed by regulations under the Mines and
 Works Act. Regulations providing for management-appointed
 safety officers and representatives in mines were issued in
 September.
