 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed
 by an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and a separate judiciary. President
 Carlos Saul Menem was reelected in 1995 for a second 4-year term, which runs until
 1999. The judiciary is generally independent but is inefficient and subject at times
 to political influence.
 The President is the constitutional commander-in-chief, and a civilian defense
 minister oversees the armed forces. Several agencies share responsibility for main-
 taining law and order. The Argentine Federal Police (PFA) report to the Interior
 Minister, as do the Border Police and Coast Guard. The PFA also has jurisdiction
 in the Federal Capital. Provincial police are subordinate to the respective governor.
 Members of the police continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial, and service economy. An economic
 reform and structural adjustment program, which included privatization and trade
 and financial sector liberalization, led to an increase in average annual gross domes-
 tic product of 6 percent during the period 1991-97, with low inflation. Growth
 slowed to an estimated 4.8 percent in 1998; however, due in large part to a reduc-
 tion in foreign capital flows into the country, and high unemployment persisted.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. There continued to be instances of extrajudicial
 killings and brutality by the police, although the authorities prosecuted a number
 of persons for such actions. Police also arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens,
 prison conditions are poor, and lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. The judicial
 system is subject to political influence at times and to inordinate delays. There were
 numerous threats against journalists. Discrimination and violence against women
 also are problems. In addition, the legacy of the human rights abuses of the 1976-
 83 military regime continued to be a subject of intense national debate, especially
 following the arrest of former junta leaders on charges of taking or seizing babies
 born to dissidents in detention and giving them out to supporters for adoption.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllling.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated extrajudicial killings. However, police officers were believed responsible
 for a number of extrajudical killings. The authorities investigated and in some
 cases detained, tried, and convicted the officers involved.
 In the province of Jujuy, the authorities relieved 14 police officers from duty and
 detained them on suspicion of involvement in the death in January of 34-year-old
 Carlos Andres Sutara. The police had detained Sutara and several of his friends for
 a records check. According to the police, Sutara died of a heart attack, but his wife
 and three friends detained with him claim that he was beaten brutally.
 In January in the province of Buenos Aires, the authorities detained a police offi-
 cer on suspicion of killing 21-year-old Walter Repetto. According to a newspaper ac-
 count, Repetto was sitting in his car waiting for a friend when the policeman, who
 was off duty and dressed in civilian clothes, approached the vehicle. Repetto at-
 tempted to drive away and was shot and killed. In July the authorities arrested four
 police officers in Entre Rios province on suspicion of involvement in the death in
 January of 22-year-old Juan Carlos Cardozo.
 Judges in Rio Negro province indicted two former provincial police chiefs on
 charges of obstructing justice in the investigation of the November 1997 deaths of
 three young women in the town of Cipolletti.
 Investigations continued into 1997 killings in three provinces allegedly carried out
 by police. An appeals court in Neuquen rejected the indictment of an officer accused
 of firing the shot that killed Teresa Rodriguez, a young woman who died during a
 clash between police and unemployed workers in the town of Cutral-Co. In Mendoza
 a sixth policeman was indicted in the death of 18-year-old Sebastian Bordon. In
 Buenos Aires the investigation of the murder of news photographer Jose Luis
 Cabezas appeared to be drawing to a close following the suicide in May of reclusive
 businessman Alfredo Yabran, who was suspected of ordering the murder. Several
 police officers were under arrest and awaiting trial in the case (see Section 2.a.).
 
 
 The Buenos Aires provincial police force continued to undergo a major reorganiza-
 tion, motivated in part by its alleged involvement in the Cabezas murder. The force
 was broken up into 18 departments under the overall direction of a civilian Minister
 of Justice and Security.
 In April a court convicted a Buenos Aires provincial policeman and sentenced him
 to 10 years in prison for the 1996 death of Cristian Javier Cicovicci, a young fur
 trapper. The youth had refused to hand over his furs to the officer, who shot him
 in the head. In May a court in the province of Cordoba sentenced a police corporal
 to 20 years in prison for the 1996 shooting death of 19-year-old Ariel Lastra.
 Six army officers were under indictment at year's end in the continuing judicial
 investigation into the alleged coverup of the 1994 death of army recruit Omar
 Carrasco. In 1996 a court convicted three soldiers of murdering Carrasco and a
 fourth for covering up the crime.
 In May the judge investigating the 1993 disappearance of Miguel Bru was im-
 peached and the investigation continued under a new judge. The authorities in-
 dicted five Buenos Aires provincial police in the case, but only one was in custody.
 Two of the five are charged with torturing Bru to death; the other three are charged
 with covering up the crime. All five awaited trial at year's end.
 In September a judge in Rio Negro province indicted five police officers in connec-
 tion with the 1989 deaths of two teenagers, Raquel Laguna and Sergio Sorbellini.
 In March an appeals court in the province of Buenos Aires upheld the 1994 con-
 viction of three provincial policemen sentenced to 11 years in prison for the 1987
 shooting deaths of three young men in the town of Ingeniero Budge. The police had
 been released from custody on a legal technicality, and when authorities tried to re-
 arrest them they could not be found.
 In October 1997, a Spanish court issued arrest warrants for the former chief of
 the Argentine navy and 10 aides on charges of genocide and torture during the
 1976-83 "dirty war" waged- by the military governments. The Spanish judge,
 Baltasar Garzon, had previously ordered the arrest of Leopoldo Galtieri, the army
 general who served as president when a military junta ruled the country in 1981-
 82. The court also brought charges of genocide against former naval officer Adolfo
 Scilingo, who testified in Spain that he had participated in throwing drugged and
 naked dissidents to their deaths in the ocean from airplanes during the dirty war.
 On December 30, 1997, the Spanish judge issued charges against another 36 Argen-
 tine military and police officials, whose names were provided by Scilingo. At year's
 end, Judge Garzon had brought charges against 110 current or former Argentine
 military and police officeals.
 Investigations continued into the 1992 sombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos
 Aires and the 1994 bombing of the city's Jewish community center (AMIA). In No-
 vember the Brazilian authorities located Wilson dos Santos, who 2 weeks prior to
 the AMIA bombing reported that he had heard from Iranian sources that there was
 to be a terrorist attack in Buenos Aires. In December one of these reputed sources,
 Nasrim Mokhtari, was arrested at the Buenos Aires international airport. At year's
 end, investigators were preparing to question Dos Santos and Mokhtari about both
 the AMIA and Israeli embassy bombings. Aiso in November, the authorities indicted
 Carlos Aberto Teileldin, the mechanic who reportedly worked on the truck used in
 the AMIA bombing, on charges of having taken an active part in the attack. He
 joined four other Buenos Aires provincial police officers also charged with participa-
 tion in the bombing.
 b. Disap earance.-hThere were no reports of poitically motivated disappearances.
 Althoughf      Mendoza provincial police were indicted in the case of Paulo
 Cristian Guardati, who disappeared in the province in 1992, the indictments later
 were dropped. However, in May the Mendoza government paid an indemnity of
 $136,000 to his family, as recommended by the Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights (IACHR).
 The Inter-American Court of Human Rights recommended that the Government
 compensate the families of Adolfo Garrido and Raul Baigorria in the amounts of
 $110,000 and $64,000, respectively. The two men disappeared in the province of
 Mendoza in 1990. The Court also called on the Government to investigate the dis-
 appearances and to bring those responsible to justice. Garrido and Baigorria are be-
 lieved to have died in police custody, but no one was arrested or charged in the case.
 Events in January refocused public attention on the mass disappearances that oc-
 curred during the 1976-83 military regime's dirty war against leftists. A group of
 national deputies announced that it would introduce a bill in Congress to annul the
 " Fll Stop" and "Due Obedience" laws, the amnesty statutes that benefit military
 officers aeged to have committed human rights violations. In March Congress re-
 pealed but did not retroactively annul those laws; the repeal was largely symbolic.
 Aiso in January, President Menem announced the Government's intention to move
 
 
 485
 the Naval Mechanics School (ESMA), the scene of some of the worst atrocities of
 the dirty war, and to build a monument to national reconciliation on the site.
 Human rights organizations opposed the proposal, and the courts enjoined the Gov-
 ernment from demolishing the building.
 Human rights groups also criticize a Supreme Court decision in August to up-
 hold a ruling by the Federal Appeals Court in Buenos Aires that rejected a request
 for a search of government files by a parent seeking information about a daughter
 who disappeared during the dirty war. In a five-to-four vote, the Supreme Court
 ruled that the request implied a reopening of criminal cases that were already
 closed. However, one of the Justices who voted with the majority stated that there
 might be other judicial or administrative sources of relief. It was not clear whether
 the Supreme Court's decision would affect similar cases in the federal appeals courts
 in other cities. In October in a separate case, the Court ruled in favor of the public's
 right to seek information from the Government concerning family members who dis-
 appeared during the military dictatorship.
 At the urging of the human rights organization Grandmothers of the Plaza de
 Mayo, judicial authorities continued to investigate the illegal adoptions of approxi-
 mately 250-300 children born to detained dissidents during the dirty war. One of
 the investigations led to the arrest in June of former army General Jorge Rafael
 Videla, the de facto President from 1979 to 1981. Videla was initially arrested and
 jailed but then put under house arrest because of his age. Although Videla was con-
 victed for the crimes he committed during the dirty war and sentenced to life in
 prison in 1985, President Menem pardoned him in 1990. However, it is not clear
 whether the 1990 pardon or the amnesty laws extend to the crime of child abduc-
 tion.
 The investigation by Judge Adolfo Bagnasco and other judges into the fate of ba-
 bies whose mothers disappeared after giving birth in detention continued. In No-
 vember Judge Maria Servini de Cubria ordered the arrest of retired Admiral (and
 former junta member) Emilo Massera, also in connection with an investigation into
 the abduction of babies of parents who disappeared. From prison he was moved to
 a hospital for medical treatment. The judge ordered that, when released from the
 hospital, Massera be placed under house arrest due to his age. In December former
 navy commander Admiral Ruben Franco was arrested on suspicion that he was a
 central organizer of the child abductions. In December retired navy Captain Jorge
 Eduardo Acosta, formerly a senior officer at the ESMA, surrendered and was ar-
 rested, bringing the total to nine senior officers who were arrested, detained, or
 summoned before various judges investigating the child abductions. Judge Bagnasco
 questioned both Massera and Acosta.
 Most reliable estimates place the number of those who, disappeared during the
 dirty war between 10,000 and 15,000. In 1984 the National Commission on Dis-
 appeared Persons (CONADEP) issued a report listing 8,961 names, based on public
 testimony from friends, relatives, and witnesses. Since then the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior's Under Secretariat for Human and Social Rights, which inherited the
 CONADEP files, has added over 700 new names, also based on voluntary reporting.
 At the same time, other names have been removed from the original list, either
 through confirmation of the death or survival of the person who disappeared, or
 through the identification of duplicate entries. The absence of documentary records
 of those who disappeared means that the Government must rely on public testi-
 mony, either voluntary or court-ordered. As CONADEP noted in its report, "It has
 been possible to determine that an important quantity of documentation existed
 that has been destroyed or is being concealed by those responsible for the repres-
 sion."
 A law granting former prisoners of the military regime the right to apply for com-
 pensation from the Government expired in September. Prior to the expiration date,
 the Under Secretariat for Human and Social Rights, which administers the law, had
 received over 13,000 applications, and by year's end had approved over 7,000 of
 them. The Under Secretariat also had received over 7,500 claims under a separate
 law authorizing compensation for the families of persons who died or disappeared
 during the dictatorship. The application period for this law expires in 2000.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture that are similar to those for homicide. Nevertheless, police brutality remains
 a serious problem (see Section 1.a.). Human rights organizations described wide-
 spread police brutality, the use of torture on suspects, and corruption within the po-
 lice forces. In June 1997, the United Nations Committee against Torture criticized
 the Government for tolerating continued brutality and the use of torture in police
 stations and prisons. In December the Government responded to the U.N. commit-
 tee's criticism.
 
 
 On January 14, a Buenos Aires magazine carried a provocative interview with re-
 tired naval Captain Alfredo Astiz, who was accused of torturing and murdering pris-
 oners at the ESMA (see Section 1.b.), including French nuns Alice Domon and
 Leonie Renee Duquet and Swedish student Dagmar Hagelin. Astiz was summoned
 before a federal court for questioning about his statements in the magazine inter-
 view but said that he could not recall the events. The navy ordered him arrested
 and held for 60 days for granting an unauthorized press interview. On January 23,
 the navy chief of staff recommended that the President discharge Astiz, and the
 President did so the same day. Astiz had been forced to retire from the navy in
 1996.
 The Commission for Relatives of Victims of Social and Institutional Violence
 (Cofavi) works to obtain justice in instances of police brutality and at the beginning
 of the year reportedly had obtained 32 convictions for violent crimes in cases it
 brought against police officers since 1992.
 Prison conditions are poor in a number of overcrowded jails where the facilities
 are old and dilapidated. Overcrowding was a problem in the Buenos Aires provincial
 prisons. In September a riot broke out in the provincial prison in Olmos, reported
 to house twice as many inmates as it was built to accommodate. Prisoners also suf-
 fer from poor sanitary conditions and insufficient food.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Erxile.-The Penal Code places limits on the ar-
 rest and investigatory power of the police and the judiciary, but provincial police
 often ignored these restrictions and arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens.
 Human rights groups find it difficult to document such incidents and state that vic-
 tims are reluctant to file complaints because they fear police retaliation or do not
 believe that their complaints would do any good.
 Police occasionally detain teenagers andyoung adults, sometimes overnight, some-
 times for an entire weekend, without formal charges. They do not always provide
 such detainees with the opportunity to call their families or an attorney. These de-
 tainees are released only upon a complaint from relatives or legal counsel.
 Police may detain a suspect for up to 10 hours without an arrest warrant if they
 have a well-founded belief that he has committed, or is about to commit, a crime
 or misdemeanor, and if he is unable to identify himself. However, human rights
 groups argue that this provision of the law is abused widely, and that police often
 detain suspects who do have identification.
 In March the Buenos Aires city council enacted a Code of Misdemeanors to re-
 place the so-called police edicts under which the Federal Police previously had de-
 tained suspected offenders. Human rights groups had long argued that the edicts
 were used as an excuse for arbitrary detentions, particularly of young people, immi-
 grants, prostitutes, and transvestites.
 The law provides for the right to bail, and it is utilized in practice. Nonetheless,
 the r~w:allows pretrial detention for up to 2 years, and the slow pace of the justice
 system often results in lengthy pretrial detention periods. Three-fourths of the in-
 mates in the federal prisons of the greater Buenos Aires area were reportedly in
 pretrial detention. In the prison system of the province of Buenos Aires this figure
 was reported to be as high as 90 percent
 The law does not permit forced exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, while the judiciary is nominally independent and impartial, its proc-
 esses are inefficient, complicated, and, at times, subject to political influence.
 The judicial system is divided into federal and provincial courts, each headed by
 a Supreme Court with chambers of appeal and section courts below it. The system
 is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, inadequate
 administrative support, and incompetence. Allegations of corruption are widely re-
 ported, especially in civil cases. In May the Justice Minister stated that "the system
 is in crisis."
 In an effort to expedite justice in criminal proceedings, the province of Buenos
 Aires implemented a new code of criminal procedure under which the responsibility
 for criminal investigations was shifted from instructional judges to prosecutors.
 Trials are public and defendants have the right to legal counsel and to call de-
 fense witnesses. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial
 courts continued the transition to oral trials in criminal cases, instead of the old
 practice of written submissions. However, substantial elements of the old system re-
 main. For example, before the oral part of a trial begins, judges receive written doc-
 umentation regarding the case, which, according to prominent legal experts, can
 bias a judge before oral testimony is heard. In March Congress enacted a law grant-
 ing greater independence to federal prosecutors and public defenders. The Council
 of the Magistracy, a blue-ribbon judicial council Congress established in December
 
 
 1997, got off to a slow start, however, due to delays in the appointment of its mem-
 bers. The Council has responsibility for appointing and removing federal judges and
 administering the federal court system.
 The Government allowed Father Juan Antonio Puigjane to leave prison in June
 and to begin serving the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Puigjane,
 a Capuchin monk, was a leader of the leftist "All for the Fatherland" movement,
 which in 1989 assaulted La Tablada army barracks near Buenos Aires. Although
 he did not take part in the assault and denied any foreknowledge of it, a court sen-
 tenced him to 20 years in prison. He is to be eligible for parole in 2000. Some inter-
 national human rights groups claim that Puigjane was jailed for political reasons,
 but the Government maintains that he and the 19 others sentenced with him were
 tried and convicted properly of involvement in a violent rebellion against a demo-
 cratically elected government.
 The release of Puigjane followed the publication of an IACHR report on La
 Tablada. The Commission absolved the Government of the use of excessive force in
 repelling the assault, but concluded that the Government committed human rights
 violations after the attackers had surrendered. The Commission also found that the
 Defense of Democracy Act, under which the La Tablada defendants were tried and
 convicted, effectively denied them the right of a ppeal. The Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the lower house of Congress drafted a bil to amend the law in this respect,
 but it was unclear whether this bill, if passed into law, would retroactively benefit
 the La Tablada defendants.
 There were no other reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and the Government generally respects these
 prohibitions. Violations are subject to legal sanction, although in practice, local po-
 lice have the right to stop and search individuals without probable cause.
 Several highly publicized cases of unauthorized telephone taps raised public con-
 cern, and the GIovernment introduced a bill in Congress to address these concerns.
 However, a group of prominent journalists warned that the proposed law could be
 used to abridge the public's right to information, under the guise of protecting the
 right to privacy. They urged the Government to withdraw the measure and legisla-
 tors to vote against it. At year's end, the Senate had approved a bill that would pe-
 nalize the unauthorized recording of telephone conversations, the unauthorized
 photographing or filming of private acts, and the dissemination of such unauthor-
 ized records. The Chamber of Deputies had not yet taken up the bill.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice .....
 A number of independent newspapers and magazines publish freely, and privately
 owned radio and televisions stations broadcast freely as well. All print media are
 privatized, but the Federal Government still owns the Telam wire service, a tele-
 vision station, and a radio network. A few provincial governments also own broad-
 cast media.
 Nonetheless, organizations of journalists expressed concern over a number of de-
 velopment during the year, including the growing concentration of media owner-
 ship, Supreme Court rulings granting a "right of reply," criticisms of the press by
 pubic officials, threats of violence aginst journalists, and the failure to bring the
 Cabezas murder case to a close (see Section l.a.). In April the Supreme Court ruled
 that the Buenos Aires daily newspaper Pagina 12 must print a denial of a story that
 it had published about a former presidential adviser, Domagoj Antonio Petric. Later
 the same month the Court also ruled against Pregon, a daily newspaper in Jujuy
 province, recognizing the right of reply of a provincial legislator whom the news-
 paper had criticized. In August the Court upheld a lower court ruling requiring the
 owners of the defunct magazine Somos to publish a letter from a reader who
 claimed to have been slandered by an article that appeared in the magazine in 1992.
 Jose Luis Cabezas, a photographer for the weely newsmagazine Noticias, was
 murdered in January 1997 outside the coastal resort town of Pinamar, south of Bue-
 nos Aires. His hands were cuffed behind his back, he had been shot in the head,
 and his body left in his car, which had been burned. Several provincial police were
 among those arrested on suspicion of carrying out the murder, but the motive was
 unclear. In May Alfredo Yabran, a reclusive businessman whom Cabezas had photo-
 graphed, committed suicide after the investigating judge issued a warrant for his
 arrest on suspicion of having instigated the crime. Although by year's end the inves-
 tigation appeared to be drawing to a close, no trial had been held yet.
 In August 1997, the Association for the Defense of Independent Journalism
 (ADEPA), a group of prominent journalists, chronicled numerous threats to journal-
 
 
 488
 ists around the country following the Cabezas murder, many in the form of anony-
 mous telephone calls. In a report issued in September, ADEPA concluded that, in
 view of these threats and of the authorities' failure to bring to justice the murderers
 of Cabezas, "the freedom of the press existing in our country since 1983 is seriously
 compromised." In May Amnesty International stated that there was "a prevailing
 climate of intimidation against journalists" and an "increasing frequency of attacks,
 death threats, and harassment." However, despite these circumstances and the
 chilling effects of the Cabezas murder, the press continued to report and criticize
 freely.
 The law provides for academic freedom, and the Government respects this in prac-
 tice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws pro-
 vide for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. However, police
 were called in to break up demonstrations in several provinces. In March the police
 dispersed unemployed workers in Neuquen after they blocked access to the airport
 in the provincial capital. In May, July, and August, police clashed with public sector
 workers in Jujuy who were demanding payment of salary arrears. The police used
 nonlethal force to control the demonstrators in Jujuy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and laws provide for these rights, and the Govern-
 ment respects them in practice.
 A committee composed of representatives of the Ministries of Justice, Foreign Re-
 lations, and the Interior determines grants of refugee status, using the criteria of
 the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol. A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees may partici-
 pate in committee hearings, but may not vote. The Government has granted refugee
 status to numerous persons and accepted them for resettlement. The issue of the
 provision of first asylum did not arise in 1998. There were no reports of the forced
 return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Constitution stipulates that the internal regulations of political parties and
 party nominations for elections be subject to affirmative action requirements to en-
 courage women's representation in elective office. A 1991 law mandates the use of
 gender quotas by all political parties in national elections. A 1993 decree implement-
 ing that law required that a minimum of 30 percent of all political party lists of
 candidates be female. As a result, the presence of women in Congress has increased.
 Of 257 members of the Chamber of Deputies, 70 are women. In the Senate, how-
 ever, whose members still are appointed, only 2 of 72 members are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of domestic and international human rights groups operate with-
 out government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human
 rights cases. The Government is generally cooperative, although not always respon-
 sive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and laws provide for equality for all citizens. A 1988 law pro-
 vides for prison terms of up to 3 years for anyone who arbitrarily restricts, ob-
 structs, or restrains a person based on "race, religion, nationality, ideology, political
 opinion, sex, economic position, social class, or physical characteristics."
 Women.-Violence and sexual harassment against women are problems, but the
 dimensions are difficult to measure. The only available statistics are those based on
 the number of cases reported to police, but many cases go unreported. The National
 Council of Women, a governmental organization created in 1992 in response to rec-
 ommendations in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Discrimination Against Women, worked with the United Nations Children's Fund
 (UNICEF) on the design and implementation of software that would standardize
 data from numerous sources and permit a more accurate evaluation of the scope of
 the problem.
 
 
 In 1994 Congress passed the Law on Protection against Family Violence, which
 authorizes a judge to order an offender excluded from the home. However, human
 rights groups criticized this law as insufficient to address the problem. NGO's work-
 ing in the area of women's rights stress that women too often do not have a full
 understanding of their rights. They are uncertain what constitutes sexual harass-
 ment, what can be considered rape, or when physical and mental abuse is consid-
 ered a crime.
 Rape is a problem, but reliable statistics as to its extent were not available. Mari-
 tal rape and acquaintance rape are recognized by law, but the need for proof, either
 in the form of clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, often presents a
 problem. A rapist is not prosecuted if he offers to marry the victim and she accepts
 his Proposal.
 Public and private institutions offer prevention programs and provide support and
 treatment for women who have been abused, but transitory housing is almost non-
 existent. The Buenos Aires municipal government operates a 24-hour hot line offer-
 ing support and guidance to victims of violence, and also a small shelter for battered
 women, but few others are known to exist.
 Women encounter economic discrimination and occupy a disproportionate number
 of lower paying jobs. Often they are paid less than men for equal work, even though
 this is explicitly prohibited by law. WVomen also are found disproportionately in the
 informal, unregistered labor market, where effectively they are denied work-related
 economic and social benefits enjoyed by registered workers. In March President
 Menem signed a decree calling for the "design and implementation of policies, plans,
 and pros to promote the incorporation of women into the workforce on an equal
 footing with men.'
 The National Council of Women carries out programs to promote equal oppor-
 tunity for women in education and employment, encourage the participation of
 women in politics, and support women's rights programs at the provincial level
 Children.-Education is compulsory, free, and universal for children up to the age
 of 15. However, adequate schooling is unavailable in some rural areas. There are
 numerous health care programs for children as well, though not all children have
 access to them. The Ministry of Interior's Subsecretariat for Human and Social
 Rights works with UNICEF and other international agencies to promote children's
 rights and well being.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, but nongovernmental and church
 sources indicate that child abuse and prostitution are on the rise. The National
 Council on Children and the Family believes that those affected tend to be younger
 than previously thought. The Council, which the Government established in 1990,
 works with federal and local agencies to improve child protection programs. Street
 children can be seen in some large cities, although there are no reliable statistics
 on their numbers.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1994 law aimed at eliminating physical barriers to
 disabled persons regulates standards regarding access to public buildings, parks,
 plazas, stairs, and pedestrian areas. Street curbs, commuter train stations, and
 some buildings in Buenos Aires have been modified to accommodate wheelchairs,
 but some public buildings and lavatories are still inaccessible to the disabled.
 The law prohibits discrimination against disabled persons in employment, edu-
 cation, and the provision of other state services. Since the establishment of the Na-
 tional Program against Discrimination in 1994, the largest single group bringing
 complaints has been disabled persons. The National Advisory Commission on the In-
 tegration of People with Disabilities, a governmental office, and numerous non-
 governmental groups were active in defending the rights of persons with disabilities
 and helping them find employment.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution recognizes the ethnic and cultural identities
 of indigenous peoples and states that Congress shall ensure their right to bilingual
 education, recognize their communities and the communal ownership of their ances-
 tral lands, and ensure their participation in the management of their natural re-
 sources. The National Institute of Indigenous Affairs (INAI) is the government agen-
 cy responsible for implementing these provisions. However, attempts to offer bilin-
 gal education opportunities to indigenous peoples were hampered by a lack of
 trained teachers.
 There is no accurate count of the number of indigenous people. Congress passed
 a law in May providing for the 2000 census to collect information about indigenous
 identity. The INAI estimates that there are 700,000 indigenous people: 450,000 in
 rural communities (the principal groups being the Kollas in Salta and Jujuy, the
 Mapuches in the Patagonian provinces, and the Wichis and Tobas in the northern
 provinces) and 250,000 in urban areas. However, the nongovernmental Indigenous
 Association of the Argentine Republic estimates the indigenous population at 1.5
 
 
 million. Census data show that poverty rates are higher than average in areas with
 large indigenous populations. Indigenous people have higher rates of illiteracy,
 chronic disease, and unemployment. Their standard of living is considerably below
 the national average.
 Since 1994 th6 Government has restored approximately 2.5 million acres of land
 to indigenous communities and expects to return 5 million more by 1999. Nonethe-
 less, some communities were involved in land disputes with provincial governments
 and private companies. In September a Mapuche community in the province of
 Neuquen settled a dispute with the provincial government and a group of energy
 companies that sought to build a gas refinery on lands claimed by the tribe.
 Mapuches in the same province filed a complaint with the IACHR, claiming that
 they were being forced off their ancestral lands in Pulmari, near the Chilean border.
 A group of Kollas in the province of Salta reached agreement with a consortium
 seeking to build a gas pipeline there that the Kollas claimed would damage the en-
 vironment. However, there was no solution in a longstanding land dispute between
 the Kollas and a company producing sugar and citrus products in Salta.
 Religious Minorities.-There were scattered reports of anti-Semitism. In January
 about 20 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery in the town of Ciudadela were vandal-
 ized. The crime resembled a December 1997 incident in which 30 gravestones were
 defiled in a Jewish cemetery in the town of La Tablada. Investigations continued
 into those two incidents, as well as an incident in the La Tablada cemetery in 1996,
 but there were no arrests. According to press reports, two officers dismissed from
 the Buenos Aires provincial police force were the main suspects in two attacks on
 Jewish cemeteries on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve in 1997.
 In April a court sentenced three Buenos Aires youths to 3 years in prison for as-
 saulting a man in 1995 whom they believed to be Jewish. It was the first instance
 of an oral trial under the 1988 antidiscrimination law. The court found that the
 three had acted out of "hatred due to race, religion, or nationality," and they were
 given the maximum penalty provided by the law. However, they were released from
 prison in August pending appeal. At the sentencing in April, some persons in the
 courtroom shouted anti-Semitic remarks. The Interior Ministry's National Institute
 Against Discrimination, the nongovernmental Permanent Assembly for Human
 Rights, and the Delegation of Jewish-Argentine Associations filed suit demanding
 that the perpetrators be identified and tried under the antidiscrimination law.
 In May a court sentenced one man to 2/2 years in prison, and gave three others
 suspended sentences of 2 years for printing and distributing anti-Semitic literature,
 another conviction under the 1988 antidiscrimination law.
 Investigations continued into the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos
 Aires and the 1994 bombing of the city's Jewish community center (AMIA) (see Sec-
 tion l.a.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form "free
 and democratic labor unions, recognized by simple inscription in a special register,"
 and this right is observed in practice. With the exception of military personnel, all
 workers are free to form unions. An estimated 35 percent of the work force is orga-
 nized. Trade unions are independent of the Government or political parties, al-
 though most union leaders support President Menem's Justicialist Party. Most
 unions are affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT). The Govern-
 ment granted legal recognition to a smaller federation, the Central of Argentine
 Workers (CTA), in 1997.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and this is observed in practice.
 There were scattered local work stoppages during the year.
 Many unions also are active in international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides
 unions with the right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements and to have re-
 course to conciliation and arbitration, and these rights are observed in practice. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security ratifies collective bargaining agreements,
 which cover an estimated 75 percent of the work force.
 In recent years, most collective bargaining agreements have been negotiated at
 the plant level. However, in September Congress passed amendments to existing
 labor laws, one of which reserved to national unions the right to represent workers
 at the collective bargaining table, or to delegate this authority to lower-level unions.
 The new law also called for the creation of a mediation and arbitration service with-
 in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security to intervene in collective bargaining
 if requested by labor and management.
 The law prohibits antiunion practices, and the Government enforces this prohibi-
 tion. However, in February the CTA complained to the International Labor Organi-
 
 
 491
 zation (ILO) that three companies had violated union rights protected by ILO con-
 ventions and that the Government had failed to prevent these violations. The ILO
 asked the Government to respond to these charges, and it did so in October.
 Export processing zones exist or are planned in several provinces. The same labor
 laws apply in these zones as in all other parts of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports that it was practiced. The law also pro-
 .bits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohi-
 bition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits employment of children under 14 years of age, except in rare cases where
 the Ministry of Education may authorize a child to work as part of a family unit
 Minors between the ages of 14 and 16 may work in a limited number of job cat-
 egories but not more than 6 hours a day or 35 hours a week. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports of its use (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.). UNICEF estimated that 252,000 children under 15 years of age were
 working. According to the National Council on Children and the Family, two-thirds
 were working in rural areas as farm laborers with their parents and a third were
 employed in urban areas, chiefly as domestic servants.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage is $200
 (200 pesos), which is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for an aver-
 age family of four.
 Federal labor law sets standards in the areas of health, safety, and hours. The
 maximum workday is 8 hours and workweek 48 hours, and overtime payment is re-
 quired for hours in excess of these limits. The law also sets minimums for periods
 of rest and paid vacation. However, laws governing acceptable conditions of work
 are not universally enforced, particularly for the estimated 37 percent of salaried
 workers in the informal sector.
 Occupational health and safety standards are still being developed, but federal
 and provincial governments lack sufficient resources to enforce them fully. Employ-
 ers are required to insure their employees against accidents at the workplace, and
 when traveling to and from work. However, a rash of accidents in the construction
 industry led to demands that the law be strengthened. Workers have the right to
 remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthful work situations, after having
 gone through a claim procedure, without jeopardy to continued employment Never-
 theless, workers who leave the workplace before it has been proven unsafe run the
 risk of being fired; in such cases, the worker has the right to judicial appeal, but
 this process can be very lengthy.
