 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims
 a fourth, Mayotte, which is still governed by France. Until the assassination of
 President Abdallah in November 1989, the Comoros was a de facto one-party state.
 Following a brief rule by European mercenaries who had served as officers in the
 presidential guard, French troops arrived to stabilize the situation. Early in 1990,
 opposition politicians returned from exile, and a wide spectrum of political leaders
 and eight political parties contested presidential elections in two stages. The acting
 President, Said Mohamed Djohar, emerged the winner in the second round. Follow-
 ing the President's inauguration on March 20, 1991, the Djohar coalition Govern-
 ment went through several reorganizations and survived three coup attempts. The
 most recent one, on September 26, 1992, involved two sons of the late President
 Abdallah.
 While several opposition groups exist, the main opposition to the Djohar coalition
 comes from the Udzima Party, formerly the sole legal party. Postponed legislative
 elections finally took place in November and December 1992 and resulted in a truly
 representative National Assembly, which met for the first time January 8, 1993.
 However, the Assembly could reach no consensus with the President on his choice
 of ministers, and after one successful no-confidence vote and the threat of a second,
 Djohar dissolved it on June 18, 1993.
 French military advisers assisted the Djohar Government in restructuring and re-
 ducing the regular military and police forces to about 1,700 persons. Further reduc-
 tions in 1993 left a force of 989 persons.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, but the Comoros is running out of arable
 land, and soil erosion on the steep volcanic slopes is exacerbating the problem. Reve-
 nues from the main crops--vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves--continue to
 fall as the population increases at one of the fastest rates in the world. Comoros
 is part of the French franc monetary zone and depends heavily on France for budg-
 etary support and technical and security assistance.
 The human rights situation changed little in 1993. Nine persons suspected in the
 September 1992 coup attempt were tried, convicted, and given death sentences on

 April 24, 1993. The press gave the trial wide publicity, and a public vigil was kept
 in front of the courthouse. President Djohar on May 1 commuted the sentences to
 life in prison. He was pressured to release these prisoners but showed no willing-
 ness to issue a general pardon. All 13 people convicted of involvement in the coup
 attempt were still in prison at the end of 1993. One reason for the President's reluc-
 tance to pardon the prisoners was that at their sentencing two of the main defend-
 ants, Omar Tamou and Mtara Maesha, admitted to having staged the coup and
 vowed to do so again if released. The presiding judge said their future liberation
 depended on their behavior in jail.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-No disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no substantiated reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, prison conditions usually were unhealthful,
 with overcrowding and inadequate diet common. Organizations wishing to inspect
 conditions at the military prison were denied access repeatedly, though the civilian
 Sison could be visited regularly. For example, the 11 coup plotters held at the
 Moroni jail were visited by the Comorian Human Rights Association in August, but
 international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC), were denied access to the military prison where the two Abdallah sons are
 held. The sons are, however, permitted one visit a week by family members. The
 Comorian Human Rights Association confirmed that prison conditions at the Moroni
 jail were Spartan, with poor sanitation, inadequate diet, and overcrowding the
 norm. The Government admitted to these problems; it blamed them on financial
 constraints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution does not specify a time
 limit between arrest and appearance before a magistrate; however, according to
 usual Comorian procedure, the time limit is 48 days. The law is silent about how
 long prisoners held for security reasons may be detained without being charged (see
 below).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1992 Constitution provides for the equality
 of all citizens before the law and the right of all accused persons to defense counsel.
 The Comorian legal system applies Islamic law and an inherited French legal code.
 Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first instance.
 In regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary is largely independent, and trials
 are public. The Supreme Court has the power to review the decisions of lower
 courts, including the Court of Appeals.
 National security cases--involving attempts to destabilize the country or over-
 throw the Government by violent means--are handled in the regular court system.
 In the past, defendants in security cases were held for up to a year, and then re-
 leased without a trial. This pattern was broken by the trial of the suspected coup
 plotters in April 1993. Moreover, there were unconfirmed allegations that the Presi-
 dent consulted with the judge during the trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property. There were no
 known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy, including with correspondence.
 The Paris-based Indian Ocean Newsletter, which is often highly critical of the Gov-
 ernment, arrives unhindered through the international mail.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, thought, and conscience, and Comorians discussed and criticized the Govern-
 ment and its leading personalities openly. A wide spectrum of political views was
 aired throughout the year. Comorians can receive radio broadcasts from Mayotte
 and two French television stations without interference. Satellite antennas are pop-
 ular, and amateur radio licenses are granted without hindrance. Several small inde-
 pendent newspapers are published, and they operate without interference and freely
 criticize the Government. The weekly semiofficial newspaper also publishes articles
 critical of some government policies. Lack of funds and illiteracy are the biggest ob-
 stacles to a wide press audience. Foreign journals and newspapers are available, as
 are books from abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Under the late President Abdallah, Comorians
 
 
 61
 were circumspect about organizing public political gatherings, and political
 groupings were careful not to antagonize the Government. Since 1990, as new politi-
 cal parties formed and old ones resumed activity, numerous rallies and assemblies
 have taken place with a minimum of governmental interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the principles and
 rules which guide the State and its institutions." The State upholds the right of non-
 Muslims to practice their faith, and there are churches for the small Catholic and
 Protestant populations. Christian missions work in local hospitals and schools, but
 by local custom they are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are freely granted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens now have the right to change their government through peaceful means.
 The Constitution gives legal status to a multiparty system and provides for other
 fundamental rights. It calls for new legislative elections to be held within 40 days
 of the dissolution of the National Assembly. Organizational problems, concerns
 about the security of voter lists, and financial difficulties caused these elections to
 be delayed until the end of December. The newly formed party of the President, Le
 Rassemblement pour Ia Democratie ct le Renouveu (RDR), emerged with a slim ma-
 jority in the Assembly. Opposition groups boycotted portions of the elections, citing
 irregularities on the part of the RDR
 Although the nature of Comorian society makes it difficult for women to get in-
 volved in politics, they have the right to vote and participate in the political process.
 There were 11 women candidates in the 1992 legislative elections, none of whom
 was victorious. In August 1991, the first Comorian woman was appointed to a high
 government position: Sittou Raghadat Mohamed was named Secretary of State or
 Population and the Condition of Women. Traditional social, religious, and economic
 institutions also importantly influence the country's political life. Interisland rival-
 ries have been a persistent and growing factor. Village notables and Muslim reli-
 gious leaders tend to dominate local politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In May 1990, a group of private citizens established the Comoros Human Rights
 Association (CHRA, also known as the Comorian Association for the Rights of Man).
 The Minister of Justice praised the CHRA for its report on prison conditions and
 promised to improve them but little was changed during the year. The CHRA had
 access to civilian prisons and worked as well to ensure fair treatment of injured
 prisoners being treated at the local hospital. In one recent case, CHRA involvement
 resulted in the transfer of a prisoner charged with incest from the public hospital,
 where he was being mistreated, to a missionary facility.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens regardless
 of race, sex, or religion. Nevertheless, within Comorian society, men have the domi-
 nant role. Change in the status of women is most evident in the major towns.
 Women are noi required to wear a veil. Women are finding increasing employment
 opportunities in the small paid labor force and generally receive wages comparable
 to those of men in similar work. However, school enrollment of females is well below
 that of males. A Comorian Women's Federation, formed in late 1989, has the goal
 of developing a family bill of rights.
 Property rights do not disfavor women; for example, the house the father of the
 bride traditionally provides to the couple at the time of their marriage remains her
 property, even in the case of divorce.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs. However, medical au-
 thorities, the Women's Federation, and the police believe that violence against
 women is rare, in part because of the nonviolent nature of Comorian society. The
 Government has not addressed this issue specifically, and there are no studies or
 statistics indicating the extent of the problem. In prnciple, a woman can seek pro-
 tection though the courts in the case of violence, but in reality the issue would most
 likely be addrssed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Children.-The few legal instruments which address the rights and welfare of
 children are generally not enforced because of a lack of inspectors.
 
 
 62
 People with Disabilities.-No legislation is in force or pending concerning acces-
 sibility to public buildings for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution allows workers, including most
 public sector workers, to form unions and to strike, but these rights only became
 a reality in 1990 with the association of some workers into small unions. Farming
 on small landholdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily
 activity of most of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is small; less than
 8,800 including government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding them. Since
 1990 groups of teachers, civil servants, and dock workers-who in previous years
 formed temporary associations to press their demands--have created unions for pur-
 poses of collective action.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-There are no laws that pro-
 hibit antiunion discrimination or protect collective bargaining, which is still in its
 infancy. Labor legislation, to the extent that it exists, is found mainly in the Labor
 Code, which is not rigidly enforced. The Code does not address the issue of collective
 bargaining. In the private sector, wages are set by informal employee/employer ne-
 gotiations. Public workers' wages are set by government policy through the Min-
 istries of Finance and Labor. Economic rather than political impediments stand in
 the way of a more active role by labor organizations; unofficial unemployment fig-
 ures exceed 70 percent.
 Most unions are in the public sector. Strikes in 1993 usually related to
 nonpayment of wages. In recent years it has not been uncommon for government
 workers to go months without being paid. There are no restrictions on unions join-
 in g federations or affiliating with international bodies.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines 15 years
 as the minimum age for the employment of children. The Ministry of Labor is lax
 about enforcing this provision but child labor is not an issue due to the lack of em-
 ployment opportunities for adolescents and young adults. Children generally help
 with the work of their families in the large subsistence farming and fishing sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in 13 years and
 no longer reflect economic realities in the Comoros. The minimum wage for a la-
 borer is about $15 (4,600 Comorian Francs) per month. Efforts in 1993 to raise the
 minimum wage failed. However, most workers earn some income from subsistence
 agriculture or fishing and receive support from the extended family. The hours of
 work in any one job rarely exceed 35 hours per week. The Government periodically
 reminds employers to respect the Labor Code, which guarantees 1 day off per week,
 plus 1 month of paid vacation per year, but does not set a standard workweek.
 Overall, the Ministry of Labor sets very few standards. The authorities gave no con-
 certed attention to health and safety standards in the miniscule manufacturing sec-
 tor.
