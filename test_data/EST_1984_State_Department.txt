 ESTONIA'
 An independent Baltic state between the two World Wars,
 Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became a
 constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. The United States does
 not recognize the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Estonia is subjected to the same
 centralized rule, the same Constitution and system of justice,
 the same restrictions on civil and political liberties, and
 the same police controls as the republics of the Soviet
 state. In addition, Soviet policy toward the Estonian nation
 arouses fear of russification and of the destruction of
 Estonian values. Because of a low birthrate and the influx of
 Slavic settlers in recent years, Estonians now make up only 63
 percent of the total population as compared to 92 percent in
 1939.
 Human rights violations appear to have increased in 1984 as
 police harassment and imprisonment of Estonian national,
 religious, and human rights activists continue and intensify.
 Any manifestation of national rights is harshly repressed by
 Soviet authorities. Attempts to keep religious faithalive
 are countered by Soviet harassment of religious leaders.
 Estonians involved in human rights issues have also been
 severely punished with prison sentences.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 average. In recent years, however, a decline in food supplies
 and in some consumer goods has caused popular discontent. The
 manner of Soviet exploitation of Estonian natural resources
 has also been criticized.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 It is difficult to establish official responsibility for the
 deaths of persons involved in political dissent. Soviet
 persecution of those attempting to defend Estonian national
 rights, however, may lead to their deaths. In March 1981,
 Juri Kukk, a scientist who left the Communist Party because he
 had become disillusioned with Soviet policies, died in a
 Soviet prison camp where he had been on a hunger strike.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In Estonia, as throughout the Soviet system, cruel and inhuman
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Estonia,
 the human rights abuses described in the report on the
 U.S.S.R. apply also to Estonia. This report discusses only
 instances of repression specific to Estonia.

 treatment of political prisoners occurs during both
 interrogation and confinement in labor camp, prison, or
 psychiatric hospital. Physical and psychological abuse of
 prisoners is common, as is detention under extremely unhealthy
 or otherwise onerous conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and sentenced for exercising
 what, in effect, are internationally recognized human rights.
 On April 19, 1984, Estonian dissident Enn Tarto was sentenced
 to a maximum of 10 years in a labor camp and 5 years in
 internal exile for signing several letters condemning Soviet
 violations of human rights in Estonia and the Soviet invasion
 of Afghanistan. Mart Niklus, a signer of the August 1979
 "Baltic Appeal," was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp and
 5 years in internal exile. The Appeal, issued on the 40th
 anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact which
 provided the basis for Soviet annexation of the Baltic states,
 called for a repudiation of the Pact and the restoration of
 full self-determination to the Baltic states. In May 1981,
 Sergey Soldatov, an ethnic Russian who was a founding member
 of the Estonian Democratic Movement, was forced to emigrate
 from the Soviet Union.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite guarantees of judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the state completely
 controls the judicial process and, in political cases,
 arbitrarily decides the outcome of all trials to suit its
 requirements. No rights of a defendant override the
 self-determined compelling needs of the state.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in personal life is pervasive through
 its use of informers, mail censorship, electronic monitoring
 of telephones, and other devices. Contacts between Estonians
 and visitors from foreign countries are strongly discouraged,
 and those who indulge in such contacts are subject to
 harassment by the authorities.
 Because of similarities between the Estonian and Finnish
 languages, many Estonians understand Finnish and stay in touch
 with developments in the West through Finnish radio and
 television. In 1982, an Estonian newspaper complained about
 Finnish telecasts and accused Finland of beaming propaganda
 broadcasts into Estonia. Central authorities reportedly
 rebuked local officials for their attack on the Finnish
 Government. Nonetheless, there have been reports that the
 Soviet Government is jamming Finnish broadcasts, although
 Estonian residents who wish to receive them are still able to
 do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties provided that their exercise accords with
 the strengthening and security of the socialist system. In
 
 
 965
 ESTONIA
 practice, the authorities do not tolerate dissident behavior.
 All legal means of publication are under the complete control
 of the party and the state. In March 1983, as part of a wave
 of arrests in Estonia, three human rights activists, Lagle
 Parek, Heiki Ahonen, and Arvo Pesti, who were involved in
 underground publications and human rights issues, were
 arrested.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public
 organizations, but the authorities subject all associations
 and organizations to their strict control. Nationalist
 demonstrations by Estonian high school students in 1980 were
 forcibly broken up by Soviet security forces which arrested
 hundreds of persons and charged the organizers with
 'hooliganism.' The Soviet reaction prompted an-open letter to
 the Soviet media signed by 40 Estonian intellectuals. The
 letter, which the Soviet media did not publish, outlined
 Estonian grievances, but emphasized that russification of
 Estonian society was the primary cause of the tensions which
 had provoked the student demonstration.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Estonia.
 Although tne Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity movement might spread,
 this has been especially true in the Baltic states. In
 Estonia, the party leadership has repeatedly scored local
 efforts to call strikes at state enterprises.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In spite of constitutional guarantees of the right to profess
 or not to profess any religion, religious believers are
 subject to many restrictions. In May, for example, the
 Estonian Supreme Court sentenced Pavel Vezikov to 2 years in a
 labor camp for allegedly circulating religious manuscripts.
 As part of a Soviet program to reduce the authority and
 activities of the Lutheran Church, many Lutheran pastors have
 been called in for questioning during the past 4 years, and
 tne professional licenses of several have been revoked.
 Nevertheless, religious belief on the part of Estonians is
 strong, as demonstrated by the reportedly large gathering
 which attended a meeting addressed by Dr. Billy Graham in
 Tallinn in September 1984.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authorities do not respect the right of emigration.
 Although one family that had been seeking to emigrate to the
 United States for over 6 years was permitted to emigrate,
 three other families who have waited that long were refused.
 At least nine Estonian families have repeatedly been denied
 permission to emigrate to Israel. Emigration is discouraged
 through intimidation and harassment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Soviet authorities attempt strictly to forbid political

 activity outside the framework of the Communist Party.
 Estonians are, statistically at least, fairly well represented
 within the party membership, although at the lower levels of
 the party. In Estonia, ethnic Estonians comprise only 52
 percent of the membership as compared totheir 63 percent
 share of the total population.
 Beginning in the early 1970's, political activity in Estonia
 outside the Communist Party has increased. In 1972, a
 memorandum to the United Nations from the Estonian National
 Front and the Estonian Democratic Movement asked for the
 restoration of Estonia's independence through elections
 supervised by the U.N. A memorandum issued in 1974 supported
 the previous one and reported the arrest of four persons
 accused of being associated with it. In 1975, a joint
 memorandum to participants in the Helsinki Conference called
 for genuine detente based on respect for human rights and
 appealed for the restoration of the independence of the Baltic
 states.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government rejects any foreign criticism of its
 human rights record, maintaining that all internationally
 recognized human rights are fully protected. Its attitude
 toward investigation of the human rights situation in Estonia
 is uncompromisingly negative.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 By Soviet standards, Estonia's 1.5 million population enjoys a
 high standard of living and an advanced industry. Soviet
 statistics for the first 6 months of 1984 show that the rate
 of growth for industrial production was 4.5 percent and for
 labor productivity 4.2 percent.
 The exploitation of Estonia's oil shale under central Soviet
 control has provoked sharp criticism in Estonia. Used for
 thermal energy production and for the chemical industry, the
 deposits have been exploited at an accelerating rate, although
 only about a third of the electrical energy produced from this
 source can be used in Estonia. In addition to the rapid
 depletion of a national resource, the enormous amount of
 pollution and environmental damage caused by shale
 exploitation has aroused concern.
 Estonian-Russian tensions are always close to the surface in
 Estonia; they appear to be increasing as the proportion of
 the Russian-speaking population grows. One manifestation of
 this is the reluctance of Estonians to learn or use the
 Russian language. In 1979, only 24 percent of Estonians said
 they spoke Russian well, a decline of 5 percent from 1970.
 As a result of student demonstrations in 1980 which were
 forcibly broken up by Soviet security forces, Estonian
 intellectuals addressed two open letters to the authorities in
 which russification was a major topic. The second one, in
 March 1982, complained about the growth of Estonia's
 Russian-speaking population, the building of Soviet bases, the
 appointment of officials who took a hard line on nationality
 questions, and the exploitation of Estonia's resources without
 Estonian control. In education, the letter said,

 russification is particularly flagrant. Only token efforts
 are being made to teach Russian-speaking children Estonian.
 On the other hand, Estonians are under strong pressure to
 pursue Russian-language programs. At the university level,
 particularly in the sciences, courses are often taught in
 Russian, even when Estonians make up the majority of a class.
 In 1984, an assistant to the Estonian Minister of Justice,
 Valdo Randpere, and his wife, Leila Miller, an Estonian
 singer, defected to the West citing the russification of
 Estonia as one of the principal reasons for their departure.
