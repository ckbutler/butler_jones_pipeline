 IVORY COAST
 The Ivorian one-party system is based on a broad
 consensus supporting the goals and methods of Ivory
 Coast's socio-economic development. Until now, this
 consensus has been reinforced by the political skills
 of President Houphouet-Boigny and the Ivorian leader-
 ship, by the open dialogue within the sole politi-
 cal party, the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, by
 the widely shared perception that the Ivorian standard
 of living continues to improve, and by the belief that
 Ivory Coast's successful development policies rest upon
 an effort to meet the basic human needs of the entire
 population.
 The Government of Ivory Coast has a strong commitment
 to human rights and has welcomed and supported the
 human rights policies of the United States. Its
 delegation to the United Nations Commission for Human
 Rights has cooperated with our delegation. During
 1978, Ivorians participated in colloquia on human
 rights in Rwanda and in Senegal and with the Govern-
 ment's support applied to open an Ivorian chapter of
 Amnesty International. Although Ivory Coast remains a
 developing country in which the vital needs of some of
 its people cannot be fulfilled, its economic growth has
 permitted appreciable improvement in the standard of
 living of its people.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law, is contrary to Ivorian
 custom and is not condoned by the Government. Govern-
 ment officials respect Ivorian laws and customs pro-
 hibiting torture. There have been no reports of
 torture in-Ivory Coast.

 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Arbitrary deprivation of life or liberty is neither
 permitted nor practiced. Although capital punishment
 is not legally prohibited, it has not been imposed in
 any case since independence. Police and other govern-
 ment officials do not treat individuals or prison
 inmates in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner. The
 poor, particularly if they are foreign Africans, are
 occasionally treated brusquely. Prison conditions are
 poor. Prisoners rely on family or friends to supplement
 a sparse prison diet and to provide other basic needs.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes pro-
 hibit arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. However,
 the Government takes firm measures,including detention,
 to suppress public protests or manifestations it considers
 threats to internal security. For example, in early
 1977 the Government briefly detained about 1400 students
 who organized or participated in demonstrations.
 According to the Government, there are no political
 prisoners in Ivory Coast; the Department of State is
 not aware of any. The last known political prisoners
 were given amnesty by President Houphouet-Boigny
 in 1975.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to the Ivorian penal code, anyone arrested
 must be brought before a prosecutor or judge within
 48 hours and has the right to legal counsel. Patterned
 after the French system, the right to a fair public
 trial exists and, to our knowledge, is respected. In
 most rural areas, however, justice is often administered
 at the village level through traditional tribal institu-
 tions.
 Trials vary in length from a few hours to several
 weeks. There is a pre-trial criminal investigation
 without a statutory time limitation. The public
 prosecutor can detain a suspect for up to 48 hours
 without charging him. The prosecutor can renew this
 
 
 86
 48-hour period indefinitely. Pre-trial detention,
 therefore, may be lengthy. The Prosecutor recent-
 ly pointed out that the lack of sufficient judicial
 personnel keeps many suspects in detention for unaccept-
 ably long periods before their cases are ready for
 trial. Although the Ivorian judicial system provides
 for court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants,
 in practice such attorneys are not readily available.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 In the modern parts of cities, legal safeguards against
 arbitrary searches are respected. In less developed
 urban and rural sectors, legal safeguards are sometimes
 ignored as a result of illiteracy, poorly trained
 officials and local customs.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Ivorian economy is a free enterprise system with
 considerable government participation in sectors
 where private industry will not or cannot provide
 investment. Ivorian economic policy has avoided
 ideological approaches and has stressed practical
 techniques. While the Ivorian economy has developed at
 an impressive pace, significant income disparities and
 uneven distribution of goods and services persist. In
 some areas, such as health, economic growth has not
 significantly mitigated poor conditions. In other
 areas, such as housing, shortages exist despite signi-
 ficant government efforts to improve conditions. Parts
 of the country have not shared in the general prosper-
 ity as much as have the larger urban centers and the
 areas which produce export crops. On balance, however,
 Ivorian development policies have made considerable
 progress in providing the basic needs of the people.
 Among the poor, for example, there are rarely food
 shortages which adversely affect their nutrition. The
 Government spends thirty to forty percent of its budget
 for education. Although problems remain, steady progress
 ig being made in reducing illiteracy, in increasing
 
 
 87
 the number of Ivorian teachers and in transforming a
 basically French educational system to meet Ivorian
 needs.
 We do not think that corruption significantly affects
 government development policies. However, mismanagement
 and inefficiency have had an impact on the Government's
 ability to improve the standard of living. Poor
 coordination among the various ministries, for example,
 recently led the Government to overspend and, subsequent-
 ly, to cut back on development projects. The single
 most important source of income to the Government in
 most years is the implicit export tax on production of
 coffee and cocoa, Ivory Coast's principal income
 earners. The tax derives from the difference between
 the price paid planters by the commodity marketing
 administration and the price in the world market. This
 tax is, in effect, a proportional one. The sales and
 excise taxes and import duties are regressive. Ivory
 Coast has a progressive income tax system, but rates
 are low and the resulting income redistribution is
 negligible.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Politial Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 In Ivory Coast there is freedom of thought, speech and
 religion. There is freedom of assembly except when the
 Government perceives a significant and immediate danger
 to public order. In such cases the government acts
 firmly and may temporarily detain unruly elements.
 All Ivorian media are controlled by the Ministry of
 Information. However, many foreign publications are
 readily available.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel, i.e., occasional check points outside major
 urban centers where police verify that identification,
 
 
 88
 motor vehicle licenses, insurance papers, and other
 documents are in order. Ivorians can freely travel
 abroad and emigrate.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process in Ivory Coast operates on the
 basis of a one-party system.   However, there is
 considerable popular participation within the party.
 For example, party members, which includes practically
 all adults, participate at the neighborhood and village
 level in the selection of the secretaries general
 and other officers of the local sub-sections of the
 Democratic Party of Ivory Coast. They also elect local
 representaives to meetings of the party sub-section
 where candidates for the national assembly are proposed
 to the national political bureau. Presidential elec-
 tions are held every five years by universal adult
 suffrage. Openly contested primary elections of the
 party's candidates for mayor in some Ivorian urban
 centers were recently held for the first time. There
 are numerous professional and other associations
 through which the people can press their views, needs
 and complaints on party and government officials. The
 President meets with these associations and holds
 extensive and candid dialogues to resolve significant
 or difficult issues. Labor unions are closely tied to
 the Government but have a fair degree of freedom in
 representing worker interests. Strikes are not illegal,
 but the thrust of the labor code insists on mediation,
 arbitration and "cooling-off" periods to resolve labor
 disputes.
 There are no governmental policies or institutional
 forces which cause, support, or condone either racial or
 sexual discrimination. The participation of women in
 public affairs is encouraged by official government
 policy. In 1975 the Ivorian leadership decided that
 the number of women deputies in the National Assembly
 would be increased (there are now eleven), and in 1976 a
 ministry concerned with women's affairs was established
 with a woman as minister.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Ivory Coast has been cooperative
 towards an inquiry into its human rights situation;
 in 1975 President Houphuet-Boigny personally received a
 representative of Amnesty International. We are not
 aware of any other inquiries regarding human rights in
 Ivory Coast.
