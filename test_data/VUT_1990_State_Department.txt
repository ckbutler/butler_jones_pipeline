 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, A South Pacific island nation with an estimated
 population of 150,000, became independent in 1980, following
 more than 70 years of joint British-French rule. It has a
 parliamenta ry system of government with a prime minister and a
 46-member parliament. The President has largely ceremonial
 powers, excppt when he is acting on the advice of the Council
 of Ministers. Following independence, a short-lived rebellion
 on two islands was put down by government forces with the help
 of Papua New Guinea troops, leaving a legacy of suspicion
 toward outside interference. Vanuatu's citizens are divided
 by a variefy of languages, by the more than 80 islands that
 make up tho nation, and by the colonial experience. Over time
 Vanuatu h t largely overcome these differences to forge a
 strong sense of nationhood. Political legitimacy is based on
 majority/rule, supported by both Melanesian and Western
 tradition. Following free and fair elections in 1983 and
 1987, Vanuatu underwent a period of domestic political turmoil
 beginning in May 1988, following a violent antigovernment
 protest march led by a government minister. The civilian
 authorities control the police and the paramilitary mobile
 forces.
 The Vanuatu economy is dependent on international trade and
 therefore vulnerable to shifts in world market prices. Prior
 to the political turbulence, tourism earned more foreign
 exchange than all other exports combined. The downward trends
 in tourism and foreign investment, started by cyclone Uma in
 early 1987 and exacerbated by the violence in 1988 and
 subsequent political uncertainty, began to show a reversal in
 1990. Tourism picked up considerably and the hotel and resort
 industry by year's end was operating at full capacity due to
 the expansion of air links to Australia and New Zealand,
 political stability, and a consequent improvement in the
 business and investment environment.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press,*freedom of
 assembly, and women's rights were the principal human rights
 problems in 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HL4JAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither the Government nor any organized group resorted to
 political or other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced
 by the courts. While the law provides for prisoners to have
 recourse to an ombudsman, the position has not been filled
 since Vanuatu became independent in 1980.

 VANUATU:
 d.- Arbitrary'Arrest,'Detention,'or-Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. During the period of
 political turmoil, opposition figures charged that the,
 Governmeint tied'td interfere'with their access-to counsel by
 revoking the-residency permit of an-'expatriate lawyer who had
 been a-ptominent-advisor to the opposition. However, all of
 the "interim government" defendants had outside counsel
 availabld to them'in their trial and in the subsequent
 successfal'Appeal "The constitutional provision that suspects
 must be'informed of charges and given a speedy hearing before
 a judge is observed-in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven,
 prohibiti6n against double jeopardy, the right 'of habeas
 corpus; and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are free
 of military or'executive interference. Throughout the
 constitutional turmoil of December 1988 and the sudbsequent
 trial of the members of the "interim government," the, courts
 functioned freely and their authority was upheld without
 question. The Government acquiebced without complaint in the
 appellate court's ultimate dismissal of charges against the
 four convicted members of the "interim government." There
 were no feports of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial
 - authority in 1990. There are no political prisdnees.
 - f. Arbittary Interference-with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home,
 or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the'Constftution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, there are significant restrictions in practice. The
 Government controls the country's only national newspaper and
 manages the national radio. There is no independent newspaper
 or radio. In the past -the Government has denied its opponents
 access-to the media, and a foreign journalist has been
 expelled frbm the country for what the Government deemed
 inaccurate reporting. Prime Minister Lini has stated that
 unbridled freedom of speech undermines the traditional social
 structure and stability. In September the Parliament approved
 Lini's proposal for a Constitutional Committee that will
 consider restrictions on freedom of speech. Twenty of the 30
 members of this Committee are from Lini's Vanua'aku Party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or other groups. There are two main political parties
 and several smaller ones. The out-of-power politicans who
 have left or been ejected from the ruling Vanua'aku party have
 formed their own political parties and are actively canvassing
 for support. Permits must be obtained to hold public
 demonstrations and rallies. Although permits are not
 generally refused, opposition leaders complain that

 VANUATU
 government restrictions on the timing and venue of rallies are
 politically motivated.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and has been generally
 respected in practice. Missionaries of various Christian
 denominations work without restriction. However, prompted by
 Prime Minister Lini's concerns that charismatic and
 evangelical groups undermine the traditional culture, the
 Constitutional Review Committee will consider restrictions on
 the activities of other than established religious groups.
 The Committee is to .complete its recommendations and submit
 them to Parliament by August 1991.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally and to return from abroad without restrictions.
 However, there have been complaints that the Government
 arbitrarily revoked residency permits of foreigners who
 displeased the party or government leaders.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right freely to change the government
 through periodic multiparty elections. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983 and 1987; both
 the campaign and voting were considered by outside observers
 to have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been freely contested and fair. However, measures
 under consideration by the Constitutional Committee, including
 extending the terms of the President and Prime Minister, could
 seriously undermine Vanuatu's democratic system.
 Beginning with a violent protest march by antigovernment
 demonstrators in May 1988, Vanuatu underwent a period of
 domestic political turmoil. Subsequent ejections and
 resignations of antigovernment members from Parliament led the
 President to attempt to sack the Vanua'aku Party Government,
 install a caretaker "interim government," and call for a new
 general election. After the Vanuatu Supreme Court declared
 the President's action illegal, the Government arrested the
 President and his five-man "interim government" on charges of
 sedition, incitement to mutiny, unlawful assembly, and
 conspiracy to overthrow the Government. They were tried in
 February 1989, and four of the six were convicted; however,
 all were freed in April 1989 by the Appeals Court for lack of
 sufficient evidence.
 Major opposition parties remained outside of Parliament for
 all of 1990, their members having resigned in protest or been
 expelled. They continued to demand general elections, and
 boycotted by-elections held to fill the vacant seats. In 1990
 the Melanesian Progressive Party and the Union of Moderate
 Parties announced that they would form a united front to
 oppose Prime Minister Lini in the next election. The ruling
 Vanua'aku Party is the primary policymaking body, and its
 decisions are implemented by the.Government.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There -'Are no local nongovernmental human rights
 organizAtions.  There were no requests for investigations by
 outside human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose
 ancestors probably'migrated from New Guinea. The small
 minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and
 Europeans, generally concentrated in the twd-towns and on a
 few pl-ahtations," experience discrimination with regard-to land
 ownership. Althbugh there have been allegations of corrupt'
 practices by members of the ruling Vanua'aku Party, there is
 no evidence to suggest a pattern of ethnic discrimination in
 the Gover6ment's provision of basic services. However, there
 are reportb of discrimination in hiring and the provision of
 services against both phrsons and communities suspected or
 known to sUpport opposition political candidates.
 While Women have equal rights under the law, they are only
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a general reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that women should devote themselves
 primarily to childrearing. There are no women leaders in
 Vanuatu's municipal or village councils, churches, or Chambers
 of Commerce. There is one female member of Parliament.
 Nevertheless,- an increasing number of women are finding work
 in the'unskilled, semiskilled, and service occupations.
 Members of the National Council of Women have expressed
 concern that the Constitutional Review Committee established
 in September may recommend strengthening the legal authority
 of village chiefs, who are viewed as- a primary obstacle to the
 attainment of social, political, and economic rights by
 women. Should the Parliament approve such a recommendation,
 it would be a major setback to new efforts to- improve the
 status of women in Vanuatu.
 While no accurate data are available, violence against women,
 particularly wife beating, is reportedly common. Several
 severe cases have been reported in which victims have died.
 Although there are no specific laws hgainst spouse beating,
 the courts have dealt severely with such cases, using common
 law assault asa basis-for imposing punishment. However, very
 few cases of wife beating are brought to the attention of the
 authorities, and eveh fewer are actually prosecuted. Usually
 the cases are dropped by the women involved before going to
 court. The police are reluctant to intervene in what are
 considered purely domestic matters.
 The majority of women in Vanuatu enter into marriage through
 "bride price payment." On those islands where the custom of
 paying "bride price" is observed, there is often a feeling
 that the bride is the property of the husband and can be dealt
 with as he chdoses. -The National Council of Women is working
 to educate women about their rights and to urge establishment
 of legal protection for women against abuse and neglect.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vanuatu's workers have the right to organize unions, choose
 their own representatives, and strike, but strikes have seldom
 occurred, due in part to high rates of unemployment. Unions
 may not affiliate with international labor federations without
 Government permission. The fundamental legislation
 establishing the right to organize into unions, setting out
 the scope of union activity, and providing for the arbitration
 and conciliation of labor disputes consists of the Trade Union
 Act of 1983 and the Trade Disputes Act of 1983. There are
 some 20 trade unions, grouped under an umbrella organization,
 the Vanuatu Trade Union Congress, which is a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The trade
 unions are independent of the Government. Vanuatu is not a
 member of the International Labor Organization.
 An official of the American Federation of Labor and Congress
 of Industrial Organizations, who had been working with Vanuatu
 labor leaders on a continuing basis to strengthen union
 activities was declared a prohibited immigrant in late 1988,
 reportedly because of allegations that he participated in or
 encouraged the May 1988 demonstrations. Despite his efforts
 to return to Vanuatu in 1990, the Government continues to
 refuse him entry.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Vanuatu exercise the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The high percentage of the population still
 engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing, however,
 serves as a deterrent to extensive union activity. There are
 no export processing zones, and labor laws apply uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c.- Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there
 have been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 years of age are not permitted to work
 outside of family-owned agriculture, where many children do
 assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18
 years of age is restricted by occupational category and
 conditions of labor--such as shipping and nighttime
 employment. In general, the high level of adult unemployment
 discourages the use of child labor. Vanuatu's minimum wage
 laws are effectively enforced by the Labor Department.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage legislation provides about 5a cents per hour for
 nonagricultural workers, and about 45 cents per hour for
 agricultural workers. Most workers are not in the wage
 economy and are thus outside the scope of the minimum wage
 law. For the remainder, these minimums provide an adequate
 standard of living within the local context. There are laws
 to regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and
 other conditions of service. -Vanuatu's Employment Act,
 enforced by the Labor Department, includes provisions for
 safety standards and a maximum workweek of 44 hours.
