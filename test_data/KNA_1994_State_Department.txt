 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations is a small two-
 island state with a democratic, parliamentary form of government. The Constitution
 provides the smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the Federation in accordance with certain enumerated proce-
 dures. A Prime Minister, a Cabinet, and a Legislative Assembly govern the country.
 The Governor General, with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State
 and must call general elections at least every 5 years. After national elections in
 November 1993, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds and his People's Action Move-
 ment formed a coalition with the Nevis Reformation Party to retain control of the
 Government.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes a 50-person Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 The mixed economy is based on sugar cane, tourism, and light industry. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry (the country's
 largest economic enterprise) and 85 percent of all arable land are owned by a state
 corporation. Economic growth continued at about 6 percent, due partly to agricul-
 tural exports and to investor confidence in plans to develop further a deep water
 port facility and the southeastern peninsula of St. Kitts.
 Human rights continued to be generally respected during 1994, although the Gov-
 ernment continued to restrict access by the opposition to government-controlled
 media.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Although there were no political or
 extrajudicial killings in St. Kitts and Nevis in 1994 there were two instances of po-
 litically charged murder. In October the son of the 5eputy Prime Minister (and Mm-
 ister of Education) and his fiancee disappeared and were later found murdered in
 an incident apparently related to drug trafficking. On October 13, the Chief of the
 polie Special Branch and Criminal Investigation Division, who led the investigation
 into these disappearances, was murdered as he left his home. Police arrested a sus-
 pect with drug trafficking ties, and the case remains under investigation. In both
 instances the Government and the opposition accused each other of involvement
 with drug traffickers.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of polticaly motivated disappearances.
 However, there was an instance of politically charged disappearance. In July the
 former Kittitian ambassador to the United Nations, his wife and family, were lost
 at sea during a Sunday pleasure boat outing. Extensive air and sea searches were
 conducted, but no evidence or remains were discovered. In the 1980's the former am-
 bassador had been publicly accused of money laundering and drug trafficking, and
 this case, like the two instances of murder described above, is the subject of charges
 and countercharges between the Government and the opposition.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought before a court within 48 hours. There were no reported
 cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that every person ac-
 cused of a crime must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these require-
 ments are generally observed. The judiciary, a part of the Eastern Caribbean legal
 system, is highly regarded and independent. Final appeal may be made to the Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or political courts. Legal as-
 sistance is available for indigen defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives
 of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, for the most part, the authorities respected these provisions in
 practice. However, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St.
 Kitt, and these media generally did not adequately publicize rallies and conven-
 
 
 498
 tions held by the opposition political party. There is a religious television station
 and a privately owned radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. he papers are free to criticize
 the Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International news publications
 are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Political parties organized demonstrations, rallies,
 and public meetings regularly during the 1993 election campaign, usually without
 government interference. Opposition parties did claim government intimidation in
 the form of excessive police presence or armed nonpart supporters during the cam-
 paign and during subsequent opposition protests, whic included violence, following
 the election. The December 1993 14-day state of emergency successfully ended the
 demonstrations. Government security forces patrolled the nation extensively to pre-
 empt protests scheduled for June 1, the 6-month anniversary of the 1993 election.
 Opposition members claimed that nonuniformed police ramed the countryside in
 unmarked cars during the predawn hours of June 1 to intimidate potential protest-
 ers. The Government asserted that its preemptive patrlling was warrantedby the
 looting and burning that had occurred in the street marches m December 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreigionists  other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Coun try, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within or departure from the
 country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are free to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty poitical system exists in wich political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. eriodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may regtr and vote by secret ballot.
 The Lgislative Assembly has 11 elected seats; 8 for St. Kitta and 3 for Nays.
 In the Novembr 1993 elections, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' People's Ac-
 tion Movement (PAM) won only four of eight seats at stake in St. Kitts and came
 in second in the popular vote. The St. Kitts Labour Party, led by Dr. Denzil Doug-
 las, won the remaining four seats and also polled a majority of the popular votes.
 The Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) won two of the three Nevis seats; the
 Nevis_ Reformation Party won the remaining one. Prime Minister Simmonds formed
 a coalition with the Nevis Reformation Party to retain control of the Government.
 The island of Nevis has considerable self-government and its own legislature.
 Although the re no impediments in law or in practice to theparticipation of
 women in leadership roles in government or political parties, St. Kitt and Nevis
 has oniy one female Member of Parliament. However, women dohold such high gov-
 ernment ofces as permanent secretary and are active within the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabiliy, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, birth
 out of wediock, political opinion or affiliation, color, sex, or creed.
 Women.-The role of women in society is not restricted by law but is cir-
 cumscribed by culture and tradition. According to a government official, violence
 against women is a prblem,xbut many women are reluctant to file complaints or
 pursue them in the courts. Despite tis reluctance, there were publicly reported
 cases of bth domestic violene and re  and a few convictions. A special police unit
 works closely with the Ministry of Women's Affairs to investigate domestic violence
 and rape cases. A nosovemental organization opened a women's enter on Nevis
 which provides counseling and information, and conducts workshops for women. No
 such facility exists on St. Kitt. The Government created the Ministry of Women's
 Affairs to help redefine the e of women in society, to ensure that women's rights
 are promoted, and to provide counseling for abused women.
 Th ConernThe Government is committed to children's rights and welfare and has
 incorporated most of the provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 
 
 Child into domestic legislation. There is no evidence of societal abuse or violence
 against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Although there is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constitution prohibit
 discrimination in employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The law permits the police, civil service and
 other organizations to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St.
 Kitts Labour Party and is active in all sectors of the economy. There is aiso an inde-
 pendent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city, and
 a taxi-drivers' association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes in 1994. Unions are free to form federations
 or confederations and to affiliate with international organizations. The islands'
 unions maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. The law po-
 hibits antiunion discrimination, but does not require employers found guilty to re-
 hire employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must
 pay lost wages and severance pay. There is no legislation governing the organization
 and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to recognize a
 union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled wish to orga-
 nize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace-by-workplace basis, not in-
 dustrywide. The Labour Commission mediates all types of disputes between labor
 and management on an ad hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes actually go
 to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the Minister of
 Labour can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be brought before
 a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not occur in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14. The Labour Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the Commu-
 nity Affairs Division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. Local law
 mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A 1984 law, updated in 1994, establishes mini-
 mum wage rates for various categories of workers, such as domestic servants, retail
 employees, casino workers, and skilled workers. The minimum wage varies from
 $56.18 (EC$150) per week for full-time domestic workers to $74.91 (EC$200) per
 week for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a
 wage earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals
 such as goats and chickens. The Labour Commission undertakes regular wage in-
 spections and special investigations when it receives complaints; it requires employ-
 ers found in violation to pay back wages.
 The law provides for a 42- to 44-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. The law provides that workers receive a minimum annual va-
 cation of 2 weeks. While there are no specific health and safety regulations, the Fac-
 tories Law provides general health and safety guidance to Labour Ministry inspec-
 tors. The Labour Commissioner settles disputes over safety conditions. Workers
 have the right to report unsafe work environments without jeopardy to continued
 employment; inspectors then investigate such claims.
