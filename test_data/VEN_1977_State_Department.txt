 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a stable practicing democracy with a very
 good human rights record. President Perez of Venezuela
 met with President Carter in Washington on June 29-30,
 1977. The two Presidents issued a joint communique
 stating that they have a common commitment to join with
 other nations in combatting abuses of human rights.
 Venezuela has taken a leading position in international
 fora in advocating respect for human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Venezuelan governing practices respect the constitutional
 guarantees of integrity of the person. Torture is not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan laws prohibit cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and this prohibition is
 respected in practice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are illegal and are not
 practiced in Venezuela.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The slowness of the judicial system sometimes leads to
 the situation of "justice delayed, justice denied" but
 this is not a question of willful public policy.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 (218)
 
 
 The policies of the Venezuelan Government are designed
 to respond to the needs of the poor. Recent measures
 have resulted in supplementary nutritional programs for
 underprivileged children, low cost housing projects in
 most towns and cities, a vast expansion in health care
 facilities in the interior, and an increase in the
 number of high schools and technical institutions
 nationwide.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 There is full respect for freedom of thought, speech,
 press, religion and assembly in Venezuela.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, travel
 and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is full freedom to participate in the political
 process. More than 90% of the eligible population
 voted in the last election.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The willingness of the Venezuelan Government to allow
 independent, outside investigation of alleged human
 rights violations has not been at issue, since no such
 investigations have been requested in recent years,
 presumably because of Venezuela's good human rights
 record. Venezuela is a strong supporter of the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission.
