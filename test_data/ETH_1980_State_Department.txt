 ETHIOPIA
 The Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia
 (PMGSE), since taking power in 1974, has extended its
 control over nearly all elements of the society.
 Serious violations of individual rights and civil and
 political liberties continue to occur within Ethiopia.
 After the 1974 revolution, the level of human rights
 abuses, high under the previous regime, increased sharply.
 The human rights situation was at its worst in 1977 and
 1978, as the government killed perhaps 10,000 men, women
 and children, and imprisoned tens of thousands of others
 in the Red Terror, a campaign to eliminate urban opposi-
 tion to the regime. Because the government has since
 consolidated its control over the urban centers of the
 country, the level of human rights abuses is now lower,
 although there is no legal protection against abuses.
 The legitimacy of the Ethiopian state is not accepted
 by many of its ethnic minorities, notably the Eritreans,
 Tigreans, Oromos, and Somalis, all of whom are in varying
 degrees of revolt. The current government's 1976 promises
 of regional autonomy to these groups have not been ful-
 filled, and its efforts to suppress these revolts have
 given rise to many human rights violations. In Eritrea,
 there is a continuing pattern of widespread arbitrary
 arrests, torture, and summary execution of those suspected
 of Eritrean independence sympathies. About one-third of a
 million Eritreans have become refugees in the Sudan and
 elsewhere. In February 1980, as a reprisal for increased
 activity by the Oromo Liberation Front, several hundred
 Oromos were arrested and interrogated, and some tortured,
 for alleged "narrow nationalist" sympathies. The war in
 eastern Ethiopia has produced more than a million refugees
 in Somalia, mostly ethnic Somalis but with substantial
 numbers of Oromos.
 The government states it is committed to improved living
 conditions and economic progress. Nevertheless, financial
 constraints and the dislocations caused by the two on-going
 wars in Eritrea and the Ogaden have hampered government
 efforts seriously. A campaign to achieve widespread
 literacy is continuing. Ethiopia's rural population
 (which constitutes about 85 percent of the country) has
 benefited directly from the revolutionary government's
 1975 land reform and subsequent development assistance
 programs. The 1979 Land Collectivization Proclamation has
 not yet been implemented widely.
 There is little respect for civil and political rights
 except for freedom-of religion. The government is creating
 a communist-style workers' party of Ethiopia.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 
 85
 a. Torture
 The use of torture is not prohibited by law. It appears
 to have declined since the worst excesses of the Red
 Terror. Reports indicate that torture--for example,
 beatings or binding in contorted positions--is used
 occasionally on political and military prisoners. Moreover,
 many Eritreans accused of "secessionist sympathies", as
 well as some ethnic Oromos arrested in February, reportedly
 were tortured.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions in many prisons are extraordinarily poor, in
 particular in the government headquarters basement
 cells, and in the prison at the 3rd police precinct in
 Addis Ababa. At the latter, prisoners are kept in
 semi-darkness in vastly overcrowded conditions, sleeping
 on the floor in cells and corridors. Sanitary conditions
 are inadequate, and prisoners' health frequently is
 affected adversely. Conditions in Ethiopia's main
 detention center, Carchelli Prison, are, in contrast,
 good. Prisoners released over the last year report
 quite favorably on conditions there. Occupational
 training and academic education is available. Inmates
 are given considerable freedom in determining their own
 activities. Treatment varies from prison to prison, and
 better-educated or older inmates are housed frequently
 in less crowded-and better facilities.
 c. Disappearances
 Ethiopians can "disappear" in that they may be arrested
 and held without any legal process, or notice to the
 public or their families. No records are maintained.
 Prisoners on occasion simply get lost in the system, and
 no one knows where they are. There is no official
 accountability for the whereabouts or welfare of prisoners.
 Some prisoners deliberately are held clandestinely, and
 others disappear for prolonged periods because the
 authorities neglect to notify families as to the prisoners'
 whereabouts. This makes it difficult for families to know
 whether their relatives in prison have been executed;
 there is usually no notice of execution, and families may
 be kept waiting for years for the return of inmates long
 since dead. Specific cases of disappearances or arrests
 in 1980 include Pastor Gudina Tumsa's wife Tsehai Tolessa
 and former Minister of Justice Zegaye Asfaw, among many
 others unknown by name.
 On April 22 Amnesty International published the names of a
 number of long-term prominent political prisoners whose
 food, brought in daily, had been turned away by prison
 officials in 1979. This has usually meant that the
 
 
 86
 prisoner has been summarily executed. Amnesty Interna-
 tional cabled the Ethiopian head of state, Mengistu Haile
 Mariam, urgently requesting assurances of the prisoners'
 safety and information concerning their whereabouts, but
 received no reply and no subsequent reliable information.
 The prominent political prisoners included several former
 high officials of the Imperial Ethiopian government which
 fell in 1974, the deposed Patriarch of the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church, and some leaders of Meison, the All
 Ethiopia Socialist Movement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The overwhelming majority of prisoners-in Ethiopia today
 are political prisoners; they number more than 10,000.
 The usual cause of detention on political grounds is
 suspicion of support for one of the underground parties
 or groups supporting secession from Ethiopia or otherwise
 opposing the government. All these arrests are in a
 sense arbitrary, as legal procedures governing arrest,
 including habeas corpus, do not exist. Many political
 arrests are still being made, at least 300-400 a week in
 Addis Ababa alone. Many of those arrested are released
 quickly. Arrest and release rates seem to be in rough
 equilibrium, except for the early 1980 wave of several
 hundred arrests of ethnic Oromos. Once a suspect is
 arrested, an investigation is conducted by the security
 organs of the government. A person suspected of a
 serious political offense generally can expect to have an
 investigation of his case begin within a month, leading to
 some disposition within perhaps eight months.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A judicial system exists for non-political criminal
 offenses. Cases are heard and decided by a judge in
 the presence of counsel for the defense, if the defendant
 can afford one. He usually cannot. For political offen-
 ses, cases are disposed of administratively by panels
 of officials in each prison. Formal rules of procedure
 and evidence are not known to exist, but it is believed
 that these panels now make an attempt to ascertain guilt
 or innocence. The prisoner may challenge the assembled
 evidence, but he or she does not have recourse to a
 lawyer. There is no known avenue of appeal, but it
 appears that death sentences must be approved at least,
 by the Secretariat of the Provisional Military Administra-
 tive Council (PZ4AC)    if not by a senior member of the
 council. Occasionally particularly prominent political
 offenders are tried in a military court. During 1980 nine
 such defendants were tried for espionage and other charges
 in a highly publicized military proceeding; some were
 sentenced to death and executed. Petty offenses, both
 political and criminal, are settled by city ward tribunals
 composed of neighborhood-elected officials.
 
 
 87
 f. Invasion of the Home
 In recent years, widespread house-to-house searches have
 been normal practice. During 1980, there were two such
 searches which covered many areas of capital city. These
 sweeps were aimed at rounding up unemployed urban youth
 for military iecruitment or agricultural labor. There are
 no requirements for warrants, nor any other guarantees of
 security of the home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The government has an oft-repeated commitment to improve
 the basic living conditions of the Ethiopian people.
 Living conditions for the great majority at present
 are poor or marginal. Some 85 percent of the population
 survives using primitive agricultural techniques in
 frequently difficult terrain, climatic conditions and
 soil. Others lead a semi-nomadic existence. Per capita
 gross national product is around $110 a year. Literacy
 rates are very low, perhaps 10 percent. The distribution
 of health and educational services in the countryside has
 been quite limited; countrywide there is only one physician
 for every 79,500 people, according to World Bank figures.
 Malnutrition is a chronic problem in many areas of the
 country due to depleted soils and drought. Ethiopia's
 transport infrastructure is still underdeveloped; approxi-
 mately half of-the country's population lives more than
 one day's walk from a road.
 The government, in attempting to address this extremely
 low level of development, is proceeding along Marxist-
 Leninist lines. It is attempting to change the gross
 disparities in economic opportunity which existed before
 the revolution. A sharply progressive income tax was
 introduced in 1978, and private sectors of the economy are
 being successively nationalized. The main objective of
 the government's economic policy is to obtain control over
 the production, and distribution of basic consumer items in
 an effort to ensure an adequate supply at a low price.
 Such efforts have been extensive, including the opening of
 a large network of stores designed to bypass private
 merchants, but are as yet not entirely effective.
 The disruption caused by the two ongoing wars and by the
 nationalization of private firms and farms has caused
 many shortfalls in the government's ambitious economic
 development plans. Resistance to new economic policies
 and bureaucratic sabotage are also thought to hamper the
 government's efforts.
 The land reform introduced in 1975 has been a great boon to
 the peasantry. The government has also revitalized its
 agricultural extension service, and is trying to teach
 farmers new methods in crop production and the prevention
 of erosion, however, in order to extend its political
 control and to obtain enough grain to feed the cities. The
 
 
 88
 government monopolizes agricultural marketing and pushes
 gradual collectivization of farms, leading to friction
 with the peasantry.
 The government is improving the level of health care
 available in rural areas by building low cost health
 stations, which have doubled since the revolution.
 Most city dwellers are poor. The marginal state of-the
 country's economy has prevented much increase in their
 wages. Such increases as they receive are more than
 eaten up by inflation in the cost of foodstuffs, fuel
 and cooking oil. The government is trying to equalize
 the wage structure by freezing wages at the middle and
 upper levels and allowing those at the bottom to rise as
 means become available. Wages, and the standard of
 living, at all levels tends to be low.
 There is no government social security program as such,
 but employers are required to put aside pension funds
 for their employees. Urban unemployment is to be a
 severe problem which the government has not been able to
 address effectively. There have been occasional roundups
 of unemployed youth who have been sent involuntarily to
 help with crop harvests.
 While higher education facilities have suffered since
 the revolution, the government is devoting much attention
 to its basic education program. In both urban and rural
 areas, thousands of people are learning to read, write,
 and do simple arithmetic. High school youth and teachers
 have been recruited into a teaching corps for this
 purpose, mostly during the summer.
 Rights relating to the ownership of private property
 have been significantly curtailed since the revolution.
 Many privately-held firms have been nationalized. The
 government has also expropriated rural land in excess of
 10 hectares, as well as urban land used as rental
 property. Ethiopians whose property has been taken have
 not been paid or promised compensation.
 The right of women to equal education is being stressed
 by the government. In many cases illiterate urban women
 have been forced under threat of arrest to attend basic
 education classes.
 Women in the central Ethiopian cultures (Oromo, Amhara,
 and Tigre) have traditionally enjoyed economic rights
 equally with men; they may inherit, buy or sell property,
 and engage in business. Women, however, are traditional-
 ly limited to more circumscribed roles in other spheres
 of social and religious life. Village leadership is
 male, and all clergy are male. Women have a subjugated
 status within the home, and child marriages are common.
 The government is challenging these traditional limita-
 tions on women's roles except in the religious sphere.
 Women continue to be circumcised in most areas of
 Ethiopia outside the Amhara highlands.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Of these freedoms only that of religion is recognized in
 Ethiopia. The government control over speech, the media,
 non-religious assemblies, trade unions, and other forms of
 expression is absolute and firmly enforced. Political
 cadres are assigned to all.major organizations, military
 units, schools and government offices to insure political
 conformity. Educational curricula strongly reflect Marxist-
 Leninist doctrine.
 Political control is apparent in all forms of-the media.
 Many journalists have been arrested for political reasons
 over the past several years. Some issues of foreign news
 magazines are banned. Books, both domestic and foreign, are
 censored. Leadership of trade unions has changed frequently
 on political grounds. In sum, no criticism of the government
 is allowed in any form, in any forum.
 In 1976 the'government promised a degree of local autonomy
 to the various nationalities within its population. Nothing
 has been done to redeem this promise.
 The formerly established Ethiopian Orthodox Church has
 been stripped of its temporal power but continues to
 flourish so long as it -does not oppose the government.
 Islamic holidays are recognized officially.  The Falasha
 Jews have.been relieved by land reform of!:their pre-revolu-
 tionary status as farm laborers, and arectreated fairly by
 the government. On the other hand there hie been numerous
 reports of official harassment, whether directed from Addis
 Ababa or initiated by zealous local officials,-against
 certain fundamentalist Protestant churches which the
 Ethiopians regard as foreign implants and which are charged
 with "anti-revolutionary activities under the cover of
 religion". Many members of the Ethiopia Evangelical Mekane
 Jesus Church (an affiliate of the Lutheran World Federation)
 -have been arrested on these grounds. The-most recent
 arrests took place in April 1980. The Mekane Jesus
 General Secretary, Gudina Tusa, has not been released
 since his abduction in July 1979 by plain-clothes gunmen
 believed to be government security agents. His detention
 may be due to protests against persecution of the church*
 and against revolutionary excesses (though his church
 has not opposed the revolution-as such) or his suspected
 *romo resistance sympathies or connections.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement within Ethiopid generally is not impeded by the
 government, although identification cards are required.
 Travel to Eritrea (a war zone) requires permission.
 Private travel abroad is very difficult for Ethiopians.
 An elaborate clearance procedure is required. Husbands
 and wives are not permitted to visit abroad at the same
 
 
 90
 time. A financial guarantor or hostage against one's
 return must be found; a heavy penalty will be paid by
 the guarantor if the traveller does not return.
 Permission to travel abroad may be denied to those not
 considered politically reliable. The right to emigrate
 generally is not recognized.
 The right of voluntary repatriation is readily recognized,
 although not widely exercised. The government has
 proclaimed amnesty decrees for Ethiopian refugees in
 Sudan and Djibouti. The decrees lack legal guarantees
 and are not unconditional, and some returnees reportedly
 have been detained on arrival.
 Many Ethiopians take advantage of any opportunity to
 leave the country.
 Except for around 1,000 Sudanese refugees said to be
 living in southwest Ethiopia, there are no significant
 concentrations of refugees in the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Ethiopian political life is completely dominated by the
 PMAC. No opposition groups are tolerated. The three
 semi-legitimate Marxist-Leninist parties still in exis-
 tence in 1979 (Wez Ader, Maleride and Seded) were banned
 in 1980. Political participation is possible--indeed,
 often mandatory--only in organizations created by the
 PMAC to accomplish its political and social goals.
 These include women's and youth associations, city ward
 (Kebele) associations, peasants' associations, office
 discussion clubs, and a commission set up to organize a
 national Marxist-Leninist political party (COPWE).
 COPWE itself is organized like a party, but is not in
 full operation. While national policy is decided
 entirely and exclusively by the senior members of the
 PMAC, the associations noted above do play meaningful
 roles on the local level. Women's associations, now
 organized from the national down to the grass-roots
 level, are a part of the PMGSE's effort to improve the
 traditionally subjugated status of Ethiopian women.
 Women are being encouraged to participate fully in
 authorized political and economic life, to take on
 occupational roles previously considered to be the
 province of.males, and to insist upon their rights
 inside the home as the equals of their husbands. Courts
 and local tribunals have fined and ridiculed men who
 abuse their wives.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investiga-
 tion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ethiopian government has reacted negatively to
 most international and non-governmental attention
 to the human rights situation in the country. It
 rejects such concern as unwarranted interference in
 its internal affairs. It also dismisses the concept of
 
 
 91
 individual human rights as being irrelevant .in a revo-
 lutionary socialist context. Official American comments
 on the human rights situation in Ethiopia have been met
 by scathing commentaries on the human rights record of
 the United States.
 Amnesty International's request for information about
 several prominent "disappeared political prisoners" and
 its separate appeal for information about Pastor
 Gudina Tumsa have gone unanswered. So have its protests
 against arrest and torture of church members.
 The PMGSE during 1980 did receive.a representative of
 the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, and
 thoroughly briefed him on the PMGSE's views on its
 own human rights record.
