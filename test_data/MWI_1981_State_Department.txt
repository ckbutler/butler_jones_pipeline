 MALAWI
 Effective control of virtually all aspects of government in
 Malawi is exercised by Life President Dr. H. Kamuzu Bands,
 chief of state and head of the sole political party, the
 Malawi Congress Party (MCP), which interacts closely with
 the government. The basis of the country's political system
 is an emphasis on President Banda's leadership role in the
 country's drive for independence, achieved in 1964, and his
 role in the country's record of steady economic growth and
 development.
 The country's attainments in achieving greater prosperity
 have, however, been accompanied by violations of civil and
 political rights in response to perceived challenges to the
 government. There is apparently some popular consensus
 that restraints on individual rights have been necessary to
 achieve the political stability required for the country's
 economic development. Legally proscribed and largely
 confined to small numbers of exiles abroad, such political
 opposition as exists does not appear to enjoy any signifi-
 cant popular support. A general trend of liberalization
 began in early 1977 with the release of 2,000 detainees and
 has continued with the release of an unknown number of other
 detainees in 1981. While arbitrary detention still occurs,
 such powers are exercised with much greater restraint, and
 with more intensive review of charges against detainees,
 than in the past. The 25-30 persons estimated to remain in
 detention in 1981 are now believed to include those arrested
 for corruption and economic crimes. A former government
 minister was detained in early 1980 for economic-political
 offenses, tried and convicted in 1981, and sentenced to 20
 years in prison. The situation of Jehovah's Witnesses
 continues to be greatly improved over that of the mid-1970's
 when large scale detentions and harrassment occurred; there
 has been no recurrence of such mistreatment.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by the government, although there is
 no specific reference to torture under Malawian law. There
 is no evidence that it occurred in 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Malawian prisons are generally adequate and reflect official
 efforts to maintain humane conditions of treatment. There
 are occasional reports of rough handling of detainees, but
 these have not extended to allegations of the existence of
 a policy or general practice of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment.
 At the local level there was physical mistreatment, includ-
 ing some killings, of Jehovah's Witnesses in the early
 1970's. However, abuses of power by local officials were
 halted and the offenders punished. No instances of mistreat-
 ment of Jehovah's Witnesses are know to have occurred since
 the early 1970's.

 c. Disappearances
 There have been no known instances of abductions, secret
 arrests, clandestine detentions or disappearances carried
 out or sanctioned by the Malawi government in 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There has been a steady decline since 1976 in the exercise
 of arbitarary detention, provided for under public security
 regulations. Moreover, publicized releases of those
 detained on political grounds suggest that such arrests
 as occur are increasingly subjected to administrative
 review as provided for under Malawi law. While long term
 detainees continue to include political dissidents, quiet
 releases may have reduced their number significantly.
 However, since the arrests in 1980 of persons on charges of
 corruption and other economic crimes connected with abuse
 of official position there have been few, if any, notable
 arrest cases. This has probably kept the numbers of
 estimated long-term detainees at well under 50 persons.
 Instances still occur of detention for short periods,
 usually for questioning by authorities, but these rarely
 result in long-term imprisonment.. A notable exception to
 this trend was the removal from office in early 1980 and
 subsequent trial and conviction of a prominent government
 minister on criminal charges which appear to have been
 politically motivated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals arrested and charged with criminal offenses
 are generally dealt with promptly and fairly in the modern
 court system. Civil cases are handled similarly in tradi-
 tional courts. Occasionally, instances of administrative
 delay occur but these are not known to be deliberate. Legal
 counsel and fair public trial are afforded all criminal
 and civil defendants. In political cases there is provision
 only for periodic administrative review of the grounds for
 detention. Although such procedures are now believed to be
 more frequently observed than in previous times, there is
 no means available to a defendant to ensure that this
 procedural safeguard is respected.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 While police and security officials enjoy a special entry
 authority, there have been no instances of invasion of
 the home publicized in the past several years.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Exercise of these freedoms is restricted under law and in
 practice to prohibit any criticism of goVernment officials
 and policies. All media are under direct or indirect
 government control. The state radio network disseminates
 releases directly authorized by the government information
 agencies. The sole national newspaper operates under
 informal self-censorship guidelines. Both media have
 shown increasing candor in coverage of international
 issues over the past two years. In practice, the principal
 
 
 154
 focus of government censorship is on the proscription of
 materially deemed sexually immoral. However, there has
 been increasing liberalization in the application of
 censorship controls affecting materials for broad public
 distribution.
 There is freedom of inquiry into the natural and social
 sciences at the university level, including examination of
 political ideologies at radical or fundamental variance with
 those of the government provided this does not extend to
 explicit criticism of the government. Association for the
 purpose of expressing political opposition is prohibited.
 Apart from businessmen's groups there are no significant
 professional organizations. Sectoral unions function under
 the umbrella of a National Trade Union Congress which is
 subordinate to the Malawi Congress Party. While strikes are
 legally permitted, none have ever occurred and organized
 labor negotiates wage increases with government at the
 latter's sufferance. However, wage increases have been
 authorized in several key sectors and actual wages in key
 trades have been permitted to go well above fixed minimum
 levels in response to market demands.
 Freedom of worship is permitted in law and practice to all
 faiths and denominations. There is no legal or practical
 discrimination against any religion. There was repression of
 the Jehovah's Witnesses when its members were deemed to be
 engaged in political activities in the mid 1970's. There has
 been no recurrence since agreement was reached with the
 government regarding members' payment of tax obligations and
 curtailment of activities the government regarded as being of
 a political nature.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There were no known restrictions of any significance on
 movement within Malawi in 1981 and there is no significant
 restriction on travel abroad, although passports have been
 denied to a few persons on political grounds. Legal
 provisions exist for restricting the movement of persons
 convicted of criminal or political offenses.
 While Asians are free to move within the country, they were
 required during the period 1975-78 to relocate to the three
 main urban centers of the country and were restricted as to
 their places of residence and business to these areas.
 While many Asians have left Malawi, the substantial number
 that remain continue to be prominent in the private commercial
 sector and hold some offices in municipal bodies.
 Malawi does not accord official refugee status to foreigners,
 but in practice has afforded haven to small numbers of
 nationals from neighboring countries. There is no outward
 flow of refugees. There is no discrimination toward any
 group under the country's travel regulations.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malawi's political processes are highly centralized. Organized
 political opposition is prohibited.
 
 
 Malawian citizens may participate in the political process
 only through membership in the MCP which has an extensive
 and active organization network actively seeking (some
 would say through intimidation) broad popular participa-
 tion. In practice, the various party organizations serve
 to transmit top-level decisions to the local level and
 can also function as channels for grassroots opinions to
 reach decision-makers. Local party organizations interact
 closely with the government in virtually all public service
 activities and projects. Women enjoy considerable political
 influence through the party's League of Malawi Women, in part
 a reflection of the matrilineal customs of several major
 ethnic groups. They enjoy special rights of access and
 petition to top-level officials. Even though women are
 still in the minority in party and governmental positions,
 their representation is increasing.
 Party membership is limited to indigenous Africans and only
 party members may seek election to parliament. Local party
 officials nominate from three to five candidates for parliament
 from each constituency. Although many candidates are
 later eliminated as being unqualified, most of the parlia-
 mentary seats were contested by two or more candidates in the
 last election (1978). Two incumbent ministers lost their
 seats in that election.
 3.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Malawi Government responded for the first time in
 1980 to a complaint lodged several years previously with
 the U.N.Human Rights Commission under its confidential
 1503 procedures regarding alleged persecution of Jehovah's
 Witnesses. The government's response came after the Commis-
 sion, at its 1980 session, decided to publicize the situation
 because of the failure of the government of Malawi to
 cooperate with the Commission in its examination of the
 complaint.   While the government rejected the charges, the
 complaint had not been actively pressed in the last several
 years and no further complaints have been placed with the
 UNHRC. There are no organizations based within Malawi to
 report on human rights conditions and it is unlikely that
 any would be permitted. However, the government has freely
 admitted foreign journalists into Malawi, including several
 over the past few years who previously had written articles
 critical of human rights in the mid-1970's.
 Amnesty International's 1981 report noted that its request
 for permission to observe a sedition trial was denied by
 the government. Amnesty International also noted concern
 about detention without trial.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The upward trend in Malawi's economy from the time of
 independence in the mid-1960's until the late 1970's has
 leveled off in the past two to three years and Malawi remains
 among the 25 poorest developing countries. It is
 a landlocked country which possesses no known mineral
 resources of value and the economy of which is predominantly
 agricultural. Whereas per capita gross domestic product (GDP)
 grew from $80 in 1970 to $200 in 1979, there
 has been a severe decline in. GDP growth in the past several
 years with zero increase projected for 1981. Numerous
 
 
 156
 factors, both domestic and international, have contributed
 to this deterioration in the performance of the economy:
 rapid deterioration in the nation's terms of trade (falling
 prices for Malawi's principal exports of tobacco, sugar and
 tea and surging prices for imports, most importantly petro-
 leum products); two successive years of adverse weather
 conditions which resulted in poor harvests of staple food
 crops; and disruptions of transport routes through Mozambique
 (Malawi's lifeline to the sea). The outlook has improved
 considerably as a result of good crop yields this year in
 food and cash crops and record prices for tobacco on the
 world market. The nation is still faced with the prospect
 of catch-up economics, however, with a population growth
 rate of about 2.8 percent, continued near-exclusive reliance
 on agriculture and continued dependence on troubled and
 unreliable transportation routes for external trade.
 The government's development effort since independence has
 focused on economic growth and efficiency, Emphasis has
 been on alleviation of rural poverty by increasing agricul-
 tural productivity. Education and, more recently, health
 come next in Malawian priorities.
 In 1979, academic enrollment increased dramatically: 10.4
 percent in primary schools; 6 percent in secondary schools;
 and 20 percent at the university level. While strides in
 the educational area have been significant (there were
 nearly 800,000 students attending schools in Malawi in 1979
 of a total national population of about 6 million), severe
 problems remain as the literacy rate is still only 25
 percent and spaces in secondary schools were available for
 only 10 percent of eligible primary school leavers.
 Health and life expectancy in Malawi are about average for
 sub-Saharan Africa. Life expectancy at birth is now 46
 years (up from 38.5 years in 1968). Reflecting only a
 marginal decline in a decade, the infant mortality rate
 is about 20 percent higher than the sub-Saharan average,
 standing at 142 per thousand in 1979. The crude birth rate
 is 52 live births per 1,000 population -- one of the
 highest in Africa. Average annual calorie intake of 103
 percent of requirement is substantially higher than the
 continental average. Thirty-three percent of the popula-
 tion had access to safe drinking water (70 percent in urban
 areas) in 1975 but this was expected to increase to over 50
 percent in 1981. Malawi had the third highest number of
 persons per physician of the nations of sub-Sahara Africa.
 Government commitment to improve the health standards has
 grown recently with about 7.5 percent of recurrent budget
 expenditure allocated to health since 1975.
 Women enjoy a mixed but generally favorable status. There
 is no legal discrimination against women in terms of
 property or other civil rights. Moreover, women enjoy
 privileged status in the traditional customs of several
 ethnic groups observing matrilineal descent of tribal
 rulers. On the other hand, women are expected to defer to
 men in public occasions and, reflecting traditional social
 emphasis on the priority of education for males, are
 under-represented in public office and government positions.
 Women are increasingly evident in government and some commer-
 cial sectors as a result of government policies to expand
 their access to opportunities for education and employment.
