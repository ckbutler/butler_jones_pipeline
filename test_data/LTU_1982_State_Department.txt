 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania was a dynamic nation-state that, in union with
 Poland, dominated an expanse of Eastern Europe from the Baltic
 to the Black Sea until the 18th century. Today, Lithuania is
 a country of 3.4 million inhabitants forcibly incorporated
 into the Soviet Union. Its ancient language is most similar
 to Latvia's, but Lithuania's political and cultural traditions
 have been influenced by centuries of ties to Poland. Those
 ties, although close, have often been stormy.
 The population of Vilnius, the capital city, has long been
 ethnically diverse and today is only about 50 percent
 Lithuanian. Overall, however, Lithuania is far more
 ethnically homogenous than Latvia or Estonia. Its relatively
 high birthrate has helped to stabilize the Lithuanian share of
 the population at about 80 percent for several decades.
 Recent statistics indicate, however, that Lithuania's
 birthrate is declining while the rate of in-migration from the
 Soviet Union has increased by almost 60 percent since the
 1960's, to an average annual rate of 7,300 during the 1970's.
 These trends suggest that Lithuania may soon face the same
 sort of demographic shifts that have already aroused fear of
 assimilation among Latvians and Estonians.
 Since the 14th century, the Catholic Church has played a
 central role in molding the beliefs and traditions of the
 Lithuanian people. As in Poland, the history of the Church in
 Lithuania has become intertwined with the nation's sense of
 identity. Even today, after four decades of sometimes violent
 repression of religious activity by the Communist Party, a
 majority of Lithuanians are practicing believers. The Church
 has provided them with a rallying point in their efforts to
 preserve their rights and traditions against an imposed,
 repressive regime, and it has helped them to maintain contact
 with the outside world. In 1982, the "Chronicle of the
 Catholic Church in Lithuania," an underground publication
 modeled on Soviet "samizdat," marked its tenth year of
 reporting to Lithuanians and to the world on the restrictions
 imposed by the Soviet regime against religious activity.
 After attaining independence after World War I, Lithuania for
 a time operated under a parliamentary system with a strong
 unicameral legislature. The military coup of December 1926
 led to the establishment of an authoritarian regime which
 restricted civil and political liberties. In 1939, the fate
 of Lithuania, like that of the other Baltic states, became the
 subject of secret negotiations between the Soviet Union and
 Nazi Germany. Like them, it was forcibly annexed by the
 Soviet Union in 1940, then occupied by Nazi forces, and
 finally reconquered by the Soviet Union at the.end of the war,
 with heavy human losses during each bloody exchange. It is
 estimated that 190,000 Jews were killed in Lithuania during
 the Nazi period; some Lithuanians participated in the
 exerminations. Reimposition of Soviet control was accompanied
 by mass arrests, deportations and executions. During the
 years 1940-41 and 1944-1952, almost 500,000 Lithuanians were
 deported to Siberia and elsewhere in the USSR. Lithuanian
 armed resistance nevertheless persisted into the 1950's.
 Since its forcible annexation of Lithuania, the Soviet Union
 has attempted to eliminate all independent political
 activity. Its persecution of religious activity there,
 including the harassment and intimidation of children, is well
 documented. In the past few years there have been a number of
 
 
 1046
 
 suspicious attacks on Catholic priests, several of them fatal,
 which some allege were organized by Soviet internal security
 organs.
 Respect for human rights has deteriorated in Lithuania during
 the past two years. Fearful that independent political
 activity in Poland would spill over into Lithuania because of
 the traditionally close ties between the two countries, Soviet
 authorities have taken special measures to restrict Polish-
 Lithuanian contacts and have threatened reprisals against
 workers who attempt to organize along the lines of Poland's
 Solidarity. At the same time, the economic situation of
 Lithuanians has worsened, particularly with respect to food
 supplies and some consumer goods.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person
 There have been many reports from Lithuania about violations
 of this category of rights. Among the most serious are
 reports of the suspicious deaths of several Catholic priests.
 The most recent was the death in December 1981 of the Rev.
 Bronius Laurinavicius, who was a member of the Lithuanian
 Helsinki Monitoring Group. His death followed those of the
 Rev. Leonas Mazeika in August 1981 and of the Rev. Leonas
 Sapoka in October 1980. All these priests had been the object
 of criticism in the official media, and there have been
 persistent allegations that Soviet security organs were
 involved in their deaths.
 Soviet authorities frequently use the legal system to suppress
 human rights activists in Lithuania, sentencing them to
 prison, labor camp, exile, or psychiatric hospitals. Members
 of the Lithuanian Helsinki Group have been among the most
 frequent targets of such practices. Two of them, Vytautas
 Skuodis and Algirdas Statkevicius, also have a claim to US
 citizenship, which the Soviets have refused to recognize.
 Skuodis was sentenced in December 1980 to seven years of
 strict regime camp and five years of internal exile. His wife
 has been threatened and harassed. Statkevicius was tried in
 absentia in August 1980 while in psychiatric confinement and
 sentenced to compulsory treatment at the psychiatric hospital
 in Chernyakhovsk.
 Invasion of the home is known to occur. Lithuanian believers
 have reported numerous instances of disruption of religious
 services in private apartments. There have also been cases
 where non-religious gatherings of known believers have been
 interrupted by the security authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights
 Press censorship in Lithuania is rigid but despite the
 authorities' control of the media, underground publications
 describing restrictions in religious freedom, curtailment of
 free speech and cultural expression, and other violations of
 rights have continued to appear in Lithuania. In addition to
 "The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania," they
 include "Ausra" (The Dawn), "Tautos Kelias" (The Path of the
 Nation), "Lietuvos Ateitis" (Lithuania's Future), and
 "Perspektyvos" (Perspectives). Persons accused of publishing
 or distributing them have received sentences, including
 prison, labor camp, exile, and compulsory psychiatric
 treatment, typically on the charge of "anti-Soviet agitation
 and propaganda."

 Religious activity has been harshly -- and, apparently,
 sometimes violently -- repressed. In addition to the attacks
 on Catholic priests mentioned above, religious processions
 have been disrupted, religious sites razed, and church
 officials prevented from carrying out their functions. Many
 instances have been reported of the harassment and
 intimidation of children of all ages to deter them from
 attending church or participating in religious gatherings.
 The intensity of the Soviet authorities' attack on the
 Lithuanian Church has intensified during the past two years,
 most likely from fear of its role as a defender of elementary
 rights and a repository of Lithuanian national sentiment.
 For both religious and political reasons, there has been
 opposition in Lithuania to the drafting of young men into the
 Soviet Army, particularly for service in Afghanistan. Draft
 deferment or alternate service for reasons of conscience or
 religious belief is not permitted by the Soviet regime.
 Draftees who resist service in Afghanistan have been
 maltreated and threatened with court martial for treason.
 The right to travel was curtailed in 1981 and 1982. Many
 Lithuanians have family and personal ties with Poland, and in
 past years travel back and forth was relatively frequent.
 Following the development of an independent labor movement in
 Poland, the Polish-Lithuanian border has been closed for
 extended periods. Before the introduction of martial law
 there, the importation of printed materials from Poland was
 also sharply reduced. Anti-Solidarity propaganda and other
 intimidation designed to suppress the formation of a free
 labor movement has been particularly shrill in Lithuania.
 Emigration is permitted only rarely and arbitrarily. A
 variety of means, including dismissal from employment,
 psychological harassment, and reduction of living standards,
 has been used to deter persons from emigrating. Ten
 Lithuanian families appear on the official US list of divided
 families seeking permission to emigrate to the United States,
 and another four families each contain a member with a claim
 to U.S. citizenship. There are 46 Lithuanian families on the
 list of those repeatedly refused permission to emigrate to
 Israel.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The attitude of the USSR-on the investigation of human rights
 violations within its own territory, as stated in Section 3 of
 the preceding report on the USSR, applies equally to Lithuania.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Lithuania is the most rural of the Baltic states. A high
 priority was placed on the development of industry since the
 Soviet occupation, but about half the labor force remains
 employed in agriculture.
 Like its Baltic neighbors, Lithuania until recently enjoyed
 relatively high living standards compared to the level of the
 USSR. This comparative advantage is now being eroded in
 several vital sectors. Soviet statistics published in the
 first quarter of 1982 showed that meat production by
 state-controlled enterprises in Lithuania had declined for the
 fourth consecutive year. Milk production is also failing to
 keep pace with the demand for dairy products, and grain
 harvests have been meager. These difficulties with
 
 
 1048
 agricultural production have been compounded by a
 Soviet-imposed requirement that Lithuania increase its food
 exports to troubled Poland. As a consequence, the average
 diet has deteriorated. Supplies of high-quality consumer
 goods have also decreased during the past year because of
 curtailed border trade with Poland. The quality of housing
 remains above general Soviet standards.
 The relative homogeneity of Lithuania's population, its strong
 sense of national identity, and the binding force of the
 Lithuanian Church have helped to preserve many of the
 country's social and cultural traditions. Nevertheless the
 disruptive effects of an imposed atheist ideology, forced
 collectivization, and a policy of industrialization have been
 severe. Rigid controls on cultural and religious expression
 have forced many Lithuanians into "underground" activity,
 which brings them into conflict with the authorities. A
 reduction in the amount of Lithuanian language instruction at
 the primary level in 1982, with a corresponding increase in
 the teaching of Russian, has aroused fear that the groundwork
 is being laid for the eventual linguistic Russification of the
 country. Only about a third of the Russian-speaking Slavs who
 settle in Lithuania learn or use the native language.
