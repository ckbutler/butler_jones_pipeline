 GUINEA
 While Guinea has moved in the past year from a military to an essentially civilian
 regime, the pace of reform and the Government are still largely controlled by Presi-
 dent Lansana Conte. In 1991 the Ruling Military Council (CMRN) was replaced by
 an appointed Transitional Committee for National Recovery (CTRN)-two-thirds ci-
 vilian one-third military-which was assigned lawmaking tasks. During 1991 the
 CTR drafted the "organic" laws necessary to implement the Constitution approved
 by referendum in December 1990. These organic laws, promulgated in December
 1991, govern political parties, elections, and the media, as well as the composition
 and operations of the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, and the National
 Communications Council. An almost entirely civihian cabinet was formed in Feb-
 ruary, when most military members of the CTRN, which was reduced in size, were
 also dropped. Political parties were legalized in April; by June the Government had
 recognized 40 of them. Multiparty National Assembly elections were scheduled for
 December 1992 but were postponed to early 1993 because of delays in funding and
 implementation of necessary preparations. efore the postponement, questions had
 been raised about the inherent fairness of the process.
 Military and paramilitary forces number around 17,000. Responsibility for inter-
 nal secunty is shared by a Gendarmerie, the Republican Guard, the National Police,
 and the well-armed Presidential Guard. Guinea contributes to peacekeeping forces
 in Liberia and maintains a detachment of troops in Sierra Leone. Total military ex-
 penditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were roughly estimated to be $29
 million. There is no indication that efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures
 in the near future. Both military personnel and police committed human rights
 abuses in 1992. Lawyers were still not allowed'in police stations to help prevent
 such abuses.
 Over 80 percent of Guinea's 7 million people are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture, and per capita gross domestic product is about $430. Guinea's major exports
 are bauxite, gold, and diamonds. In 1992 the World Bank and the International
 Monetary Pund continued to oversee Guinea's major economic restructuring pro-
 gram, which involves, among other things a sharp reduction in the size of the pub-
 lic service. This austerity program created a pool of unemployed civil servants who
 continued to be a source oficivil unrest.
 Human rights in Guinea remained circumscribed in 1992, despite expectations of
 change. Major problems were serious abuses (including unlawful killings) by poorly
 disciplined security forces, failure of the Government to try and punish those who
 committed such abuses, the use of arbitrary arrest and detention to harass alleged
 opponents of the Government, restrictions on the right of assembly, and violence
 and discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political And Extrajudicial Killings.-There were no reports of political killings.
 However a number of extrajudicial killings took place in 1992, mainly associated
 with clashes between civilians and security forces, in which the latter used excessive
 force. In separate incidents in the towns of Labe and Kamsar, soldiers used hand
 grenades during civil unrest, causing deaths and injuries. In March soldiers outside
 a soccer stadium in Labe sought to prevent some youths from climbing a fence. The
 youths threw rocks, and one of the soldiers threw a hand grenade into the group,
 killing one youth and critically injuring another. Three soldiers implicated in the
 use of the grenade were restricted to the army camp and transferred to another post
 in June.
 On July 9, after political party rallies in the town of Kamsar, local youths clashed
 with mainly Peuhl shopkeepers. A local army unit intervened and one soldier threw
 a hand grenade killing two civilians, Ibrahima Diallo and Thierno Mouctar Diallo.
 At a local hospital, 40 others were treated for injuries, a majority of which were
 linked to the grenade explosion. When relatives of the victims filed a criminal com-
 plaint in Kamsar, the judge responsible for investigating cases and pressing charges
 sent a request to the Justice Ministry for its opinion rather than launching a pre-
 liminary investigation as required by the Criminal Procedure Code. No arrests were
 
 
 made. In March two civilians died in clashes with gendarmes in Kankan when citi-
 zens marched on the Gendarmerie after a gendarme allegedly stole from a shop.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance. A total of 63 people
 arrested in the wake of the April 1984 seizure of power and the July 1985 coup at-
 tempt remain unaccounted for. In 1992 the Association of Victims of Repression
 (A) friled suit against present and former government officials involved in the ar-
 rests, but no additional information about the 63 came to light.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1965 Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, and
 degrading treatment. However, the Guinean police are often responsible for brutal-
 ity against suspects. On August 27, Conakry police beat several dozen women who
 were seeking to participate in an unauthorized march. During university unrest in
 Conakry in January and February, police beat students before and after taking
 them into custody. On January 27, for instance, four students were taken into cus-
 tody by riot police, beaten with-clubs during 2 days of detention, and released with-
 out being charged on February 5.
 Prison conditions, including those in the women's prison, are primitive and
 unhealthy. Deaths due to malnutrition and disease are frequent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Ineffective administrative controls and
 limited legal resources make arbitrary arrest a persistent threat to Guineans. In
 July, when two members of the unemployed civil servants' movement, Pepe Lama
 andDavid Kolie, visited the Civil Service Ministry to inquire about their case, their
 inquiry was interpreted as intention to harm the Minister. The two were taken into
 custody and held for 2 months before they could get the preliminary proceedings dis-
 missedby a judge. On October 27, Amadou Bah, head of the Union of Democratic
 Forces (UF), was arrested and questioned about an alleged assassination attempt
 against President Conte. He was released on October 30.
 e. Denial of Fair Publi Trial.-The Guinean Penal Code provides for the pre-
 sumption of innocence of accused persons, the independence of udges, the equality
 of citizens before the law, the right of the accused to counsel, and the right to appeal
 a judicial decision. Although the Government in principle provides funds for legal
 defense in serious criminal cases, in practice these funds are rarely dispensed; so
 the lawyer frequently either receives no payment or provides no services to defend
 the accused. The new Constitution affirms the judiciary's independence. However,
 magistrates are susceptible to influence by the executive branch because they are
 civil servants with no guarantee of tenure. As the Kamsar case illustrates (Section
 l.a.), judicial authorities often defer to central authorities in politically sensitive
 cases.
 The judiciary includes the Courts of First Instance (or justice of the peace at the
 local level) and two Courts of Appeal (one in Kankan andone in Conakry). The Su-
 preme Court, created in 1992, is the court of final appeal. Guinean law provides for
 a Court of State Security under certain circumstances, but one has not met since
 the trial of those allegedly involved in the coup attempt of 1985. A military tribunal
 prepares and adjudicates charges against accused military personnel. However,
 since 1988 all judgments regarding violations under the Penal Code have been ren-
 dered by civilian courts. There is a traditional system of justice at the village or
 urban neighborhood level where litigants present their civil cases for judgment be-
 fore a village chief, neighborhood chief, or council of wise men. The dividing line be-
 tween the formal and informal justice systems is vague, and a case may be referred
 from the formal to the traditional system to ensure compliance by all parties with
 the judicial ruling. Conversely, if a case cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of all
 parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the formal system for adju-
 dication.
 Suspected criminals, notably thieves, are sometimes beaten to death by victims
 and others with the tacit approval of police authorities. On a few occasions, this
 practice was directed against law enforcement officials. On March 30, when a cus-
 toms agent, Seydouba Soumah, shot and killed Mamadou Cello Diallo, a truck driv-
 er whom he suspected of smuggling cigarettes, citizens in the vicinity beat the agent
 and left him for dead. When family and friends of the driver found the agent in a
 hospital, they threw him out a fourth-story window, killing him. The Interior Min-
 istry publicly denounced this resort to summary justice, but no one was tried or
 punished for such practices in 1992.
 The administration of justice is plagued by numerous problems, including: a
 shortage of magistrates (who generally are poorly trained) and lawyers (39 in all),
 an out-dated and over-restrictive legal code, and corruption. There are also allega-
 tions of nepotism in the administration of justice, with relatives of influential mem-
 bers of the Government being virtually above the law.
 
 
 111
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In pub-
 lic statements the Government stresses the inviolability of the home. However in-
 terference in citizens' lives continues, primarily through police harassment. It is
 widely believed that security officials monitor mail and tlephone calls. Judicial
 search warrants are required by law, but these procedures are frequently ignored
 or not strictly followed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government has stated publicly that it sup-
 ports free speech and a free press, and the new Constitution promises an unspec-
 ified degree of freedom of expression, subject to limitation by law and regulaton.
 The new press law, while proclaiming freedom of the press and communications, is
 narrow and restrictive, pr ibiting communications which offend the President, in-
 cite to violencet result in discrimination or hatred, or disturb the public peace. Sedi-
 tious cries or chiants uttered in public are also proibited. The law permits the ar-
 rest of publishers, authors, printrs, and vendors in all of the above cases. Defama-
 tion and slander are also criminal offenses under the press law. Only one journalist
 was charged with violations of this law in 1992. Foday Sadiku Fofana, correspond-
 ent for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Reuters, was detained on
 Otober 21 in connection with an October 3 BBC report he had filed on the depar-
 ture of Liberians who, he indicated, had received military traning in Guinea. On
 November 18, he was charged before the Court of First Instance i Conakry with
 working as a journalist without credentials and with calumnious defamation of the
 Government. On November 25, the Court found him innocent of bth charges, and
 he was released. Captain Panival Bangura initiated a criminal defamation case
 against Jean Soumaor, publisher of the independent newspaper, L'Umon. The de-
 fendant has not been detained, but under the press law, could be sentenced to up
 to six months in jail andfor frned up to $1,100.
 The Government owns and operates the electrnic news media, as well as the offi-
 cial newspaper, Horya. Reporters, who are government employees, practice self-
 censorship in order to protect their jobs. The Ministry of Commuication continues
 to act as overseer of the state-owned media, but censorship appears to have dimin-
 ished in 1992 with the emergence of independent newspapers. A National Commu-
 nications Council (CNC)_was created in October to regulate the journalism profes-
 sion and assure impartiality in the media, including alloction of equal time to ele-
 toral candidates. The CNC includes representatives of the President, the Supreme
 Court, journalists, librarians, and printers.
 A number of new independent journals-one weekly and the rest monthlies--were
 launched in 1992, despite continuing technical and financial difficulties. Some are
 linked with op asition parties while others offer news and criticism of both the Gov-
 ernment and the opposition.
 Several political tracts, both signed and unsigned, that included specific criticisms
 of the President and other officials, were distributed widely in Conakry and other
 regions. Foreign publications, some of which include criticism of the Government,
 circulated freely in Guinea. There was no known attempt to interfere with foreign
 radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of PeacefuL Assembly and Assoiation.-Public gatherings may take
 place only with prior notification to the Government. The Penal Code bans an
 meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or any gathering whose nature
 threatens national unity./ On July 29, the Interior Ministry suspended all marches
 and demonstrations until the law on demonstrations ws promulgated on September
 17. Several dozen would-be participants in a planned opposition march on August
 27 were taken into police custody, questioned, and subsequently released. Thernte-
 nor in ister, whose Ministry registers both political parties and civic organizations,
 said that organizations other than political parties should not engage in political ac-
 tivity. The [nterior Ministry suspended three civic organizations or partc ipating in
 an unauthorized July 25 March in Conaker      t (see Section 4).
 Under the September 17 law local administrative authorities may cancel a march
 or meeting if they have grounds to believe that public order will be threatened be-
 cause of a recent political or social event, or because an opposing organization is
 planning a simultaneous event nearby. Organizers of the event may be held crimi-
 nally liable if there is violence or destruction of property. Since the law went into
 effect   h political parties have held many rallies but no marches.
 Political parties must provide information on their founding members and produce
 internal statutes and political platfoth  which are consistent with the Constitution
 before the Government will recognize them. All 42 parties applying for official rec-
 ognition received it. Many held rallies thrughout the countryside without govern-
 ment interference.
 
 
 112
 The Government encourages the formation of nonpolitical professional organiza-
 tions, whose numbers continue to increase.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religious groups enjoy religious freedom and tolerance.
 An estimated 85 percent of the population is Muslim. There is no official state reli-
 gion, and the preamble of the new Constitution declares Guinea to be a secular
 state. The Government observes mAjor Christian and Muslim holidays. Foreign mis-
 sionaries both Catholic and Protestant, operate freely in Guinea. The state-owned
 radio and television stations provide regular air time for both Christian and Muslim
 broadcasts.
 The Government and the quasi-governmental National Islamic League (LIN) have
 spoken out against the proliferation of "pseudo-sects generating confusion and devi-
 ation" (within Guinean Islam) but have not restricted these groups. The new Con-
 stitution provides religious communities the freedom to administer themselves with-
 out state interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Counhy, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Guineans are free to travel within the country and to change their
 place of residence and work; in practice, however, travelers face harassment by po-
 lice and military roadblocks, particularly late at night. It is common 'for citizens to
 pay bribes to avoid police harassment. Foreign travel is permitted, although the
 Government retains the ability to limit it for political reasons. Moreover, except for
 women of independent means, women must have written permission from their hus-
 bands in order to obtain a passport.
 According to a November census about 485,000 Liberians and Sierra Leoneans
 have sought refuge in Guinea, mostly in the forest region. An additional 80,000 peo-
 le previously counted as refugees were determined to be Guinean nationals who
 ad een living in Liberia and Sierra Leone and who were displaced by the conflicts
 there. The Government continues to work closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and many other international and nongovern-
 mental organizations to provide food and shelter.
 Following several criminal incidents in Conakry, allegedly involving refugees, the
 Government ordered the relocation of approximately 1,000 refugees from Conakry
 to the forest region. However, the UNHCR was already in the process of transfer-
 ring these refugees, because adequate assistance was not available in Conakry.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights& The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 Guinean citizens did not have the right and ability to change their gov-
 ernment through democratic procedures. The President, his Cabinet and the presi-
 dentially appointed Legislature (CTRN) wielded full powers of government. Com-
 petitive National Assembly elections were to be held for the first time since inde-
 pendence on December 27 but were postponed to early 1993 because of delays in
 the financing and implementation of necessary preparations notably the completion
 of a national census upon which voter rolls could be based. here were reports that
 the preliminary census results showed wide discrepancies between population and
 registered voters in a number of areas. The Constitution provides that assembly and
 presidential elections be held at least every 5 years.
 There are no legal restrictions on women or minorities in voting. One political
 party is headed by a woman. Three of the 18 members of the Cabinet 3 of the 16
 members of the Supreme Court, and 2 of the 11 members of the CTRN are women.
 There were accusations throughout the year that the progovernment Unity and
 Progress Party (PUP) received state resources to support its campaigns, and that
 the Government pressured civil servants to support-or not openy oppose-the
 PUP. Opposition party members were harassed by both the PUP any military per-
 sonnel. Violence in Kamsar (see Section l.a.) was said to have been started by PUP
 youth who went on a rampage in the market. Opposition leaders complained
 throughout the year that, although government officials would generally hear out
 opposition concerns in formal settings, there was no flexibility or openness to signifi-
 cant modifications in preelection procedures.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are four local nongovernmental organizations in Guinea that are primarily
 interested in human rights issues: the Guinean Organization for Human Rights
 (OGDH), the Guinean Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AGDH), the
 Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro, and the Association of Victims of Repression
 (AVR). The OGDH is interested in legal and civil rights as well as such social and
 economic rights as education and employment. The OGDH is best known for its
 president's leadership role in the opposition National Democratic Forum. The OGDH
 
 
 113
 was not officially registered with the Interior Ministry; that Ministry suspended the
 OGDH from operation after its members paiticipated in an unauthorized but peace-
 ful march on July 25. The Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro, the main deten-
 tion center for political prisoners during the Sekou Tours presidency, became an of-
 ficially recognized civic organization in 1991. In addition to seeking restitution of
 losses for the families of those who died at Camp Boiro, this organization began
 planning a center to collect and disseminate information about human rights viola-
 tions committed in Guinea, with a view to preventing future violations. In 1992 the
 organization filed suit in court for restitution against the Democratic Party of Guin-
 ea (PDG) previously led by the late President Sekou Toure, after the PDG
 reemerg   as a legally recognized entity.
 The AVR is concerned primarily with investigating and obtaining restitution for
 those who were imprisoned, tortured or killed in the wake of the July 4, 1985 coue
 attempt. The AVR filed suit with the Supreme Court against President Conte and
 others who were government officials at that time. This officially registered organi-
 zation also was suspended after some of its members participated in the July 25
 march. The AGDH was created and officially recognized in 1992; it publicized infor-
 mation on cases of human rights violations and sought to call international atten-
 tion to the suspension of the right to demonstrate.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 While racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the Constitution and the
 Penal Code, ethnic identification is strong in Guinea, and mutual suspicion affects
 relations across ethnic lines, in and out of Government. The Cabinet includes rep-
 resentatives of all major ethnic groups. A disproportionate number of police are
 Malinke, former President Toure's ethnic group, while a disproportionate number of
 senior military officers are Soussou, the ethnic group of President Conte. There were
 some incidents of interethnic violence; the case of the customs agent (see Section
 .e.) had strong ethnic tones. In N'Zerekore -in November, violence erupted after an
 ethnic Peuhl was killed, allegedly by a police officer. There were reports that other
 Peuhl had been murdered in recent weeks. Citizens of Burkina Paso allegedly were
 detained without charge as a result of fears about their invovlement in the Liberian
 conflict.
 Although the Constitution provides for the equality of sexes, women face discrimi-
 nation in Guinea. Particularly in rural areas, opportunities for women are limited
 by custom and the demands of subsistence farming, much of which is performed by
 women. The Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work, but
 in practice women receive less pay than men in most jobs. In education, according
 to a United Nations Development Program report for 1991, females receive only 20
 percent as much schooling as males. Women also faced discrimination in certain of-
 ficial matters, such as the requirement for a male relative's permission to travel.
 Many women were attacked and dozens of them were raped during several days of
 violence in Conakry in April. The violence began after rumors circulated that a for-
 eigner had paid Guinean women to engage in bestiality. Police detained over 40 sus-
 pects, but none were formally charged.
 Violence against women, mainly wife beating, is a criminal offense and constitutes
 grounds for divorce under civil law; however, police rarely intervene in domestic dis-
 putes. Social workers in Guinea say that wife beating occurs, but -they differ as to
 the extent of the problem. The issue received some exposure in locally produced tele-
 vision dramas but is not mentioned in the press or given governmental attention.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is widespread and practiced among the
 three main religious groups in Guinea: Muslims, Christians, and animists. Accord-
 ing to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of Guinean women who
 have undergone this procedure may be as high as 60 percent. The current genera-
 tion of parents is less supportive of this custom, but grandmothers frequently insist
 on the circumcision of a granddaughter, even when the parents are opposed. The
 most dangerous form of circumcision, infibulation, is not practiced.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Guinea's Labor Code, drafted with the assistance of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) and promulgated in January 1988,
 states that all workers (except military and paramilitary)have the right to create
 and participate in organizations that defend and develop their individual and collec-
 tive rights as workers. At least two independent unions, the General Workers Union
 of Guinea (UGTG) and the Free Union of Teachers and Researchers of Guinea
 (SLECG), have emerged since the new Labor Code ended the previously existing
 trade union monopoly system. The Labor Code requires elected worker representa-
 tives for any enterprise employing 25 or more salaried workers. In practice, most
 
 
 workers still belong to the post-Marxist National Confederation of Guinean Workers
 (CNTG), which is funded by the State. In 1992 the union leadership began to imple-
 ment a check-off system of dues collection designed to increase the Confederation's
 freedom from government control.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known their
 intention to strike. In sectors affecting "essential services" (e.g., hospitals, schools,
 media, and bakeries) some provisions for a minimal level of service may be required,
 though it is not clear how this principle is to be applied. Bank workers went on
 strike for one week in March. The seven workers arrested in Kamsar in October
 1991 for illegally striking at the Compagnie de Bauxite de Guinee (CBG) were con-
 victed but released pending an appeal.
 Unions may freely associate with international labor groups, but the only notable
 affiliations are those the CNTG maintains in African regional trade union organiza-
 tions. The UGTG has applied for membership in the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize the workplace and nego-
 tiate with employers or employer organizations. Collective bargaining for wages and
 salaries is rotected by law, and antiunion discrimination is prohibited. Work rules
 and work hours established by the employer are to be developed in consultation
 with union delegates. Union delegates are to represent individual and collective
 claims and grievances before the employer. Individual workers threatened with dis-
 missal or other sanctions have the right to a hearing before the employer with a
 union representative present. The Conakry Labor Court convenes weekly to hear
 such cases; in the interior, civil courts hear the cases.
 There are no export processing zones in Guinea.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under the new Code is 16 years. However, apprentices may start at 14. Workers and
 apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to work at night, for more than
 12 consecutive hours, or on Sundays. The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor and Social Affairs must maintain a list of occupations in which women and
 youth under 18 may not be employed. Enforcement, however, by Ministry inspectors
 is limited to ilare firms in the modern sector of the economy; children of all ages
 work on familyfarms and in small trades. In practice, no minimum years of school-
 ing are required fewer than one-third of school-age children attend school.
 e. Acceptable onditions of Work.-The Government has not yet enacted minimum
 wage legislation, but the Labor Code provides for the eventual establishment by de-
 cree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also provisions for overtime
 and night-wages which are fixed percentages of the regular wage. According to the
 Labor Code, regular work is not to exceed 10-hour days or 4-hour weeks, with a
 40-hour workweek being the norm. The minimum weekly day of rest must be 24
 consecutive hours, usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker has the right to an an-
 nual paid vacation accumulated at the rate of at least 2.5 workdays per month of
 service.
 The Labor Code contains provisions of a general nature respecting occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not yet elaborated a set of practicable
 workplace health and safety standards. Neither has it as yet issued any of the min-
 isterial orders laying out the specific requirement for certain occupations and for
 certain methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspec-
 tors are empowered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to health.
 However, enforcement remained more of a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors ac-
 knowledge that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with
 their small staffs and meager budgets.
