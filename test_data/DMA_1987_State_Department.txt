 DOMINICA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Dominica has a system of
 parliamentary democracy dating back to British colonial rule.
 The island became independent in 1978. Prime Minister Eugenia
 Charles and the governing Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) won the
 July 1980 general elections and were reelected to a second term
 in July 1985. Both elections were free, fair, and open, and
 voter participation was heavy--a tradition in Dominica. The
 opposition Democratic Labor Party (DLP) formed a coalition
 with a number of smaller opposition groups before the 1985
 elections and won 43 percent of the popular vote.
 Since the Dominica Defense Force was disbanded in 1981
 following two violent coup attempts, the police are the only
 security force in Dominica. A small police Special Service
 Unit (SSU) has been organized as part of the Regional Security
 System of the Eastern Caribbean states. The SSU has been
 provided some light infantry training, and a Marine Wing has
 been organized within the police force to function as a coast
 guard. Both the SSU and the Marine Wing are supervised by the
 Commissioner of Police.
 Dominica is among the least developed nations in the Eastern
 Caribbean. Economic growth and development remain sluggish.
 With the assistance of foreign donors, the Government is
 encouraging foreign investment and rehabilitating critical
 economic infrastructure. Bananas are Dominica's major export
 crop, but the Government encourages crop diversification as
 well as light manufacturing and agri-business development.
 Banana farmers are prospering as a result of a generous quota
 from the United Kingdom, but unemployment remains Dominica's
 major social problem.
 Dominica's human rights record remained good during 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports in 1987 of torture or other forms of
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. An
 independent investigation into the 1981 death of John Rose
 Lindsay implicated six policemen in 1985. Lindsay was
 believed to be a member of the terrorist "Dreads." Charges
 were dropped against three policemen due to insufficient
 evidence. The remaining three were tried in 1986 and found
 not guilty due to lack of evidence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or
 exile. The right to a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention is respected. Dominican law requires that persons
 
 
 DOMINICA
 arrested or detained be charged with a crime within 24 hours
 or released from custody. This requirement is honored in'
 practice. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or exile
 in 1987.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not known to take place in
 Dominica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trial before an,
 independent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty, are allowed legal
 counsel, and have the right of appeal on legal or procedural
 matters. However, indigent criminal defendants are provided
 legal counsel only in capital cases. -
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family,-Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. Search.war.rants are required by law. There were no
 reports in 1987"of arbitrary government intrusions into the
 private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 The Constitution establishes the right of free expression,
 which is affirmed in practice. The political opposition
 freely criticizes the Government. . Dominica's main radio
 station and sole television station:are state owned. Two
 other radio stations confine their broadcasts to religious
 programming. The principal weekly newspaper-is independent
 but generally favors the ruling DFP party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association and freedom.to.assemble are honored
 without exception. Opposition groups hold-rallies, meetings,
 and conventions without hindrance from the Government.
 Labor has the right to organize, to bargain collectively, and
 to strike.- The right to strike is respected in practice. In
 1985, the Civil Servants' Union struck, and in 1986 there was
 a strike by garbage workers. Labor unions are independent but
 are not a significant political force owing to small
 membership.
 The Banana Growers Association and the Civil Service
 Association-are strong organizations which play a significant
 political role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is 80 percent Roman Catholic. The remainder is
 largely Protestant, with a small Muslim community and some
 Rastafarians. The free practice of religion-is allowed. Two
 radio stations are operated by a Catholic and a Protestant
 group.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed by law and generally honored in
 practice. However, the Government has prevented the departure
 of at least One group of opposition supporters, who intended
 to travel to Libya, by revoking their passports. Under
 Dominican law, passports are state property and may be revoked
 if subversion is suspected.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Dominica has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have clear political choices and opportunities
 through free elections to change their government. The
 governing DFP and opposition DLP represent a broad political
 spectrum. The DFP now holds 17 seats in Parliament and the
 DLP 4.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization has a branch office
 in Dominica. The Human Rights Committee of the Dominica
 National Workers Union has occasionally published allegations
 of human rights violations in Dominica in the past. The union
 is not affiliated with any recognized labor organization.
 There were no formal human rights complaints during 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution guarantees equal rights under the law
 regardless of race or sex. Dominican law does not restrict
 the role of women in the nation's public or social life. The
 traditional role of women, once limited to the home and to
 agricultural work, is changing rapidly as women assume
 increasing responsibilities in public and private enterprises,
 including the office of Prime Minister. Nevertheless,
 religious and social welfare organizations have expressed
 concern over the incidence of domestic or sexual violence
 against women and children. Government efforts at public
 education and awareness to-reduce such violence continued in
 1987, including a much-heralded police week campaign in
 September entitled "Stop Drug and Child Abuse."
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age is 14. The standard workweek is
 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are given a minimum of 2 weeks
 annual vacation. The Employment Safety Act, an occupational
 health and safety law consonant with International Labor
 Organization standards, was passed in 1984. Occupational
 health and safety inspections are carried out under this law.
 Firms are notified of deficiencies and given 3 to 6 months to
 come into compliance. Inspections are ongoing, but to date
 there are no cases of prosecutions or fines under the Act. A
 minimum wage of $3.80 per day is set for agricultural workers
 only.
