 President Omar Bongo, the head of Gabon's sole political party,
 the Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG), has been reelected three
 times in Vncontested elections, most recently in November
 1986. A 1983 constitutional amendment provides that only the
 President-Founder of the party (President Bongo) may be a
 candidate for president. Presidential power is extensive but
 in practice is somewhat limited by a complex governmental
 structure, which includes a 42-member Cabinet headed by the
 Prime Minister. The 120-member National Assembly has no real
 power. All major ethnic groups and regions are represented in
 the Government, Political Bureau, and Central Committee of the
 party.
 The armed forces are comprised of approximately 4,000 army,
 navy, and air force personnel. Internal security is shared by
 the Gendarmerie, a paramilitary force of 2,700, and the
 National Police, consisting of 2,000 troops, which works with
 the Gendarmerie to maintain law and order in Libreville, Port
 Gentil, and other provincial capitals. Uncontrolled
 immigration is of particular concern. Security forces monitor
 the presence and activities of thousands of illegal aliens and
 occasionally conduct campaigns to find and deport them.
 Gabon's relatively high per capita income ($3,200 in 1989) is
 based on oil revenues, but it belies the underdeveloped nature
 of the country and its economy. Although endowed with
 petroleum, manganese, uranium, and vast timber resources, Gabon
 has had limited agricultural and industrial development and
 must import most of its food and manufactured goods. Rain
 forest covers 85 percent of the country, and approximately
 two-thirds of the populace lives in remote areas. The
 TransGabon railroad, completed in 1986, now connects the
 coastal capital of Libreville to Franceville in the southeast
 interior. Due to the precipitous fall in revenue from oil
 exports in recent years, the Government has imposed austerity
 measures to meet World Bank and International Monetary Fund
 program criteria.   A massive onshore oil field discovered in
 southern Gabon should bDost petroleum output by 50 percent by
 1990.
 Human rights continued to be tightly restricted in 1989.
 Principal concerns included mistreatment of prisoners and
 detainees (there continued to be allegations of mistreatment of
 Equatorial Guineans held as illegal aliens by the security
 forces), lack of procedural safeguards in State Security Court
 trials, and restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, and
 assembly.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political killings or summary executions in
 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There ware no known cases of abductions or disappearances
 ascribed to govornment security forces or any other group.
 
 
 124
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Gabonese law and security enforcement officials use beatings as
 part of the interrogation process. Two persons arrested in
 conjunction with a foiled coup plot in late 1989 subsequently
 died while in custody. According to the Government, one died
 from malaria and the other from a combination of diabetes and
 hypertension. No independent medical confirmation of the
 causes of death had been made available by year's end.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and the main prison, Central
 Prison, has poor hygiene, inadequate medical facilities, and
 insufficient food. No specific instances of mistreatment of
 prisoners came to light in 1989, but Amnesty International's
 (AI) 1988 Report stated that a number of criminal suspects and
 alleged illegal aliens had been beaten and tortured at Central
 Prison in Libreville in 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Gabonese law protects against arbitrary detention through
 clearly articulated judicial procedures (in the French
 tradition). Security forces have been known to disregard the
 procedures, particularly in security cases, by detaining
 persons indefinitely without charge. The Constitution
 specifies that "acts against the security of the State" and
 "actions against the Chief of State," which can include
 advocating a multiparty system, are punishable crimes. There
 were, however, no known political detainees or prisoners held
 during 1989.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control nor as a
 sentence for convicted criminals. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system, modeled on the French, has several levels.
 The trial court (Tribunal de Premier Instance) hears questions
 of fact and law in civil, commercial,'ordinary criminal and
 administrative cases. The appellate level is divided into two
 courts, with a separate appeals court for criminal cases. The
 highest level, the Supreme Court, has four chambers.
 Outside the normal court system, there is a military tribunal
 to handle all offenses under military law, a State Security
 Court, and a special criminal court which deals with fraud and
 embezzlement of public funds by officials. The right to a fair
 public trial is provided for in the Constitution and generally
 has been respected in criminal cases, but important procedural
 safeguards are lacking in State Security Court trials. State
 Security Court trials are open to the public, and defendants
 are represented by counsel, with the right to appeal to the
 Supreme Court or, if turned down by the Supreme Court, to the
 President. However, court officials are appointed by the
 President, who can also transfer and dismiss them by decree.
 Although the judiciary is susceptible to intervention by the
 executive, particularly in political or security cases, there
 was no indication that such intervention occurred in 1989. On
 January 1, 1989, and and on the 20th anniversary of the ruling
 PDG, President Bongo continued his practice of commuting the
 sentences of first offenders who were not convicted of first
 degree murder or armed robbery.
 
 
 125
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search warrants may be obtained after the fact but, as
 occasionally happens in cases of suspected illegal aliens,
 sometimes they are not obtained at all. There were credible
 reports that in many cases the homes of those detained were
 ransacked by security forces who confiscated personal effects.
 The Government periodically monitors communications.
 Membership in the ruling PDG is not mandatory, but it enhances
 opportunities for political and career advancement. Gabonese
 citizens' livelihoods are not normally compromised by failure
 to join the party.
 Section'2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted. Neither direct public criticism
 of the President nor advocacy of a multiparty political system
 is permitted. Gabonese citizens with access to the President
 can express (and have expressed) their views, including
 criticisms, directly to him in private meetings, and there has
 bean no retribution as a result. Public media--radio,
 television, and the sole daily newspaper L'Union--are
 controlled by the Ministry of Information and disseminate
 government views and communiquos. The media carry wire service
 material (mostly Agence France Presse) which gives the public
 some coverage of world events. The broadcasts of prodemocracy
 demonstrationg in China were apparently edited by the local
 television station which downplayed the impact of-the mass
 demonstrations. However, the Government allowed the French
 satellite system to broadcast these events. The President
 encourages journalists to point out failures of individual
 government offieials or ministries and to highlight
 inefficiency and corruption. Although foreign books and
 magazines-containing "scurrilous* material have been banned in
 the past, this practice has not occurred in recent years.
 Academic freedom is limited and public criticism of the
 President or of the political system is nrt allowed. In 1989
 students engaged in protest actions against curriculum content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government limits freedom of assembly and association to
 recognized organizetions. Permits and po-lice notification are
 required for all outdoor meetings. The Government generally
 permits such meetings only if they are organized by the ruling
 party (and its ancillary units such as the women's, youth, and
 labor movements), cultural and entertainment impresarios, or
 recognized churcb groups. Demonstratons are not permihted.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor uniQps, ~e Sectiow 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion-
 There is no state religion, and the Qonstitution provides for
 sovecail smaal syncretis-ticset.5W

 GABONI
 The primary faiths are Catholic and Protestant. There are a
 few Muslims (including President Bongo) and numerous adherents
 to traditional religions. Foreign missionaries, including
 Americans, are engaged actively in evangelical and
 administrative capacities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement of :)oth Gabonese citizens and expatriates within the
 country is not restricted formally, but travelers occasionally
 encounter gendarmerie control points where identity cards and
 other documents are examined. While Gabonese citizens may
 return freely to Gabon from abroad, they must obtain exit
 permits from the police, and government employees must obtain
 permission to travel abroad.
 There are approximately 200,000 non-Gabonese resident in Gabon,
 many :- whom are from Equatorial Guinea or Cameroon.
 Immigration 7aws and presidential decrees promulgated in 1986
 imposed heavy monetary guarantee requirements on non-French and
 non-Ame:r!an expatriates working in Gabon and levied exit visa
 fees for each depa;ture from the country. The Gendarmerie
 periodicaety det3ins undocumented aliens who are then placed in
 a holding camp under harsh conditions. Most of the detainees
 are released 3fter paying fines and bribes. in August the
 Government of Senegal arranged for the voluntary repatriation
 from Gabon of some 1,000 of its citizens.
 The Government encourages but does not force "regroupment'--the
 voluntary consolidation of small rural communities into larger
 villages along a road--by enhancing the delivery of public
 services such is water, electricity, and schooling in the
 larger vi.llages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Chantge Their Government
 The present political system does not accord citizens the right
 to change their government through the electoral process. The
 Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG) is the sole political party of
 Gabon. A party constitution amendment (March 1983) rescricts
 candidacy for presidential elections to the Founder-President
 of the PDG. Among party members, there is competition for
 elections to the National Assembly and for positions on the
 Central Committee, but this maneuvering is within the sole
 political party. Presidential elections are held duzing the
 7th year of the President's term. National Assembly members
 are elected for 5 years. The Council of Ministers, which meets
 under the chairmanship of the President or, occasionally the
 Prime Minister, approves all government decisions proposed by
 the President. The 42member Cabinet (reshuffled slightly in
 August) includes representatives of major ethnic groups from
 all regions of the country. This large Cabinet allows the
 various interest groups to have a review role in policy
 formulation, a share in political patronage, and a consultative
 role on national resource distribution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding international and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Gabon has not been the object of human rights investigations in
 recent years, but in 1989 it invited representatives of Amnesty
 
 
 127
 GABON
 International and other human rights organizations to visit
 Gabon to ensure that coup plotters arrested in August receive
 good treatment and due process of law. President Bongo
 repeated his invitation to human iights observers in a November
 address to the nation in which he also announced that the coup
 plotters would be tried by the civil courts rather than placed
 under the jurisdiction of a military court. There are no local
 human rights groups. In the cabinet reshuffle of August,
 responsibility for human rights questions remained with the
 Secretary of State for Promotion of Women.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gabon's relative prosperity has enabled the Government to
 extend health and social security benefits to all its people,
 regardless of tribal affiliation or region. Recent
 difficulties in maintaining these benefits have been due to
 severe budget cutbacks rather than to discriminatory
 practices. There are no significant ethnic, racial, religious,
 or social groups that have recently suffered mistreatment by
 the Government.
 Urban women are moving increasingly into the professions due to
 improved educational opportunities, including in technical
 training institutions in urban areas. Government and party
 policies are supportive. In rural Gabon women still fill
 largely traditional roles built around family and village,
 e.g., hauling water, tending fields. The gradual introduction
 of piped-in water and of electricity has had the effect of
 improving living standards for rural women.
 Violence against women in Gabon, including wife beating,
 occurs, but there are no studies or statistics available to
 help determine the extent of the problem. However, violence
 against women is believed to be infrequent as it is not part of
 the traditional social context. The incidents that are
 reported in the media from time to time invariably have their
 genesis within the context of domestic disputes or are related
 to violence against prostitutes. The Government does not
 condone such behavior but has not directly addressed the issue.
 Section 6   Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers may organize labor unions but are not free to form and
 join unions of their own choosing. All unions must be
 affiliated with the government-sponsored Labor Confederation of
 Gabon (COSYGA), which is a specialized organ of the PDG and the
 sole labor federation. It is estimated that over half of
 Gabon's 90,000 salaried private-sector workers are unionized.
 Government employees are not permitted to belong to unions.
 Under Gabonese law, the right to strike continues to be
 severely restricted; strikes are illegal if they occur before
 remedies prescribed under the Labor Code (1978) have been
 exhausted. In June demonstrators gathered outside the
 presidential palace to protest a change in the Labor Code which
 would have legalized piece-rate work in the industrial sector.
 President Bongo met with a labor delegation to discuss the
 matter, and he later agreed to rescind the announced change.
 In an unusual conciliatory move, the demonstrators were paid
 their regular wages for the afternoon of the demonstration.
 Utilities workers in Gabon's oil capital of Port Gentil have
 
 
 128
 GABON
 staged work stoppages in the past to protest government-ordered
 cuts in salaries and personnel at the state-owned utilities
 company.
 COSYGA is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and maintains ties with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and the American Federation of Labor and
 Congress of Industrial Organizations and other national trade
 union centers.
 In its 1989 report, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE)
 indicated that, in order to conform with Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association, the Government should revise existing
 legislation to: provide workers who wish to form unions of
 their own choosing the right to do so; eliminate the obligation
 imposed on workers to pay a solidarity tax without their
 consent; and eliminate compulsory arbitration which effectively
 makes it legally impossible to strike.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in each sector negotiate with management over specific
 pay scales, working conditions, and benefits applicable to
 their industry. Representatives of labor, management, and
 government meet annually to agree on the minimum wage, which is
 determined within guidelines provided by the Government.
 Agreements reached between labor and management in each sector
 also apply to nonunion and expatriate labor. According to the
 Labor Code, workers may individually or collectively take
 complaints of code violations to arbitration and may appeal to
 labor and national courts. These provisions are respected in
 practice. There are no export processing zones in Gabon.
 The 1989 report of the COE recommends that existing legislation
 be revised to expand protection against antiunion
 discrimination and to provide protection, including penal
 sanctions, for workers' organizations against employer
 interference.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although forced labor is prohibited by law, the COE has for
 many years noted that provisions of the Merchant Shipping Code
 are incompatible with ILO Conventions on forced labor. These
 provisions permit the use of compulsory duties as one means of
 administrative punishment or reprimand for merchant seamen.
 The Government has often said that it is amending the Code, but
 it has taken no action to date.
 d. Minimum Age For Employment of Children
 No minor below the age of 16 may work without the authorization
 of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Education, which
 enforce this provision. It is granted rarely, and few
 employees in the modern wage sector are below the age of 18.
 Children at younger ages are involved in traditional family
 farm labor in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The (1978) Labor Code and the (1982) General Convention of
 Labor govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors.
 Labor legislation provides broad protection to workers. The
 minimum wage for unskilled labor since April 1985 has been
 about $200 per month for Gabonese and about $150 for
 
 
 129
 foreigners. Owing to labor shortages, most salaries are much
 higher. These wages provide a decent living for workers and
 their families. Work over 40 hours per week must be
 compensated with overtime, and the workweek must include a
 minimum rest period of 48 consecutive hours. Women have a
 right to 14 weeks of leave during pregnancy, including 6 weeks
 before delivery.
 The Labor Code provides for occupational health and safety
 standards to be established by decree of the Minister of
 Health. Adherence to these standards, which are generally
 adopted from the French model, varies greatly and usually
 reflects company policy rather than governmental enforcement
 efforts. There has been. little unemployment for Gabonese
 wishinj to enter the wage economy, although it has been
 increasing as the economy reacts to the recent decline in world
 oil prices.
