 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and unicameral Con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms and an independent judiciary headed by a Supreme
 Court of Justice. President Carlos Roberto Reina took office in January 1994 as the
 fourth democratically elected President since the reestablishment of democracy in
 1982. Both major parties (Liberal and National) have now assumed power from the
 other after free elections.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise the army, air force, navy, and the
 police (Public Security Force-FUSEP) as a fourth branch. In December, however,
 the Congress a pproved the second and final reading of a constitutional amendment
 to place FUSEP under civilian control. The armed forces operate with considerable
 institutional and legal autonomy, particularly in the realm of internal security and
 military affairs. The Government established an Ad Hoc Commission on Police and
 Judicial Reform in 1993, in response to credible allegations of extrajudicial killings
 by members of the FUSEP, particularly its Directorate of National Investigations
 (DNI). In January 1994, the Government established a new Public Ministry contain-
 
 
 482
 inga new Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DIC) to replace the disbanded
 DNI; however, the DIC is not yet fully staffed or equipped. According to human
 rights organizations, including the Government's National Commission for the Pro-
 tection oHuman Rights, reports of abuses have steadily declined since the DNI was
 abolished. Nonetheless, members of both the armed forces and the FUSEP are re-
 pohrted to have committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is primarily based on agriculture, with a small but increasingly im-
 portant maquiladora (in-bond processing for export) industry that accounts for some
 75,000 jobs. The armed forces or its pension fund play a role in the national econ-
 omy, controlling enterprises usually associated with the private sector, including a
 bank, several insurance companies, and one of the two cement companies. Some en-
 tities (notably the merchant marine and the national telephone company) have
 passed from military to civilian control. Approximately 43 percent of workers engage
 in agriculture; about one-third of those work on large plantations. The principal ex-
 port crops are coffee and bananas, which are the country's leading source of foreign
 exchange. Nontraditional products such as melons and shrimp also play an impor-
 tant role in the country's economy. Per capita income is about $670 annually, which
 provides most of the population with a low standard of living. The Government esti-
 mates that 65 percent of its citizens live in poverty.
 The Government's human rights recor        roved somewhat, although serious
 problems remain in certain areas. Some members of the security forces allegedly
 committed extrajudicial killings. Reports of torture decreased significantly; however,
 police beatings and other abuse of detainees remained a problem. The Government
 administratively punished some abusers but took no judical action against them.
 Considerable impunity for members of the civilian and military elite, exacerbated
 by a weak, underfunded, and sometimes corrupt judicial system, contributes to
 human rights problems. Prison conditions remained harsh, and the judicial system
 is unable to provide prisoners awaiting trial with swift and impartial justice. No
 senior government official, member of the business elite, bureaucrat, or politician
 was convicted in 1996. However, the authorities arrested and jailed two officials of
 the former administration for fraud and abuse of power, and there are accusations
 against former President Callejas and members of his cabinet. There was an in-
 crease in the number of vigilante killings. Other human rights problems were soci-
 etal discrimination and violence against women, discrimination against indigenous
 people, and abuse of street children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, members of the security forces (notably District Com-
 mand 7 of the police in Tegucigalpa) allegedly committed several extrajudicial
 killings.
 The crime rate surged again in 1996, including a rise in the number of homicides.
 Random shootings were common; bombs were thrown at the President's home and
 at businesses of a human rights activist, at the courts, at Congress, and at govern-
 ment ministries. With the drastic increase in violent crime, it continued to be dif-
 ficult to differentiate among homicides that may have been perpetrated by members
 of the various government security services, common criminals, or private vigilantes
 (these are privately hired, unlicensed guards or watchmen, as well as volunteer
 groups who patrol their neighborhoods or municipalities to deter crime).
 Human rights groups have compiled credible evidence to indicate that at least 73
 of these homicides were extrajudicial executions. In at least 21 of these cases, it is
 alleged that renegade elements of the security forces or civilian groups working with
 them (including vigilante elements) deliberately used unwarranted lethal force
 against supposed habitual criminals. Widespread frustration at the inability of the
 security forces to control crime and the well-founded perception that a corrupt police
 force is complicit in the high rate of crime, have led to considerable public support
 for vigilante justice. The Government did not take effective action to try, convict,
 or punish anyone for these offenses.
 On July 23, residents discovered the body of a 20-year-old in a trash dump in El
 Segundo Anillo Periferico, a neighborhood in the northern city of San Pedro Sula.
 They found the victim, whose identity remains unknown, with his feet bound and
 his hands tied behind his back; he was shot twice in the head. Witnesses to the
 shooting claim that the victim was killed at the trash dump by several men who
 fled the scene. Police speculate that the killing was an act of vigilante justice but
 have not identified any suspects.
 
 
 483
 On July 1, the bodies of two men (Isauro Rene Rivera Salgado, age 25 and Ruben
 Omar Arambu Baile, age 21) were found in Cerro Grande, a neighborhood of
 Comayaguela, near Tegucigalpa. Both men, missing for 2 days were found in a
 ditch with bullets in the head, the thorax, and both sides of the 6ody. In a prelimi-
 nary investigation, the police indicated that both appeared to be executions, adding
 that one or both were involved in some sort of illegal activities. There were no wit-
 nesses and FUSEP has not interrogated or arrested any suspects.
 Credible allegations of extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP, particu-
 larly its now-defunct Directorate of National Investigations, led to the creation in
 January 1994 of a new civilian-controlled Directorate of Criminal Investigations to
 replace the DNI within the new Public Ministry (which also includes a prosecutorial
 branch). Human rights groups, including the Attorney General's office, have noted
 a continuing drop in the number of reports of human rights abuses since the dis-
 solution of the DNI. The new Ministry, responsible for investigating all cases of
 extrajudicial killings, has completed its initial program of training and organizing
 its staff. Although this process has been slow, the DIC did solve several high-profile
 cases, including two kidnapings where the DIC rescued the victims and arrested the
 kidnapers. The Ministry will lack the capability, however, to investigate adequately
 current or past criminal cases until the DIC reaches a higher level of operational
 capability. The DIC expects to reach this level in mid-1997, when it expects to have
 1,500 fully trained and equipped agents. In 1996, the DIC had only 420 investiga-
 tors and practically no communications equipment.
 In June the stepdaughter of human rights activist Ramon Custodio, president of
 the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), died under
 unclear circumstances; by year's end no final determination had been made whether
 the death was a murder or a suicide.
 On January 5, the First Court of Appeals ruled that military officers accused of
 human rights abuses in the 1980's were covered by the 1991 amnesty decreed by
 the National Congress. However, in a decision announced January 19, the Supreme
 Court unanimously overruled the Appeals Court decision in the case of nine military
 officers accused of the illegal detention, torture, and attempted murder of six stu-
 dents in 1982. The case was returned to the criminal courts for action, which the
 appeals court had ruled did not have jurisdiction since past amnesty covered the
 military. The effect of this ruling was that courts of first instance will consider the
 application of amnesty on a case-by-case basis, subject to review by higher courts.
 Following much-publicized investigations of human rights violations (past and
 present) by military personnel, judges in the civilian court system issued arrest war-
 rants for 15 senior active and retired military and police officers, charging them
 with a number of serious crimes committed in 1982. These included the kidnaping,
 illegal detention, torture, and attempted murder of six students by the police; the
 illegal detention and murder of Nelson Mackay Chavarria and the attempted mur-
 der and illegal detention of Miguel Francisco Caries; and the illegal detention, rob-
 bery, murder, and threats to murder of Adan Aviles Funez and a Nicaraguan la-
 borer named Amado Espinoza Paz, who disappeared together in Choluteca on June
 12, 1982. Of the 15 with outstanding warrants, all but 2 remain fugitives and at
 large. (One of these turned himself in but was released after proving that he was
 not in the country at the time of the alleged crimes; the other is in prison serving
 a 5-year sentence for a narcotics conviction).
 The Supreme Court on July 1 issued a special decree permitting officials associ-
 ated with the criminal justice system (including the military, police, prison wardens
 and employees, criminal investigative agents, public prosecutors, judges, and mag-
 istrates), who are sought by the criminal courts, to serve their preventive detention
 at military bases and police centers rather than the central penitentiaries, as has
 been the case in the past. The decree is not mandatory and leaves the detention
 decisions up to the judge in each case. This ruling applies only to preventive deten-
 tion and may encourage military officers sought or a leged human rights abuses in
 the 1980's to turn themselves in. The decree is designed as an interim measure,
 pending passage by the National Congress of a new penal procedures code that will
 modernize the now antiquated code.
 There was no progress in investigation or prosecution of other alleged
 extrajudicial killings committed in previous years. These include the 1995 killings
 of four alleged criminals who had been detained by police of the 7th command of
 FUSEP in Tegucigalpa: Orlando Alvarez Rios, Diomedes Obed Garcia, Rony Alexis
 Betancourt, and Marco Antonio Serbellon; the 1995 killings of three alleged car
 thieves found tortured and shot to death outside the city of La Paz: Jose Alfredo
 Castro Urbina and Dennis Moises Castro Rosa (the third remains unknown); and
 a number of killings dating back to 1990.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 484
 
 The Attorney General continued investigations into the disappearances of 184
 people in the 1980"s. Various witnesses, survivors, and a few former members of the
 military have charged that a military intelligence group called Battalion 3-16 kid-
 naped, tortured, and murdered many of those who disappeared. The National Com-
 missioner for Human Rights, Leo   a adare, also continued his investigation into
 the human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by members of Battalion
 3-16 and the former DNI. The Attorney General had several clandestine grave sites
 excavated during the year, and forensic scientists identified several remains as
 those of persons on the list of those who disappeared. The Attorney General and
 the Human Rights Commissioner requested from the HOAF and the US. Govern-
 ment information they might have to aid this investigation. The HOAF claimed to
 have no relevant information. The U.S. Government reviewed documents from that
 period and released to the Attorney General and the Commissioner thousands of
 pages of declassified documents, including several hundred pages relating to the dis-
 appearance of a US. citizen Jesuit priest, Father James Carney.
 In August the Government completed payment of indemnifications ordered by the
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights to the victims' families in the Velasquez
 Rodriguez and Gedinez Cruz cases. The victims were students at the National Au-
 tonomous University in 1981 when DNc agents detained them; they were never seen
 again. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed its satisfaction
 with the Government's action and with the petitioners who testified.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and there were only a few reports that officials
 employed such practices. However, police beatings and other alleged abuse of de-
 tainees remained a problem. The police also engaged in violence against street chil-
 dren (see Section 5).
 The Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), part of FUSEP, investigates cases
 of alleged torture and abuse; OPR officials recommend sanctions for police agents
 found guilty of such mistreatment. However, neither the FUSEP General Command
 nor the OPR is empowered to punish wrongdoers; only the commander of the ac-
 cused agent has the authority to do so. Several human rights groups and the Public
 Ministry criticized the OPR for not being responsive to their requests for impartial
 investigations of FUSEP agents accused of abuses. The Public Ministry established
 the Office of Human Rights Inspector within the DIC to monitor the behavior of its
 agents. This office reports to the head of the human rights section and to the Attor-
 ney General. Investigations by this office resulted in the firing of 11 DIC agents in
 1996.
 Prison conditions are harsh. Prisoners suffer from severe overcrowding, malnutri-
 tion, and a lack of adequate sanitation. The 24 penal centers hold 9,342 prisoners,
 of which only 835 have been convicted and are serving sentences. The rest are still
 awaiting trial, some for as long as 5 years. More often than not, wardens house the
 mentally ill and those with tuberculosis and other infectious diseases together in the
 same celis with the general prison population. A new, larger detention facility for
 men located in Tamara lacks water and was not expected to open until sometime
 in 1997. Prisoners with money routinely buy private cells, decent food, and conjugal
 visitation rights, while prisoners without money often lack the most basic neces-
 sities as well as legal assistance. When the authorities arrest street children, they
 house many of them with adults who abuse them.
 The Government permits prison visits by international human rights organiza-
 tions.
 d. Arbitrar Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law states that the plice may arrest
 a person only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission
 of a crime, and that they must clearly inform the person of the grounds for the ar-
 rest. (By law the FUSEP cannot investigate; it only detains suspecta.) Police must
 bring a detainee before a judge within 24 hours; the judge then must issue an initial
 temporary holding order within 24 hours, release an initial decision within 6 days,
 and conduct a preliminary investigation to decide whether there is sufficient evi-
 dence to warrant further investigation. However, in practice, the authorities do not
 routinely observe these legal requirements. While bail is legally available, it is used
 primi    or ostensibly medical reasons, but procedures for granting it in such cases
 are confused and unclear. Poor defendants, even when represented by a public de-
 fender, are seldom able to take advantage of bail.
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, a judge, the police, public officials,
 or any citizen may initiate criminal proceedings. Perhape as many as 80 percent of
 the cases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal justice system but
 instead are settled administratively by the police or by municipal courts, which are
 separate from the regular judicial court system.
 
 
 The Constitution prohibits the expatriation of a citizen to another country; exile
 is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair trial While the Government respects these provisions
 in principle, historically in practice, adherence has been weak and uneven. A nim-
 ber of factors limit the effectiveness of the system: Both the judiciary and the Public
 Ministry suffer from inadequate funding, the civil law inquisitorial system functions
 very p]oorly; and powerful special interests still exercise their influence and often
 prevail in many lower courts. However, mn landmark pubhic sector cases (see Section
 l.a.), the Supreme Court did show a significant degree of independence from power-
 ful political and economic interests.
 The court system is composed of a Supreme Court with 9 magistrates; 10 appeals
 courts; 67 courts of first instance of general jurisdiction; and 325 justice of the peace
 courts of limitedjurisdictio. Congress elects the nine Supreme Court justices and
 names the president of the Court; the Supreme Court, in turn, names all lower
 court judges. The 4-year term for justices ofthe Supreme Court coincides with those
 of the Congress and the President
 Some progress was made i      n  a judicial career system tofenhance   t qualfica-
 tions of sitting judges, depoliticize the appointments process, and b reak the subcul-
 tures of corruption, clientism, patronage, and influence peddling within the judici-
 ary. Nevertheless, many appeals courts and lower courts remain staffed by politi-
 cally selected judges and unqualified clerks and are inefficienct and subject to influ-
 ene by special interests.
 An accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an ini-
 tial hearing by a judge,  o hal, t an attorney provided by the Stat if necessary,
 and to appeal, Although the Consitution recognizes the principle of innocence, the
 Criminal Code is in practice often administered by ill-trained judges operatinmg on
 a presumption of "guilty until proven innocent."  rtrial hearings and trials are
 written, and at the judge's discretion may be declared secret and not 'public." De-
 fendants and their attorneys are not always genuine participants in the process, de-
 spite rights accorded under law. Defendants may, through the judge, confront wit-
 nesses against them and present evidence on teir own behalf. According to law,
 defendants and their attorneys have access to government-held evidence relevant to
 their cases, but in practice this is not always the case.
 In the inquisitorial system, judges are legally in charge of the investigation as
 well as the trial and sentencing. Both the Public Ministry's public prosecutors and
 private prosecutors may bring criminal charges against citizens. A judge may jail
 an accused persons for 6 days before a determination is made of probable cause to
 admit the c are. If a judge sustains the criminal accusation, the accused remains
 in jail or may be released on bail while awaiting trial. Until recently, the same
 judge conducting the investigation was the trial and sentencing judge. By order of
 the Supreme Court, those jurisdictions are now separate.
 A public defender program provides service to those unable to afford an adequate
 defense. There are 104 public defenders nationally providing free legal services for
 37.4 percent of the prison population; however, public defenders are hard pressed
 to meet the heavy demands of a nonautomated, inadequately funded, and labor-in-
 tensive criminal justice system. Despite their best efforts, detention of criminal sus-
 pects pending trial averaged 2 years and remains a serious human rights problem.
 In a number of cases, poor prisoners remain in jail after being acquitted or complet-
 ing their sentences, due to the failure by responsible officials to process release pa-
 pers. A significant number of defendants serve the maximum possible sentence for
 the crime of which they are accused before their trials are ever concluded or even
 begun. In June government statitics showed that 89 percent of prisoners in jails
 had not been through a trial process or sentenced.
 Pending consideration of provsed reforms, the Supreme Court issued an instruc-
 tion that holds judges personally accountable for reducing the backlogged cases; sep-
 arates judges into pretrial investigative judges, and trial and sentencing judges; and
 creates a program to monitor and enfoe compliance with these measures. The in-
 struction i intended to ensure that the rights of the accused to a timely and trans-
 parent defense are more effectively respected.
 The 1994 Public Ministry Law and subsequent creation of the new ministry, with
 196 public prosecutors assigned nationally, are also intended to strengthen a citi-
 zen's ability to seek redress from government abuses and to enjoy fair and public
 trials. The Public Ministrys independence from the other branches of the Govern-
 ment is also intended to reduce the opportunities for the politically and economically
 powerful to distort the investigative and prosecutorial process. After 2 years in full
 operation, the Public Ministry has taken decisive action in favor of human rights
 by investigating and accusing not only military officers of violations, but also inves-
 
 
 486
 tigating and accusing various high ranking officials of both the former and current
 government of abuses of power, fraud, and diversion of public funds and resources.
 These are crimes that seriously diminish the Government's ability to address fun-
 damental economic issues affecting the human r4 hts of the general population. Citi-
 zens can also seek redress through the Nationa Human Rights Commissioner (Om-
 budsman), who is empowered to monitor and oversee the Government's performance
 on human rights matters. Despite the significant efforts of the Public Ministry, con-
 siderable independence shown by the Supreme Court on highly visible and different
 cases, and independent lower court judges, at year's end the justice system still
 tended to favor the rich and politically influential and remained weak, underfunded,
 marginally politicized, and generally inefficient.
 Prior to 1994, the armed forces insisted that its members could only be tried
 through its own courts-martial. However, in 1993 Congress passed a resolution in-
 terpreting the jurisdiction of the military court system to be subordinate to the civil-
 ian system in cases of jurisdictional dispute. Since then both officer and enlisted
 military personnel accused of crimes against civilians have in fact been remanded
 to the civilian judicial system. Following much-publicized investigations of human
 rights violations (past and present) by military personnel, judges in the civilian
 court system brought criminal charges against a number of senior active and retired
 military officers for murder, attempted murder, and illegal detention (see Section
 L.a.). The Public Ministry maintains civilian prosecutors accredited to 11 military
 courts as well as to the major courts of first instance in the country. Although the
 military continued to profess respect for civilian court jurisdiction over its members,
 only one military officer accused of human rights violations has turned himself in.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons authorized
 by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the authorization of
 a competent authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or at
 any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission of crime. How-
 ever, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police and armed forces
 personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization before entering a pri-
 vate home. Despite a system of "duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue search
 orders, coordination among the police, the court, and the Public Ministry remains
 weak. However, while these interagency liaison problems still undermine the effec-
 tiveness of the system, there was notable improvement during the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities largely respected these freedoms in practice. The
 media, while often openly critical of the Government and frequently willing to ex-
 pose corruption, are themselves subject to     high  levels of corruption   and
 pliticization. Serious investigative journalism is still in its infancy. There were
 credible reports of powerful figures threatening the job security of reporters, as well
 as instances of self-censorship and payoffs to journalists to kill stories.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for all forms of religious ex-
 pression, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens enter and exit the country without arbitrary impediment, and
 the Government does not restrict travel within the countys borders.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum and the granting of asylum or refugee status in ac-
 cordanee with the standards of the 1951 United Nations Convention and its 1967
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government through democratic and
 peaceful means in the November 1993 elections. International o     pservers found the
 elections to be free and fair. The national government is chosen by free, secret, di-
 rect, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, but the clergy and
 serving meers of the armed forces are not permitted to vote. Any citizen born
 
 
 in Honduras or abroad of Honduran parentage may hold office except for members
 of the clergy and the armed forces. A new political party may gain legal status by
 obtaining 20,000 signatures and establishing party organizations in at least half the
 country's 18 departments. In December the major parties held vigorously contested
 primary elections-a first for the National Party- in preparation for elections in
 1997.
 There are no legal impediments to women or minorities participating in govern-
 ment and politics, but in practice, the proportion of women and minorities in politi-
 cal organizations and elective office is far lower than their overall representation in
 society. However, in the 1993 elections voters elected for the first time a woman,
 Guadalupe Jerezano, as one of the three vice presidents, and the losing opposition
 slate also had a female vice presidential candidate. Women hold a cabinet ministry
 and a Supreme Court position, as well as a number of vice ministerial positions. Of
 the 128 Deputies in Congress, 14 are women. There are few indigenous persons in
 leadership positions in government or politics. Five Deputies are indigenous per-
 sons, and the ambassador to the United Nations is a member of the Garifuna indig-
 enous group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 In March Congress ratified a presidential decree expanding the functions of the
 National Commission for the Protection of Human Rights and unanimously re-
 elected Dr. Leo Valladares for a 6-year term as Commissioner. Under this new de-
 cree and in fulfillment of his expanded functions, the Commissioner has free access
 to all civil and military institutions and centers of detention; he may enter without
 authorization or objection by anyone. The Commissioner performs his functions with
 complete immunity and autonomy from all persons.
 Anonymous telephone callers continued to threaten several individuals active in
 human rights endeavors. Human Rights Commissioner Valladares received numer-
 ous telephone threats against himsef andhis family. Dr. Ramon Custdio, presidnt
 of CODEH, and Berta Oliva de Nativi, coordinator for the Committee of the Rel-
 atives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras, also received numerous tele-
 phone threats. DIC director Wilfredo Alvarado has received death threats since his
 investigation into several high-profile scandals involving the illegal sales of Hon-
 duran diplomatic passports. Attorney General Edmundo Orellana reported threats
 against himself and his family due to his investigations of several cases of persons
 who disappeared in the 1980's.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination based on race and sex. Although it also bans
 discrimination on the basis of class, in fact, both the military and the political and
 social elite generally enjoy impunity before the legal system. Members of these
 groups are rarely arrested or jailed. Some progress was made by the Government,
 however, with the arrest and incarceration of Jose Tomas Guillen Williams and
 Luciano Coello, two officials of the former Callejas government. Both remain in the
 central penitentiary in Tegucigalpa awaiting trial on charges of corruption and
 abuse of power.
 In 1994 the Congress passed a constitutional amendment to end compulsory mili-
 tary service. This measure was designed to end the common practice of forcible re-
 cruitment into the armed forces of middle and lower class citizens. There were also
 allegations that the authorities do not adequately defend homosexuals from threats,
 harassment, or abuse and that some officials support, promote, or engage in such
 hostile activities.
 Women.-Violence against women remains widespread, and serious weaknesses in
 the Penal Code severely impede efforts to combat it. The Honduran Women's Com-
 mittee for Peace---Visitacion Padilla and the Center for Women's Rights have called
 for the passage of legislation now before the Congress that would strengthen pen-
 alties for crimes against women. Congress continues to resist addressing concerns
 of women's advocacy reform groups in this area. The majority of such violence takes
 place within the family. The courts do not take action in domestic violence cases
 unless the victim is badly injured and incapacitated for more than 10 days. Except
 in the case of children 12 years of age or under, rape is considered a private crime
 (meaning rape victims over age 12 must hire a private prosecutor, a luxury few can
 afford). The penalties for rape are relatively light, ranging from 3 to 9 years' impris-
 
 
 488
 onment. There are few shelters specifically maintained for battered women. During
 the year, six new centers for battered women were opened offering legal, medical,
 and psychological assistance. Although the law offers some redress, few women take
 advantage of the legal process, believing that judges would be unwilling to apply
 the law vigorously. Sexual harassment in the workplace is also a problem.
 Women are represented in at least small numbers in most of the professions, but
 cultural attitudes limit their career opportunities. In theory, women have equal ac-
 cess to educational opportunities, but family pressures often impede the ambitions
 of women intent on obtaining higher education. The law requires employers to pay
 women, who make up 51 percent of the work force, equal wages for equal work, ut
 employers often classify women's jobs as less demanding than those of men, as a
 justification for paying them lower salaries.
 Some organizations have begun to offer assistance to women, principally targeting
 those living in the rural sectors and marginal neighborhoods of ,cities. The Hon-
 duran Federation of Women's Associations, for example, provides home construction
 and improvement loans, offers free legal assistance to women, and lobbies the Gov-
 ernment on women's causes. The human rights group CIPRODEN continues an edu-
 cation program to make women aware of their rights under the law.
 Children.-Although the Government has committed itself to protecting children
 by allocating 27 percent of its 1996 budget to public education and health care, it
 is unable to prevent abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) and child workers (see
 Section 6.d.). In Tegucigalpa there are about 4,000 street children, of whom 2,000
 frd shelter on any given day. Many of them have been sexually molested, and
 about 40 percent regularly engage in prostitution; approximately 0 percent of the
 street children in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula are HIV positive. At least 40per-
 cent are chronically addicted to glue sniffing. Over 75 percent of the street children
 fid their way to the streets because of severe family problems; 30 percent are aban-
 doned. Both the police and members of the general population engage in violence
 against street children When the authorities arrest street children, they house
 many of them with adults who abuse thesn
 Casa Alianza worked with the police and courts to end the abuse of children who
 are arrested and incarcerated in adult prisons. As a result, juvenile centers in Ta-
 mara, El Carmen, and Hatilro (located in sections of Tegcigalpa and San Pedro
 Sula) were opened during the year. However, detention of children with adults, vgi-
 lante violence, and police abuse continue t be to pble dueto a general lack oi
 juvenile detention centers.
 On September 10, new legislation covering children and adolescents took effect.
 The new code covers the rights, liberties, and protection of children, including the
 area of child labor, and establishes prison sentences of up to 3 years for persons
 convicted of abuse of children in any form. Given limited resources, the ability of
 the Government to enforce the new code is problematic.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no formal barriers to participation by dis-
 abled persons in employment, education, and health care, but neither is there spe-
 cific statutory or constitutional protection for them. There is no legislation that re-
 quires accessibility for disabled persons to government buildings or commercial es-
 tablishments.
 Indigenous People.-The small community of indigenous people have little or no
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, or the
 allocation of natural resources. All indigenous land rights are communal. While the
 law permits persons to claim individual free holding titles, in practice this has been
 difficult. Tribal lands are often poorly defined in documents dating from the mid-
 19th century and in most cases lack legal title based on modern cadastral measure-
 ments. The Honduran Forestry Development Corporation makes decisions regarding
 exploitation of timber resources on indigenous lands, often over strenuous tribal ob-
 4ection. Nonindigenous farmers and cattle ranchers regularly usurp indigenous
 The courts commonly deny legal recourse to indigenous groups and show bias in
 favor of the nonindigenous parties, who are often people of means and influence.
 Failure to obtain legal redress frequently caused indigenous grups to attempt to
 regain land through invasions and other tactics, which usually provoked the au-
 thorities to retaliate forcefully. In April, 2 years after their 1994 pilgrimage, some
 5,000 members of indigenous groups again threatened to march to Tegucilgalpa to
 remind the Government of the prmises it made (the "Plan of Presidential Action
 of 1994") and demand that their rights be respected. They called off the march after
 discussions with senior government officials but vowed to return if the Government
 does not fulfill these agreements.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions; the unions are independent of government and political parties. Although
 only about 14 percent of the work force is organized, trade unions exert some eco-
 nomic and political influence. During the year this influence diminished somewhat.
 Unions frequently participate in public rallies against government policies and
 make extensive use of the media to advance their views. There are also three large
 peasant associations directly affiliated with the trade unions. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic labor rights,
 which the authorities honor in practice. The Civil Service Code, however, stipulates
 that government workers do not have the right to strike. (This does not include
 those working in state-owned enterprises.) There were legal and illegal strikes dur-
 ing the year y workers in foreign-owned maquiladora (in-bond processing) plants
 exporting textiles and garments.
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity" associations, which are es-
 sentially aimed at providing credit and other services to workers and management
 who are members of the association. Organized labor, including the American Fed-
 eration of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations and the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions, strongly opposes these associations on the grounds
 that they do not permit strikes, have inadequate grievance procedures, and neutral-
 ize genuine and representative trade unions.
 The trade union movement maintains close ties with various international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects workers'
 rights to organize and to bargain collectively; collective bargaining agreements are
 the norm for companies in which workers are organized. However, although the
 Labor Code prohibits retribution by employers for trade union activity, it is a com-
 mon occurrence. Some employers threaten to close down unionized companies, har-
 ass their workers, and in some cases fire them for trying to form a trade union. Em-
 ployers actually dismiss relatively few workers for union activity once a union is rec-
 ognized; these cases, however, serve to discourage other workers from attempting
 to organize. Workers in both unionized and nonunionized companies are under the
 protection of the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the
 Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Labor took action in several cases, pressuring
 employers to observe the code. Labor or civil courts can require employers to rehire
 employees fired for union activity, but such rulings are uncommon. Generally, how-
 ever, agreements between management and unions contain a clause prohibiting re-
 taliation against any worker who participated in a strike or union activity.
 The same labor regulations apply in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest
 of private industry. Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free
 trade zone (7 of the 11 maquiladora companies there are unionized), but factory
 owners have resisted efforts to organize the new privately owned industrial parks.
 The Maquiladora Association has sponsored several meetings and seminars between
 its membership and major labor groups. As a result, tensions declined, and some
 20 plants unionized peacefully in the privately owned EPZ's. The attitude of the
 Government towards organized labor in the EPZ's is the same as for other indus-
 tries.
 In a number of US.-owned plants, workers have shown little enthusiasm for
 unionizing since they believe that their treatment, salary, and working conditions
 are as good as or better than those in unionized plants. In the absence of a union
 and collective bargaining, several of the EPZ plants have instituted solidarity asso-
 ciations, which to some extent exist as company unions for the purpose of setting
 wages and negotiating working conditions. Others use the minimum wage to set
 starting salaries and adjust the wage scale by negotiating with common groups of
 workers and individuals depending on skill, years of employment, and other related
 criteria. Talks between unions and EPZ plants continue.
 Labor leaders blame the Government for permitting management to act contrary
 to the Labor Code, and say that this problem will continue until the Ministry of
 Labor is reorganized to make it more efficient. They criticize the Ministry for not
 enforcing the Labor Code, for taking too long to make decisions, and for being timid
 and indifferent to workers' needs. Under a November 1995 Memorandum of Under-
 standing between the Minister of Labor and the United States Trade Representa-
 tive's Office (calling for more forceful implementation of the Honduran Labor Code),
 the Ministry has made significant progress toward enforcing the code. In one case
 where the Ministry imposed a $10,000 (115,000 lempira) fine on a company for fail-
 ure to rehire 16 workers fired for organizing a union, the company reinstated the
 workers the next day. The Ministry has increased its inspections of the
 
 
 maquiladoras and the training of its inspectors; more needs to be done, however,
 to adhere completely to international labor standards.
 The Labor Code clearly prohibits blacklisting- nevertheless, there was credible evi-
 dence that informal blacklisting occurred in the privately owned industrial parks.
 When unions are formed, organizers must submit a list of initial members to the
 Ministry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. Before offi-
 cial recognition is granted, however, the Ministry must inform the company of the
 impending union organization. Ministry officials have consistently been unable to
 provide effective protection to workers. There are credible reports that, particularly
 in the EPZ sector, some inspectors have gone so far as to sell companies the names
 of employees involved in forming a union, which some companies used to dismiss
 union organizers before recognition was granted. There is also credible evidence that
 military intelligence maintains files on union activists.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the law pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor. Although there were no official reports of such
 practices, there were credible allegations of forced overtime in EPZ plants, particu-
 larly for women.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit the employment of minors under the age of 16, except that a child
 of 15 years is permitted to work with the permission of parents and the Ministry
 of Labor. The new Children's Code prohibits a child of 14 years of age or less from
 working (even with parental permission) and establishes prison sentences of 3 to 5
 years for individuals who allow children to work illegally. An employer who legally
 hires a 15-year-old must certify that the young person has finished or is finishing
 compulsory schooling. The Ministry of Labor grants a number of work permits to
 15-year-olds each year. It is common, however, for younger children to obtain these
 documents or to purchase forged permits that use the Labor Ministry's letterhead.
 The Ministry of Labor cannot effectively enforce child labor laws, and violations
 of the Labor Code occur frequently in rural areas and in small companies. Many
 children work on small family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops to
 supplement the family income. According to the Ministry of Labor, human rights
 groups, and organizations for the protection of children, the most significant child
 abor problem is in the construction industry. Employment of children younger than
 the legal working age in maquiladoras probably occurs but does not appear to hap-
 pen on a large scale.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-In December 1995, the Government decreed a
 25 percent increase in the minimum wage. Daily pay rates vary by the sector of the
 economy affected and geographical zones: The lowest minimum wage is $2.00 (26
 lempiras) per day in the agriculture sector. The highest minimum wage is in the
 minig sector at $3.48 (31.50 lempiras) daily. Urban workers earn slightly more
 than those in the countryside. The Constitution and the Labor Code stipulate that
 all labor be fairly paid, but the Ministry of Labor lacks the staff and other resources
 for effective enforcement. Even after the third consecutive annual increase, the min-
 imum wage is considered insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family. Labor leaders say that the Government has ignored those earn-
 ing above the minimum wage (workers in the maquiladoras and organizations such
 as banks) and is calling for an across-the-board increase of 30 percent that they
 claim will benefit all.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek.There is a
 requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days. The Labor Code pro-
 vides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after 4 years.
 However, employers frequently ignore these regulations due to the high level of un-
 employment and underemployment and the lack of effective enforcement by the
 Ministry of Labor.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws,
 but does not do so effectively. Although fewer than in previous years, some com-
 laits allege the failure of foreign factory managers to comply with occupational
 ealth and safety aspects of Labor Code regulations in factories located in free zones
 and industrial parks. There is no provision for a worker to remove himself from a
 dangerous work situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
