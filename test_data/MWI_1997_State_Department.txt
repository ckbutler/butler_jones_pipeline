 MAJAWI
 The Republic of Malawi held its first democratic, multiparty elections since inde-
 pendence in May 1994. President Bakili Muluzi principally relies on the ruling Unit-
 ed Democratic Front (UDF), which holds 82 of the 177 seats in the National Assem-
 bly. The opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP), formerly the sole legal party,
 holds 52 seats. The opposition Alliance for Democracy (AFORD) split over the JDF-
 AFORD coalition and the continued presence of AFORD Members of Parliament
 (M.P.'s) in the Cabinet, reducing AFORD's number of MP's to 27. Seven former
 AFORD M.P.'s and two former MCP M.P.'s sit as independents. AFORD and MCP
 ended their 9-month boycott of Parliament in March. The legislature demonstrated
 only limited independence from the executive. In October a High Court judge ruled
 that cabinet ministers could not also sit as Members of Parliament, potentially af-
 fecting 21 seats. The judiciary has demonstrated independence in several high pro-
 file political cases, although there are frequent allegations that its decisions result
 from political bias or bribe%.
 The National Police, hea ed by the Inspector General of Police under the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, is responsible for internal security. Although the army is apolitical,
 the police occasionally called on the army for support. While violence and common
 crime have become frequent, there was no indication of organized activity in Malawi
 
 
 199
 or abroad by remnants of the Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP), formerly the MCps
 paramilitary wing. Despite notable improvements, there continued to be credible al-
 legations of human rights abuses by the police.
 Malawi is small, densely populated, and landlocked. The economy is predomi-
 nately agricultural. Over 85 percent of the population derives its income from agri-
 culture. Tobacco remains the primary foreign exchange earner; other cash crops in-
 clude tea, coffee, and sugar. Foreign aid remains a critical source of income. The
 Government continued privatizing the ownership of public enterprises. The economy
 was expected to grow by 7 percent in real terms; the inflation rate was about 15
 percent. Annual per capita income is below $200. Wealth remains concentrated in
 the hands of a small elite.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in many
 areas, but serious problems remained. The police continued to abuse detainees and
 to use excessive force in handling criminal suspects. There were instances of deaths
 of detainees while in, or shortly after release from, police custody. In implementing
 reforms, the Inspector General of Police stressed public accountability and trans-
 parency. Prison conditions remained poor. Lengthy pretrial detention, the inefficient
 and understaffed judicial system, and limited resources called into question the abil-
 ity of defendants to receive a timely and, in some cases, a fair trial. High levels of
 crime prompted ang   mobs to execute summarily alleged criminals.
 The Malawi Broadcasting Corporation inaugurated its second channel, and the
 Government granted two broadcast licenses, one to a station broadcasting only reli-
 gious programming and one to a private station scheduled to begin broadcasting in
 early 1998. By contrast the print media continued to report freely. The Human
 Rights Commission mandated by the Constitution to explore human rights viola-
 tions made little progress. Women continued to experience severe societal discrimi-
 nation, and violence against women and children remained a problem. The Govern-
 ment took steps in its economic development programs to assist disadvantaged
 women. The Government intimidated civil servant strikers, dispersed them with
 tear gas, prohibited their peaceful assembly, and arrested, suspended, or transferred
 strike leaders in an effort to break the union.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. There were incidents of deaths of detainees while in, or shortly after re-
 lease from, police custody. These deaths involved possible use of excessive force or
 possible negligence, as in the June death of one of the suspects in a bank fraud case.
 Several prisoners died largely due to poor prison conditions (see Section 1.c.).
 Frustrated by inadequate law enforcement and rising crime, angry mobs some-
 times resorted to vigilante justice in beating, stoning, or burning suspected crimi-
 nals to death. The Government made no discernible effort to punish  nividuals who
 carried out these abuses.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. Although that provision is generally respected, the Inspectorate of Prisons, an
 investigative body mandated by the Constitution, confirmed that the police contin-
 ued to physically abuse detainees. However, the incidence of abuse dropped. While
 higher ranking officials demonstrated familiarity with new standards for the hu-
 mane treatment of prisoners, their subordinates commonly employed unacceptable
 techniques. According to an October 1996 Inspectorate of Prisons report, unaccept-
 able techniques included beatings, whippings, dog attacks, knifings, and the inten-
 tional deprivation of food, water, toilet facilities, and medical care to force confes-
 sions. These abuses are sometimes hidden by keeping a prisoner in police custody
 until wounds heal before turning the prisoner over to the prison system for remand.
 The mistreatment is partly due to the mistaken belief of many police officers that
 the law requires them to present a case (not just charges) to the court within 48
 hours of arrest. The Government continued to seek community involvement in its
 comprehensive reform of the police.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, and sub-
 standard sanitation and health facilities remained serious problems. Poor conditions
 contributed to the deaths of several prisoners following an outbreak of tuberculosis
 at the prison in Zomba. While not kept in separate facilities, women are segregated
 within the prison compound and tended by female guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law permits the accused to challenge
 the legality of detention, to have access to legal counsel, and to be released or in-
 
 
 formed of charges by a court of law within 48 hours. In an effort to comply with
 the 48-hour rule, police occasionally resorted to beatings in order to extract informa-
 tion necessary to their case. In cases where the court determines that a defendant
 cannot afford to supply his own counsel, legal services are supposed to be provided
 by the Government. With few persons able to afford legal counsel, the country's four
 public defenders were not sufficient to meet the needs of indigent detainees. Bail
 is frequently granted to reduce prison overcrowding. Its use often bears only a tenu-
 ous relation to the merits of an individual's situation. December statistics indicated
 that approximately 35 percent of the 5,950 prison inmates were detainees awaiting
 trial.
 Exile is not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary dem-
 onstrated a high degree of independence from elected officials in several high profile
 political cases. Allegations that individual judges were corrupt or politically biased
 were common. The judicial system is also handicapped by serious weaknesses, in-
 cluding poor record keeping, shortage of trained personnel, and a heavy caseload.
 The Constitution provides for a High Court, a Supreme Court of Appeal, and sub-
 ordinate magistrate courts. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President and con-
 firmed by the National Assembly. Other justices are appointed by the President fol-
 lowing a recommendation by the Judicial Service Commission. All justices are ap-
 pointed until the age of 65 and may be removed only for reasons of incompetence
 or misbehavior, as determined by a majority in Parliament and the President.
 By law defendants have the right to a public trial but not to a trial by jury. In
 dealing with murder cases, the High Court nevertheless used juries of seven persons
 from the defendant's home district. Defendants are also entitled to an attorney, the
 right to adduce and challenge evidence and witnesses, and the right of appeal. How-
 ever, the judiciary's budgetary and administrative problems effectively denied expe-
 ditious trials for many defendants.
 Traditional court judges, absorbed into the magistrate court system, received
 some training to acquaint them with court procedure and the body of law they are
 now expected to administer.
 Many of the country's old repressive laws were superseded by the new Constitu-
 tion. The High Court overturned old laws that were in conflict with the Constitu-
 tion. In consultation with nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and par-
 liamentarians, the Law Commissioner addressed the ambiguities in the Constitution
 and proposed legislation on women to bring Malawi's laws into compliance with new
 constitutional standards.
 Juvenile offenders have special rights under the Constitution, including the right
 to be separated in custody from adults, to be treated in a manner that accounts for
 age and the possibility for rehabilitation, and to be exempted from the punishment
 of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Govern-
 ment authorities generally respected the constitutional right to privacy regarding
 person, family, home, and private communications. However, army and police forces,
 in carrying out sweeps for illegal weapons, did not obtain search warrants as re-
 quired by law. Postal authorities have apparently ceased their past practice of open-
 ing and inspecting private correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution superseded old laws re-
 stricting the press and now provides for freedoms of speech and press. The Govern-
 ment generally respected these rights in practice. The Government also generally
 tolerated the brad spectrum of political and ideological opinion presented in the
 country's two dozen newspapers. However, media representatives complained about
 government secrecy and periodic verbal threats against members of the press by
 government officials.
 Malawi has three radio stations. A small private station broadcasts only religious
 programming and is not permitted to broadcast news. In October the Government
 granted a license for a second private radio station. State-owned Malawi Broadcast-
 ing Corporation (MBC), which broadcasts on two channels, is the most important
 medium for reaching the public. MBC programming was dominated by reporting on
 the activities of senior government figures and official government positions. Parties
 and groups opposed to the Government largely were denied access to the broadcast
 media. MC refused to air paid public announcements of labor union events. The
 Government effectively blocked consideration of legislation to make MBC a more
 
 
 independent public broadcasting entity and continued to deny applications to estab-
 lish any more new private radio stations.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. Authorities -routinely granted official permits, which are required by law
 for large meetings. The Government requires organizations, including political par-
 ties, to register with  the Registrar General in the Ministry of Justice. Despite fre-
 quent lengthy delays, there were no reports of groups being denied registration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Religious groups must register with the
 Government. Missionaries experienced occasional difficulties in renewing employ-
 ment permits. While the Government announced a new policy and procedures on
 temporary employment permits, there were lengthy delays involved in securing re-
 newals of permits (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have freedom of movement and residence within the country,
 and the right to leave and return. Despite the lifting of restrictions on the move-
 ment of Asians, to date there has been little movement by Asians and other expatri-
 ates from cities and towns to rural areas.
 The Government cooperated with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in managing the refugee community. According to the
 UNHCR, Malawi hosted over 1,700 refugees, primarily from Somalia and the Great
 Lakes region, at the country's refugee center. Although the Government grants refu-
 gee status, it does not accept refugees for resettlement and does not permit them
 to work or study. Asylum applicants are granted hearings to make their case for
 refugee status. Although there were no reports of bona fide refugees seeking first
 asylum being turned away, NGO sources have expressed concern that some of those
 found not to be bona fide refugees-primarily Congolese-were rejected because of
 poor quality translation or ambiguous questions that trapped or misled otherwise
 qualifiled refugees. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 There was a sharp increase in the number of Rwandan and Congolese asylum
 seekers during December 1996 and the first quarter of the year. The Government
 is increasingly wary of those who travel long distances to seek asylum in Malawi.
 In February the Government decided that no further applications for asylum from
 Rwandans would be considered. The Government also invoked the principle of first
 country of asylum, as many of the Rwandans and Congolese either had requested
 asylum in another country or had the opportunity to do so. In August refugees at
 the center were told that they could choose to go home voluntarily or they would
 be required to demonstrate fear of persecution on an individual basis. Many reg-
 istered their willingness to repatriate. In August security personnel turned up at
 the center, and even though they did not interact with the refugees, approximately
 600 refugees fled, fearing forced repatriation. After- additional assurances that any
 repatriation would be voluntary, some refugees returned to the camp. By mid-Sep-
 tember 57 Rwandans had registered their willingness to repatriate, and a screening
 process had begun for those unwilling to repatriate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are generally able to exercise this constitutional right. Malawi has uni-
 versal suf     or citizens 18 years of age and older. There were allegations of vote
 buying and intimidation during by-elections.
 President Muluzi, Vice President Justin Malewezi, and a 25-member Cabinet ex-
 ercise executive authority. The Second Vice Presidency remains vacant following the
 resignation of Chakufwa Chihana and the collapse of the UDF-AFORD coalition.
 While the executive and the legislature were elected in free, democratic elections,
 the executive in fact exerted considerable influence over the legislature. In Novem-
 ber 1996, the Minister of Local Affairs reaffirmed the Government's commitment to
 the ongoing reorganization of local government structures, but the Government has
 taken no steps to date to organize local elections, raising the possibility of further
 postponement. In July the Minister of Local Government announced that, to hold
 down costs, local government elections would be postponed and would be held con-
 currently with the May 1999 presidential and parliamentary elections. Since that
 announcement, debate over representative local government has intensified among
 the Cabinet, opposition parties, NGO's, and the electoral commission. The commis-
 sion has questioned the postponement, arguing that there would be confusion if
 local and national elections were held simultaneously in 1999. Although the Govern-
 
 
 202
 
 ment does not prevent the operation of opposition political parties, the parties have
 alleged that the Government utilizes bribery and other inducements to encourage
 opposition party divisions and defections of key personnel to the UDF.
 There are no laws that restrict the participation of women or minorities in the
 political process. However, there are very few women in prominent government posi-
 tions. Only two ministers and two deputy ministers are women, and there are nine
 women in the National Assembly. The Parliamentary Women's Caucus has worked
 effectively with the Law Reform Commissioner on draft legislation to bring laws into
 compliance with constitutional guarantees protecting women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights groups operated without
 government restriction, training civic educators, advocating changes to existing laws
 and cultural practices, and investigating and publishing their findings on luman
 rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their
 views.
 The Ombudsman is mandated by the Constitution to investigate and take legal
 action against government officials responsible for human rights violations and
 other abuses. However, the Ombudsman's freedom of action was circumscribed by
 legislation that requires a warrant and a 3-day waiting period to gain access to cer-
 tain government records. The Constitution also provides for a National Compensa-
 tion Tribunal (NCT) to entertain claims of criminal and civil liability against the
 former government. As of August, the NCT estimated that it would need $35 million
 to cover the estimated 7,000 filed claims; to date, only 15 percent of these claims
 have been resolved. Other large sums were disbursed to settle non-NCT lawsuits
 against the Government for similar human rights violations. However, the promi-
 nence of many of the recipients raised concerns of favoritism. With two members
 named, the constitutionally mandated Human Rights Commission, also entrusted
 with monitoring and protecting against violations of constitutional rights, had bare-
 ly begun to function by year's end and awaits further legislation on membership and
 procedures.
 The Inspectorate of Prisons and local organizations monitor police behavior and
 prison conditions without government interference.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically provides for equal rights for women; forbids discrimi-
 nation based on language, culture, or religion; and generally provides every citizen
 the right to equality and recognition before the law. In practice the capacity of gov-
 ernment institutions to assure equal rights for all citizens is limited.
 Women.-Spousal abuse, especially wife beating, is common. Malawian society has
 begun to take problems of violence against women more seriously. The press pub-
 lished more frequent accounts of rape and abuse, and the judiciary imposed heavier
 penalties on those convicted of rape. However, domestic violence is not discussed
 openly by women, reportedly even among themselves, and there are no confidential
 shelters or facilities for treatment of women who suffer physical or sexual abuse.
 Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes.
 Under the new Constitution, women have the right to full and equal protection
 by law and may not be discriminated against on the basis of their sex or marital
 states. In practice, however, discrimination against women is pervasive, and women
 do not have opportunities equal to those available to men. Women have significantly
 lower levels of literacy, education, political representation, formal and nontradi-
 tional employment opportunities, and access to resources to increase agricultural
 productivity.
 Women, especially in rural areas, historically have been unable to complete even
 a primary education and are therefore at a serious disadvantage in the job market.
 In education, accepted economic and social practice hampers the ability of women
 andgirls to succeed. In the 15-45 age group, female literacy is less than 35 percent.
 Male literacy is about 45 percent. Girls drop out of school more frequently than
 boys, and in the last year of primary school, only about 25 percent of all students
 are girls. Despite recent significant gains in girls' education, large gaps remain be-
 tween girls' and boys' achievement. Still, there have been signs of improvement in
 education for girls. Girls are now entering first grade in the same proportion as
 boys, and 39 percent of the secondary school entrants are girls.
 Women often do not have equal access to legal and financial assistance, and wives
 are often victims of discriminatory inheritance practices in which the majority of the
 estate is taken unlawfully by the deceased husband's family. Women are usually at
 
 
 203
 a disadvantage in marriage, family, and property rights but have begun to speak
 out against abuse and discrimination. Female-headed households are disproportion-
 ately represented in the bottom quarter of income distribution. In a country where
 85 percent of the population is rural, 70 percent of the rural female population farm
 full-time. Typically, women work more hours than men to complete the same farm
 tasks because they rarely have the improved tools and equipment and remain re-
 sponsible for all household tasks. Women have limited access to agricultural exten-
 sion services, training, and credit. Some progress has been made in all of these
 areas with gender training for agricultural extension workers and the gradual intro-
 duction of rural credit schemes for women. The participation of women in the lim-
 itd formal labor market is particularly constrained. Women make up less than 5
 percent of the country's managerial and administrative cadres.
 Women face significant health challenges. Malawi has a high maternal mortality
 rate. AIDS is a major threat, and females in the 15 to 24 age bracket are six times
 more likely to be H   t positive than men.
 The Law Reform Commissioner has undertaken a review of legislation that dis-
 criminates against women and has proposed legislation to bring the law into compli-
 ance with new constitutional standards. In November Parliament passed an affili-
 ation bill that raised the minimum level of child support.
 The Government addresses women's concerns tugh the Ministry of Women,
 Youth, and Community ervices. The National Commission on Women in Develop-
 ment coordinates government and NGO activities. The inaugural meeting of the
 Gender Initiative Network (GIN) was held in March. The GIN attempts to bring to-
 gether the largely urban women' hs r s activists and the overwhelming rural ma-
 jority to discuss common interests.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for equal treatment of children under the
 law, and the Government greatly increased spending on children's health and wel-
 fare. The Government established free primary education for all children in 1994,
 although education is not compulsory. Well over half of the country's children live
 in poverty, mostly in rural areas. Children in rural, female-headed households are
 among the poorest. A few charitable organizations attempted to reduce the number
 of child beggar in urban areas and find alternative care for them. The problem of
 street children worsened as the number of orphans whose parents died from HV/
 AIDS increased. In 1995 there were an estimated 140,000 children who had lost
 their mother to AIDS, and this is expected to increase to 300,000 by 2000.
 Only a third of children are within relatively close access to safe drinking water.
 The infant mortality rate is high. Child malnutrition is a serious problem.
 There tre societal patterns of abuse of children. A few small ethnic groups prac-
 tice female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and paychological health. The media
 have also begun to report on the sexual abuse of children, especially in relation to
 traditional practices of initiation. While rites to initiate girls into their future adult
 roles are still shrouded in secrecy, emerging data suggest that abusive practices are
 widesprea  ad more damaging than previously believed. Also the belief that chil-
 dren ae unlikely rto be HIV positive contributes toathe sexual abuse of minors. Na-
 tional data on AIDS cases show that adolescent girls are three to four times more
 likely than adolescent boys to be HIV positive or to suffer from AIDS.
 In November Parliament passed an affiliation bill, which raised the minimum
 level of child sup port.
 People With Disabilities.-he Government has not mandated accessibility to
 buildings and services for the disabled, but one of the national goals listed in the
 new Constitution is to support the disabled through greater access to public places,
 fair opportunities in employment, and full partiveon in all spheres of society. The
 Ministry of Education has expressed interest in beginning special education pro-
 grams, but anding to implement them is uncertain. Special schools and training
 centers, which assist individuals with disabilities, and several self-supprting busi-
 nesses run by and for the disabled have existed for some time.
 Nautonal/RacialEthnic Minorities.-Malawians of African heritage are members
 of indigenous tribes and are not discriminated against by government or society.
 Former restrictions on where Asians could live and work are now unconstitutional.
 (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government considered various proposals on temporary employment permits
 for expatriates but has yet to clarify its policy and procedures. The Government's
 decision not to automatically renew the permits caused concern and sometimes
 hardship to businessmen, teachers, health workers, and missionaries. Business resi-
 dence permits are readily granted to new investors.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although signed into law in May 1996, the Labor
 Relations Act did not enter into force because the Ministry failed to publish a notice
 establishing the date the legislation was to take effect. Thus, labor issues continue
 to be covered by the old legislation. Workers have the legal right to form and join
 trade unions, but unions must register with the Ministry of Labor and Manpower
 Development (MOLMD). Unionization is on the rise, but resistance on the part of
 many employers remained. Army personnel and police may not belong to trade
 unions, but other civil servants are allowed to form unions. There were 13 reg-
 istered trade unions. Given the low percentage of the work force in the formal sector
 (about 12 percent), plus the lack of awareness of worker rights and union benefits,
 only a minuscule percentage of the work force are union members. Unions are inde-
 pendent of the Government, parties, and other political forces. Although there are
 no restrictions on the number of union federations, Malawi has only one, the Malawi
 Congress of Trade Unions (MCTU). All unions are affiliated with it. According to
 the MOLMD, there are no unusually difficult registration procedures that would
 prevent a trade union from registering.
 Members of registered unions in "essential services" have the right to strike after
 having carried out prescribed procedures. Essential services are nowhere specified;
 they are determined by the Minister of Labor. The Trade Union Act requires that
 labor disputes in essential services be reported in writing to the Minister of Labor,
 who then attempts to negotiate a settlement. He may refer the case to a tribunal
 within 28 days of receiving the dispute report if it is not possible to reconcile the
 parties. The law implies that if a trade dispute has gone through this process, and
 if it has not been resolved or referred to a tribunal, workers in essential services
 may strike. There were several strikes, especially in the public sector, with no clear
 agreement on which ones were legal. As the Trade Union Act requires that unions
 must approve strikes by secret ballot, all the strikes may have been illegal.
 In April the Government intimidated civil servant strikers by, among other
 things, dispersing them with tear gas and police dogs, prohibiting them from assem-
 bling peacefully outside their places of work, arresting activists on dubious grounds,
 and suspending or transferring strike leaders in an effort to break the union. The
 civil servants returned to work without resolving any of the outstanding issues.
 Through the end of the year, the Government and union continued to talk sporadi-
 cally.
 Laws do not specifically prohibit retaliation against strikers. There is no prohibi-
 tion on actions against unions that are not legally registered. Arbitration rulings are
 Unosmay form or ,join federations and affiliate with international organizations
 with government permission.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize. The right to bargain collectively, although practiced, is only implied and not
 expressly protected by law.
 The Ministry of Lbor sets minimum wage rates based on recommendations of the
 Tripartite Wages Advisory Board.
 The law proibits antiunion discrimination by employers, but there are no effec-
 tive mechanisms for resolving complaints, and there is no legal requirement that
 employers reinstate workers dismissed because of union activities.
 InAugust 1995, Parliament approved legislation to establish export processing
 zones (EPZ's); six were operational by year's end. The full range of labor legislation
 applies to the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Coploy Labor.-The Government does not specifi-
 cally prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but there were no reports that
 it occurred outside the agcultural sector (see Section 6.d.). The new Constitution
 prohibits forced labor, and such labor is generally not employed.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Ag  or Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but there
 are no reports that it occurred outside the agricultural sector. The Constitution de-
 fines children as those under the age of 16 years and prohibits the employment of
 children in work that is hazardous, harmfful, industrial, or interferes with their edu-
 cation. However, while primary education is now free and universal, it is not com-
 pulsory. Less than 20 percent of children finish primary school, which runs from age
 6 to age 13. Enforcement by police and labor inspectors in the MOLMD is not effec-
 tive because of budgetary constraints. There is significant child labor on tobacco and
 tea estates, subsistence farms, and in domestic service. There is no special legal re-
 striction on children's daytime work hours.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are two legislated minimum wage rates.
 The urban minimum wage is roughly $0.68 (MK     .85) per day, including $0.05 for
 
 
 205
 rent; in all other areas it is roughly $0.49 (MK8.50) per day, including $0.05 for
 rent. These wages are insufficient to support a worker and family. Moreover, the
 MOLMD is unable effectively to enforce the minimum wage. The prescribed mini-
 mum wages are largely irrelevant for the great majority of citizens who earn their
 livelihood outside the formal wage sector. Wage earners tend to supplement their
 incomes through farming activities carried out through the extended family net-
 work.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours, with a mandatory weekly 24-hour rest
 period. The laws require payment for overtime work and prohibit excessive compul-
 sozy overtime. However, labor inspections are more the exception than the rule, and
 the statutory restrictions are frequently violated.
 The Workers' Compensation Act includes extensive occupational health and safety
 standards. Enforcement of these standards by the MOLMD is erratic, and workers-
 particularly in industrial jobs-often work without basic safety clothing and equip-
 ment. MOM officials say that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment. However,
 given the low level of education of most workers and the high level of unemploy-
 ment, they are unlikely to exercise this right. Workers dismissed for filing com-
 plaints about workplace conditions can theoretically file a complaint with the near-
 est labor office or sue the employer for wrongful dismissal.
