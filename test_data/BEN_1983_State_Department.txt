 BENIN
 Benin obtained its independence from France in 1960 but ex-
 perienced numerous changes in its leadership until 1972 when
 the present Marxist-Leninist government under President Mathieu
 Kerekou took control. The sole political party, the People's
 Revolutionary Party of Benin, is highly centralized, selects
 all candidates for the National Assembly and local government
 bodies, and is similar in theory to that of the Soviet and other
 ruling Communist parties. Although rights are guaranteed on
 paper, in practice no organized political opposition is permitted
 and the press, radio, and television are government run.
 In 1977, an unsuccessful attempt by mercenaries to overthrow
 the Kerekou government initiated a period of intense suspicion
 of foreign intervention. Precise information on human rights
 violations is difficult to obtain in a closed political system
 such as Benin's. The Government continues to hold a number of
 political prisoners--according to Amnesty International about
 50--and rumors of releases have been largely unconfirmed. Some
 of these arrests date back to the early days of the Kerekou
 government while others are students arrested in 1979 and 1981.
 Beninese must exercise caution in becoming involved in any
 activity that could be considered critical or threatening to
 the Government, but during the past year the openness of the
 Government to divergent and more moderate views appears to
 have increased.
 Benin is one of the world's poorest countries; its economy is
 sorely underdeveloped. Its population continues to depend
 primarily on agriculture and small trade for its livelihood,
 although several state-owned corporations have recently been
 formed and are beginning to have an impact on the economy.
 Among these, the offshore oil development project is particu-
 larly'noteworthy. Benin began to export oil in small quantities
 during 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reported cases of unlawful or arbitrary deprivation
 of life for political or related motives in Benin during 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 No reports of disappearances or secret arrests have been received
 in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports in 1983 specifically noting torture
 or beatings. Prison conditions in Benin are very poorl
 
 
 sanitation facilities are inadequate; there is overcrowding;
 and food supply is inadequate unless subsidized by friends
 or relatives outside. Physical punishment undoubtedly occurs
 although specific details are scanty. There is no evidence
 of discrimination against prisoners on the basis of sex,
 religion, or national origin.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Benin's legal system does not guarantee habeas corpus or bar
 arbitrary arrests. Periods of incarceration are at the
 discretion of the authorities. In the past, many arrests have
 occurred during periods of high political tension; several
 prisoners arrested in 1979 and 1981 are still in jail. Others
 fled the country at the time and continue to remain abroad, in
 effect as exiles. There have been no reports of arbitrary
 arrests resulting in imprisonment since 1981. Amnesty Interna-
 tional's 1983 report notes concern over several detainees held
 without trial for extended periods; it cites three prisoners in
 jail since 1976.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary does not operate as an independent branch of
 the Government. Depending upon the sensitivity of the case,
 defendants may or may not be permitted legal counsel. There
 is no time limit on charging a defendant or on bringing a
 person to trial. In recent years, the Government has used
 only the established civilian "revolutionary court" system.
 Courts are organized on provincial and national levels, and
 they are planned for the district level when sufficient judges
 have been trained. The highest court of appeal is the Central
 People's Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Constitution provides for safeguarding the
 inviolability of the home and calls for warrants to be obtained
 from a judge before the police can enter a residence, there have
 been occasional unconfirmed reports of forced entries in sensi-
 tive political cases. Other reports indicate that security
 police monitor phones and the mail going to or from suspected
 persons, but no cases of mail or phone tampering have been
 confirmed. There are no known other types of interference with
 the home or family. While party membership is in principle
 required of all Beninese citizens, it is not known if the
 requirement is strictly enforced.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The local press, radio and television are all government
 controlled and operated. There are no independent media in
 Benin, and there is only one newspaper. The media carries
 
 
 only those stories that are approved by or serve the
 interests of the party-state. Opposition to government
 policies and open criticism of the Government are not
 tolerated. Academic freedom on nonpolitical issues,
 however, is permitted, and there normally is no censorship
 of foreign books and artistic works. Broadcasts by the
 Voice of America, BBC, French Radio, Voice of Moscow,
 and many other sources are readily available to much of
 the population through short wave radio. No attempt is
 made to interfere with reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 With the exception of political gatherings, public meetings are
 allowed. All political meetings, however, must be sponsored
 by the single party. Labor unions are organs of the party
 and government unified under a general organization umbrella.
 Although controlled by the Government, individual local unions
 negotiate with individual employers and represent their fellow
 workers" grievances, so that the Government may often have to
 play the role of arbiter. There is no known persecution of
 professional groups. Groups maintain international affiliations.
 The right to strike is not guaranteed under the 1977 Constitution.
 Although this right is not explicitly denied, it is clear that
 labor strikes are not sanctioned. This interpretation is sup-
 ported by specific laws subsequently adopted by the National
 Assembly. The Constitution states that *union activities are
 guaranteed to workers" but it says they "must be used for the
 elevation of the conscience of the proletarian class and for
 the augmentation and continued development of production."
 While labor actions occasionally occur in Benin, most (usually
 by students rather than workers) take the form of brief work
 stoppages to protest such things as late salary or scholarship
 payments.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist
 in Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 any special status or benefit. With the exception of one
 group, Celestial Christianity, which has been declared illegal
 by the Government, there are no restrictions on religious
 ceremonies or teachings, and religious conversion is freely
 permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. International movement is
 controlled to the degree that a passport and exit permission must
 be obtained for travel to other than West African countries, but
 obtaining them presents no unusual problems. Economic rather
 
 
 36
 than governmental constraints usually preclude travel outside the
 region. There are no restrictions placed on residence within
 Benin, except for recently released prisoners who may be subject
 to travel restrictions.
 Emigration is a way of life; many Beninese go to neighboring
 countries to earn their livelihood. Citizenship is not re-
 voked. Beninese abroad are encouraged to return home to help
 develop their country, although only a small number have re-
 turned. In 1983, there were many more refugees in Benin than
 usual. Ghanaians from Nigeria transited Benin and were given
 assistance within the capacity of the Beninese Government.
 About 200 Chadian refugees who came to Benin during the past
 several years are now more or less permanently settled although
 they are free to return to Chad, according to Beninese law.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 All political activity takes place within the context of the
 one-party system and there is little real political choice.
 On the local level, mass rallies select candidates for the party
 slate, and no opposition to this slate is permitted. The party
 controls the entire electoral process, and even local party-
 endorsed officials are under the authority of government-
 appointed district officers.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers any attempt to investigate human
 rights practices an interference in its internal affairs.
 Amnesty International has appealed to the Government for the
 release of various persons detained without charge or trial.
 Amnesty International's 1983 report cited the continued long-
 term detention without trial of political prisoners, unfair
 trial practices, and ill-treatment of prisoners as its major
 concerns. The Government occasionally denounces human rights
 abuses in other areas of the world, e.g., the Middle East and
 Grenada. There are no organizations in Benin which attempt to
 protect individual liberties. Freedom House in 1983 rated Benin
 "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Benin is ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world with
 an estimated annual per capita income of $326 in 1983. Despite
 that fact, it enjoys a relatively good climate for agriculture,
 and there is little starvation. A 1977 estimate showed calorie
 supply as a percentage of requirements at 99.52 percent. More
 than 80 percent of Benin's 3,792,000 (1983 estimate) people live
 in rural areas and are engaged in agricultural production
 (primarily subsistence), but there is a recent trend toward
 increasing urbanization. The 1983 estimated growth rate is 3.10
 percent. Although in 1979 an estimated 65 percent of the popu-
 
 
 37
 lation were below the absolute poverty level, these statistics
 are unreliable since much of the country's income derives from
 informal trade with neighboring countries which is not reported
 and is not reflected in official government figures. Benin's
 population is composed of more than 40 ethnic groups which, in
 the precolonial era, were separate principalities and often at
 war with each other. There is also a wide range of religious
 faiths.
 Historically, Benin has accorded women a major role in the
 commercial sector. In the Government, a number of women figure
 prominently in the upper ranks. While there are no women in
 ministerial positions, there are five in executive level positions
 in the Presidency, 26 in various ministries with the rank of
 bureau director or above, one judge, and four (out of a total of
 29) on the permanent committee of the National Revolutionary
 Assembly. No precise figures are available on women in the party
 structure, but it is known that several hold senior positions.
 Since the present Government came to power in 1972, a serious
 effort to promote economic development and distribute the
 country's wealth more equitably has begun. As a part of this
 program, state-owned industries in cotton, sugar, and cement have
 been established and are being developed in the rural areas. oil
 has also been discovered offshore near Cotonou, and more than
 one million barrels were exported during 1983.
 The development effort also addresses health and education
 problems in the country. There is free or nominally priced
 medical care in Benin, and a system of old-age benefits has
 been established. Clinics have been set up throughout the
 country, many with assistance from foreign governments. In
 1980, life expectancy at birth' was estimated at 47.01 years,
 and the infant mortality rate in 1983 was put at 147.01 per
 1,000 live births. Twenty-one percent of the total population
 had access to safe water in 1979, with 52 percent in the urban
 areas and 16 percent in rural areas.
 An active literacy program is in operation in Benin, and 24.80
 percent of the total population were considered literate in
 1980. No breakdown between men and women is available. Primary
 school enrollment in 1979 stood at 60 percent, with a breakdown
 of 78 percent male and 42 percent female.
