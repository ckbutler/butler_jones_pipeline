 NIGERIA
 On October 1, 1979 Nigeria inaugurated its first civilian
 government in 13 years. During the period from 1966-1979
 several coups and a civil war occurred, but General Murtala
 Muhammed and his successor Lt. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, made
 clear their intentions to return Nigeria to civilian rule
 and adhered to a schedule to meet this goal.
 On September 21, 1978, a 12-year state of emergency and ban
 on political activity were lifted. National elections were
 held during July-August 1979 for a President and members of
 a National Assembly, and for state governors and legislators.
 In general, the elections were free and fair, and all
 persons over 18 were encouraged to register and vote. The
 Federal Electoral Commission declared Alhaji Shehu Shagari
 the victor in the Presidential election, but one of his
 opponents appealed the decision to the election tribunal and
 the Supreme Court, in accordance with established rules. The
 decision was ultimately upheld, and Shagari was peacefully
 inaugurated as scheduled.
 Chapter IV of the new Nigerian constitution, which was
 promulgated on October 1, 1979 contains broad human rights
 guarantees. Chapter III of the 1963 Constitution, in force
 until October 1, also contained broad human rights guaran-
 tees, which were generally observed by the Federal Military
 Government (FMG).
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not condoned. However,
 reports have been received indicating that persons suspect-
 ed of crimes are sometimes beaten for the purpose of
 extracting confessions.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 condoned. Nigerian prisons lack many modern facilities and
 there are a few reports that some prisoners have been
 mistreated. The government is now in the process of
 contracting with an American company to build 34 modern
 prison facilities. There are no summary executions and the
 Department of State has no knowledge that the International
 Committee for the Red Cross has ever been denied access to
 detainees.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although not common practice, there have been instances
 of arbitrary arrest when the government believed an emer-
 gency or a threat to internal security existed. The right
 of habeas corpus exists and has been honored since the end
 of the state of emergency in late 1978. In February, 1979,
 the FMG issued a decree that gave the Inspector General of
 Police special powers to detain individuals for indefinite
 
 
 143
 periods for acts "prejudicial to public security." The
 decree, issued to give officials authority to quell any
 disturbances or threats to internal stability during the
 election process, was rescinded on September 30, 1979. On
 occasion the FMG has acted rapidly to detain people
 involved in activities that might have led to political
 violence. Normally they have been released once the
 immediate threat of violence passed. The Department of
 State has no knowledge of any political prisoners currently
 being held clandestinely in Nigeria.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm, and the ordinary
 Nigerian receives justice from the courts under both
 traditional and statutory law. The Public Officers
 (Special Provisions) Decree of March 2, 1976, denies'
 dismissed public officials the right to seek redress in
 court.
 Both the new and the old constitutions provide that
 an accused individual is entitled to a fair public trial
 unless government officials can satisfy the court that it
 would not be in the public interest for the matters at hand
 to be publicly discussed. Prisoners must be advised of the
 charges against them, have access to legal counsel, be
 informed of the evidence on which charges are based, and be
 given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of a
 defense. These rights seem to be honored in practice and
 the Department of State is not aware of any incidents of
 harassment of defense counsel by the government. The
 judiciary is independent of military or executive control,
 and individuals have the right of redress to a high court.
 The Department of State is not aware of any civilians being
 tried by military courts, nor is it aware of any special
 courts to deal with political or security matters.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The right to be free from invasion of the home has
 been protected by FMG policy and is guaranteed in the
 new constitution. Judicial warrants are required
 before a home can be entered. The Department of State
 is not aware of any violations of this right.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Nigeria has a mixed economy with some government ownership
 but with ownership of most businesses in private hands.
 The government has introduced programs designed to fulfill
 basic needs for food, shelter, improved health care, and
 education. The new government has announced that the de-
 velopment of agriculture will be a top priority. There are
 extremes in the distribution of income and wealth, with most
 of the resources concentrated in the hands of a small minori-
 ty. Nigeria has a progressive tax structure. A primary goal
 of the 1975-80 development plan and the current annual budget
 is to accelerate economic growth and improve the living
 conditions of the poor. One feature of the development
 
 
 144
 plan is to provide free primary and secondary education to
 all Nigerian children. The success of the Universal Primary
 Education program has been limited by the unavailability of
 census data and the shortage of schools and trained teachers.
 Nigeria's literacy rate is estimated to be about 25 percent.
 The Land Use Decree No. 6 of 1978 provides that land
 in Nigeria cannot be owned by private individuals, but
 is instead held in trust by the governors of the various
 states. Customary right of occupancy is granted rent-free
 by the local governments when the land is used for agricul-
 tural purposes. Rent is charged for statutory occupancy,
 but fees can be waived or reduced if a state governor
 determines that it would be in the public interest to do
 so. Adequate shelter continues to be a problem. Health
 care is generally available, but is limited by the lack of
 trained personnel and adequate medical facilities. The
 extension of health care is one of the goals of the 1975-80
 development plan.
 Private and public resources are diverted from needed
 development projects because of corruption which remains an
 endemic social and political problem. The government,
 however, has condemned and taken legal action to discourage
 corruption.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 In February, 1979, the FMG published Public Order Decree
 No. 5 which prevents assemblies that threaten public order
 and requires potential assemblies to obtain a license from
 the state military administrator. The new constitution
 prohibits membership in secret societies.
 Censorship of the press has been minimal and infrequent;
 the government banned one periodical in 1978, allegedly for
 exacerbating tribal and religious tensions. In December,
 1978, the FMG enacted the Nigerian Press Council Decree No.
 31 which establishes a code of conduct for journalists,
 provides for their registration, and imposes penalties on
 those who do not follow the decree's code of conduct. The
 FMG occasionally suspended or called in for questioning
 journalists who published stories or cartoons on political
 developments which the government found inaccurate or
 inopportune. All TV and radio broadcast organizations are
 wholly owned by the government, and the new constitution
 proscribes the ownership of TV and radio stations by
 private individuals unless authorized by the President.
 In addition to federal and state government newspapers,
 there are a number of privately owned dailies, weeklies and
 magazines.
 All of the media are frequently critical of the federal
 and state government policies. The government is attentive
 to such criticism and public reaction to it. Journalists
 
 
 145
 were sometimes detained by FMG for short periods of
 time, b5t the Department of State is not aware of
 any currently under detention.
 Both the old and new constitutions provide for freedom
 of speech, press, religion and assembly. Nigerians are
 free to practice the religion of their choice and no
 religious groups are discriminated against.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration.
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are respected.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 During the July-August 1979 elections, all citizens
 18 years of age and older were allowed and encouraged
 to vote. The ban on political activity had been lifted in
 September, 1978. Shortly thereafter the Federal Elector-
 al Commission granted political party status to five of
 the 52 political associations that subsequently sprang
 up on the basis of their being able to prove they had
 organizations in at least 13 of the 19 states. In contest-
 ing the elections all five parties functioned freely, had
 access to the media and conducted public meetings. The
 performance of the five parties during the elections stood
 in marked contrast to the elections during the early 1960's
 under the First Republic, when politicians used coercion
 and thuggery.
 Women in Nigeria are entitled to all rights guaranteed
 under the Nigerian constitution and can challenge anyone
 who attempts to interfere with the exercise of those
 rights. Under statutory and customary law as well as
 custom, there are many areas in which they do not enjoy the
 status and conditions of men. An unmarried woman, who is
 21 or above, has the legal capacity to sue and be sued, to
 buy and sell property, to engage in business or a profession
 and to choose her own residence. However, married women
 cannot control their own property, cannot enter into loan
 or purchase agreements and cannot obtain a passport or
 travel outside the country without their husbands' consent.
 Further examples of discrimination against women
 include an absence under customary law of rights to
 husbands' property or income, apart from the right of
 support, and limitations on the right of divorced women
 to remarry. There is no law against a married woman's
 working, but, except in government service, there is no
 guarantee of equal pay for equal work. Traditional
 education for women is limited to homemaking skills.
 Women make up only a small portion of the top levels of
 the business, government and academic communities,
 although their roles in these areas have grown over the
 years. The federal and state governments and women's
 groups, such as the National Council of Women, are
 actively working on women's problems and rights.
 Several of the candidates in the recent elections were
 
 
 146
 women, and there were more registered women than men
 voters. One woman has been appointed a minister, and
 another a deputy minister; three women were elected to
 the National Assembly.
 There are 42 industrial unions and one labor federa-
 tion, the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC), to which all
 the unions belong. The NLC was founded on March 1,
 1978 and has a membership of more than three million.
 During the past year the NLC and the industrial unions
 have been more preoccupied with establishing branches
 at the state level than dealing with workers' issues.
 However, in May, 1979, the NLC began to flex its muscles
 and issued an ultimatum to the FMG demanding, inter alia,
 a lifting of the wage freeze within 21 days. Unions, with
 the exception of those involved in "essential services"
 such as port operations and transport, have the right to
 organize, bargain collectively and strike.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is not aware of any recent request
 by an international or non-governmental institution to
 investigate human rights conditions in Nigeria. The
 Nigerians have maintained a high interest in human rights
 violations throughout Africa and have been willing to
 consider violations in other countries. Nigeria supported
 human rights issues which arose during the 1979 OAU and NAM
 meetings and the Nigerian Bar Association created a Human
 Rights Committee to monitor the newly elected civilian govern-
 ment's implementation of human rights provisions in the con-
 stitution.
