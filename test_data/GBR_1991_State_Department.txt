 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK)
 is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary
 form of government elected in periodic, multiparty elections.
 As there is no written constitution, human rights are
 "residual," i.e., assumed unless limited by statute.
 Throughout the UK, public order is maintained by civilian
 police forces responsive to and controlled by elected officials.
 Because of terrorist violence, the Royal Ulster Constabulary
 (RUC) in Northern Ireland is supported by army units.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy.
 Persons may own property and pursue private economic interests.
 The Government provides comprehensive social welfare services.
 Terrorist bombings and killings carried out by the illegal
 Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and other "republican"
 (Catholic) and "loyalist" (Protestant) terrorist groups in
 Northern Ireland and Britain are the greatest threat to public
 order and security in the UK.
 The tensions and long-held grievances between the two
 communities in Northern Ireland have caused some persons,
 Catholic and Protestant, to be denied equality of rights and
 opportunities despite government efforts to redress these
 grievances. After British courts held in three separate cases
 that convictions of alleged terrorists in past years were based
 on false evidence and coerced confessions, the Government
 appointed a Royal Commission to review the criminal justice
 system in England and Wales and announced that consideration
 would be given to applying to Northern Ireland any resulting
 recommendations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings by the Government. However,
 questions about instances of extrajudicial killing continued to
 be raised. In Northern Ireland, 94 persons were killed in
 incidents related to terrorism, 6 of whom were killed by
 security forces in 1991. In September a 19-year-old student
 was shot and killed during a security incident by an RUC
 officer. The RUC in effect acknowledged its error when it
 stated that the student was not involved in terrorist activity.
 The incident is being investigated, and no results had been
 announced by year's end. Human rights groups and other
 commentators contend that an in-house RUC investigation will
 not be impartial.
 Deaths as-a result of shootings by security forces in Northern
 Ireland continue to prompt allegations that soldiers resort to
 "leth&l force" precipitately. Such shootings have prompted
 allegations that soldiers were carrying out a "shoot to kill"
 policy, which the Government denies. The soldiers involved in
 * A separate report on Hong Kong, a dependent territory of the
 United Kingdom, follows this report on the United Kingdom.
 
 
 1293
 
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 such incidents have argued that they were in "imminent danger"
 before opening fire. The courts have accepted the army's
 defense, and there have been very few convictions of soldiers.
 The Government states that members of the armed services are
 required at all times to operate within the law.
 Critics have argued that instructions to police concerning the
 use of lethal force are inadequate. Current law requires use
 of lethal force to be "reasonable in the circumstances." This
 is in contrast to the European Convention on Human Rights,
 which allows the use of lethal force only when "absolutely
 necessary" in specific circumstances.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continued the use of
 plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) for riot
 control; there were no fatalities from PBR's in 1991.
 The PIRA continued to carry out killings in Northern Ireland,
 Great Britain, and continental Europe. "Human bomb" attacks
 continued against security forces' targets in Northern Ireland,
 during which several private citizens were forced to drive
 vehicles loaded with explosives to security forces' checkpoints
 while PIRA gunmen held family members hostage.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances caused by government forces.
 There continued to be instances of persons abducted or held
 hostage by terrorists in Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment of prisoners and provide penalties for
 violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by such methods
 are not admissible as evidence in court. A new code of
 practices that came into force in 1991 brought about greater
 standardization of police interrogation procedures and
 strengthened oversight requirements. Human rights groups
 criticized treatment of accused terrorists in custody in
 Northern Ireland, charging that they were subject to
 psychological and physical abuse and urging, for example, the
 videotaping of interrogations to prevent abuses.
 Human rights groups continued to criticize conditions in some
 British prisons. The Government outlined a long-term program
 to improve overall prison conditions, particularly shortcomings
 in sanitation facilities and recreational opportunities, based
 in part on findings by a government inquiry into prison violence
 and on extensive recommendations for penal reform.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In instances when reasonable cause to suspect criminal guilt
 exists, police may make arrests without warrants. Those
 arrested without warrant must be released on bail within 36
 hours unless brought before a magistrate's court. The court may
 authorize an additional 60 hours of detention before charges
 must be brought. Generally, persons charged with nonserious
 offenses may be released on bail. In cases such as crimes of
 violence, however, magistrates have remanded persons for periods
 of up to 18 months before trial.
 
 
 1294
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Reacting to the violence in Northern Ireland, the Government
 adopted the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1991
 (the first version was enacted in 1978) which is applicable only
 to Northern Ireland; and the Prevdntion of Terrorism (Temporary
 Provisions) Act of 1989 (first enacted in 1974), almost all of
 which is applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Both acts
 must be renewed annually by Parliament.
 Under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, police
 and military personnel, in dealing with cases of suspected
 terrorism, may enter and search without warrants, and members
 of the armed forces on duty may arrest without a warrant, any
 person suspected of having committed or being about to commit
 any offense. Such persons may be held for up to 4 hours, after
 which they must be transferred to police custody or released.
 The 1991 Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act introduced
 the new offenses of directing a terrorist organization and
 possessing items intended for terrorist purposes and gave
 authorities new powers to examine financial and other documents
 found in terrorist-related searches. The 1989 Prevention of
 Terrorism Act allows the police to arrest, without warrant,
 persons anywhere in the UK whom they reasonably suspect to be
 involved in terrorism. Such persons may be detained for up to
 48 hours without legal representation or judicial review.
 Judicial review may be delayed up to a further 5 days on the
 authority of the Home Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is provided for by law and observed in practice. An
 indigent defendant has the right to counsel of his choosing.
 All criminal proceedings must be conducted in public, with the
 exception of juvenile court cases and cases involving public
 decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act,
 the court may be closed at the judge's discretion, but the
 sentence must be passed in public. The UK has a multitier
 court system with magistrate's, county, high, and appellate
 courts. In some cases, appeals may be brought before the House
 of Lords.
 In March the "Birmingham Six" were freed when the Court of
 Appeal quashed their convictions for terrorist bombings in
 1975. The Court had received evidence that cast doubt on the
 reliability of evidence in the case and supported the
 prisoners' claim they had been intimidated into making
 confessions. In a related case, the convictions of the
 "Maguire Seven," who had already completed prison sentences on
 possession of explosives charges, were quashed in June.
 These two cases--plus the 1989 overturning of the "Guildford
 Four's" conviction on terrorist bombing charges--were an
 impetus for the Government's decision in March to appoint a
 Royal Commission to review all aspects of the criminal justice
 process in. England and Wales. The Government indicated it
 would consider whether changes implemented as a result of the
 Commission's findings might also be applied in Northern
 Ireland.
 The independent Police Complaints Authority is supervising
 police investigations into arrests made by the West Midlands
 Serious Crime Squad, which handled the "Birmingham Six" case.
 Although the Squad had been disbanded in 1989 after reports
 that its members had intimidated suspects and fabricated
 evidence, four officers were charged with perjury and conspiracy
 
 
 1295
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 to subvert the cause of justice, and recommendations for
 prosecutions in other cases are being considered.
 The right to trial by jury has been suspended for certain
 terrorist- related offenses in Northern Ireland because of
 intimidation of the judiciary, jurors, and solicitors. In such
 cases, a "Diplock Court," in which a single judge presides over
 a trial without a jury, is used. Although human rights groups,
 attorneys, and others have criticized these courts, the
 conviction rate of those who plead not guilty in Diplock Courts
 is virtually identical to the rate in regular courts.
 Under a 1988 change of law, a court may draw whatever inference
 it deems proper, including an inference of guilt, if a subject
 remains silent during questioning. This was to deal with the
 "wall of silence" and "ambush testimony," whereby a suspect
 does not speak until his trial and then presents a surprise
 alibi. The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights
 continues to have reservations about the impact the law could
 have on the public's sense of confidence in thesystem of
 justice, but the law itself has not actually been invoked in a
 case since its inception.
 Persons under the age of 18 convicted of murder may be subjected
 to indeterminate detention. In Northern Ireland, where public
 attention has focused on this issue, 17 persons were serving
 indeterminate sentences at the end of 1991 for murders
 committed while they were under the age of 18.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is generally well respected in both law and
 custom. Warrants are normally required for a police search of
 private premises. However, under the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1991, on-duty members of the
 armed forces or any constable may enter-any premises or other
 place if he or she considers it necessary to preserve peace or
 maintain order. The Act requires a standard of "reasonable
 grounds of suspicion" before a dwelling may be entered without
 a warrant.
 In the Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust
 of the Government has deep historical roots, many believe that
 the conduct of some members of the security forces in carrying
 out security checks constitutes unwarranted harassment'and
 intimidation. The Government conductsintensive training of
 security personnel in proper procedures but acknowledges that
 official guidelines are sometimes violated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Strongly held tradition, an independent press, and a democratic
 political system combine to secure freedom of speech and press.
 Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented.
 The Government continued to restrict broadcasts of live or
 recorded statements made by representatives of the PIRA or other
 terrorist organizations or of Sinn Fein, the legal political
 arm of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or by others who express
 views that "solicit, support, or invite support for such
 organizations." There are no restrictions on reporting their
 words, and exceptions are made for coverage of elections and
 
 
 1296
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 parliamentary proceedings. The final appeal in a case brought
 by the National Union of Journalists that challenged the
 measures as an infringement on the right of free speech and
 press was rejected by the House of Lords in early 1991.
 In 1991 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the UK
 Government was wrong to prevent newspapers from publishing
 excerpts from the memoirs of a retired British Security Service
 official after the book became available abroad. The Court
 also ruled that the Government's original injunctions to stop
 publication were justified on national security grounds before
 the book appeared in the United States.
 b, Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not exercise
 their statutory right to limit the freedom of public assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1991 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically
 listed in the statutes. The lists do not include political
 parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 worship, although the Government provides funds for the schools
 of the established churches in England and Scotland but not for
 those of other religions and denominations. In Northern
 Ireland, the Government also funds denominational schools if a
 sufficient demand for them exists.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination by public authorities on the basis of
 religious belief or political opinion (see Section 5 concerning
 the Fair Employment Act). There is no similar law in Great
 Britain. There are no religious bars to holding public office.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 UK citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and in
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. The Home
 Secretary, however, may exclude from mainland Britain anyone
 connected with terrorism in Northern Ireland unless that person
 was born in Great Britain or has been resident there for 3
 years. Similar authority is granted to the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland to exclude persons not native to or
 resident in that province. In ordering exclusion, the
 Secretary of State must only be "satisfied" that a person is or
 has been involved in the commission, preparation, or
 instigation of acts of terrorism. Currently 102 persons are
 subject to such exclusion orders. Human rights groups have
 objected to such orders because the evidence used is not tested
 in any court.
 Immigration rules require that all requests for asylum be
 considered by the Home Office in accordance with the 1951
 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The Government
 admitted in 1991 that some requests for asylum from Turkish
 Kurds were incorrectly denied by immigration officers in 1990
 and has taken action, including staff training, to prevent
 
 
 1297
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 future recurrences. In November the Court of Appeals found the
 Home Secretary in contempt of court for failing to halt the
 deportation of a Zairian asylum seeker despite the existence of
 a "judicial undertaking" (i.e., a court order) that he not be
 removed from the country. Legislation was introduced in 1991
 to reduce misuse of asylum procedures by persons who have no
 legitimate claim to refugee status. Human rights groups claim
 that the legislation would undermine Britain's commitment to
 provide haven for legitimate refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is-formed on the basis of a majority of seats in
 the House of Commons, won in elections held at intervals not
 longer than 5 years. Participation in the political process is
 open to all persons and parties, of which there are several.
 All citizens 13 years of age and older may vote.
 Most British dependent territories have small populations,
 under 60,000, and are ruled by appointed governors or
 administrators assisted by executive councils (usually
 appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils (partly
 elected).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude'Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1973 the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights was
 established by the Government to monitor human rights in
 Northern Ireland.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, are based in
 the UK. The Government cooperates fully with international
 inquiries into alleged violations of human rights and usually
 takes steps to rectify its own laws and policies when they are
 found not to be in conformity with human rights agreements to
 which it is a party.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 nationality, or national or ethnic origin and outlaws incitement
 to racial hatred. (Racial discrimination is not specifically
 outlawed in Northern Ireland.) A government-appointed,
 independent Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) supports
 persons taking court action under the Race Relations Act of
 1976, provides guidelines on good practice, and may initiate
 court action. After formally investigating complaints, the CRE
 may issue notices requiring that discrimination cease. Such
 notices are followed up over a 5-year period to ensure
 compliance. A CRE code of practice on employment issued in
 1984 encouraged many private companies to adopt equal
 opportunity policies and some degree of voluntary monitoring.
 Equal opportunity for women is provided, by law. An equal
 opportunity commission supports women who bring discrimination
 cases, most of which are labor related, before the courts and
 produces guidelines on good practice for employers. Large
 companies have begun to revise job classification and pay
 structures in an effort to achieveparity. Following legal
 changes in 1990, married women pay taxes on an equal basis with
 
 
 1298
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 other taxpayers. Women have equal property rights and equal
 rights in the divorce coUrts.
 Offenders in domestic violence cases are prosecuted and may be
 imprisoned. Women's shelters provide refuge for battered
 wives, and local governments provide counseling services. Rape
 victims receive similar support.
 There is no evidence of governmental discrimination on religious
 grounds in the United Kingdom. In Northern Ireland, anti-
 Catholic discrimination in employment stemming from a complex
 range of historical and social factors persists. The majority
 Protestant community controls much of the local economy and is
 more prosperous than the Catholic community (a recent study
 showed the average weekly income among Protestants was 18
 percent higher than among Catholics).
 Within the Northern Ireland civil service, the proportion of
 Catholics under age 36 reflects their proportion in the
 population, but they continue to be underrepresented in the
 -upper age groups and grades. Despite an overall increase in
 employment in Northern Ireland, the Catholic male unemployment
 rate remained 2.5 times that of Protestant men.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act of 1989 is intended
 to end employment discrimination and is aimed at outlawing even
 unintentional or "indirect" discrimination. All public sector
 employers and private firms with more than 25 workers must
 register with the Fair Employment Commission, monitor the
 religious composition of their work force, supply annual
 monitoring reports to the Commission, and review their overall
 employment practices at least once every 3 years. These
 obligations will be extended to small firms (employing between
 11 and 25 workers) beginning in 1992. Employers who fail to
 comply face criminal penalties and loss of government contracts.
 Although the vast majority of companies are in compliance with
 the legislation, fines have been imposed on some firms for
 violations. No criminal proceedings have been undertaken in
 part because the Government focuses its efforts on getting
 employers to comply short of court action. While the
 legislation has been criticized by some for not proposing
 "strong and effective provisions for targets and timetables,"
 in general it has been praised by leaders of the Catholic
 community. Government efforts to increase recruitment of
 Catholics into the police force and related security fields
 have been hampered by PIRA assassinations and death threats.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form and join representative
 organizations, associate freely, choose representatives,
 publish journals, openly promote members' interests and views,
 and elect representative assemblies to determine union policies
 and procedures. Unions participate freely in international
 organizations.
 Unions are free from government control but must register their
 accounts with a government-appointed trade union certification
 officer. Senior union officers must be elected by secret
 ballot. The law mandates secret ballots before a strike call,
 prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a legal
 strike call, and allows individual trade union members to lodge
 
 
 1299
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 complaints against their union with a government-appointed
 commissioner.
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike" in the UK.
 Voluntary cessation of work may be considered a breach of
 contract. A system of legal immunities which protected unions
 from prosecution when engaged in lawful industrial action has
 been narrowed by a series of acts of Parliament introduced in
 the 1980's. These acts have excluded secondary strikes and
 actions judged to have political motives. Unions encouraging
 such strikes are subject to fines by the courts and may have
 their assets seized. The legislation also restricts the
 ability of unions to act against subsidiaries of prime
 employers with whom they are in dispute where the subsidiaries
 are not party to the dispute and are the employers of record.
 This has led to union complaints that they have no protection
 against the transfer of work within the corporate structure,
 making unions the victims of a form of employer secondary
 action. The 1990 Employment Act made unions liable for all
 industrial actions, including unofficial strikes, unless the
 unions concerned write to strikers repudiating their action.
 Unofficial strikers may be legally dismissed. In instances
 where the right to strike is prohibited, e.g., for police
 officers, there are alternative means to resolve differences.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 (COE) in 1989 and again in 1991 upheld complaints against
 government bans on the disciplining by unions of members who
 reject lawful strike calls and on union indemnification of
 members and officers for sanctions imposed for engaging in
 approved union activities. The ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) called for changes in legislation to protect
 workers taking industrial action following a case involving the
 dismissal of 2,000 striking seamen. The Government has
 contested the conclusions of the COE and CFA and in 1990
 adopted legislation that the Trade Union Congress (TUC) alleges
 violates ILO conventions by narrowing the range of situations
 in which lawful industrial action may be taken.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is deeply rooted
 in common law. There is no legal obligation for employers to
 bargain with workers' representatives, nor have collective
 bargaining agreements historically been legally binding or
 enforceable in the courts, but collective bargaining is
 extensive, involving over 10.2 million workers, or about 40
 percent of the work force. It is illegal to deny a worker
 employment on the grounds that he or she is or is not a union
 member, except in the case of the armed forces, the police, or
 the security services.
 The 1984 ban on membership in national unions by employees of
 the high-security Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
 led to complaints being lodged at the ILO'by the TUC. The CFA
 and COE have affirmed that the ban and the dismissal of workers
 retaining union membership are in violation of ILO Convention
 87. The 1991 International Labor Conference expressed "deep
 concern" at the continuation of the ban and at the unwillingness
 of the British Government to enter into a dialogue with the
 unions. The British Government maintains that its actions in
 the GCHQ case fall within Convention 87's exemption for the
 armed forces and are also consistent with ILO Convention 151 on
 labor relations in the public service.
 
 
 1300
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion
 discrimination may seek redress through industrial tribunals.
 Remedies include payment of indemnities and reinstatement by
 employers found guilty of discriminatory practices, although
 reinstatement rarely occurs. A backlog of tribunal cases has
 developed in recent years.
 The COE has also qwstioned whether British legislation
 adequately protects against denial of employment on the grounds
 of past or present trade union activity. Evidence of
 blacklisting was collected by a House of Commons' select
 committee. In September 1991, press reports detailed one
 organization's compilation and distribution of a list of 22,000
 activists to prospective employers.
 Following a breakdown and abolition by the UK Government of a
 longstanding bilateral collective bargaining negotiating
 process, teachers' pay and conditions have been unilaterally
 determined since 1987 by the Secretary of State for Employment.
 The COE concluded that these procedures are not compatible with
 ILO Convention 9a on the right to organize and collective
 bargaining. In 1991 legislation was adopted which provided
 that teachers' pay and conditions should be determined by an
 independent review body, which was appointed in September.
 Export processing zones do not exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited in the TJK and its
 dependent territories and possessions and is not practiced.
 d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 School attendance until the age of 16 is compulsory. Children
 under that age are not permitted to work in an industrial
 enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage. In some low-wage
 industries employing approximately 2 million workers, wage
 councils of employers and trade union members establish minimum
 hourly wages and overtime rates for adult workers. Provisions
 are legally enforced by a team of inspectors. Minimum wage
 rates vary from industry to industry, but all are substantially
 below the national average earnings figure. The UK does not
 have a law limiting daily or weekly working hours.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the
 health and safety of employees not be placed at risk. A Health
 and Safety Executive (HSE) enforces health and safety
 regulations and may initiate criminal proceedings. In 1990,
 following a number of accidents, responsibility for railway
 safety was transferred to the HSE. A health and safety
 commission submits regulatory proposals to the Government,
 appoints investigatory committees, and encourages research and
 training. The UK system of occupational health and safety is
 viewed as efficiently managed and operates with the full
 involvement of workers' representatives.
