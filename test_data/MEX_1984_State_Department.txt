 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been governed by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 1929. The
 Constitution of 1917 provides for the separation of powers
 among a bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive,
 but the powers of the presidency far outweigh those of the
 other branches in Mexico's highly centralized system. Mexico
 has a sizable industrial sector. There are also large peasant
 and indigenous populations in the rural sector, which continue
 greatly to rely on manual labor.
 The PRI dominates politics at the federal and state levels.
 Opposition parties, viewed by the Government as outlets for
 criticism and dissatisfaction, have been able to make some
 inroads on the municipal level. Opposition strength,
 especially that of the conservative National Action Party
 (PAN), is growing, though some observers characterize this
 increase as a protest vote against the PRI. The opposition
 has yet to challenge the PRI successfully on the state level,
 let alone for the presidency. Most opposition party
 opportunities have been thwarted by nationwide PRI voting
 strength and organizational power, by maneuvers to divide the
 opposition and, the opposition claims, by continuing electoral
 fraud. In elections held in 1983 and 1984, protests about
 electoral fraud were especially strong in the states of
 Sinaloa, San Luis Potosi and Coahuila. For its part, the
 Government continues to emphasize its commitment to the
 principle of political pluralism.
 Both Amnesty International and the National Committee in
 Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted, Disappeared, and Political
 Exiles in Mexico, continue to express their concern over the
 fate of Mexico's "disappeared'. In June, the Committee
 presented a list of persons who had disappeared since 1969.
 While admitting that many of these persons had reappeared, the
 Committee charged that all those unaccounted for are being
 held clandestinely in government prisons. The Government has
 denied these charges and has stated that disappearances will
 not be tolerated. The Committee also alleges the existence of
 315 persons it terms 'political prisoners', 285 of whom were
 jailed during the current Administration; the great majority
 of these are peasants involved in land disputes. In response
 to the Committee's presentation of 38 of the most noteworthy
 cases, the Government said that some are in the process of
 investigation, while others have resulted in sentences for
 criminal acts.
 Human rights organizations have continued to make allegations
 concerning arbitrary arrests, especially of members of
 opposition parties, unions independent of the PRI, and peasant
 organizations. A number of deaths have also taken place,
 especially in the rural sector in disputes over land.
 The Federal Government during 1984 implemented.efforts to curb
 misuse of police authority; local leaders on the municipal
 level, especially those involved with influential private
 landowners, are not as rigorous in protecting human rights,
 and abuses appear to stem largely from that sector.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The current Administration reopened an investigation into the
 January 1982 discovery of 14 bodies found in the Tula River.
 Investigation at the time had proven fruitless. Warrants have
 now been issued against 24 members of the former Division of
 Investigation for the Prevention of Delinquency (DIPD), an arm
 of the Federal District's police force which was disbanded as
 one of the first acts of the new Administration. A number of
 arrests have already been made. It is alleged that the former
 DIPD members abducted, tortured and killed the 14 victims, 13
 Colombians and 1 Mexican, who themselves were reportedly
 involved, along with elements of the DIPD, .in the drug trade
 and a series of bank robberies. Testimony has been given that
 the acts of the DIPD were carried out on the instructions of a
 former director of the Federal and Transit Police and a former
 director of the DIPD for the purpose of extorting money from
 the victims. An arrest order has been issued against the
 latterl the former is currently awaiting extradition from the
 United States.
 Peasant organizations charged that during 1984 at least 69
 peasants were killed in confrontations in the states of
 Chiapas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, Sonora, Oaxaca and
 Guanajuato. Such charges have come not only from independent
 peasant organizations such as the Marxist-led and -oriented
 Independent Center of Agricultural Workers and Peasants
 (CIOAC) and the National Coordinator for the Plan of Ayala
 (CNPA), but also from the PRI-affiliated National
 Confederation of Peasants (CNC). The former attribute the
 killings of peasants affiliated with independent groups to
 paramilitary bands, supported by corrupt local landowners
 (caciques) as well as to members of the CNC, and to local
 police. For its part the CNC attributes fatalities in its
 ranks to members of the independent unions, encouraged, they
 say, by leftist political activists. Others, however, suggest
 that for the most part CNC members who have been killed were
 victims of internal CNC struggles.
 A major incident in 1984 involved the killing of nine members
 of a leftist independent peasant group in the town of
 Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas, on October 6. Following up on
 leads that the perpetrators were members of the CNC, backed up
 by agents of public security, the Attorney General for the
 State of Chiapas on October 10 announced the arrest of 18
 members of the CNC. On October 19, a violent confrontation
 between members of the CNC and CIOAC left three dead, two
 members of CIOAC and one CNC member.
 On September 26, four members of the leftist Unified Socialist
 Party of Mexico (PSUM) were killed near the village of San
 Jose Miahuatlan, Puebla, a municipality governed by the PSUM.
 Three of the victims were peasants; one, Felipe Fernandez
 Valiente, was a member of the State Committee of the PSUM.
 The four were killed in an armed ambush. Authorities have
 suggested that the attack was a politically-motivated
 assassination--more specifically, that the perpetrators were
 acting on behalf of local caciques, concerned that the PSUM
 had been active in organizing peasants in the area against
 their interests.
 
 
 598
 MEXICO
 Within Mexico there are about 47,000 registered Guatemalan
 refugees, the majority of whom live along its southern
 border. On April 20, 1984, 6 refugees were killed and 6
 wounded in the El Chupadero Camp (Chiapas) during an armed
 incursion into Mexico from Guatemala. Eyewitnesses stated
 that the perpetrators were members of the Guatemalan Army; the
 Government of Guatemala said that they were guerrillas,
 dressed in army uniforms. The Mexican Government protested
 the incident to Guatemala, though it did not identify the
 perpetrators.
 There have been rumors of maltreatment of the Guatemalan
 refugees by the Mexican security forces, especially during the
 relocation of the camps from Chiapas to Campeche, following
 the El Chupadero incident. The Catholic Bishop of San
 Cristobal de las Casas published an open letter in the Mexican
 press shortly after July 5, when, he said, three Guatemalan
 refugees were killed by Mexican security forces during the
 relocation of the Ixcan Camp. His protest was first aired by
 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) before being
 published in Mexico. Those killings have not been
 independently verified, and the Government has yet to comment
 officially.
 Amnesty International's 1984 Report (covering the period
 January-December 1983) expresses that organization's concern
 over killings, specifically in the rural area. It highlights
 that such killings, carried out by local security forces and
 armed civilians acting with them, have been directed towards
 peasants involved in land disputes, members of peasant
 organizations and rural trade unions created outside the
 official party, the PRI.
 b. Disappearance
 The Committee in Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted, Disappeared
 and Political Exiles of Mexico, led by Mrs. Rosario Ibarra de
 Piedra, Mexico's most prominent human rights advocate and the
 1982 presidential candidate for the left-wing Revolutionary
 Workers Party (PRT), continued to press the Government for
 information on the fate of Mexico's disappeared. On June 5,
 1984, the Committee presented two lists to the Interior
 Secretariat (Gobernacion). The first identified 455 persons
 whom the Committee states have disappeared between 1969 and
 December 1982. The second listed 40 persons either detained
 or disappeared during the current Administration. The
 Committee itself notes that, of those listed as having
 disappeared between 1969 and December 1982, three have
 reappeared. As to the group of 40, all but five have either
 been freed or otherwise accounted for. The Committee has
 continued to charge that the disappeared are being held in a
 chain of clandestine government-controlled prisons. It
 supports these claims with reports by other human rights
 groups, news reports, and letters smuggled out of prison.
 Interviews with disappeared who have reappeared, both on the
 radio program, 'Opinion Publical, and in
 letters-to-the-editor, also speak of such clandestine
 prisons. The Government continues to deny strongly the
 existence of any clandestine prisons, as wellas involvement
 in the disappearance of individuals, and states that those
 unaccounted for were killed in encounterp with security
 forces, or changed their names, went underground, or
 voluntarily went into exile. Human rights activists report
 that the Government has been rigorous in its'attempts to
 
 
 599
 MEXICO
 determine the whereabouts of those five persons claimed by the
 Committee to have disappeared and still missing during the
 period since December 1982.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, human
 rights organizations have charged that the police have
 tortured both political prisoners and those arrested for
 common crimes with electric shocks, beatings, submersion in
 water, deprivation of light and food, and the forcing of
 chili-laden mineral water up the nostrils. There are periodic
 reports in the Mexican press of confessions obtained through
 coercion. A U.S. journalist reports that he was tortured by
 means of electric shocks in April 1984, following his
 detention while covering a local strike in Reynosa. Local
 authorities have denied the allegations and the Government has
 begun investigations into the incident and the identity of
 those responsible. Other American citizens, arrested mainly
 on drug trafficking charges, complained of torture and inhuman
 and degrading treatment at the hands of the police in several
 cases in 1984. One such American claimed to have been
 interrogated in Oaxaca while blindfolded, naked, with his
 hands tied behind his back and in a squatting position.
 The Government officially denies that torture takes place or
 is in any way officially sanctioned. However, the current
 Administration, apparently reacting indirectly to these
 various charges, is conducting new recruitment, education and
 training of local and national police forces. Such measures
 are being implemented especially in the Federal District,
 where about one quarter of Mexico's population resides.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and there are public complaints about
 lack of trained personnel, a high turnover both in staff and
 Administration, corruption among prison staff members, and
 mistreatment of prisoners related to such corruption. Since
 the current administration took office, reforms have been
 carried out in the prisons of the Federal District, including
 doubling the daily budget for food per prisoner, developing
 prison industries to sell products on the open market, and
 training prisoners in a marketable skill. In addition, two
 new prisons are under construction in the Federal District.
 In some other parts of Mexico as well, overcrowding has been
 alleviated by new prison construction. In 1983, a new prison
 was opened in Acapulco, and one is under construction in
 Mazatlan.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Leaders of peasant organizations and unions outside the
 framework of the PRI, as well as opposition party activists,
 claim that the police frequently make arbitrary arrests,
 resulting in extended periods of detention.
 Following civil disturbances in Acapulco in November 1983, ten
 members of CONAMUP (National Coordinator of Popular Urban
 Movements) were arrested for what CONAMUP claimed were
 fabricated charges. Judicial authorities have responded that
 those arrested have been charged with damage to property and
 incitement to riot. On August 30, 1984, the Regional
 Secretary-General of the United Socialist Party (PSUM) in
 Jalapa, Veracruz, *was arrested along with two party activists
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 39
 
 
 600
 MEXICO
 and charged with disorderly conduct. Again, the claim was
 that the charge was fabricated and that the arrest took place
 for purposes of intimidation. Two weeks earlier, a local PAN
 municipal council member in the same locality reported that he
 had been subjected to similar treatment. Rosario Ibarra's
 committee, during the months of August and September, widely
 publicized that the Government was holding 315 persons, whom
 they termed *political prisoners'. The Committee stated that
 285 of these, the vast majority of whom were peasants who had.
 been involved in peaceful activities over land to which they
 had proof of ownership, had been jailed during the current
 Administration. Mexican political observers state that there
 has been a long history in Mexico of conflict over land, with
 different factions holding title to the same plots. On
 October 12, 25 different ethnic Indian groups held a march in
 Mexico City and presented a list of 150 Indians held in jail
 in different parts of the country. The demonstrators were
 appealing for an end to repression in their communities and a
 respect for their traditions. Both CONAMUP and the CNPA
 (National Coordinator for the Ayala Plan) demand the release
 of peasants imprisoned for what they term fictitious crimes.
 They specifically mention 13 members of an organization of
 Triqui Indians from Juxtlahuaca, Oaxaca, and seven peasants
 from the OCEZ (Organization of Peasants Emiliano Zapata).
 On October 13, 1984, 11 peasants were freed after having been
 detained since September, 1983. All 11 are members of the
 Pacto Riberno, an organization formed to press for reparations
 from the national oil company, Pemex, for damage to or
 confiscation of lands in the State of Tabasco. These 11 were
 among 25 members who, according to the Pacto, had been accused
 of common crimes.
 Amnesty International has adopted as prisoners of conscience
 four members of COCEI (The Coalition of Workers, Peasants and
 Students of the Isthmus) including one of its founders,
 Leopoldo de Gyves Pineda, who have been in prison since
 December 1983. The four have been charged with offenses
 against the public order, illegal carrying of arms and
 incitement to riot. The COCEI claims that the charges are
 politically motivated, following the forcible ousting of the
 PSUM/COCEI municipal government of Juchitan, Oaxaca, in July,
 1983, (The PSUM/COCEI had won the 1981 election.)
 During the annual Labor Day march, May 1, a homemade firebomb
 was thrown among Mexican dignitaries who were on a balcony of
 the presidential palace. Police investigators determined that
 the perpetrators were students at the Popular Preparatory
 School of Tacuba. On May 5, this institution was taken over
 by a combination of local police and federal authorities.
 About 100 students were arrested at the time, though most were
 released within a few days. Fourteen students were charged
 with involvement in the May Day incident, and continae to be
 held by the authorities.
 On July 16, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a writer and critic of the
 Government's policy towards Guatemalan refugees, was abducted
 and held overnight. Neither the abductors nor the facility
 where he was held were identified, but Aguilar states that he
 was made to understand that he was being held because of'his
 writing.

 MEXICO
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed
 within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at
 least a two-year sentence. Nevertheless, trial delays are
 often caused by cumbersome court procedures, and by the
 defendants' inability or unwillingness to pay bribes in the
 form of "gratuities' to bring the case to trial. State
 authorities in some localities are attempting to correct such
 abuses. In February, 1984 the Governor of the State of
 Yucatan announced that he had discovered 'grave
 irregularities' in the Office of the Attorney General,
 centering mainly on the solicitation of bribes. The Governor
 states that basic changes have been implemented.
 Allegations have been made by the political opposition that
 the failure to bring to trial peasant activists, independent
 union members and those in the political opposition is
 politically motivated.
 Defendants have a right to counsel and public defenders are
 available. Although certain sections of the criminal code
 provide for the convoking of tribunals with juries, in
 practice this almost never takes place. In most cases, a
 judge generally acting alone examines written statements,
 expert bpinion, and, less commonly, oral testimony and then
 makes his decision.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Although the Mexican Government generally does not intrude on
 privacy of individuals, and search warrants are required by
 law, Mexican human rights activists and members of the
 political opposition have complained that they are followed by
 the police and that their telephone lines are tapped. During
 1984, there were charges of invasions of peasants' homes by
 local landowners accompanied by police, without warrants, and
 allegations that these incidents were sometimes accompanied by
 robbery, rape, and the burning of homes. The incidents were
 sometimes connected with the phenomenon of "urban squatters'
 in Mexican metropolitan areas.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and of the Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed by law.
 Hand in hand with the Government's efforts to achieve its
 moral renovation goals, it is tolerating more direct public
 criticism, and bolder press articles have appeared. Certain
 topics, such as direct criticism of the President and the
 military, have traditionally been shunned by most media. At
 least one foreign journalist has been kept out of the country
 following such criticism; sources within the Government and
 local press have stated that this journalist and a colleague
 will not be allowed to enter Mexico. Overt censorship in
 other cases has been exercised primarily for the purpose of
 protecting public morality, be it in print, radio, movies or
 television. Nevertheless, press sources report that
 administrations in power influence the press by giving
 financial supplements to individual reporters for favorable
 articles, by withholding newsprint and ink (a government
 monopoly) from critical papers, and by selectively placing
 
 
 602
 MEXICO
 government advertising, an important source of income for the
 press. During the past year, some payments to journalists,
 reportedly previously abandoned by the de la Madrid
 Administration, appeared to have been reinstituted, according
 to local journalists and foreign correspondents based in
 Mexico. Such subsidies seem to be far less pervasive than
 during previous administrations, and some of these payoffs are
 indirect. In the case of advertising, for example,
 journalists may receive a percentage of the advertising sold
 to the entities which they cover. Opposition parties and some
 journalists have publicly accused the PRI's Office of
 Information of making large payments directly to other
 journalists. They say that this explains the reduction in
 direct government subsidies to journalists.
 The popular radio program, *Opinion Publica", taken off the
 air by the previous Administration for broadcasting views
 critical of the Government, was reinstated in 1983. It
 currently operates, however, with an altered format, having
 abandoned live telephone call-ins in favor of recorded calls.
 In 1983, opposition observers noted that the change was for
 the purposes of censorship. The outspoken moderator remains
 the same, and controversial figures, including a person
 formerly numbered among the disappeared, but recently
 released, have joined him regularly on the show in 1984.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right to peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose throughout the country, but a government permit
 is generally required for major demonstrations. Within the
 Federal District, opposition political groups, as well as
 peasant and indigenous organizations, are allowed frequent
 access to both main boulevards and the city's large central
 square for demonstrations. During the month of September,
 Rosario Ibarra de Piedra and a number of opposition deputies
 engaged in a prolonged hunger strike in support of the
 disappeared and political prisoners in Mexico. The strike was
 held within the precincts of the national legislative palace.
 Numerous oemonstrations were held throughout the country in
 support of the hunger strikers, and most were unmolested. The
 press reported, however, that on September 25 60 members of
 the Revolutionary Workers Party were set upon by the judicial
 and municipal police while holding a supportive sit-in in the
 main square of Apizaco, a small town in the state of Tlaxcala.
 Trade unions enjoy and practice the right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike. The majority of organized peasants
 belong to the National Conference of Peasants (CNC), also
 affiliated with the PRI. Several powerful independent unions
 also exist. Leaders of these independent unions and peasant
 organizations have complained of an increase in the level of
 repression and harassment against them from those bodies
 associated with the PRI. Campesino groups have charged
 increased killings and arrests of their leaders and militants,
 and that their movements and activities are carefully
 monitored by both municipal and federal police. Some
 independent unions are associated with opposition parties; on
 the left with the Unified Socialist Party (PSUM) and the
 Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT) while those to the right of
 PRI unions are not connected to any political party.
 Opposition political leaders have complained that government
 attempts to unify the two electricity-sector unions has
 included doing away with a non-PRI union. Others say that the
 absorption of this union is a natural process of consolidation.
 
 
 603
 MEXICO
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, individuals are free to practice the
 religion of their choice; however, no religious body has any
 legal existence. The clergy is prohibited from participating
 in politics, voting, owning real estate and wearing religious
 nabits in public. Most of these prohibitions are not strictly
 enforced; neither is a constitutional restriction against
 pre-university religious schools, many of which exist. In
 practice the hierarchy of the Catholic church in Mexico
 maintains a close liaison with the Government. Though Mexico
 is predominantly Roman Catholic, Protestant and Jewish
 communities also exist.
 Protestant Evangelists, especially from outside Mexico, are
 active and especially successful in certain rural, largely
 indigenous communities. In July 1984, state authorities in
 Chihuahua announced the expulsion of 52 such missionaries over
 a 98-day period in that state. The Government reportedly
 charged these missionaries with violating article 130 of the
 Constitution, which limits the holding of religious services
 to inside church buildings and homes. Some critics of the
 action have charged that the Government is selectively
 enforcing the anti-clerical laws in favor of the predominant
 Roman Catholic church. Other critics state that, in some
 outlying areas, the laws are not being enforced against the
 Evangelists so as to reduce the influence of the Catholic
 church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted. Recently, however, because of problems of
 unrest within Guatemala, some areas along the border have been
 closed to the public by the military.
 Mexico has in the past traditionally followed a liberal asylum
 policy and its borders have been open to Central Americans
 fleeing from their countries. During the past year, there has
 been some attempt to control these entries without closing the
 southern border. Early in 1984, the Government began to
 relocate all the refugee camps in the south to the Yucatan
 Peninsula, stating that this was necessary to protect the
 refugees from border incursions from Guatemala and to improve
 their living conditions. Critics of the relocations, however,
 say that their purpose was to discourage the influx of
 additional refugees. The number of registered Guatemalan
 refugees in Mexico in 1984 was officially estimated to have
 grown to about 47,000. Government spokesmen have stated that
 there is no plan to encourage the refugees to leave Mexico;
 however, Mexican authorities have assisted over 600
 Guatemalans who have voluntarily returned to Guatemala.
 Estimates of Salvadoran refugees in Mexico continue to be
 unavailable from the Government, and Mexico does not consider
 them to oe refugees. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees
 estimated that 15,000 Salvadorans were present in Mexico in
 late 1983. The number of Salvadoran political asylees in
 Mexico has been estimated at less than 100.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mexico has been governed since 1929 by the PRI, the dominant
 party. To secure its continuity in power, the PRI has relied
 
 
 604
 MEXICO
 on revolutionary legitimacy, cooptation of the opposition,
 massive government and PRI organizational resources
 and--opposition parties charge--electoral fraud in some
 cases. The PRI has broad representation from labor, peasants,
 and other sectors of society. Opposition parties have
 recently been able to make inroads, especially among the
 peasants and the middle class. Election reform laws in 1977
 legalized opposition parties beyond those then in existence,
 and earmarked seats in the state and federal legislatures for.
 opposition parties and guaranteed them access to the public
 media. President de la Madrid, both in his first and second
 Annual Report to the nation, emphasized his commitment to
 political pluralism in Mexico. In the second address, he
 pointed to the registration of two additional opposition
 parties, the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM)
 and the Mexican Workers Party (PMT). Critics have observed,
 however, that it is in the interest of the PRI to keep the
 opposition fragmented. They also charge that the PARM joins
 the ranks of other so-called opposition parties, such as the
 Popular Socialist Party (PPS), which support the PRI.
 The new electoral races in 1984 did not provide a test of this
 commitment to political pluralism, as effective opposition was
 not yet sufficiently developed in three of the four states
 where elections were held. In the state of San Luis Potosi,
 considered by Mexican political observers to be an area of
 strength for the National Action Party (PAN), the PRI won.
 The PAN has attributed this victory to fraud. Despite the
 opposition's allegations, it is undoubtedly true that a
 substantial portion of the population throughout Mexico
 supports and votes for the PRI. In 1984, the PRI initiated
 primary elections for selection of its candidates in a number
 of constituencies in order to promote internal party democracy.
 A large number of elections for federal deputies and
 governorships will take place in 1985. The opposition says
 that the results in states with a developed opposition, such
 as Sonora, will be a test of the PRI's commitment to political
 pluralism.
 Minority groups, including women and indigenous groups, are
 allowed full participation in the Mexican political process.
 Under the law, all citizens 18 and over may vote, though
 members of the clergy, under the Constitution, are denied this
 right.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government participates in international human rights
 forums and allows both domestic and international human rights
 groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment. In 1984 Mexico established the Mexican Academy
 for Human Rights, and hosted the 22-nation First
 Ibero-American Congress on Political Rights. Mexico also
 hosted the Fourth Latin American Congress of Families of
 Detainees and Disappeared (FEDEFAM) in November 1983. Mexico
 is an active member of the UN Human Rights Commission.
 Senior government officials appear to have been responsive to
 the human rights campaign mounted by Rosario Ibarra de Piedra
 in September. The Secretariat of the Interior is reportedly
 investigating at least some of the allegations of
 
 
 605
 MEXICO
 disappearances, and Ibarra has been promised an audience with
 President de la Madrid to discpss the disappeared and
 political prisoners.
 Amnesty International has an office in Mexico and its annual
 report on human rights is easily available. Its 1984 report,
 which covered calendar year 1983, was concerned mainly with
 arbitrary arrest and prolonged incommunicado imprisonment of
 political prisoners, sentences based on confessions allegedly
 extracted under torture and ill-treatment, and
 disappearances. Amnesty was also concerned about information
 on the arbitrary arrest and murder of members of rural
 communities and Indian groups, in some cases alleged to have
 been carried out directly by members of the official security
 forces, and in others by armed civilians who seemed to be
 acting in concert with the former. Amnesty's report 'Torture
 in the 80's' states that the most frequent and consistent
 allegations of torture have been made against the Division of
 Investigations for the Prevention of Delinquency (DIPD),
 disbanded by President de la Madrid as one of the first acts
 of his Administration. Press reports in August stated that
 the federal judicial police were searching for a torturer
 employed by the DIPD inside a prison near the Tula River. His
 identity was established by testimony from the members of the
 DIPD's Jaguar Group, themselves under indictment.
 Freedom House rates Mexico 'partly free'.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mexico's major domestic, economic and social problems are
 poverty, inflation, a depressed level of economic activity,
 unemployment, severely uneven income distribution, and a high
 rate of population growth.
 In Decqmber 1982, the new de la Madrid Administration began a
 wide-ranging program to reduce inflation and increase foreign
 exchange reserves without unduly reducing employment levels in
 the short term. The longer term objective is to promote a
 sustainable rate of growth that will reduce unemployment and,
 hence, poverty. The Government maintains its right to
 regulate many private economic activities in the public
 interest. Restrictions regarding the ownership of property by
 foreigners generally limit foreign equity participation in
 business enterprises to 49 percent.
 Mexico's population in 1984 was estimated at 77.7 million and
 its population growth rate stood at 2.5 percent in 1984. Life
 expectancy at birth was 66.3 years and the infant mortality
 rate was 44.3 per 1,000 live births. Mexico has become an
 urbanized society, with 67 percent of the population living in
 cities as of 1980. Over 16 million people live in the Mexico
 City metropolitan area.
 Primary education is both free and obligatory and has been
 extended to include 10 years of schooling. The primary school
 enrollment ratio in Mexico was 122.4 percent in 1981 (male
 123.8 and female 120.9), reflecting the presence of adults and
 older children in primary school classes. Adult literacy as
 of 1980 stood at 83 percent. As of 1984, 58 percent of the
 population had access to safe water (urban, 61 percent and
 rural, 51 percent). The average caloric supply as a percent
 of requiremepts was 114 percent in 1977. There is no
 discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background
 or political opinion in the availability of food, shelter,
 health care, and education.

 Inflation and unemployment continue to trouble the economy.
 The Mexican Government contends that open unemployment is 8.0
 to 8.5 percent. Underemployment has been estimated by many
 observers at 30 to 40 percent for several years.
 Men and women are equal in principle under the law. Mexican
 women have the right to file for divorce and separation.
 There are no travel restrictions on women and they can own
 property in their own names. Over the past ten years, women
 have increased their presence in non-traditional occupations.
 However, the concept of women as mothers and homemakers
 continues to dominate.
 The number of women's action groups is increasing and it
 appears that the objectives of women are becoming more
 diversified. Women comprise approximately 26 percent of the
 work force in urban areas but continue to work predominantly
 in nonsupervisory jobs with few at the executive level.
 However, a women is now Secretary-General of the dominant
 political party. Of the 64 senators elected to the 52nd
 legislature, six are women; of the 400 federal deputies, 35
 are women.
