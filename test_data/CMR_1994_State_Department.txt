 CAMEROON
 Nominally a multiparty republic Cameroon continues to be ruled in fact by Presi-
 dent Paul Biya and a circle of advisers drawn largely from his own ethnic group
 and from hisparty, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM). The
 reigning CPDM's power was last challenged in 1992 in relatively free National As-
 sembly elections and highly flawed presidential elections. The CPDM successfully
 dominates the National Assembly through its controlling share of a ruling coalition
 that has rendered the one significant opposition party in the Assembly, the National
 Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP), essentially powerless. In addition, Cam-
 eroon's 1972 Constitution gives extraordinary powers to the President, including the
 authority to govern by decree during the 10 months of each year when the Assembly
 is not in session. Few significant opposition measures ever come to a vote.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national police, the National
 Intelligence Service (DGRE), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration (MINAT), Military Intelligence (SEMIL), the army, and to a lesser extent,
 the Presidential Security Service. The police and the gendarmerie have dominant
 roles in enforcing internal security laws. As in previous years, security forces com-
 mitted numerous and egregious human rights abuses.
 Cameroon's economy has continued to contract dramatically, despite abundant
 natural resources. In January the much-needed devaluation of the 8A currency,
 recommended by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank went into
 place. While it provided a significant boost to agricultural exports, city dwellers and
 salaried workers were badly pinched. Financially, the Government has a burden-
 some foreign debt and runs a chronic budget deficit. Its capacity to collect revenues
 is hampered by widespread and long-standing corruption and inefficiency.
 The authorities continued to commit serious human rights abuses, including a
 number of extrajudicial killings. In at least one case army troops, trying to control
 ethnic conflict in Far North province and to deal with a serious problem of banditry
 in that area, massacred civilians, including women and children, in retaliation for
 attacks on troops by bandits. In numerous instances, the police and other members
 of the security forces beat and tortured suspected criminals. They Toutinely beat
 prisoners throughout the country; in several instances, they beat and abused opposi-
 tion party activists to intimidate and repress political activity. The Government
 rarely tries or punishes human rights abusers, thus creating a climate of impunity
 in which the abuses continue to flourish. The Government also restricted, to one de-
 gree or another, almost all of the human rights discussed in this report, including
 reedom of press and assembly, the riht to a fair trial, and the right to change the
 government. The Government has failed to carry out repeated promises to under-
 take constitutional reform or hold multiparty elections. Discrimination and violence
 against women remain a serious and growing problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-While there were no killings known
 to have been politically motivated, public security forces continued to be responsible
 for a number of extrajudicial killings. There were several reliable reports of detain-
 ees having been beaten to death in prisons around the country. The most serious
 incidents occurred in Far North province near the Chadian border, where govern-
 ment security forces were called in to quell ethnic violence between Cha Arabs and
 members of the Kotoko ethnic group and to stamp out banditry. Security forces were
 responsible for arbitrary arrests of suspected perpetrators and, in at least one case,
 for a retaliatory attack on a village suspected of harboring them.
 Malloum Eli, a Choa Arab arrested by government security forces in late January
 in connection with an assault on government security forces, which resulted in the
 death of nine soldiers, reportedly died in detention at an army barracks in the vil-
 lage of N'lDjamena, Far North province.
 In an apparently unrelated incident, three Choa Arabs, Harouna Djidda, Allakhou
 Mahmat, and Issa Mahmat, died in the custody of security forces shortly after their
 arrest on January 21 in Far North province. Djidda and Mahmat were credibly re-
 ported to have been tortured to death, while the third, Issa Mahmat, is reported
 to have been summarily shot.
 On February 17, army troops after an exchange of gunfire with bandits, were
 credibly reported to have entered a village of Choa Arabs in Far North province and
 to have massacred in retaliation as many as 55 people, most of them women and
 children, and wounded many others. While local provincial officials at first disputed
 the Choas' account of the incident, admitting only that several villagers were in-
 
 
 30
 jured during an arms search, a report dated February 25 by a Far North Provincial
 Commission found that a number of deaths had in fact occurred. Villagers claimed
 the army surrounded the village and opened fire indiscriminately. Military officials
 later claimed that their troops had returned fire in self-defense. It has not been pos-
 sible to verify either side's account of the events. The National Commission on
 Human Rights and Liberties, a government-appointed and funded group, did not
 have sufficient funds to visit the site of the alleged massacre or perform an inves-
 tigation.
 The Government is faced with a difficult situation in northern Cameroon where
 several ethnic groups carry on banditry and internecine disputes. Chadians, some
 of them engaged in banditry, generally move easily across the border. There were
 however, reports that authorities arrested, mistreated, and possibly killed detained
 Chadians suspected of illegal entry or banditry.
 On April 19, soldiers in Edea, Littoral province, arrested Desire Nken for sus-
 pected burglary and tortured him to death at a nearby military base the same day.
 Photographs of his badly beaten body were widely disseminated in the private press.
 The Government ostensibly investigated the incident but announced no results. Dur-
 ing the night of May 25-26, a secondary school student was shot to death during
 a riot by a gendarme in the town of Nanga Eboko, Center province. According to
 a report by a Ministry of Education official who investigated the case, gendarmes
 removed the student's body to their headquarters, extracted the bullet, and stabbed
 the body to make it appear that the boy had died during the riot by nonofficial
 means. A robbery suspect, Christian Pidi Ekoka, died on July 15 in the custody of
 Douala gendarmes, following what the attending physician determined to have been
 a severe beating that had produced multiple injuries.
 In September the head of a notorious special police unit that has been widely and
 credibly accused of engaging in extrajudicial arrests, tortures, and murders was ar-
 rested. Credible reports indicate that his arrest was precipitated in part by his
 extrajudicial activities.
 b.   sappearance.-There were no reports of long-term disappearances. However,
 police and gendarmes frequently failed to inform detainees' family members or at-
 torneys of their whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence obtained
 thereby, and prohibits public servants from using force against any person. In spite
 of this, there were many credible reports of security forces inflicting severe beatings,
 systematic torture, and other inhuman treatment (see Section L.a.). Sanctions
 against those responsible are rare, although the Government maintains that they
 face administrative punishments which are not made public. Public security forces
 are credibly reported to operate a number of unofficial prisons and torture centers
 of which one, the Chateau Americanos, is particularly notorious. These unofficial
 prisons have been inaccessible to outside observers from the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or other humanitarian organizations.
 In November the authorities arrested and jailed two Yaounde police officers after
 they allegedly stripped and beat a submagistrate who had attempted, as part of his
 official duties, to visit prisoners. No public legal proceedings had begun involving
 police officers by the end of the year.
 Security forces habitually inflict degrading mistreatment on detainees, including
 stripping, confinement in severely overcrowded cells, and denial of access to toilets
 or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes routinely beat detainees to ex-
 tract confessions and the names and whereabouts of alleged criminals. In particular,
 they often beat them on the soles of their feet with an iron bar or whip them with
 a reinforced rubber tube.
 In July the government-supported National Commission on Human Rights and
 Freedoms, with a grant from the Canadian Government, sponsored a 3-day human
 rights conference for military and police officers. Some 70 officers attended. In No-
 vember the ICRC sponsored a course on law and order and the code of conduct in
 combat, which was attended by 30 instructors from the army, marines, and gendar-
 merie.
 On January 12, following a riot at the University of Yaounde, security forces sup-
 ported by helicopters sealed off the University and attacked the students with tear
 gas, then transported them to the infamous Chateau Americanos. Many were badly
 beaten before being released the next day. In another incident, a suad of gen-
 darmes assaulted four activists in a branch office of the opposition UNUP Party
 near Bot Maka, Littoral province, as they returned from a party meeting on April
 30. The four were badly beaten and left unconscious by the roadside.
 Similarly, on May 21, several members of the Progressive Movement, an opposi-
 tion party, were badly beaten by gendarmes and riot police when they attempted
 
 
 31
 to hold a meeting at the Bamenda Omnisport Stadium in Douala. The Government
 had earlier banned the intended meeting.
 On September 25 a U.S. resident of-Yaounde was struck in the face and kicked
 in the groin by a police officer when stopped at a roadblock and accused of speeding.
 Unusually, the victim later received an official apology. This incident typifies police
 conduct at roadblocks. It is widely believed that some police have targeted expatri-
 ates for harassment in order to extort money.
 Prison conditions are life threatening, especially outside major urban areas. Be-
 tween March and September, 21 inmates died in an epidemic of typhoid and tuber-
 culosis in Douala's central prison. There are serious defciencies in food, health care,
 and sanitation in almost all prisons. Some traditional rulers in Northern Cameroon
 continue to maintain private prisons which operate outside the authority of the gov-
 ernment penitentiary system. Prisoners are sometimes chained in their cells. Beat-
 ings are common, with numerous credible reports appearing in the private press of
 prisoners having been burned by cigarette butts or painfully suspended over iron
 ars. Seriously ill prisoners are often denied adequate medical care. Juveniles and
 nonviolent prisoners are often incarcerated together with violent adults. Corruption
 among prison personnel is widespread. The ICRC doesn't visit prisons because it is
 too ifrequenty allowed access to those detainees in whom it is interested. These
 include detainees who are detained outside the official prison system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary, prolonged detention remains
 a serious problem. Security forces failed to implement fully a Penal Code require-
 ment that detainees be brought promptly before a magistrate and have held detain-
 ees incommunicado.
 Police may detain a person in custody in connection with a common crime for up
 to 24 hours before bringing charges. That period may be renewed three times. How-
 ever, the law only provides for the right to a judicial review of the legality of deten-
 tion in a few areas of the country with an Anglophone majrt      swhere, the
 Francophone legal tradition applies, precluding judicial authorities from acting on
 a case until the administrative authority that ordered the detention turns the case
 over to the prosecutor. After a magistrate has issued a warrant to bring the case
 to trial, he may hold the detainee in "pretrial detention" indefinitely pendin court
 action. Furthermore, a 1990 law permits detention without charge for renewalepe-
 riods of 15 days "in order to combat banditry." Persons taken into detention are fre-
 quently denied access to both legal counsel and family members. The law permits
 release on bail only in the Anglophone provinces, where the legal system includes
 features of British common law. Even there, bail is granted infrequently.
 On July 30 the authorities arrested 28 members of the UNDP  and chrgd them
 with having imented civil disorder as a result of a riot in Maroua, North province,
 in which the motorcade of Hamadou Moustapha, Deputy Prime Minister and Min-
 ister for Town Planning, was attacked. The Government claimed that the detainees
 either participated in the attack or instigated it. Leaders of the UNDP claimed that
 the detainees had nothing to do with the attack and that the Government instigated
 the attack as an excuse to arrest prominent members of the UNDP. At the end of
 the year, the detainees remained in police custody without any indication of when
 a trial would be held. They were allowed access to attorneys.
 The Government does not practice political exile. Some opposition members who
 considered themselves threatened by the Government have voluntarily left the coun-
 try and declared themselves to be in political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The court system is p art of the executive branch
 of Government, subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. Magistrates are thus subject
 particularly in political cases, to government direction. Corruption is endemic, and
 in many cases a favorable judgment goes to the highest bidder. Some politically sen-
 sitive cases are never heard.
 Magistrates acknowledge that rendering a decision in a political case that dis-
 pleases the Government may result in transfer to a less desirable position. Because
 appointed attorneys receive little compensation, the quality of legal representation
 for indigent persons is often poor. The Bar Association and some voluntary organiza-
 tions, such as the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, offer pro bono legal
 assistance in some cases. Trials are public.
 Traditional courts are important in rural areas. Their authority varies by region
 and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters of property and domestic disputes
 and may serve a probate function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of
 their decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 There were no known political prisoners, as distinct from political detainees, at
 year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-Both
 invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are illegal, but there
 
 
 32
 were numerous credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed citizens and
 conducted searches without warrants. Security forces, including police, frequently
 set up roadblocks to extract bribes from travelers. This longstanding practice ap-
 pears to have increased as the economy declined. In June a high-ranking CPDM of-
 ficial involved in a commercial dispute with a foreign citizen, rather than resolve
 his dispute through legal means, employed the police to seize the citizen's property
 unlawfully. The foreign citizen then sought redress through the courts. At year's
 end, the dispute remained before the courts without resolution.
 On August 23, the national police breached accepted diplomatic immunity in fore-
 ibly entering US. Government diplomatic property (USAID and Administrative
 Compound) in Yaounde, removing three vehicles andmiscellaneous items. The bail-
 iff claimed he had authority to seize the property pursuant to a court decision. The
 bailiff also claimed to have an order of execution (warrant) signed by the Attorney
 General. Police and bailiffs again forcibly entered the grounds on August 26 and
 again attempted to seize US. Government property. The Embassy in both instances
 protested vigorously this violation of diplomatic immunity and twice received high-
 level apologies. Government officials repeatedly promised that the vehicles would be
 returned to the Embassy, but at year's end their return was still pending.
 There were numerous credible reports that the Government kept some opposition
 activists and dissidents under surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitutionprovides for freedom
 of expression and press, these liberties are not always respected. In 1990 a new law
 established more liberal regulations to begin publication of newspapers and maga-
 zines. That law, however, formally enshrined prepublication censorship and granted
 the Ministry of Territorial Administration the authority to suspend or revoke the
 right to publish. The law also provided for the licensing of private radio and tele-
 vision stations, but at the end of 1994, no licenses had been granted, and the Gov-
 ernment retained complete control of the electronic media. Public servants employed
 by the official media face retribution for openly criticizing the Government, as in
 the case of numerous radio and television journalists who have been transferred to
 less desirable assignments for remarks that the Government considered critical.
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune, and de-
 termines the content of radio and television broadcasts. Nevertheless, Government
 reporters sometimes write articles which implicitly criticize the ruling party or por-
 tray government programs in an unfavorable light. The government-controlled
 broadcast media provide disproportionately greater attention to CPDM functions,
 than to opposition events.
 Approximately 40 to 50 private newspapers are published, most only sporadically.
 These newspapers are often outspoken in their criticism of the Government and the
 President, but newspapers are not read widely outside the major cities. Censorship
 declined and was suspended completely for a period of about 6 weeks following a
 national communications conference in late August. By mid-October, however, cen-
 sorship was reinstituted, and police posted at printing plants to enforce it. The Gov-
 ernment continued to censor articles or newspapers that it considered libelous or a
 threat to the public order. As in earlier years, authorities seized or restricted arti-
 cles critical of the Government and its supporters.
 By year's end, the Government had censored 73 individual articles, seized 7 issues
 of various newspapers, and suspended 3 newspapers for periods ranging from 1 to
 3 months. During the course of the year police arrested or intimidated several jour-
 nalists and editors.
 Authorities detained publishers and editors for publication of unfavorable news
 and commentary about the Government. For example, on January 7, police arrested
 Ndzana Seine, publisher of Le Nouvel Independant, following an interview with
 Presidency Secretary General Joseph Owona in which Owona was quoted as having
 made unfavorable comments about the Bamileke ethnic group. Police held Seme for
 3 days without charges in three different Yaounde police stations. His newspaper
 was suspended for 2 months. Seme's wife was not notified of his arrest, nor was she
 permitted to visit him. Ndzana Seine was arrested again on October 14 on charges
 of inciting public disorder and of slander against President Biya. The charges were
 precipitated, apparently, by a series of articles dealing with inner circle political
 scandals in the Government. The arresting authorities, however, cited no specific of-
 fending article. After being held without bail for 212 months, his case was heard
 on December 23. He was found guilty on both counts, and fined approximately $900,
 given a 1-year suspended prison sentence, and placed on probation for the next 3
 years.
 
 
 Although there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, it is generally be-
 lieved that there are state security informants on university campuses. Some profes-
 sors believe that their political viewpoints and activism have had a negative impact
 on professional opportunities and advancement. Free political discussion at the uni-
 versity is dampened by the presence of armed security forces, as well as the some-
 times strident pro-opposition groups. In July newly a ppointed Minister of Higher
 Education Peter Agber Tabi decreed that university lecturers would not be per-
 mitted to depart Cameroon without his specific authorization. In at least one in-
 stance, a departing professor was removed from an airplane destined for Bangui by
 security forces and forbidden to leave the country. The Education Minister's appar-
 ent primary purpose in initiating the travel ban, which has not been tested in court,
 was to stem the outward flow of trained cadres rather than inhibit the movement
 of political opponents.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are provided for in law but restricted in practice. The Penal Code prohibits
 public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior government approval.
 Some 90 political parties operated legally, albeit with severe restrictions, along with
 a growing number of civic associations.
 The Government severely hindered the ability of opposition parties to operate,
 generally by refusing them permission to hold meetings on various technicalities.
 While the Government insisted that political parties were permitted to hold meet-
 ings if they had obtained a permit, it frequently denied permits on the grounds that
 the proposed meetings threatened public order. Through such means, the Govern-
 ment prohibited the UNDP from holding meetings in its stronghold of Adamaoua
 and the North provinces, following a riot in Maroua in late July. Although the ban
 on meetings included all parties, the directive was clearly aimed at the UNDP.
 Similarly, the Government in August banned meetings by the Social Democratic
 Front (SDF) Party, and several times prohibited the Progressive Movement Party
 from holding a rally in Douala. Various bans and interdictions effectively limited the
 ability of opposition parties and coalitions to function normally. On ovember 26,
 government security forces broke up a rally in Bafoussam by members of the Allied
 Front for Change, a coalition of 16 opposition political parties. Police prevented John
 Fru Ndi, the head of the coalition, from entering the city to lead the rally and ar-
 rested several coalition activists. The Government asserted that, as the coalition is
 not a legally recognized political party, it does not have the right to stage rallies.
 The Government permitted the Allied Front for Change to hold an end-of-year rally
 in Yaounde on December 29, but discouraged attendance through intimidation tac-
 tics, such as roadblocks on routes leading into Yaounde, a heavy police presence
 around the stadium venue, and helicopters circling over the stadium.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally does not restrict freedom of
 religion. A religious group must be approved and registered with the Ministry of
 Territorial Administration in order to function legally. There were no reports of Gov-
 ernment harassment of Jehovah's Witnesses, although the Government has not re-
 turned properties confiscated in 1970. The Witnesses are free to build new places
 of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law does not restrict freedom of movement within the country, but
 the Government does in fact impede domestic travel. Police frequently stop travelers
 to check identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts as security
 and immigration control measures. With increasing frequency, police demanded iMie-
 gal payments from citizens at roadblocks or other points.
 Although most opposition leaders traveled freely, some political activists faced re-
 strictions. The Government, for instance, occasionally use its passport control func-
 tion to prevent dissidents from leaving the country. In February, for example,
 Charly Gabriel Mbock, the national campaign manager for the SDF, was prevented
 from traveling to Benin where he was to represent his party at a conference. Airport
 special police questioned Mbock for several hours under the apparent pretext that
 he was wanted for a criminal offense and freed him only after his flight had de-
 parted. In several instances, opposition parties erected roadblocks or otherwise im-
 peded free movement of the public.
 Cameroon has long served as a safe haven for displaced prsons and refugees
 from the region. The Government estimates the total number of displaced Africans,
 mostly Chadians, at 45,00. Although Cameroon occasionally returns illegal Chad-
 ian immigrants, there were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees.
 Some illegal immigrants have been subjected to harsh treatment, including impris-
 onment (see Section L.a.).
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government, but the 1992
 presidential elections, which were marred by wi espread government manipulation,
 and the near total dominance of the political process by the President and his party
 call into serious doubt the ability of citizens to exercise this right.
 In contrast to the relatively open March 1992 National Assembly elections, the
 last presidential election held in October 1992 was characterized by widespread
 irregularities; it was highly criticized by independent observers and widely regarded
 in Cameroon as fraudulent.
 The Government's control over Cameroon's administrative apparatus is broad and
 deep. The President appoints by decree the chief operating official, the Government
 Delegate, of Yaounde, Douala, Bamend, and several other large cities, which have
 no elected mayors. The governors of each of the provinces are also appointed directly
 by the President. Important lower level members of the provincial administrative
 structures, including the senior divisional officers, the divisional officers and the
 district chiefs are all appointed by the Prime Minister, who is also a member of the
 CPDM. The governors and senior divisional officers wield considerable authority
 within the areas under their jurisdiction, including, significantly, the authority to
 ban political meetings that they deem likely to threaten public order. Governors and
 divisional officers frequently exercised this authority during the year to ban meet-
 ings by opposition parties.
 The CPDM's longevity is best explained by the fact that the extensive powers it
 derives from the 1972 Constitution enable it to maintain itself in power. Opposition
 parties, recognizing that they are unlikely to win a significant measure of participa-
 tion in the governance of Cameroon under the present Constitution, have consist-
 entlry called for a process of constitutional reform that would lead to a greater decen-
 tralization of presidential power. On December 15, the President convened a con-
 sultative constitutional review committee to review a draft constitution prepared by
 the Government without outside consultation. The members of the committee were
 selected entirely by the President without reference to the wishes of any other
 groups or entities and were given 1 week to convey their responses to the Govern-
 ment's draft. The committee's deliberations were not open to public scrutiny. Far
 from mollifying opposition groups, this maneuver by the Government was seen as
 an effort to manipulate constitutional changes in a way that minimized public de-
 bate or broad participation.
 In April the Government attempted to ban a meeting of the All-Anglophone Con-
 ference (AAC). The AAC, a loose structure of Anglophone organizations primarily
 from Cameroon's Northwest and Southwest provinces, defied the ban and met se-
 cretly to discuss constitutional reform issues, primarily focusing on the creation of
 a federal system within Cameroon that would give the Anglophone West a greater
 degree of autonomy. Government officials expressed concern that the AAC planned
 to issue a call for secession by the Anglophone provinces. In their efforts to block
 the meeting, the Government first issued a ban order, then placed security forces
 around the scheduled meeting site. AAC delegates contravened the Government's ef-
 foits by holding a series of secret meetings. The delegates, rather than calling for
 secession, called for renewed efforts to negotiate a federal constitution within a rea-
 sonable time.
 The Government has focused its energies on weakening and destabilizing all
 sources of opposition to the hold exercised by the Beti ethnic group in the circle
 around the President and within the CPDM. However, while the President's inner
 circle is heavily drawn from his own Beti ethnic group, all levels of the administra-
 tion include significant numbers from other ethnic groups. There are no specific dis-
 criminatory laws prohibiting women or minorities from participating in government
 or in other areas of public life. Women are represented in the Presidents Cabinet
 (2 of 44 members), the National Assembly (21 of 180 members), the CPDM, the judi-
 cial system, and numerous state-run enterprises, although not in numbers propor-
 tional to their share of the population. Suffrage is universal at age 20.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights monitoring groups continued to operate.
 Nevertheless, the Government impeded their effectiveness through intimidation. It
 limited access to prisoners, delayed issuance of visas to international monitors, and,
 in the case of the governmental National Commission on Human Rights and Free-
 doms, withheld financial resources.
 Among numerous nongovernmental civic associations, some of the most active in-
 clude the National League for Human Rights, the Organization for Human Rights
 
 
 35
 and Freedoms, the Association of Women against Violence, the Cameroonian Asso-
 ciation of Female Jurists, the Cameroonian Association for Children's Rights, and
 the Human Rights Clinic and Education Center. Financial hardships, inexperience,
 and occasional- fear of government reprisals sometimes discouraged these groups
 from publicly criticizing the Government's human rights record. Nevertheless, sev-
 eral organizations issued press releases to denounce specific human rights abuses.
 In general the Government did not respond publicly to specific allegations of
 wrongdoing by human rights monitors. Instead, it issued a 'white paper" on the
 state of human rights in the country which was widely criticized by independent
 observers as an attempt to distort and justify its actual record of abuses. The ICRC
 did not visit prisoners in 1994 because past experience indicated that, even when
 the Government permitted ICRC access to prisons, it did not always provide access
 to detainees of particular concern. A few other international organizations conducted
 investigations, and one in particular, Paris-based Rapporteurs Sans Frontieres, de-
 nounced the Government's repeated detention of journalists. Amnesty International
 issued reports on several cases of alleged human rights abuses, and Article 19, a
 London-based organization, also investigated abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, enshrines freedom of reli-
 gion, and mandates that "everyone has equal rights and obligations." However, dis-
 crimination based on race, language, religion, or social status is not explicitly forbid-
 den.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions recognizing women's rights, women do
 not, in fact, enjoy the same rights and privileges as men. Polygyny is permitted by
 law and traditions but polyandy is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit
 from her husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will,
 and customs vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants
 greater authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the
 usran'a wishes determine custody of children over the age of 6. While a man may
 be convicted of adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may
 be convicted without regard to venue. In the northern provinces, traditional leaders
 (Lamidat) prevent their numerous wives from ever leaving the palace.
 Women's rights advocates report that violence against women has surged in re-
 cent years, and that the law does not impose effective penalties against violators.
 Spouse abuse is not a legal ground for divorce. In cases of sexual assault, a victim's
 family or village often imposes direct, summary punishment upon the suspected  r-
 petratr through means ranging from destruction of property to lynching. Whie
 there are no reliable statistics an violence against women, the number of newspaper
 reports indicates its frequency is high.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for a child's right to education, and school-
 ing is mandatory through age 14. Nevertheless, rising school fees and costs for
 books have forced many families to forego sending their children to school. Babies
 and small children are sometimes held in prison if their mothers are incarcerated.
 Familial child abuse is not common, but is one of several targeted issues of chil-
 dren's rights organizations.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been condemned by international
 health experts as dangerous to both physical and psychological health, is not prac-
 ticed widely but is practiced in some areas of Far orth and Southwest provinces.
 It includes the most severe and dangerous form of the abuse, infibulation, and is
 usually practiced on young, preadolescent girls. The Government does not recognize
 FGM as a problem and has allocated no resources to education on the issue.
 National/Racial/Ethni Minorities.-There are frequent and credible allegations
 of discrimination among Cameroon's more than 200 ethnic groups. President Biya's
 Beti ethnic group receives special preferences in all sectors affected by the Govern-
 ment. As a result, Betis hold a preponderanc of key positions in Government, the
 security forces, and the military._ 1n other sectors, discrimination by other ethnic
 groups is common. Virtually all ethnic groups tend to provide preferential treatment
 to fellow members of their group when they are able to do so.
 An important ethnic and political division falls along linguistic lines rooted in the
 colonial period. The Anglophone minority (20 percent) often charges that the
 Francophone majority does not share real power and that the Government provides
 fewer economic benefits to English-speaking regions. As noted in Section 3, the Gov-
 ernment tried to prevent the Second Annual Convention of the All-Anglophone Con-
 ference from taking place in Bamenda, the capital of Northwest province.
 Cameroon's indigenous population of Pygmies (a term which in fact encompasses
 several different ethnic groups) primarily resides in the forest areas of the south
 
 
 36
 and southeast. While no legal discrimination exists, other groups often treat the
 Baka as inferior and sometimes subject them to virtual slave labor.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution does not specifically protect the dis-
 abled. Lack of facilities and care is particularly acute for the mentally handicapped.
 Although Cameroonian society is generally tolerant of physical disabilities, which
 are commonplace, the Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code allows workers to form and
 join trade unions of their own choosing. It permits groups of at least 20 workers
 to organize a union but also requires registration with the Ministry of Labor. Provi-
 sions of the Labor Code do not apply to civil servants, employees of the penitentiary
 system, or workers responsible for national security. Some sections of the Labor
 Code have never taken effect, as not all of the implementing decrees have been is-
 sued. No new implementing decrees were issued in 1994.
 The National Union of Teachers of Higher Education (SYNES) applied in 1991 for
 legal status as a public service association, as did the National 1nion of Contract
 Officers and State Agents in 1994. At year's end, the Ministry of Public Service had
 not accorded legal status to either union. The Government also never responded to
 a 1993 finding by the International Labor Organization Committee on Freedom of
 Association that the Government was at fault for delays in registering SYNES, and
 for failure to respond to charges that its members were subject to harassment.
 The Labor Coae explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after man-
 datory arbitration. It provides for the protection of legal strikers and prohibits ret-
 ribution against them.
 As the economy contracted, the Government and state-owned enterprise sector fell
 behind in salary payments, and several strikes occurred. The civil servants' strike
 which had begun in December 1993 continued into February 1994. Since the Gov-
 ernment has never recognized civil servants' unions, it considered the strike illegal.
 In January, 11 members of the National Union of Secondary School Teachers
 SYNAES, were arrested, detained for 5 days at provincial police headquarters, and
 reportedly beaten. Subsequently, over 150 secondary school teachers were dis-
 missed, and at least 75 teachers had their salaries suspended. In addition, the presi-
 dent of SYNES and the president of the National Order of Cameroon Teachers as
 well as other leading activists in the strike were dismissed from their civil service
 positions.
 Despite an agreement between the Government and public sector employees in
 early March which barred any further punishment of civil servants who took part
 in the strike, many public sector employees complained of continued harassment
 and intimidation, including 11 professors at the University of Yaounde, who were
 suspended for "irregular absences." The 11 who were suspended were among the
 most active supporters of the strike.
 The only labor confederation is the Confederation of Cameroonian Trade Unions
 (CCTU), formerly affiliated with the ruling CPDM party under the name Organiza-
 tion of Cameroonian Trade Unions. The CCTU formally declared its political inde-
 pendence in 1992, but Secretary General Louis Sombes' attempts to exert that inde-
 pendence met with considerable government opposition in 1994. In April the CCTU
 President, also a member of the CPDM's Central Committee, dismissed Sombes in
 spite of the opposition of the remaining members of the CCTU Executive Commit-
 tee. When Sembes continued to exercise his duties as Secretary General, police de-
 tained him and several of his associates for several hours. Meanwhile, a new sec-
 retary general, appointed by the CCTU President, took office.
 In May the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) con-
 demned the actions of the police and of the CCTUPresident as 'actions which violate
 internationally recognized labor standards and practices as set out by conventions
 of the International Labor Organization." Nevertheless, in early September, police
 broke into CCTU headquarters, changed the locks on Sombes' office doors to bar his
 entry, and locked Sombes and his family out of their CCTU-owned official residence.
 Although a Yaounde court subsequently ruled that Sombes should be reinstated in
 his position, he had not regained access to his office by the end of the year.
 The CCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Org anize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargainingbetween workers and management in local workplaces, as well
 as between labor federations and business associations in each sector of the econ-
 omy. Nevertheless, no sectoral collective bargaining negotiations had been under-
 taken by the end of 1994.

 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to fines rann up to the equivalent of $2,000 (1 million
 CFA). However, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination do not have to
 reinstate the workers who have experienced discrimination. The Ministry of Labor
 reported no complaints of such discrimination in 1994.
 Three firms obtained approval in 1994 to operate under Cameroon's Industrial
 Free Zone regime, and four more submitted applications. Free zone employers are
 exempt from some provisions of the Labor Code but by law must respect all inter-
 nationally recognized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is offi-
 cially prohibited by the Labor Code. However, Cameroonian prisons continued to
 allow inmates to be contracted out to private employers or used as communal labor
 for municipal public works.
 There are credible reports that slavery continues to be practiced in the Lamidat
 of Rey Bouba, an isolated traditional kingdom in North province.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children The Labor Code establishes that
 no child may be employed before the age of 14. Ministry of Labor inspectors are re-
 spo nsible for enforcing the minimum age of employment but lack resources for an
 effective inspection program. In rural areas many children begin work at an early
 age on family farms. Often, rural youth, especially girls, are employed by relatives
 as domestics, while many urban street vendors are under 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all sec-
 tors. In 1993 the Prime Minister failed to sign a decree establishing the monthly
 minimum wage at approximately $80 (25,000 1993 CFA). The devaluation of the
 CFA in January rendered the proposed minimum wage unacceptable, and a new
 minimum wage had not been negotiated by the end of 1994.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours in public and pri-
 vate nonagricultural firms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The
 Code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of rest per week. The Govern-
 ment sets health and safety standards, and the Ministry of Labor Inspectors and
 Occupational Health Doctors are responsible for monitoring these standards. How-
 ever, they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program.
