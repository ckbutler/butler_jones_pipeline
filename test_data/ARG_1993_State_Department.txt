 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal, constitutional democracy with about 33 million inhab-
 itants. The President, Carlos Saul Menem of the Justicialist (Peronist) Party, was
 elected in 1989 through an electoral college for a single 6-year term. The
 Constitutionprovides for a bicameral legislature and an independent judiciary. The
 executive traditicnally is the dominant branch at the federal level. Since the end
 of military rule in 1983, there have been two national presidential elections as well
 as numerous midterm elections for Congress and provincial governments, the most
 recent in October 1993. President Menem is not now eligible for reelection in 1995;
 however, efforts were being made to amend the Constitution to allow for a second
 consecutive term.
 The President is the constitutional commander in chief, and a civilian Defense
 Minister oversees the armed forces. Responsibility for maintaining law and order is
 shared by the Federal Police, which report to the Interior Minister, the Border Po-
 lice and the Coast Guard, which report to the Defense Minister; and the provincial
 police reporting toprovincial governments. There were continued abuses of police
 authority in 1993, although fewer than in previous years.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial, and service economy that grew
 rapidly and experienced significant changes. An economic reform program is in-
 tended to convert a centrally controlled economy into one more responsive to market
 forces. The program reduced inflation dramatically by sharply increasing revenue
 collection, fixing the exchange rate, privatizing virtually all major state enterprises,
 and opening the economy to vigorous competition from    imports. These changes
 forced the business community to increase productivity in order to stay competitive,
 often through significant investment in labor-saving technology.
 The Constitution provides for a wide range of freedoms andguarantees. Neverthe-
 less, institutional weaknesses, political partisanship, government failure to punish
 human rights violators, and the legacy of authoritarian rule resulted in failure to
 protect individual rights fully. This was particularly true in the case of extrajudicial
 killings, often committed with impunity and instances of police brutality. There
 were also many threats and incidents of aggression against the media, as well as
 attempts to monitor ideological activities of students and others. Societal violence
 against women continued to be a problem, with little visible effort by the Govern-
 ment to combat it. The Government failed to comply with a law that calls for indem-
 nification of those who suffered torture or detention during military rule.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no credible reports of politi-
 cally motivated killings carried out by government forces in 1993. Police were in-
 volved, however, in a number of extrajudicial killings, often with impunity.
 In Cordoba, an internal investigation of the death in 1989 of a taxi driver revealed
 in February that two police officers who had tried to extort money from the driver
 had killed him. The two were arrested and remanded to a civilian court pending
 trial. An off-duty policeman working as a security guard at a discotheque killed a
 14-year-old boy in Haedo Buenos Aires province. In nearby Quilmes, two Bolivian
 boys were shot and killed by a policeman as they exited a church. Le,-al action was
 initiated against both policemen. The efficacy of legal actions of this nature varies
 widely, however, depending on the court within whose jurisdiction the case falls, the
 attitude of local authorities, and the efficacy of police internal review mechanisms.
 The 1991 murder of Radical Party politician Regino Maders was still not resolved
 by the end of 1993, although ex-police sergeant Carlos Guidone was arrested in Feb-
 ruary on suspicion of involvement in the case. Maders was thought to have been
 killed because of his investigation into alleged corruption in the privatization of a
 provincial electric utility company. There were credible reports of attempts to in-
 timidate witnesses in the case, and of political interference with the investigation.
 b. Disappearance. -Unresolved disappearances that may have been attributable
 to the police took place in 1993. On August 17, Miguel Bro disappeared shortly after
 he filed a complaint for abuse of authority against the La Plata police for raiding
 his home without a search warrant. Bru's parents attempted unsuccessfully to reg-
 ister his disappearance, but the police refused to accept the report. It was finally
 accepted at the police station where Bru's father worked. A judicial inquiry has
 commenced.
 In the 1992 disappearance of Pablo Guardati, who was reportedly abducted by
 four policemen in Mendoza and seen in police custody by a witness 73 days later,
 a body was positively identified as that of Guardati in June. The 4 policemen most
 
 
 349
 directly involved were detained for questioning; 10 officers involved in the coverup
 were reassigned, and 4 officers were charged with attempting to pay bribes for false
 testimony.
 Hundreds of children whose biological parents disappeared during the 1976-83
 military dictatorship were-either innocently or fraudulently-adopted by others.
 Largely as a result of pressure from the "Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo"
 I up, a National Commission on the Right to Identity was created in the Interior
 Ministry in November 1992. According to this group, in 1993 there were still some
 500 children whose true identity had not been established or restored. In the case
 of the Reggiardo-Tolosa twins, fraudulently adopted by police officer Samuel Miara
 and his wife after their biological parents were murdered, a federal court nullified
 the adoption; charged Miara with falsification of official documents; canceled their
 fraudulent birth certificates and other documents; and in May ordered that their
 true surname be restored. Miara is serving a sentence for fraud and the twins were
 temporarily housed in a foster home in anticipation of a custody award to their bio-
 logical relatives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture which are similar to those for homicide, from 8 to 15 years in prison. The level
 of reported incidents of police brutality, particularly directed against young men, de-
 clined somewhat from 1992. At the same time, disciplinary and legal action against
 police officers accused of beating and killing youths continued. In mid-July the Sec-
 retary for Security of Buenos Aires province announced broad new measures to con-
 trol the police and improve their image. As a result, at least 1,000 provincial police
 were separated from the force.
 In Rosario, Santa Fe province, two police officers were suspended from the force
 during the investigation of charges that they had tried to extort money from two
 I ouths, aged 19 and 15, and, failing in their objective, beat them and shot at them.
 n addition, an internal police investigation of the two officers' actions was pursued.
 At Villa Carlos Paz, near Cordoba, two police were arrested in March for torturing
 a suspect during interrogation, and a third officer was suspended for covering up
 the crime.
 Prison conditions vary widely, but on the whole are acceptable. Many of the facili-
 ties are old, and some are dilapidated and crowded, but the primary complaints
 seemed to be the lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in some facilities. Conjuga visits
 are permitted in some prisons, depending upon the facilities available. Abuse of
 prisoners by guards is punished in at least some cases. In Santa Fe, in April, 12
 guards were suspended and tried for abusing 4 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-Although the Penal Code contains ex-
 plicit protections for individual rights and places limits on the arrest and investiga-
 tory powers of the police and judiciary, the laws are often ignored and meaningful
 sanctions seldom applied against those who break them.
 The Interior Ministry conducted courses for public officials designed to heighten
 awareness about human rights issues, and the Justice Ministry attempted to edu-
 cate the public about the legal rights of detainees. The Government created an om-
 budsman to oversee the observance of individual rights in the prison system.
 A December 1991 law provided compensation (in government bonds) for those who
 were illegally detained and held by the executive or the armed forces during the
 1976-83 military dictatorship. The Interior Ministry has ap proved 4,000 of the
 8,300 requests submitted for indemnity a yents. The lengthy process produced
 many complaints from those people who believe themselves entitled to compensa-
 tion. The Supreme Court is responsible for settling disputes over the amount of com-
 pensation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution and Penal Code call for trials
 before panels of udges using written presentations and for appellate review of all
 judicial rulings. The system of oral public trials in penal cases, instituted in Septem-
 ber 1992 functioned on a partial basis in 1993. Once fully implemented and funded,
 oral triafs may significantly accelerate rulings in the judicial process. The right to
 bail is provided by law and recognized in practice.
 While the judicial system is independent and impartial in theory, there were con-
 tinued allegations that the executive branch exercised undue influence on the
 courts. Growing public awareness of the shortcomings of the system, which is slow
 and cumbersome, had an impact on official actions. The first oral tribunal in the
 federal capital freed a young man accused of robbery in June because he had not
 been notiled by theprosecutor of his right to refuse to testify against himself. In
 one notorious case of a prisoner who was detained for 7 yearswithout ever having
 been convicted of a crime, the detainee was released in July.
 
 
 The independence and indeed, the physical safety of judges werealso affected by
 threats and attacks on their persons. There is credible reason to believe such at-
 tacks were sometimes perpetrated by the police or the military. A federal judge in
 La Plata who had been investigating the involvement of military personnel in a
 band of highwaymen was threatene and his daughter was almost kidnaped. Un-
 known persons sent the judge a series of photogaphs showing his mother, his
 daughter, and his house. The house of a judge in Lomas de Zamora (Buenos Aires
 province) was fired upon by unknown individuals in July, and provincial authorities
 acknowledged that virtually all of the federal judges working in the province have
 received threats at one time or another. Two judges, one i-n Parana (Entre Rios
 province) and one in Rosari, received threats related to trials of corrupt police offi-
 cers and narcotics traffickers. The Government's response to these threats was to
 offer poice protection while investigating the incidents.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Corr-espondence.-eAl-
 though prohibited by the Constitution from doing so, the Government someties
 intrudled into the lives of private citizens. With the privatization and modernization
 of the telephone service, denunciations of telephone tapping diminished. However,
 reports continue of illegal monitoring by government agencies and private entities.
 The Government reserves the right to monitor telephones in special cases, with a
 court order. An October 1992 presidential decree assigned the State Intelligence
 Secretariat (SIDE) supervision of judicially ordered telephone taps, replacing an of-
 lice that existed in the formerly state-owned telephone company. A federal judge
 questioned the decision to place this authority within the national executive.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-In its September 1992 presentation to the Inter-
 American Press Society meeting in Madrid, the National Editors and Publishers As-
 sociation (ADEPA) characterized that year as the worst year for freedom of expres-
 sion since the return of democracy in 1983. The problems that characterized 1992
 continued in 1993. The most serious problem in the area of freedom of expression
 was the heightened level of threats and overt aggression against reporters, radio
 and television stations, media personalities, union leaders, and opposition politi-
 cians.
 Two journalists were attacked physically, one on two occasions. Marcelo Bonelli,
 a reporter for Clai and Radio Mitre who was investigating the activities of govern-
 ment drug "Czar" Alberto Lestelle, was assaulted by two men on his way to the
 radio station. Then Deputy Interior Minister Gerardo Conte Grand admitted that
 the attack was probablyp art of an "intimidation campaign," while President Menem
 condemned the attack, denivany official involvement, but improbably attributed
 the incident to those who wanted to make the Government look bad.
 The second case involved journalist Hernan Lopez Echague of Buenos Aires daily
 Pagina 12. He was investigating reports that a gang of thugs operating out of Bue-
 nos Aires' central market was being used to mabilize support or Peronists and to
 intimidate opponents. Lo pez Echague was first attacked by two men on August 25.
 On August 30, Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf announced that two men had been
 arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attack. They were released 2 days later,
 however, after Lopez Echagne was unable to make a positive identification. In state-
 ments to the press they accused the police of planting incriminating evidence on
 them at the time of their arrest.
 Lopez Echague was attacked a second time on September 9 in a Buenos Aires
 suburb. Two men forced him into a car where, with the help of a third, they bludg-
 eoned him unconscious. He was then driven several blocks and dumped. President
 Menem and government officials strongly condemned both attacks and attributed
 them to unspecified enemies of the Government who were attempting to undermine
 its support prior to the October elections. An alleged witness provided the license
 plate number of the vehicle used by the assailants. A search of provincial records
 revealed that a similar automobile was registered to the Buenos Aires orovincial
 government, but records indicated that it had not been used the night of toe attack.
 The crk dibility of the witness was questioned, and President Menem appointed a
 Special Prosecutor to investigate the case, but as of year's end the identity of Lopez
 Echague's assailar~ts was unknown.
 President Menem ordered the government television station to restore a political
 commentca program which had been canceled by station managers after it revealed
 unflattering a.pects of the Governments purchase of a new presidential aucraft. A
 federal court absolved the producers of the satiric television program  er Es
 Nad" of libel charges brought by a military oMiicer who alleged that he had been
 defamed by a comedy program about Argentine particiption in the Persian Gulf
 war. In March, in a suit brought by the Government related to an investigation into
 
 
 351
 the adulteration of wine a federal judge ruled that it is not unlawful for journalists
 to interview a fugitive from justice and that a journalist who refuses to reveal his
 sources is not guilty of concealment. Finally, in May the Senate repealed a statute
 penalizing offenses against the dignity of a public official.
 The number of reported telephone threats increased during the June to October
 pre-electoral period. Journalists working for the newsmagazine Somos, for Buenos
 Aires daily La Nacion, for a television station in Quilmes, for the newspaper La Ma-
 nana in Formosa province, for Radio Continental and the television station Telefe
 in Buenos Aires, for El Cronista in Buenos Aires, and for the daily La Capital in
 Rosario all received telephone threats. A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an FM sta-
 tion in huenos Aires, and a similar transmitter in Santiago del Estero province was
 deliberately burned. A journalist in Salta was arrested in April and a tape that she
 had made during an interview with a public official was confiscated by police. A
 print media journalist's car was firebombed in Buenos Aires in May, and a reporter
 or Clarin had his camera snatched from him and smashed by an unidentified per-
 son in June.
 A government initiative in June was widely condemned as an effort to muzzle the
 independent press. An official communique announced the Government's intention
 to seek a new radio broadcasting law; to license new television stations; to enforce
 legal provisions regarding broadcast transmissions; to ensure equal access to news-
 print- and to enforce antimonopoly laws. The communique asserted that the Govern-
 ment a objective was to prevent the kind of monopoly over information that charac-
 terized Argentina before the return to democracy in 1983.
 The media reaction was immediate and negative. ADEPA and the Inter-American
 Press Society expressed concern. The day after the communique appeared, two of
 President Menem's ministers denied that the Government was seeking to control
 the media. Although the President reiterated his plans to send legislation to Con-
 gress that would impose limitations on radio broadcasting, no bill was sent by year's
 end.
 Academic freedom was generally respected, but in June the press reported that
 the provincial police ordered the gathering of information on student political activi-
 ties and ideologies. Evidence of similar attempts to gather information on student
 activities subsequently surfaced in several other locales of Buenos Aires province
 and in the provinces of Neuquen, Corrientes, Misiones, Cordoba, and Tucuman.
 Then Interior Minister Gustavo Beliz testified that the order to update intelligence
 files had been issued under his predecessor and was a "bureaucratic mistake."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws pro-
 vide for the right of groups and political parties to assemble and demonstrate. Retir-
 ees, pubic school teachers, students, gay rights groups, farmers, political activists,
 and other organizations exercised this rght, generally without interference. Never-
 theless, local authorities sometimes interpreted these constitutional protections re-
 strictively, as in the case of 25 members of a government workers union who were
 detained briefly in Jujuy province in September for demonstrating in demand of bet-
 ter wages.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion
 but gives the Roman Catholic Church a privileged position in society. Only a Roman
 Catholic may be elected President, and many institutions are, in practice, closed to
 Jews. Missionaries are free to proselytize provided they register with the Secretar-
 iat of Worship in the Foreign Ministry. The number of Protestant and evangelical
 groups has risen.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Documented international travel, internal travel, and emigration re-
 mained unrestricted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 For over a decade Argentina has held periodic, free elections to choose federal,
 provincial, and local officials. Universal, adult suffrage is obligatory in national elec-
 tions. The Constitution and Civil Code provide for full participation in the national
 political process, regardless of sex, ethnic background, or national origin. Although
 rsident Menem was ineligible for reelection in 1995, efforts were being made to
 amend the Constitution to, among other changes, allow for a second consecutive
 term.
 A 1991 law mandating that 30 percent of the candidates on party lists be women
 was in force for the October 1993 legislative elections. In late September, the Su-
 preme Court ruled that a female candidate for the Chamber of Deputies for Entre
 Rios province should be ranked high enough on the Peronist party list of candidates
 to give her reasonable assurance, based on the number of deputies that the party
 
 
 returned in the 1991 elections, that she would be elected. The October elections saw
 26 women elected for the first time to the Chamber of Deputies. One female deputy
 was reelected, and seven female deputies continue to serve the balance of terms to
 which they were elected 2 years before.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights monitoring groups operate freely without government restric-
 tion or interference. The Ministry of the Interior has a Sub-Secretary for Human
 Rights. Among the measures designed to control police abuses and improve their
 image are special courses on human rights issues organized by the Ministry and the
 creation in early December of a national ombudsman or people's defender. There
 were no requests by international or nongovernmental organizations to investigate
 human rights abuses in 1993, but the Government has been cooperative in this re-
 gard.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Sex, Race, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of the above criteria. There is no
 evidence of a systematic effort to abridge these rights by the federal or local govern-
 ments, or by private groups or individuals.
 Women.-The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens, provisions
 which are generally reflected in civil, penal, and labor law. Nonetheless, women en-
 counter discrimination in the workplace, especially the growing number of urban
 women who also are heads of household. Women's groups charge that employed
 women are disproportionately found in the lower ranking positions in the lowest
 paid sectors of the formal economy and in unregulated and underpaid work in the
 informal economy. They also report increasing numbers of women seek employment
 in the informal economy owing to lack of training opportunities and scarcity of child
 care and other provisions to assist working women in the formal sector.
 The Government created the National omen's Council in 1991 to develop and
 coordinate women's policies; it reports to the Presidency. The Council promotes
 equal opportunity for women and nondiscriminatory education, training, and ori-
 entation programs, as well as special programs for women at risk. The problems of
 spousal a use and violence against women are drawing more public attention, but
 there are no government programs aimed at combating such abuse.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the protection of children
 and the defense of their human rights and welfare. Historially, Argentina has been
 a leader in Latin America in programs to provide public education, health protec-
 tion, and rereational servies for all children, regardless of class or economic status.
 Endemic economic problems over the past three decades, however, have made it dif-
 ficult for the State and for society in general to attain these high standards.
 Indigenous People.-The degree to which indigenous peoples participate in the po-
 litical process, their exercise of civil rights, and the extent of their control over natu-
 ral resources and land varies widely from one ethnic group to another, and from one
 region of the country to another. The indigenous population, estimated at 100,000,
 is concentrated at the northern and southern extremities of the country. The prov-
 ince with the highest concentration of indigenous peoples, Chaco, has about 30,000
 native peoples divided into three nations. Like most of Argentina's indigenous peo-
 ples, their indices of undernourishment, illiteracy, tuberculosis and other diseases,
 and unemployment are higher than national averages.
 In 1987 Congress passed a law designed to return Indian lands. It has yet to be
 implemented. In 1990 President Menem implemented a 1924 law granting some
 150,000 hectares of land to one of the Chaco nations and budgeted the equivalent
 of $150,000 to undertake a survey and delimitation of individual plots. The survey,
 however, did not take place because competing national and provincial authorities
 could not agree who would carry it out and how it would be funded.
 Religious Minorities.-There were fewer incidents of overt anti-Semitism in 1993
 than in previous years. A Jewish cemetery in Formosa province was desecrated in
 late 1992, and in September 1993 the large cemetery at La Tablada, Buenos Aires
 province, was vandalized. The Government's 1992 decision to make public old files
 purportedly dealing with the immigration of an estimated 60,000 former Nazis to
 Argentina after World War II attracted attention again in 1993, when the local Jew-
 ish community and others criticized the Government's failure to follow through with
 access to significant records, including central bank archives that may contain evi-
 dence of large currency transfers in that era.
 People with Disabilities.-Disabled persons' rights are protected by law, and some
 provisions have been made (i.e., curb ramps in some urban areas) to accomodate
 
 
 persons with physical disabilities. A comprehensive federal law protects the rights
 of disabled persons and mandates special concessions in employment, but its observ-
 ance is di icult to judge. The media generally highlight instances in which the
 rights of the disabled appear to be violated or ignored, such as in the case of a 19-
 year-old woman in Buenos Aires with Down's syndrome who was banned from vot-
 ing in the October elections. Such reports were infrequent.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-With the exception of military personnel, all workers
 are free to form unions. The labor movement is organized in a large, national labor
 central, the General Labor Confederation (CGT), and represents about one-third of
 the work force. Each province has a local CGT, and some large national unions (e.g.,
 commercial workers, automobile workers, metallurgical workers, light and power
 workers) are sig.ificant economic and political powers. Some factions of the CGT
 were quite hostile to the Menem Government's proposed reform of laws governing
 labor, social security, and social welfare because they were perceived as a threat to
 the traditional economic and political power of Peronist labor.
 In response, and with an eye to the October elections, the Government
 downplayed these initiatives, thus helping to solidify Menem's support among tradi-
 tionally Pernist organized labor. On the other hand, the International Labor Orga-
 nization's (ILO) Committee of Experts concluded that the text of a draft amendment
 prepared by the Government did not go far enough in removing excessive conditions
 set out in Act No. 23561 for granting trade union status, noting that a trade union
 at the enterprise level could only be granted status when another union did not al-
 ready exist within the same unit or area of activity.
 Unions have the right to strike, subject to compulsory conciliation and arbitration
 by the Labor Ministry. Union members and leaders who participate in strikes and
 other activities are protected by law. Several unions, especially education workers,
 exercised that right in 1993 without government interference. Argentine unions are
 free to associate internationally, and some leaders play active roles in regional and
 international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-These rights are protected by
 federal law throughout the country; complementary provincial labor laws often go
 beyond these rights. Antilabor practices are prohibited. Labor and management are
 legally bound by collective bargaining agreements which, in theory, set basic wage
 levels and working conditions on an industry wide basis. In practice, particularly
 in the last 5 years, these agreements have tended to be less global in their scope,
 with the current trend in both practice and theory moving toward company- and in
 some cases region-specific agreements. The Federal Government's role in this proc-
 ess is limited to ratifying these contracts to give them legal status. The ILO's Com-
 mittee on Freedom of Association, however, asked the Government to remove limita-
 tions on collective bargaining, imposed in 1991 as a stabilization measure, which ex-
 clude wage indejntion agreements and require that wage increases be based on pro-
 ductivity gains.  The labor reform bill introdued in Congress in 1993 would give
 management more flexibility to hire and fire, more control over hours and vacations,
 and would further reduce the Government's role in labor-management relations.
 In December the Supreme Court upheld the executive branch's annulment of 65
 labor contracts affecting 15 unions in the port and maritime sector. The Court's de-
 cision had its origins in a decree issued in mid-1992 which struck down all labor
 contracts affecting maritime and port activities as part of the administration's pro-
 jected reform of that sector. Previous to the Supreme Court's decision, a Labor Court
 had asserted that the decree was unconstitutional. The affected unions have filed
 a complaint with the ILO.
 Workers may not be fired for participating in legal union activities and those who
 prove they have been discriminated against have the right to be reinstated.
 There are no officially designated export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and is not known to be practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age, except within the family, is illegal. Minors aged 14 to 18 may work
 in restricted tys of employment with regard to hours and safety and health condi-
 tions, although exceptions are allowed in cases of extreme necessity. A recent in-
 crease in the level of unemployment encouraged some families to send their children
 out to seek work, often resulting in the illegal employment of minors, mostly in the
 informal sector and on farms. Federal and provincial labor authorities were not well
 equipped tocope with this situation due to budgetary and personnel limitations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national minimum wage is $200 (200
 pesos) a month.
 
 
 Federal labor laws contain elaborate, albeit somewhat inflexible, provisions for
 guaranteeing acceptable conditions of work, especially with regard to hours, rest pe-
 riods, safety and health, and job security. The maximum workday is 8 hours, and
 the maximum workweek is 48 hours. Premiums are paid for work beyond those lim-
 its, which is frequently the case, as employers seek greater productivity without
 having to acquire legal obligations to new workers under the present system.
 Federally legislated occupational and health standards are comprehensive but the
 Federal Government and many provincial governments lack the resources and train-
 ing to enforce them, despite union vigilance against violations. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthful work situations, after
 having gone through a claim procedure, without jeopardy to continued employment.
 Nevertheless, workerswho leave the workplace before it has been proven unsafe run
 the risk of being fired; in such cases, the worker has a right to judicial appeal. Ac-
 cording to Labor Ministry authorities, this appeal process can take up to 5 years.
 Worker lawsuits provoked by on-the-job injury or job-related disability remain a
 major industry, and a very large number of retirees are on disability, both legiti-
 mate and questionable. Much of the work force, including children, is employed in
 small owner-operated enterprises, making it difficult to enforce workers' rights as
 well as health and safety standards.
