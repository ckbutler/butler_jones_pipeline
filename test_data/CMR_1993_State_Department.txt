 CAMEROON
 Despite democratic reforms begun in 1990, political power remained in the hands
 of the President, Paul Biya, and a small circle of advisers drawn primarily from his
 own ethnic groupand the former single party, the Cameroon People's Democratic
 Movement (CPDM). Biya was reelected in October 1992 in presidential elections
 marred by widespread irregularities, ascribed largely to the Government by inter-
 national observers. In contrast, the March 1992 legislative elections were generally
 considered free and fair by international observers, and some opposition parties
 gained representation in the National Assembly-while others boycotted the vote.
 The elections have not significantly diminished the authority of the President, since
 the present Constitution, which dates from the one-party era, imposes few legisla-
 tive or judicial checks on executive power.
 The flawed presidential vote cast a shadow over Cameroonian politics throughout
 1993. The President announced steps to reform the Constitution. At the end of the
 year, however, the Government still had not convened the promised constitutional
 consultative committee, which had been envisioned to be broadly representative of
 Cameroonian society; nor had it published the text of the constitution as revised by
 the government-dominated Technical Committee.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national police, the National
 Intelligence Service (CENER), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration (MINAT), military intelligence (SEMIL), the army, and to a lesser extent,
 the Presidential Security Service. MINAT is in charge of prisons, and its local offi-
 cials (prefects or senior divisional officers) are responsible for invoking security
 forces to maintain order. The police, which includes a special security force, the
 Mixed Mobile Brigade (BMM), and the gendarmerie have the dominant role in en-
 forcing internal security laws. As in previous years, security forces, including the
 BMM, committed numerous human rights abuses.
 Cameroon has a strong, diversified agricultural base and a small but important
 petroleum sector, which produces 50 percent of export earnings. With a per capita
 g oss domestic product (GDP) of about $800 in 1992-93, the country ranked among
 t e lower middle-income developing countries. Per capita GDP has fallen by about
 50 percent since 1986, due to population growth of nearly 3 percent per year, declin-
 ing oil production, slow adjustment to a drop in the world prices of Cameroon's
 major exports, and the effects of corruption. Self-sufficiency in food production helps
 
 
 mitigate the effects of shrinking export earnings and a gwing foreign debt burden.
 Private economic activity is hindered by a bloated pub ic corporation sector, lack of
 fiscal integrity, and uneven judicial enforcement of contracts and property rights.
 There were serious human rights abuses, including political and extraju dicial
 killings. Security forces fired on peaceful opposition demonstrators in March, killing
 2 persons and wounding more than 20. Security forces continued to engage in arbi-
 trary detention--over 100 persons were detained on 1 day in November-and phys-
 ical mistreatment to intimidate opposition leaders. They routinely beat persons de-
 tained in connection with common crimes. Although Cameroon's independent news-
 papers circulated widely and criticized the administration, the authorities used a va-
 riety of techniques to intimidate the press, e.g., arresting or bringing libel suits
 against some prominent journalists. The former labor wing of the ruling party con-
 tinued to dominate the labor movement, and there were no other independent
 unions authorized. Societal discrimination against women also continued to be a se-
 rious problem.
 On May 26, a military tribunal convicted and sentenced one military officer and
 five soldiers for their roles in the January 1992 summary executions of Choa Arabs
 in Kousseri. The officer and one of the soldiers were sentenced to death and the re-
 maining four soldiers were given prison sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years; four
 others were found innocent of similar charges. The six convictions are under appeal.
 The trial was the first case in which members of the security forces were publicly
 tried for human rights offenses. Generally, security force personnel commit even the
 most egregious abuses with impunity; persons reporting such abuses are more likely
 to be punished than are the perpetrators (see Section L.a.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHIS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were several incidents of po-
 litical and extrajudicial killing, some attributable to government security forces.
 While in their custody March 16-20, gendarmes beat to death Louis Abondo
 Langvoue, who was detained in connection with a theft in Bertoua, East Province.
 An autopsy report, corroborated by photographs and statements from the presiding
 medical examiner, concluded that Abondo had died from "severe continuous trauma,
 dehydration, and shock" due to "severe, merciless, and indiscriminate beating." As
 of late December, the Government had initiated no investigation or disciplinary ac-
 tion in the case but had suspended the medical examiner from his post.
 Using excessive force, gendarmes fired into a crowd of opposition demonstrators
 in Bamenda on March 25, killing 2 and wounding 20. The incident occurred during
 the second in a series of peaceful demonstrations held without legal authorization
 by the opposition Union for Change. According to eyewitness accounts, a cordon of
 30 gendarmes initially fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of some 500 seated dem-
 ï¿½onstrators. As the crowd began to scatter, at least two gendarmes fired into the
 crowd. After issuing a public statement which blamed the deaths and injuries on
 opposition supporters armed with home-made weapons, the Prime Minister estab-
 lI hed a commission of inquiry composed entirely of government security officials.
 Its conclusion that gendarmes had fired in self-defense was belied by eyewitness ac-
 counts of the incident and the lack of any casualties among the gendarmes.
 On January 17, outside Bafoussam, West Province, unknown assailants abducted
 Cameroon Democratic Union (CDU) Vice President Benjamin Menga from his car
 and beat, stabbed, and shot him. He died 6 days later of his injuries. Since Menga
 was not robbed, his death was widely thought to be politically motivated. CDU offi-
 cials charged that Menga was a victim of a rival opposition party, the Social Demo-
 cratic Front, whose members had allegedly threatened him. However, the charges
 that Men a's death was politically motivated have not been substantiated. As of
 year's end, no suspects had been charged, and the investigation appeared to have
 lost momentum.
 In May members of the Palace Guard (Dogari) of the Lamido of Rey Bouba, a
 progovernment traditional ruler in North Province, killed 20 persons in countering
 a decision by villagers in Mbanre to install a pro-opposition chief. In the skirmishes,
 townspeople also killed three members of the Dogari with poisoned arrows. The
 nearest gendarmerie detachment, located in Belel, declined to intervene when in-
 formed of the fighting.
 In June there were reports that gendarmerie and army units shot and killed eight
 Choa Arabs who had been detained for alleged banditry and illegal possession of
 weapons in Far North Province. The Choas charged that they were ethnically tar-
 geted by the gendarmerie forces, but in the highly emotional ethnic rivalries of the
 northern region, it has not been possible to confirm or disprove this. The charge was
 
 
 34
 based on allegations of personal vendettas by certain gendarmerie officers; on the
 other hand, the Choa Arabs have politically voted with the Government and have
 also been identified frequently among the highway bandits that plague the north.
 On November 25, 1993, Yaounde police reportedly shot and killed Moise Fokou,
 a 23-year-old street vendor, in Yaounde's Mokolo market area. Published photo-
 graphs of the vendor's body and eyewitness accounts suggested that the vendor was
 in handcuffs at the time of his death.
 In December there were credible reports that 23-year-old Cyprain Tonwie Ndifor
 was beaten and later died while in gendarmerie custody in Northwest Province.
 However, no detailed investigation of the case had been completed at the end of the
 year.
 The Government seldom punishes abuses by security force members. Officials
 argue that publicly disclosing such abuses involving security forces would hurt mili-
 tary and police morale and thereby undermine their effectiveness. In a notable ex-
 ception, a military tribunal tried 10 soldiers and gendarmes, including 2 officers, for
 the January 1992 summary execution of 5 Choa Arabs in Far North Province. In
 a decision handed down by a Yaounde military tribunal on May 26, five of the ac-
 cused, including one officer, were found guilty. Two of the guilty were sentenced to
 death. As of December 31, an appeal was pending in the case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of long-term disappearance. However,
 police and gendarmes frequently failed to inform detainees' family members or at-
 torneys of their whereabouts. For example, when police detained nearly 100 mem-
 bers of the opposition Union of Cameroonian Democratic Forces (UFDC) party on
 March 31, they did not inform family members who had to visit numerous detention
 facilities before finding them. Similarly, when plice detained journalist and Union
 for Change administrative secretary Francois Borgia Marie Evembe on August 19,
 they notified neither his family nor his attorney. After nearly 2 days of searching,
 family members located him in a Yaounde police cell.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence
 obtained thereby, and prohibits public servants from using force against any person,
 there were many credible reports of security forces inflicting severe beatings, sys-
 tematic torture, and other inhuman treatment (see Section l.a.). Sanctions against
 those responsible are rare, although the Government maintains that they face ad-
 ministrative punishments which are not made public.
 The security forces follow a pattern of degrading mistreatment of detainees, in-
 cluding stripping, confinement in severely overcrowded cells, and denial of access to
 toilets or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes routinely beat detainees
 to extract confessions and the names and whereabouts of other alleged criminals.
 In particular, they often beat them on the soles of their feet with an iron bar or
 whip them with a reinforced rubber tube.
 For example, security forces beat Social Democratic Front (SDF) economic adviser
 Joseph Kwi and other opposition supporters in this manner; they had been detained
 for participation in the March and April peaceful protest demonstrations. Similarly,
 security forces beat Victorin Hameni Bieleu, President of the opposition UFDC
 party, who was detained March 31 to April 8 with approximately 100 of his support-
 ers, on the soles of his feet; he also suffered blows to the eye. While in custody, secu-
 rity forces awakened Francois Borgia Marie Evembe during the night and subjected
 him to lengthy interrogation, sometimes lasting 6 or 7 hours (see Section lb.).
 In May Secretary of State for Internal Security Jean Fochive issued a directive
 to all police officers stating that numerous abuses of detainees had come to his at-
 tention and that future incidents would result in disciplinary action-including de-
 motion of those responsible. In the directive, which Fochive publicly acknowledged,
 he specifically cited whippings, beatings on the soles of feet, and beatings adminis-
 tered as detainees hung suspended from the ceiling (the so-called balancoire) as un-
 acceptable practices.
 Nevertheless, released members of the opposition Union for Change reported in
 November that they had been beaten on the soles of their feet and then forced to
 stand or walk. In some cases, police demanded money from the detainees, threaten-
 ing more severe threatment if they refused.
 Prison conditions are life threatening, especially outside major urban areas. An
 18-year-old convicted thief died in the Buca prison in July after suffering from acute
 malnutrition. An August 8 newscast on government-controlled television revealed
 serious deficiencies in food, health care, and sanitation even in New Bell prison lo-
 cated in Douala, Cameroon's largest city. Overcrowding is severe throughout the
 penitentiary system. For example, lBamenda's central prison houses more than three
 times the number of inmates for which it was built. Some traditional rulers in
 
 
 northern Cameroon maintain private prisons which operate outside the authority of
 the government penitentiary system. Prisoners are sometimes chained in their cells.
 Conditions are worst at isolated Tchollire II prison, where inadequate food and
 medical attention reportedly caused at least 40 deaths between 1990 and 1992
 among the inmates. The authorities have refused requests by foreign diplomats to
 visit the prison. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which re-
 opened its office in Cameroon in 1992, suspended visits to prisons and detention
 centers following the Government's refusal to permit ICRC representatives access
 to some detainees. Women held in custody do not appear to be targeted for rape or
 abuse by security or prison personnel.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary, prolonged detention remained
 a serious problem. In particular, the security forces failed to implement fully the
 Penal Code requirement that detainees be brought before a magistrate within estab-
 lished time frames, and have held detainees incommunicado.
 By law, a person detained in connection with a common crime may be held in cus-
 tody up to 24 hours before being charged. That period may be renewed three times.
 However, the law only provides for habeas corpus in the few majority-Anglophone
 areas of the country; elsewhere, the Francophone legal tradition applies, precluding
 judicial authorities from acting on a case until the administrative authority that or-
 dered the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. After a magistrate has
 issued a warrant to bring the case to trial, the detainee may be held in "pretrial
 detention" indefinitely pending court action. Furthermore, a 1990 law permits de-
 tention without charge for renewable periods of 15 days "in order to combat ban-
 ditry." Persons taken into detention are frequently denied access to both legal coun-
 sel and family members. The law permits release on bail only in the Anglophone
 provinces, where the legal system includes some features of British common law.
 Even there, bail is granted infrequently.
 The Government repeatedly detained opposition activists on political grounds, as
 in the cases of Francois Borgia Marie Evembe, Joseph Kwi, and Victor Hameni
 Bieleu (see Sections 2.b. and 2.c.). Other politically motivated detentions occurred
 on August 28, when SDF Northwest Province coordinator Joseph Akonteh was held
 for 2 days on the eve of an opposition-led general strike, and on September 8, when
 Littoral Province coordinator Leolin Nja Kwa was taken into custody for 3 days.
 Both men were released without charge after their detention. Neither was phys-
 ically harmed during these incidents. In October the police detained the spouse and
 children of opposition figure Jean Michel Nintcheu. The wife and three children
 under 10 years of age were detained for approximately 10 days without charges.
 The most serious instance of arbitrary detention was the arrest in November of
 approximately 100 persons in connection with the opposition coalition, the Union for
 ange. The detainees were questioned about their affiliation with the Union for
 Change and their intentions to attend a press conference given by John Fru Ndi,
 the leader of the main opposition party, the SDF. All detainees were released with-
 out charge within 48 hours of their arrest. Nearly all rank and file Union for
 Change supporters were beaten at the time of arrest, and most suffered beatings
 and extortion of money at the hands of police during their detention. Senior Union
 for Change officials were generally not mistreated while in custody.
 The Government does not practice political exile. However, some opposition mem-
 bers who considered themselves threatened by the Government have voluntarily left
 the country and declared themselves to be in political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Cameroonian court system is subordinate to
 the Ministry of Justice; it is part of the executive, not a separate or independent
 branch of government.
 Magistrates in Cameroon are career civil servants responsible to the Minister of
 Justice, and thus are subject particularly in political cases, to government direction.
 For example, one widely publicized corporate control dispute between a European
 investor and a Cameroonian with close ties to the ruling party was decided on ques-
 tionable grounds in favor of the ruling party supporter. Some politically sensitive
 cases are never heard. For example, it took nearly a year before the Chief Justice
 informed SDF lawyers that he had declined to hear their October 1992 appeal for
 an injunction against the presidential swearing-in, pending Supreme Court review
 of electoral irregularities.
 Magistrates acknowledge that rendering a decision that displeases the Govern-
 ment may result in transfer to a less desirable position. However, decisions in non-
 political cases are usually not subject to government interference. Trials are public.
 A 1990 law established a State Security Court to try "crimes against the internal
 and external security of the state." Persons detained during the 1992 state of emer-
 gency were arraigned by State Security Court prosecutors but were not formally
 charged with a crime.
 
 
 If a defendant is indigent, the presiding judge in the case will designate an attor-
 ney from among the members of the bar in the court district. However because ap-
 pointed attorneys receive little compensation, the quality of such legal representa-
 tion is often poor. The Bar Association and some voluntary organizations, such as
 the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, offer pro bono legal assistance in
 some cases.
 Traditional courts continue to play an important role, particularly in rural areas.
 Their authority varies by region and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters
 of property and domestic disputes and may serve a probate function as well. Most
 traditional courts permit appeal of decisions to traditional authorities of higher
 rank.
 There were no known political prisoners as distinct from political detainees, at
 year's end. However, political prisoners released under the 1991 Amnesty Decree
 complained that the Government had not implemented provisions mandating that
 former military officers and public servants be reinstated to positions they held
 prior to their incarceration.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 both invasions of the home and tampering with correspondence are violations of
 Cameroonian law, there were reports of police and gendarmes harassing citizens
 and conducting searches without warrants. This practice was particularly wide-
 spread in Southwest Province, where security forces entered private homes and
 businesses to enforce payment of taxes and customs duties. Gendarmes destroyed
 goods, alleged to have been smuggled, without permitting due process of law for
 those accused of import violations. In one instance, gendarmes participating in an
 anticontraband drive set fire to a small cargo vessel belonging to a Nigerian trader
 in Limbe, Southwest Province, when he refused to pay a bribe.
 There were credible reports that the Government kept some opposition activists
 and dissidents under surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberies, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1972 Constitution provides for
 freedom of expression and press, Cameroonian law and practice have long restricted
 these liberties. In late 1990, a new law established more liberal regulations to begin
 publication of newspapers and magazines. That same law, however, formally en.
 shrined prepublication censorship and granted the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration the authority to suspend or revoke the right to publish. The law also pro-
 vided for licensing of private radio and television stations, but, as of the end of De-
 cember, no licenses had been granted, and the Government retained complete con-
 trol of the electronic media. Public servants employed by the official media face ret-
 ribution for openly criticizing the Government, as in the case of numerous Cameroon
 radio-television journalists who have been transferred to less desirable assignments
 for such remarks.
 The Government publishes an official newspaper-the Cameroon Tribune-and
 determines the content of radio and television broadcasts. Nevertheless, government
 reporters sometimes run stories which implicitly criticize the ruling party or portray
 government programs in an unfavorable light. The government- controlled broadcast
 media, although funded by all taxpayers, provide disproportionately high levels of
 coverage to the CPDM functions, while giving little air time to opposition events.
 Parties represented in the National Assembly, however, were given access to tele-
 vision and radio time during scheduled "expression directe" political broadcasts.
 Some 70 private newspapers are published, about one-quarter weekly and the oth-
 ers at irregular intervals. These newspapers circulate widely and are often out-
 spoken in their criticism of the Government and the President. Starting in mid-
 1993, there were fewer cases of censorship of individual articles. Rather, issues con-
 taining articles critical of the Government and its supporters were subject to seizure
 or to restrictions on distribution.
 The Government used its licensing authority to suspend nine private newspapers
 in November 1992. Although the papers continued to circulate clandestinely until
 the suspension order was lifted in May, the order imposed a severe economic hard-
 ship on these nine newspapers and had a chilling effect on the fledgling private
 press. After the suspension was lifted, the police seized several newspapers for pub-
 lishing stories that embarrassed the Government. For example, police removed from
 newstands the June 22 and July 20 editions of La Nouvelle Expression, which re-
 ported a scandal involving construction of a presidential golf course, and the Sep-
 tember 27 issue of Le Nouvel Independant, which implicated a confidant of the
 President in a 1988 murder.
 In other intimidating techniques, the Government stationed security forces
 throughout the spring outside Rotoprint, the Douala firm which prints most private
 
 
 papers. It detained journalist Francois Borgia Marie Evembe for a total of nearly
 10 days in connection with two articles he wrote for Le Messager which criticized
 the President (see Sections l.b. and 1.c.). It tried Le Messager publisher Pius Nlawe,
 Challenge Nouveau publisher Benjamin Zebaze, and Challenge journalist Martin
 Waffo for their April publication of a purported letter from the Minister of Justice
 to the Prime Minister suggesting charges against opposition leader John Frm Ndi
 and others for "insurrection, murder, spreading of false information, and incitement
 to revolt' in the aftermath of the 1992 presidential election. The court gave Njawe
 a 6-month suspended sentence and Zebaze and Waffo received 5-month prison
 terms; however, at year's end, all three men were free while their sentences remain
 under a ppeal.
 In a highly publicized libel case, the owner of a fish import company sued La
 Nouvelle Expression editor Severin Tchounkeu and staff writer David Nouwou in
 Douala court, alleging he had been falsely accused of involvement in a customs
 fraud scandal. Although the journalists offered documentary proof for their story,
 the court found them guilty, and on April 4 the judge imposed an unusually stiff
 sentence of 6 months in prison-the first time since independence that a journalist
 served time for libel. The two journalists spent 6 weeks in prison before the judge's
 ruling was overturned on appeal. There is credible evidence to suggest that Govern-
 ment displeasure at the journalists' implication of the Customs Minister in the scan-
 dal contributed significantly to the harsh sentences the court handed down.
 There are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, though it is generally be-
 lieved that there are state security informants on university campuses. Some uni-
 versity professors believe that their political viewpoints and activism have had a
 negative impact on professional opportunities and advancement. Free political dis-
 cession at the university is dampened by the presence of armed security forces, as
 well as sometimes strident pro-oposition groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are provided for in law but restricted in practice. The Penal Code prohibits
 public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior government approval.
 The 1990 Law on Freedom of Association established that Cameroonians may freely
 form associations simply by notifying the responsible administrative authority ac-
 cording to a set procedure. Some 90 political parties operated legally, along with a
 growing number of civic associations.
 While political parties and civic associations were generally permitted to hold
 public assemblies, the Government at times harassed opposition groups by denying
 them access to meeting facilities or refusing their permits on technicalities. For ex-
 ample, in April the All Anglophone Conference was at the last minute denied per-
 mission to use the conference hall at the University of Buea. In August the governor
 of Southwest Province issued a communique forbidding the Cameroon Anglophone
 Movement from holding a meeting. Some opposition leaders, such as Ndeh
 Ntumazah and Garga Haman Adji, were unable to hold scheduled press conferences
 when they were denied authorization. In September security forces disrupted a
 meeting of the newly formed Liberal Democratic Alliance (LDA) in Buea, using tear
 gas to disperse supporters gathered outside LDA chairman Njoh Litumbe's home.
 In November, government security forces blocked two separate Yaounde press con-
 ferences of opposition leaders John Fru Ndi and Garga Haman Adji. On November
 3 Fru Ndi was denied access to the privately owned headquarters of the opposition
 UFDC, where he had intended to hold a press conference. Minutes later, the vehicle
 in which Fru Ndi was riding was rammed and sprayed with high pressure water
 by a mobile government water cannon. Fru Ndi suffered minor lacerations during
 the confrontation and sought refuge in the residence of a diplomat. In the case of
 Garga, on November 18, Yaounde police first prohibited a conference in the Yaounde
 Hilton and then prevented Garga from receiving journalists in his private residence.
 On December 1, security officials forcibly broke up and dispersed a press con-
 ference of the Cameroonian National Trade Union, which was calling for a general
 strike to protest public sector salary cuts.
 In some cases, opposition parties deliberately flouted the requirement to obtain
 permission for public meetings or protest marches. For example, in Northwest Prov-
 ince, the Social Democratic Front refused to apply for permits to hold demonstra-
 tions in March and April, despite pleas by the provincial governor that they do so.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution,
 and there is no established state religion. There are no restrictions on places of wor-
 ship, the training of clergy, religious education, religious travel-such as the haj-
 or participation in charitable activities.
 A religious group must be approved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial
 Administration in order to function legally. A presidential decree in February grant-
 ed legal status to Jehovah's Witnesses, banned from 1970 until 1990. There were
 
 
 38
 no reports of government harassment of Jehovah's Witnesses. Although properties
 confiscated in 1970 have not been returned, the Witnesses are free to build new
 kingdom halls.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by law. Po-
 lice frequently stop travelers to check identification documents, vehicle registrations,
 and tax receipts as a security and immigration control measure. During a gendar-
 merie and police campaign to stop contraband smuggled from Nigeria, the checks
 became pervasive and occasionally oppresive in Southwest Province. Personnel man-
 ning these roadblocks frequently solicited bribes to speed passage.
 During antigovernment protests, opposition supporters sometimes erected road-
 blocks. For example, during the August Anglophone "Solidarity Day" general strike
 some strike supporters in Southwest Province used barricades to enforce the work
 stoppage. Roadblocks were erected by Union for Change supporters in Bamenda
 during demonstrations in March and April, and again in August to protest the de-
 tention of Northwest Province coordinator Joseph Akonteh. Opposition supporters
 also inhibited movement in Douala during the general strike called for August 30
 and 31.
 The Government has sometimes used its passport control function against those
 it considers real or potential threats. For example, the Government has refused for
 more than 2 years to issue a passport to UFDC president Victor Hameni Bieleu. Al-
 though government officials claim that the problem stems from legal charges pend-
 ing against Hameni Bieleu since the 1992 state of emergency, the denial of his pass-
 port predates these charges.
 Cameroon has long served as a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees
 from the region. As of December 31, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
 Cameroon was providing assistance to more than 2,000 refugees, primarily from
 Chad, but also from Liberia, Zaire, and Sudan. However, estimates of the total num-
 ber of refugees, mostly spontaneously settled Chadians, range from 8,000 to 50,000.
 Although Cameroon occasionally returns illegal Chadian immigrants, there were no
 reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Cameroon continues to be governed by the President and a small circle of advis-
 ers, many drawn from his own ethnic group, who came to power during a period
 of single-party authoritarian rule. His party controls the National Assembly, and he
 has the power to dissolve the Assembly and call new elections at any time; to return
 bills for a second reading reuiring that they be passed by a majority of the full
 Assembly; and to govern by decree during the 10 months each year when the As-
 sembly is not in session. With a working parliamentary majority, the ruling party,
 the CPDM, and its coalition partners also set the legislative agenda, preventing
 many opposition initiatives from coming to a vote.
 The governing parliamentary coalition consists of the CPDM, the former single
 party; the MD , a small, northern-based party allied with the CPDM since April
 1992; and the legalized wing of the splintered leftist party, the UPC. The only par-
 liamentary party not formally allied with the CPDM is the UNDP. The CPDM and
 several small parties campaigned in the 1992 presidential election under the banner
 of the "Presidential Majority._ While this entity is not known to have had any offi-
 cial standing as such, it was given extensive coverage in the official press as a coali-
 tion of parties which had railed to President Biya.
 Opposed to the Presidential Majority was the Union for Change coalition of par-
 ties supporting the chairman of the SDF Party, Ni John Fru Ndi, and his call for
 a limited, 2-year presidential mandate to implement democratic reforms and to con-
 vene a national conference. The Union for Change does not have any official status
 as a political organization, although its constituent parties are legally recognized.
 The SDF is the largestparty within the Union for Change but has its own struc-
 tures and policies. The Union for Change has continued to operate as an opposition
 political organization since the October 1992 presidential election.
 Based on the results of the October 1992 presidential elections, the two largest
 parties not to be formally allied with either the Union for Change or the CPDM-
 led coalition are the UNDP, headed by Bello Bouba Maigari, and the CDU, headed
 by Adamou Ndam Njoya.
 Although multiparty elections were held in 1992, the flawed presidential race rep-
 resented a step backward in Cameroon's democratization process. The widespread
 electoral irregularities attributed principally by international observers to the Gov-
 ernment undermined public confidence in President Biya's professed commitment to
 political reforms. There were also irregularities during the annual voter registration
 
 
 39
 period, which resulted in a sharp decrease in registered voters nationwide. Accord-
 ing to estimates made public by Minister of Territorial Administration Gilbert
 Andze Tsoungui, the number of registered voters fell by 20 percent. MINAT ascribed
 the decrease to the removal of fictitious or underage persons from the rolls.
 Political reform efforts focused on revising Cameroon's 1972 Constitution, which
 dates from the one-party era. However, the constitutional reform process has been
 tightly controlled by the Presidency and has permitted minimal public or opposition
 participation. A multiparty commission established in 1991 to draft a new basic law
 was adjourned in February 1992 prior to completing its mission. In May, however,
 the Government unilaterally released a draft which it claimed to be the work of the
 multiparty commission. The May draft retains a centralized presidential system, in
 which human rights guarantees may be superseded by subsequent legislation. In
 the next phase of the constitutional reform process, the President promised to ap-
 point a constitutional consultative committee, including opposition delegates, to re-
 view the work of the technical committee of lawyers and academics and prepare a
 "quasi-final draft." The President will decide on the final version to be submitted
 for ratification by either the National Assembly or a popular referendum. As of
 year's end, the Government had taken no further steps to advance the constitutional
 reform process but maintained that there will be a new Constitution in 1994, as
 well as municipal elections.
 Members of the President's ethnic group, the Beti, wield a disproportionate share
 of  litical power, particularly in key economic and security ortfolios.
 Women serve in prominent positions in the executive, egislative, and judicial
 branches of the Government, but are underrepresented among the senior leadership.
 Only 2 women sit in the 44-member Cabinet, and 1 woman sits on the 14-member
 Supreme Court. There are 17 women in the 180-seat National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights monitoring groups were permitted to
 operate in Cameroon, but their effectiveness was impeded by the Government.
 Numerous nongovernmental civic associations included the National League for
 Human Rights, the Organization for Human Rights and Freedoms, the Association
 of Women Against Violence, the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, the
 Cameroonian Association for Children's Rights, and the Human Rights Clinic and
 Education Center. Financial hardships, inexperience, and occasional fear of govern-
 ment reprisals discouraged these nongovernmental civic associations from publicly
 criticizing the Government's human rights record. For the most part, therefore,
 these groups sought primarily to heighten awareness of human rights issues rather
 than investigate specific alleged violations. In order to accomplish this, they distrib-
 uted informational publications and held awareness clinics and meetings. One
 group, the Cameroomn Association of Female Jurists, made public announcements
 of its activities on radio and television programs.
 The presidentially appointed National Commission for Human Rights and Free-
 doms, occasionally critical of the Government, was refused access to political detain-
 ees and was unable to conduct investigations due to lack of funding by the Prime
 Minister's office. It also failed to report publicly on its investigations into allegations
 of human rights abuses.
 Members of the International Federation of Editors and Journalists were unable
 to investigate reported harassment of the independent press, when they were twice
 denied visas to Cameroon and, as noted in Section .c., the ICRC suspended visits
 to prisoners and detainees because of Government restrictions.
 While government officials often make public statements giving their version of
 alleged human rights abuses, thcy generally do not respond publicly to specific
 charges of wrongdoing made by domestic or international monitors.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The preamble to the 1972 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, en-
 shrines freedom of religion, and mandates that everyone has equal rights and obli-
 Sations." However, discrimination based on race, language, religion, or social status
 is not explicitly forbidden. Both English and French are official languages in Cam-
 eroon.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions, women remain subservient to men.
 Polygyny is permitted by law and tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to
 which a woman may inherit from her husband is normally governed by traditional
 law in the absence of a will, and customs vary from group to group. In many tradi-
 tional societies, custom grants greater authority and benefits to male than to female
 
 
 heirs. In cases of divorce, the husband's wishes determine custody of children over
 the age of 6. A married woman may not legally obtain contraceptives or be sterilized
 without her husband's consent. While a man may be convicted of adultery only if
 the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may be convicted irrespective of
 venue.
 Women's rights advocates report that violence against women has surged in re-
 cent years, and that the law does not impose effective penalties against violators.
 Wife beating is not a legal ground for divorce. In cases of sexual assault, a victim's
 family or village often imposes direct, summary punishment upon the suspected per-
 petrator through means ranging from destruction of property to lynching. While
 there are no reiable statistics on violence against women, the number of newspaper
 reports indicate the frequency is high. In September a senior Ministry of Health offi-
 cial publicly estimated that a high percentage of emergency room admissions nation-
 wide were cases of spousal ahuse.
 Children.-The Constitution guarantees a child's right to education, and schooling
 is mandatory through age 14. Rabies and small children are sometimes held in pris-
 on if their mothers are incarcerated. Child marriages are not common, although
 young girls often wed in their midteens, especially in rural areas. The Cameroonian
 Association for Children's Rights is concerned with a wide range of children's rights
 issues, including child incarceration and child marriages.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision), which has been condemned by inter-
 national health experts as dangerous to bth physical and psychological health, is
 usually practiced on girls at an early age. It includes the most severe form of the
 abuse, infibulation, and continues to be practiced in some areas of the Far North
 and Southwest Provinces.
 National/RacialEthnic Minorities.-There are freqent and credible allegations
 of discrimination among Cameroon's more than 200 ethnicgroups. Ethnic favoritism
 is a factor in both private and public sector employment. The Bamileke, the coun-
 trys largest single ethnic group (with at least 20 percent of the population), believe
 they have been systematically denied political power commensurate with their num-
 bers and economic importance. Opposition newspapers frequently attacked the Beti,
 while those close to the Government criticized the Bamileke and Anglophone groups.
 Outbreaks of ethnic violence occurred between the Kotoko and Choa Arab commu-
 nities in Far North Province, between Mbo and Bamileke residents in West Prov-
 ince, and in Bui Division Northwest Province.
 An important ethnic, political division falls along linguistic lines. The Anglophone
 minority (20 percent) often charges that the Francophone majority does not share
 real power and that the Government provides fewer economic benefits to English-
 speaking regions. In April the All-Anglophone Conference enumerated a long list of
 Anglophone grievances and called for a two-state federal system, divided into
 French-speaking and English-speaking states, to protect their minority language
 rights. The heavy police and gendarmerie presence in English-speaking Southwest
 Province, ostensibly to stop the flow of Nigerian contraband (see Section l.f.), con-
 tributed to Anglophone resentment.
 People with Disabilities.-The Constitution does not protect the disabled. Lack of
 facilities and care is particularly acute for the mentally handicapped. Although
 Cameroonian society is generally tolerant of physical disabilities, which are com-
 monplace, the Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A new Labor Code passed in 1992 allows workers
 to form and join trade unions of their own choosing. Under the new rules, groups
 of at least 20 workers may organize a union but must then register with the Min-
 istry of Labor. Provisions of the Labor Code do not apply to civil servants, employees
 of the penitentiary system, or workers responsible or national security. At year's
 end, some but not all of the implementing decrees had been issued for the new
 Code.
 Ministry officials explained that they had received applications to create national
 confederations but that these could not be authorized before local unions and re-
 .ional or sectoral federations were formed. The Federation of National Educators
 YNES) applied in 1991 for legal status as a public service association, since gov-
 ernment workers are not permitted to form trade unions. The Ministry of Public
 Service had not accorded legal status to SYNES by year's end. In response to a com-
 plaint filed by SYNES, the7ILO Committee on Freedom of Association criticized the
 Government for delays in registering the new union and for failure to respond to
 charges that its members were subject to harassment.
 The new Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after
 mandatory arbitration. As the continuing economic contraction caused the Govern-
 
 
 ment and state-owned enterprise sector to fall behind in salary payments in 1993,
 numerous wildcat strikes occurred. Workers at both the Cameroonian Press Cor-
 poration (SOPECAM), which publishes the government daily Cameroon Tribune, as
 well as the Cameroonian Transport Corporation walked off the Job on separate occa-
 sions during the year, demanding payment of salary arrears. One SOPECAM strike
 lasted more than 6 weeks; the others were of shorter duration. Employees returned
 to work after management agreed to make partial payment. Other workers staged
 sit-ins or temporary work stoppages during the year at Yaounde's Congress  all
 (where arrears totaled 11 months) and the Bamenda provincial hospital. The new
 Labor Code provides for the protection of legal strikers and prohibits retribution
 against them provided that they follow the labor arbitration procedures outlined in
 the Code.
 The only labor confederation in Cameroon is the Confederation of Cameroonian
 Trade Umons (CSTC), formerly affiliated with the ruling CPDM party under the
 name Organization of Cameroonian Trade Unions. The CSTC formally declared its
 political independence in 1992, and secretary general Louis Sombes publicly criti-
 cized the Government during 1993. However, since no other labor organizations
 have been legalized, the CSTC is still widely regarded as a quasi-officiallabor con-
 federation, even by many of its own members. There are no known individual
 unions entirely independent of government and political party controls. The only
 new union rgistered by the Ministry of Labor in 1993, the Union of Contract Em-
 ployees and State Agents (SYNCAE), is an affiliate of the CSTC.
 The CSTC is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Code pro-
 vides for collective bargaining between workers and management in local work
 places, as well as between labor federations and business associations in each sector
 of the economy. As of December 31, sectoral collective bargaining negotiations had
 not been undertaken, although the Government instructed individual state-owned
 enterprises to negotiate salary reductions with workers. Prior to passage of the new
 Code, the Government collaborated with the CSTC and employers to set wages
 through a complicated formula that took into account the sector and region of em-
 ployment and the worker's education level.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to frines ranging up to the equivalent of $3,500 (1 million
 CFA). However, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination do not have to
 reinstate the workers who have been discriminated against. The Ministry of Labor
 reported no complaints of such discrimination in 1993.
 In November the CSTC disputed the legality of wage cuts in public and public
 corporation sectors and called for a general strike. Although there was no labor
 union organized to represent civil servants as a whole, the first efforts to form a
 public sector union were made in November.
 Eight firms have obtained approval to operate under Cameroon's industrial free
 zone regime, and four had begun operations by the end of the year. Free zone em-
 ployers are exempt from some provisions of the Labor Code but must respect all
 internationally recognized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the new Labor Code, although it specifically excludes "any work or serv-
 ice extracted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a court or law"
 and "work or service in the general interest, forming part of the civic obligation of
 citizens." In 1993 Cameroonian prisons continued to allow inmates to be contracted
 out to private employers or used as communal labor for municipal public works.
 There are credible reports that slavery continues to be practiced in the Lamidat of
 Rey Bouba, an isolated traditional kingdom in North Province.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code establishes that
 no child be employed before the age of 14. Ministry of Labor inspectors are respon-
 sible for enforcing the minimum age of employment but lack resources for an effec-
 tive inspection program. In rural areas many children begin work at an early age
 on family farms. Some rural youths, especially girls, are often employed by relatives
 as domestics. Street vendors in the cities are sometimes under 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the 1992 Labor Code, the Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all
 sectors of the economy. As of the end of the year, the minimum wage had not been
 set. A decree establishing the monthly minimum wage at approximately $80 (25,000
 CFA) had been submitted to the Prime Minister for approval but had not been
 signed by year's end. The Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours
 in public and private nonagricultural firms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related
 activities. The Code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest.

 The Government sets health and safety standards, and the Ministry of Labor in-
 spectors and occupational health doctors are responsible for monitoring these stand-
 ards. However, they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program.
