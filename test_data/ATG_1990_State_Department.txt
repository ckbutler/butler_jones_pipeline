 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a
 parliamentary democracy and a member of the Commonwealth of
 Nations. It is governed by a prime minister, a cabinet, and a
 bicameral legislative assembly. The Governor General, with
 largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State and
 serves as the representative of the British Monarch. The
 Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister V.C. Bird, Sr. and his Antigua Labor
 Party (ALP) hold 15 of .the 17 seats in the House of
 Representatives. One seat is held by United National
 Democratic Party (UNDR) Deputy Baldwin Spencer, who is
 designated the leader of the opposition. The remaining seat
 represents the Barbuda constituency, and is held by Hilbourne
 Frank, a political independent who leads the Barbuda faction
 advocating secession from the union with Antigua. The
 Governor General appoints the 17-member Senate with the advice
 of the Prime Minister and opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and
 Barbuda Defense Force, a 90-person infantry unit. The police
 are organized, trained, and.supervised according to British
 law enforcement practices. -The security forces have a good
 reputation for respecting individual rights in the performance
 of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy, with a strong private
 sector. Tourism is the major industry. In 1990 the economy
 faltered somewhat after 6 years of high growth, due mainly to
 a slowdown in the tourism sector. A large and growing
 external debt continued to concern the Government.
 The Constitution provides for political and civil rights,
 which are generally respected in practice. However, there
 were several notable exceptions in 1990. Government control
 of the electronic media has resulted in almost no access for
 opposition parties or persons presenting opinions opposed to
 government policies. During 1990 the Government used its
 monopoly of the electronic media to engage in deliberate
 disinformation campaigns. The Government also failed to
 respond adequately to an arson attack on the home of a cleric
 who was an outspoken critic of some government policies. The
 Queen's Privy Council voided the conviction of an Antiguan
 journalist for "undermining confidence" in the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance or politically
 motivated abductions.

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees, and these prohibitions
 are respected in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention,
 which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants are
 guaranteed the right of judicial determination of the legality
 of their detention. Detainees must be brought before a court
 within 48 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports
 of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is modeled on that of the United Kingdom
 and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system. Final
 appeal may be made to the Queens's Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom and is invariably made in the case of death
 sentences. There are no military or political courts.
 Criminal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public
 trial. In capital cases the Government provides legal
 assistance at public expense to persons without means to
 retain a private attorney. There are no political prisoners
 in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence in 1990. The police must
 obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, the press,
 and other forms of communication. These provisions are
 generally respected. However, the Government dominates the
 electronic media, the only daily source of news. The
 Government owns one of the two radio stations and the single
 television station, and the Prime Minister's family owns the
 second radio station. The cable television company--whose
 principal owners include Bird family members--operates a
 channel that occasionally features local programming as part
 of its cable service. The government-owned media report
 regularly on the Government's activities but rarely on those
 of opposition political parties. ABS radio and television
 regularly censor and manipulate news that could be potentially
 damaging to the Government.
 In March the home of a Methodist minister involved in a
 campaign to force the Government to move against quasi-legal
 prostitution and other forms of officially tolerated vice was
 firebombed shortly before he was to lead a major protest
 march. Although the police questioned several suspects, the
 investigation was quietly dropped; there were credible reports
 that this was due to the possible involvement of a prominent
 Antiguan official. Neither the protest march nor the firebomb

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 attack were mentioned on the radio and television although
 these issues dominated public discussion for several weeks.
 In April news of the possible involvement of Antiguan
 officials in the diversion of a shipment of Israeli arms to
 Colombian narcoterrorists was reported in Antigua. Over the
 next month, public pressure grew for a formal Commission of
 Inquiry into the affair. The Commission was formed in June
 and held public hearings until September. During this time
 ABS radio and television, and the government-owned newspaper,
 The Nation, reported only selected aspects of the inquiry and
 the arms scandal, avoiding any testimony potentially damaging
 to Vere Bird, Jr., the eldest son of the Prime Minister, who
 was one of the possibly implicated officials. The radio and
 television also engaged in deliberate disinformation, lifting
 certain statements from the testimony and repeating them out
 of context to make them seem more favorable to the possibly
 implicated officials. Under extreme public pressure, the
 Government agreed to broadcast the hearings in their entirety,
 but began editing the testimony, reportedly for length,
 especially during the critical final week. This culminated in
 the deletion of the entire final day's testimony.
 Weekly newspapers representing the opposition published a
 variety of opinions, although after the apparent
 discontinuance of the UNDP newspaper, only one weekly
 opposition newspaper remained functioning after August.
 In February the Queen's Privy Council--the Supreme Court for
 the Eastern Caribbean states--reversed an Eastern Caribbean
 Court of Appeals ruling that journalist Tim Hector was guilty
 of making statements likely to undermine confidence in the
 conduct of public affairs for a 1985 newspaper article that
 made an inaccurate charge against a government minister. The
 Privy Council found that the offending newspaper article was
 not libelous, since Hector believed it was true at the time.
 The Privy Council further found that the pertinent section of
 the law was unconstitutional,-and criticized the Appeals Court
 for having reversed a lower court ruling exonerating Hector.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 police interference. Required permits for public meetings are
 issued by the police and are normally granted. Permits for
 political rallies were routinely granted during 1990. Permits
 for several protest marches were also granted without
 hindrance, although march routes were sometimes altered by
 police.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is unrestricted exercise of religious freedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of
 other religious denominations practice and proselytize openly
 without government interference. All groups are free to
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens of
 Antigua and Barbuda to move about within the country, to
 travel abroad, or to emigrate.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system
 accommodating a wide spectrum of political viewpoints. All
 citizens 18 years of age and older may register and vote by
 secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at
 least every 5 years. The Government is obligated by law to
 hold voter registration during a fixed period each year, and
 parties conduct their own registration drives free from
 government interference. The last general elections were held
 in March 1989 and were won by the ALP, which has been in power
 since 1951, except for a'period of opposition from 1971 to
 1976. The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding
 monopoly on patronage and its influence over the economic life
 of the country made it extremely difficult for opposition
 parties to attract membership and financial support. During
 1990, public dissent over government policy came more from
 competing ALP factions than from the opposition UNDP,. which
 has been increasingly quiescent.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed concern about Antigua and Barbuda. There were no
 requests for human rights investigations or inquiries during
 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed,
 language, or social status, and it is generally observed.
 However, while the role of women in society is not legally
 restricted, tradition tends.to limit women to home and family,
 particularly in rural areas, and to restrict their career
 options. These traditional roles are changing, however. The
 Government has begun programs to provide enhanced educational
 opportunities for both sexes as well as family planning
 services. Under the energetic prodding of the Directorate of
 Womens Affairs (previously the Women's Desk), women are moving
 up in government and the professions, but progress is slower
 in the private sector. .The Women's Desk was founded a decade
 ago with one director and a secretary and now employs, in
 addition to the executive director, three professionals and
 clerical and support staff. In 1990 the Directorate continued
 educational programs for women in such areas as health,
 crafts, and improving business skills. It also began a
 literacy training program, and organized a workshop on child
 abuse which provided the Government with recommendations for
 changes in child welfare legislation.
 Most violence against women in Antigua probably goes
 unreported. Gauging the extent of the problem is difficult,
 due to the lack of accurate data, and is compounded by the
 reluctance of women in many cases to testify against their
 abusers. Police may be reluctant to interfere in cases of
 domestic violence and some women charge that the courts are
 too lenient.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to form labor
 unions. Although fewer than 50 percent of Antigua and
 Barbuda's workers belong to unions, the important hotel
 industry is heavily unionized. Unions are free to affiliate
 with international labor organizations and do so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the Antigua
 Trades and Labor Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers Union
 (AWU). The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the
 AWU is somewhat more loosely allied with the opposition UNDP.
 The AWU is the larger and more active of the two major unions.
 The right to strike is recognized by the labor code. This
 right can be limited in a given dispute by the Court of
 Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dispute
 requests the court to mediate, there can be no strike.
 Because of the delays associated with this process, in
 practice labor disputes are often resolved before a strike is
 called. There were no strikes in 1990.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor organizations are free to organize and bargain
 collectively. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law
 and there have been no reports of its practice. There are no
 areas of the country where union organization or collective
 bargaining is discouraged or impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery or forced labor, and they do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law provides a minimum working age of 13, which is
 respected in practice. Responsibility for enforcement rests
 with the Ministry of Labor, which is required by law to
 conduct periodic inspections of workplaces.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day workweek, but in
 practice the standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave and up to
 13 weeks of maternity leave. There are no occupational health
 and safety laws or regulations. Different minimum wages for
 different work categories were established by law in 1981.
 Some representative minimum hourly wages at present are:
 household domestics $0.50, unskilled laborers $0.61,
 construction workers $0.93, and skilled workers $1.30. Most
 such minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers, but in practice the great majority of
 workers earn substantially more than the minimum wage.
 Increases in the minimum wage were recommended in 1989 but
 there was no action to implement the recommendation in 1990.
