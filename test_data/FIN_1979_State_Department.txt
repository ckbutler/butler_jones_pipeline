 FINLAND
 Finland's respect for human rights is demonstrated in its
 traditions, its constitution, and its framework of sub-
 stantive and procedural safeguards concerning the integrity
 of the individual. Domestically, human rights interests
 are protected overall through its vigorous parliamentary
 democracy and free press; and specifically by its indepen-
 dent judiciary, a chancellor of justice appointed by the
 executive branch, and an ombudsman named by parliament,
 having autonomous authority to initiate investigations into
 human rights matters. Economically and socially, Finland
 displays sophisticated concern for the rights of women and
 minorities and for the problems of the disadvantaged.
 Internationally, Finland is a supporter of human rights
 objectives. It is a signatory of the United Nations Con-
 vention on Refugees, the International Covenant on Economic,
 Social.and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights. With regard to the last-
 named, the U.N. Human Rights Committee noted in August 1979
 its special recognition of the Finnish Government's sincere
 efforts to implement the Covenant's principles.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includinq
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Capital punishment has not been practiced in modern Finnish
 history; the death penalty for crimes committed in times of
 peace was formally abolished in 1949, and in 1972 the abo-
 lition was extended to crimes committed in wartime. The
 sentence of confinement to hard labor was abolished in 1974.
 Inspections of prison facilities and interviews with priso-
 ners are conducted routinely on an unannounced schedule by
 teams from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the
 Interior, and by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. The circumstances of an
 arrest are traditionally examined when an accused is brought
 to trial and, should the arrest be shown to have been false,
 or should an accused ultimately be acquitted, he or she,- is
 entitled to collect damages; pending legislation would
 create a system of pre-trial examination of arrests as well.
 Immediately upon arrest, the accused's family or chosen
 representative must be informed of the charge. "Preventive
 detention" is not permitted except in times of declared war
 
 (586)
 
 
 587
 for narrowly defined offenses such as treason, mutiny, and
 trafficking in weapons, and even in such rare eventualities
 procedural safeguards are mandated.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. All trials are open to the public, except for
 narrowly defined cases in which juveniles or matrimonial
 disputes are involved, or in certain instances where na-
 tional security is concerned: the latter provision is very
 rarely invoked, and, if it is, procedural safeguards are
 scrupulously followed to ensure a fair trial. The Judiciary
 is completely independent, and may hear appeals from any
 Governmental decision, including strictly administrative
 decisions. "Provisional tribunals" are expressly prohibited.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home, including prohibition of eaves-
 dropping and mail tampering, is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Search warrants may only be issued
 by judicial authorities empowered to issue warrants of
 arrest; in narrowly defined instances, the Minister of the
 Interior or the Chancellor of Justice may also authorize a
 search, subject to subsequent judicial scrutiny and possible
 penalties.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Finland's attention to, and record in, the field of social
 justice is excellent. The nation's economy is advanced,
 with privately-owned, cooperative and state-controlled
 enterprises operating within a market economy system. The
 Government is committed to fiscal and incomes policies
 aimed at maximizing employment opportunities as well as
 broad distribution of income among individuals and between
 the urban and rural sectors. A comprehensive social wel-
 fare policy includes provisions for housing, health and
 medical services, welfare, various family benefits, and
 disability and unemployment insurance. Education is com-
 pulsory and free up to the age of 16, with nominal fees
 for higher education thereafter. Linguistic minorities are
 given the right of state-supported schools and educational
 materials in their native languages. Literacy is virtually
 100%.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includinu:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Civil and political liberties are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice: Discrimination on the basis of race,
 national or ethnic origin is a criminal offense. There is
 no censorship, and prior restraint is expressly prohibited;
 the right of citizens to own and operate a printing press
 is also constitutionally guaranteed. While certain media
 organs are owned or managed by parliament or political par-
 ties, others are privately owned and without political af-
 filiation, and there is no lack of independent or opposition
 views. All religions may be freely practiced in Finland.
 The right of assembly is guaranteed, and any group may hold
 a meeting without license upon six hours notice to local
 authorities. Freedom of association is also guaranteed:
 
 
 588
 if the purpose of an organization is to inflence political
 issues, only Finnish citizens may belong; if the organiza-
 tion involvesftraining in the use of firearms, a license
 is required.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There are no restrictions on domestic travel.
 The right of Finnish nationals to return to Finland is
 guaranteed. The only restrictions on passport issuance
 for travel outside Finland concern persons under indictment,
 activities endangering national security, minors travelling
 without parental consent, etc.
 c. Freedom to participate in the Political Process
 Finland is a multi-party parliamentary democracy. Any
 association may register as a political party if it in-
 cludes more than 5,000 citizens, practices internally
 democratic procedures, and publishes a party program.
 opposition parties function freely, have media access, and
 hold public meetings; they are also entitled to subsidies
 for their operating costs. All Finnish citizens over the
 age of 18 may participate in the political process: some
 80% of eligible voters participated in the March 1979 Par-
 liamentary Elections,
 Women have equal legal status with men. They have had the
 right to vote since 1906. All restrictions on employment
 because of sex (including jobs in prisons and physical
 education facilities) were abolished in 1975. Since 1972,
 a government-supported equality council has overseen the
 granting of equal rights to women. Women play a prominent
 role in the political and economic life of the nation as
 well as in households, and the level of their participation
 in public life continues to increase.
 Labor is free to organize, bargain collectively and strike,
 and the labor movement is well-developed and politically
 influential.
 4. Governmental Attitude and Record regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State knows of no requests for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Finland.
