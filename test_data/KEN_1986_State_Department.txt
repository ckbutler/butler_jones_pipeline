 KENYA
 Kenya has been a one-party state by law since 1982, and the
 President, Daniel arap Moi, maintains firm control over both
 the Government and the party, the Kenyan African National
 Union (KANU). The role of the party has grown significantly
 in recent years, especially in 1986, when Moi personally led a
 massive party membership campaign. Kenya has a popularly
 elected National Assembly of 158 members, and 12 additional
 members are appointed by the President. Parliament plays a
 minor role in policy initiatives, although it is involved
 frequently in local and regional issues. Within the one-party
 system, there is considerable competiton for parliamentary
 seats. The Government allegedly interferes in some especially
 sensitive cases to ensure that certain candidates are elected.
 In 1986 the Government attempted to tighten control over the
 party electoral process by proposing a law requiring that all
 voters (with the exception of certain members of the clergy,
 civil service, and military) physically queue behind candidates
 on election day, thereby effectively eliminating the secrecy
 of the ballot. Parliament has not yet enacted this proposed
 controversial voting requirement, which could apply to all
 party elections and the preliminaries to the general elections
 scheduled for 1988.
 Although the Kenyan economy has recovered from the 1984
 drought, its annual gross national product growth of
 approximately 4.5 percent has barely kept pace with the growth
 in population, approximately 4 percent annually. Unemployment
 continues to rise as more than 300,000 new workers enter the
 job market each year, while the economy annually generates at
 most 40,000 new wage-earning positions. Kenya has a well-
 developed private sector and produces not only most of the
 food it consumes but also an exportable surplus of corn in
 good years. The Government has begun to display an awareness
 of the need to promote even greater privatization in most
 areas of the economy, including inefficient public
 corporations.
 The human rights situation in Kenya was subject to some strain
 in 1986. As a result of agitation by a clandestine dissident
 group called "Mwakenya", some individuals were detained and
 released, while others were tried, convicted, and incarcerated.
 Still others fled the country out of fear of being arrested or
 detained. Little is known publicly about the group except
 that it was founded in 1981 in the Kikuyu division of Kiambu
 district outside Nairobi.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no instances when people disappeared under
 suspicious circumstances. Some uncharged detainees, e.g.,
 from the Mwakenya, are still being held, but the disappearance
 of any of them would be unprecedented in Kenyan politics.

 KENYA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically proscribed under the Constitution.
 Isolated reports of police torture do not suggest that torture
 is commonly practiced, but rather indicate that physical abuse
 and degradation are occasionally carried out by some persons
 without official Government sanction. When allegations of
 torture do emerge, they are usually investigated by the
 Government. Police, however, often use excessive force in
 apprehending suspected criminals, and some suspects have
 allegedly been killed while fleeing the scene of a crime.
 Prison conditions in Kenya are poor, and Amnesty International
 has expressed concern over the treatment of detainees as well
 as of prisoners who have been formally tried and convicted.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act of 1982 allows
 prisoners to be held in solitary confinement, with almost no
 outside contact with families and legal counsel. In at least
 one case in 1986, there were serious allegations of denial of
 medical treatment to a political prisoner. Prisoners are often
 required to sleep on cold cement floors which are sometimes
 covered in urine because of inadequate toilet facilities.
 Overcrowding has recently become a problem in some jails,
 especially in Nairobi. Correspondence with prisoners is
 monitored, censored, and frequently not delivered. Security
 officials are always present when detainees or prisoners
 consult with family members or attorneys.
 d., Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 The Government has from time to time secretly detained persons
 implicated in alleged antigovernment activities. Since
 resuming the practice of formal detention without charge, the
 Government has detained or restricted 18 persons under the
 Preservation of Security Act, including 5 in 1986 in connection
 with Mwakenya. Ten uncharged detainees were released in
 1983-84, and one in 1985. At present, nine persons are being
 held under the Act. Seven of these are being held under
 suspicion of Mwakenya involvement, and two for alleged links
 to the 1982 coup attempt. A total of 37 Kenyans were tried,
 convicted, and sentenced for sedition in connection with
 Mwakenya. Forty-nine more were released after questioning.
 Other Kenyans have been seized and held, usually for short
 periods, without being detained. Approximately 60 to 65
 soldiers and airmen were jailed after the 1982 coup attempt.
 Thirty-four were released in June 1986, while the rest.are
 still being held. They are subject to military jurisdiction,
 and none has been charged with a crime.
 Aside from the detention cases falling under the Preservation
 of Public Security Act and the unprecedented circumstances
 resulting from the attempted coup of August 1982, detained
 persons generally have the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of their detention. Kenyan law requires that
 persons charged with crimes be brought biweekly before judicial
 authorities in public court to ensure that investigations are
 conducted in a timely manner and that prisoners are not
 mistreated. The degree of compliance with the biweekly review
 requirement varies, however, according to the individual
 magistrate responsible for assuring adherence to these
 procedures. Detainee cases are reviewed every 6 months by a
 confidential detainees review tribunal.
 
 
 148
 KENYA
 Self-exile has become a course of action frequently chosen by
 Kenyan dissidents. As a result of the 1982 coup attempt and
 the 1986 Mwakenya controversy, several critics of the
 Government have fled the country, including one former member
 of Parliament, Koigi Wa Wamwere. The exiles claim that they
 fled to avoid detention for their political views. The
 Government regards them as voluntary exiles and asserts that
 all are free to return to Kenya. One Kenyan journalist, who
 had returned from self-exile in July after reportedly receiving
 official assurances of freedom from arrest/prosecution, claims
 to have been detained, held incommunicado for 2 days, and
 expelled from the country after being formally stripped of his
 Kenyan citizenship. His alleged offense was the authoring of
 articles critical of the Government while abroad. However,
 neither exile nor the threat of exile is routinely used by the
 Government as a means of coercion or intimidation.
 Kenya has not ratified the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) convention No. 105 on The Universal Abolition of Forced
 Labor. Although forced labor is not practiced in Kenya, the
 Kenyan Government has retained the colonial "Chiefs' Authority
 Act," a provision of which empowers chiefs to coerce labor
 under certain circumstances. While forced labor may
 technically be legal in some cases, this provision of the
 Chiefs' Authority Act has not been invoked since independence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Kenyan judiciary usually exhibits considerable
 independence. In cases involving detention under the
 Preservation of Public Security Act, its authority is limited
 to ensuring compliance with procedural provisions. Aside from
 these security cases, the right to a fair public trial is
 usually observed, although long delays and postponements are
 common.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts, and verdicts may be
 appealed to the Kenyan high court. High court justices,
 however, are appointed and dismissed solely at the pleasure of
 the President and are thus susceptible to executive pressure.
 Military personnel are tried by military courts, and verdicts
 may be appealed. Judge advocates are appointed on a case by
 case basis by the chief justice. Members of the press
 regularly attend and report on court proceedings, both civilian
 and military. Kenyans do not have a right to representation
 by legal counsel, except in certain capital cases. Most, but
 not all, persons tried for capital crimes are provided counsel
 free of charge if they cannot afford it.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security officials occasionally conduct illegal searches to
 apprehend suspected criminals or seize allegedly stolen
 property. In 1986 searches and security sweeps were conducted
 in areas along the Ugandan border in an effort to apprehend
 illegal aliens and uncover smuggled goods, especially
 firearms. The homes of suspected dissidents, including
 university professors, have also been entered and searched,
 usually for alleged subversive or incriminating documents.
 Security forces reportedly occasionally employ surveillance
 techniques and electronic invasion of the home.

 KENYA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are proclaimed in the Constitution.
 In practice, however, these freedoms have been narrowly
 interpreted by Kenyan authorities (e.g., Parliament is not
 permitted to discuss foreign affairs). The existence and use
 of the detention provisions of the Preservation of Public
 Security Act discourage public exchange of views on political
 topics. There is no systematic formal censorship of the
 Kenyan press, but in April a major Nairobi newspaper published
 a list of 18 widely varying publications which are prohibited
 in Kenya. The publications, which attack the Government as
 authoritarian and undemocratic, are mostly published abroad
 and are prohibited under sections 63 and 52 of the penal code.
 Pressure has also been brought on journalists and publications
 not to stray too far from the prescribed government line. In
 some instances journalists have been fired or detained without
 charge. Government officials regularly caution editors against
 printing information they wish withheld from the public, and
 the editors usually comply. However, during the recent
 controversy about queueing in future elections, the press
 printed strong arguments from politicians and the clergy
 against the Government's position. The press occasionally
 reports unflattering news about government civil servants but
 rarely criticizes government leaders and never criticizes or
 attacks the President. The Government also discourages
 political activism by university faculty and students. Kenya's
 institutions of higher learning, especially the University of
 Nairobi, have frequently been closed and not reopened until
 assurances were given that students would cease political
 activity. Kenyan officials regularly denounce university
 lecturers for alleged disloyalty and the preaching of
 tribalism.
 Kenya has a 30-member film censorship board under the auspices
 of the Ministry of Culture and Social Sciences. While the
 board must approve all films shown in Kenya, a variety of uncut
 foreign films are available in Kenya. A 10-member television
 censorship board has established guidelines that govern what
 can be shown on television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are guaranteed by the
 Kenyan Constitution, although these rights are limited by the
 Public Order and Police Act, which gives local authorities wide
 powers to control public gatherings. It is illegal to convene
 an unlicensed meeting, and politicians have been investigated
 or arrested for violations of this statute. Licenses to hold
 public meetings are rarely denied. When they are, it is
 usually on the grounds that the proposed meeting might disturb
 civil order. With the exception of civil servants, who are
 required to join KANU, Kenyans are not officially required to
 join any political organization. Some Kenyans complained of
 intimidation and harassment during the 1986 KANU recruitment
 drive. Party membership has in fact become a test of one's
 loyalty to the Government. It is seen increasingly as a
 prerequisite to enjoying the full benefits of Kenyan
 citizenship. The Government and the party itself both claim
 that party membership is strictly voluntary.
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement. Its only
 trade union confederation, the Central Organization of Trade
 
 
 150
 KENYA
 Unions (COTU), is affiliated with the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity. The employees of all permanent enterprises
 employing at least 7 persons may be organized into trade
 unions. Approximately 75 percent of such workers are actually
 unionized, but the widespread use of temporary workers inhibits
 organizing efforts. In fact, unions represent a greater number
 of workers in collective bargaining than actual membership
 suggests because nonunion workers are frequently covered by
 collective bargaining agreements negotiated for their
 respective enterprises. Union elections in 1986 have thus far
 demonstrated that democracy still exists in the Kenyan trade
 union movement. Some recent campaign practices, however,
 (such as excluding certain members from running for office)
 prompted the Minister of Labor to urge unions to overhaul
 their constitutions to permit freer expression of dissenting
 views.
 Complex labor legislation renders strikes virtually illegal.
 Strikes are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor has not
 taken action towa-d resolution within 21 days after the formal
 declaration of a dispute. Wildcat strikes of 1 or 2 days are
 quite common. Most union disputes are settled by the parties
 involved, although Kenya's dispute resolution mechanism, the
 Industrial Relations Court, has a well-earned reputation for
 fairness and impartiality. All union contracts in Kenya are
 subject to Government guidelines which limit salary increases.
 Some unions that have been unable to get the total allowable
 increase through collective bargaining have had success,
 however, in obtaining the maximum salary increase through
 litigation in the Industrial Court. Some unions have also
 gained additional workers benefits, such as expanded health
 insurance coverage and increased housing allowances. All
 collective agreements must be approved by the Industrial
 Court, which has become the model for several other industrial
 courts in Africa.
 A few professional organizations such as the Law Society of
 Kenya have been. formed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A wide range of religious groups exists in Kenya, and freedom
 of worship is protected by the Constitution. The Government,
 however, in 1986 criticized church leaders for alleged meddling
 in politics, notably the queueing question, and refused to
 register religious groups which it believes may pursue
 activities harmful to Kenyan society. Nevertheless, foreign
 missionaries are permitted to enter and work in Kenya, and
 there is no specific religious requirement for holding
 political office. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
 Saints has tried without success to obtain registration for
 the past 4 years. The Government, however, has not interfered
 with Mormon meetings, nor has it registered any other church
 during this period.
 In 1986 the Government and some church leaders disagreed over
 the proposed new voting procedure to require voters to express
 their preferences by physically queueing behind their chosen
 candidates instead of using the ballot box. Many of the most
 respected church leaders publicly expressed the view that the
 proposed voting shift represents a further decline in the
 democratic systems of the country. Subsequently, the
 Government announced that church leaders (and others in certain
 specified positions) would be exempted from the proposed
 
 
 KENYA
 queueing requirement. Church leaders continue to oppose the
 proposed law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Kenya is restricted only by certain provisions
 of the Preservation of Public Security Act, which limits
 movement of persons considered dangerous to public security.
 These provisions are rarely invoked. Following the 1982 coup
 attempt, the Government expanded the controls over travel
 abroad. Although Kenya does not officially prohibit emigration
 of its nationals, in some cases the Government has seized the
 passports of controversial Kenyans.
 Kenya continues to accept refugees, despite the country's high
 rate of unemployment. In 1986 Kenya accepted over 8,000
 documented refugees, most of whom were from Uganda, Ethiopia,
 and Rwanda. An estimated 20,000 more persons have taken refuge
 in Kenya unofficially. Unrest in Uganda has prompted many
 Ugandans to enter Kenya illegally, and the Kenyan Government
 has begun to tighten security in order to limit their numbers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Moi and a small group of advisors control all major
 policy decisions in the Government and the party. Within the
 one-party system, a wide range of candidates competes for
 party and National Assembly positions. In the most recent
 general election (1983), up to 15 candidates contested a
 single parliamentary seat. In that same election, 35 percent
 of parliamentary incumbents were voted out of office,
 including 5 ministers and 18 assistant ministers. Some
 critics see the proposed queueing system as a means to tighten
 party control over the electoral process.
 In Kenya's postindependence history, neither the President nor
 the Vice President has faced an opposing candidate. The
 Government encourages but does not coerce the electorate to
 vote. Members of all ethnic groups are permitted to run for
 office, and President Moi has broadened ethnic representation
 in the Government and party. Persons from 12 different ethnic
 groups hold cabinet portfolios. Sixteen groups, including
 Europeans, are represented among the 43 assistant ministers in
 the Government. Three women hold seats in the National
 Assembly. More than 20 female candidates were elected to
 municipal office in 1983. The range of allowable discussion
 on domestic issues in the National Assembly is fairly broad,
 although there is no criticism of the President or any of his
 policies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to criticism regarding human
 rights in the country. Various groups, including Amnesty
 International, have appealed to the Government to abandon its
 use of formal detention without charge. President Moi has
 publicly criticized Amnesty International and other outside
 groups for meddling in Kenyan politics. There are several
 Kenyan organizations which address certain issues related to
 human rights, but none which focuses exclusively on human
 
 
 152
 KENYA
 rights in Kenya. Kenya has not ratified the Organization of
 African Unity's Human Rights Charter adopted at that
 organization's 1981 summit in Nairobi.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is a diverse country that does not practice legal
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Despite recent gains by women in many
 fields, and the emergence of influential women in Parliament,
 Government ministries, and the professions, they remain
 underrepresented in educational institutions, government, and
 business. This is not a matter of policy, but rather the
 product of a traditional culture that has long prescribed very
 limited roles for women. Women are a crucial factor in Kenyan
 labor and provide about three-quarters of Kenyan farm labor.
 Female farm labor is likely to maintain its prominent position
 because of the continuing migration of men to cities in search
 of higher-paying jobs. In the modern sector, women earn less
 than men for comparable work. Many Kenyan ethnic groups still
 practice female circumcision, although the Government has
 mounted a major effort to eliminate the practice and forbids
 such operations to be conducted in Government facilities.
 Kenya's Asian community, which numbers about 65,000, accounts
 for approximately one-quarter of the country's total economic
 output. Kenya's Africanization campaign has resulted in some
 Asian emigration, and many Asians are concerned about the
 long-term implications of the policy. Kenya amended its
 citizenship law in 1984, depriving many Asians and Europeans
 of Kenyan citizenship. Under the present law, people born in.
 Kenya of non-Kenyan parents can no longer claim Kenyan
 citizenship.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Kenya's population of approximately 21 million is projected to
 double early in the 21st century. Urbanization continues to
 accelerate rapidly, but approximately 80 percent of Kenyans
 still live in rural areas, and most are employed in subsistence
 or semisubsistence agriculture. Of approximately 1 million
 persons who work in the wage economy, approximately 50 percent
 are government employees.
 The legal minimum age for employment in Kenya is 16, but the
 law, which is reviewed periodically by the Government, is
 virtually unenforceable, and many children begin work at an
 earlier age. Kenya has adequate legislation to provide
 acceptable and safe conditions for workers, including
 occupational safety and health, but the Government is unable
 to enforce compliance. The maximum legally allowable work
 week in Kenya is 52 hours. A minimum wage is established.
