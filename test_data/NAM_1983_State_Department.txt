 NAMIBIA*
 Namibia is administered by South Africa, originally under
 a League of Nations mandate (1920-1966), and since 1966
 illegally on a de facto basis. Human rights practices in
 Namibia reflect the application of laws imposed by South
 Africa, the conditions of military conflict, and the
 character of Namibia's geography, population, and economy.
 Generally arid, but with rich natural resources, Namibia
 supports a population of just over one million, over half
 of which is concentrated in the relatively well-watered
 northeastern area. The modern mining, farming, and industrial
 sectors of the economy, controlled by the white minority,
 have affected traditional tribal African society without
 transforming it. Africans residing in urban areas and
 the many migratory workers have adopted Western ways, but
 traditional society remains intact in the rural areas.
 Executive power over Namibia rests with the Administrator
 General, appointed by the South African Government, who has
 the authority to issue proclamations with the force of law.
 Beginning in 1980, considerable authority had been transferred
 to an interim three-tier system of elected representatives,
 dividing governing responsibility among central, ethnic, and
 local authorities. However, the central government (*first-
 tier") level, consisting of a Council of Ministers and a
 National Assembly chosen in South African-supervised 1978
 elections, was dissolved in January 1983, when the Administrator
 General resumed direct rule. - The Council of Ministers and
 National Assembly were never recognized as legitimate government
 institutions by the United States, the United Nations, or
 the international community.
 The "second-tier" authorities--separate bodies representing
 each of the 12 officially-designated population groups
 except the Bushmen, who are governed directly by the central
 government--exercise semiautonomous authority in areas
 determined by the Administrator General. Not all of the
 ethnic authorites have equal power, and, under this system,
 whites prosper disproportionately. The "third-tier" authorities,
 such as municipal governments and village management boards, are
 limited to providing local services. In 1983, official
 commissions have criticized this three-tier structure for
 corruption and inefficiency.
 The judiciary in Namibia comprises two overlapping systems:
 one for whites, "Westernized" blacks, and persons of mixed
 race; the other for indigenous Africans. Wide-ranging
 security legislation, much adopted from South Africa,
 violates rights to due process. A judicial commission
 of inquiry was appointed by the Administrator General in
 November 1983 to examine security legislation and submit
 recommendations on its "adequacy, fairness, and efficacy".
 The continued denial of independence is the most fundamental
 violation of human rights in Namibia. The people of Namibia
 also suffer from the military conflict which began in mid-1966
 between the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
 and the combined forces of the South African Defense Force
 *There is no United States mission in Namibia, and the United
 States Government has only limited information about the human
 rights situation there.

 and the South West Africa Territorial Force. SWAPO's
 political and guerrilla miitary effort has included
 ambushes, minings, arson attacks, some urban terrorism and,
 reportedly, political assassinations. SWAPO guerrilla
 military units operating in small teams have annually
 attempted to penetrate Namibia from bases in southern
 Angola. In turn, South African units carry out political
 and military counterinsurgency operations in Namibia. The
 Defense Force also maintains a salient in southwestern
 Angola, sometimes taking action to attempt to disrupt SWAPO
 at the Angola bases. Civilians have suffered intimidation and
 abuse from both sides or have been caught in crossfire between
 the two antagonists. Allegations of torture by South African
 security elements have been sustained in court proceedings.
 There was continued progress in 1983 in the negotiations
 to bring about a peaceful, internationally recognized
 settlement in Namibia, based on Security Council Resolution
 435. The U.N. Secretary General's August 1983 visit to
 South Africa and Namibia helped advance the process.
 RESPECT FOR HUNAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Namibian insurgency has produced killings on both sides.
 In 1983, two members of the South West Africa Territorial
 Force and two members of "loevoet' (the Owambo-Kavango
 regional home guard) were convicted of murder. One was
 sentenced to death, and the other three to prison terms of
 from five to 15 years. Four other members of "Koevoet" were
 convicted of culpable homicide in killing a detainee. Their
 punishment consisted only of a fine. Under the Defense Act,
 large sections of Namibia are declared to be security areas,
 in which actions taken by security force personnel can be
 justified if shown to have been taken in good faith. In
 May 1983, the Defense Force established a military board of
 inquiry to investigate charges of the death of three persons
 and the torture of three detainees in the "operational
 area", which includes the Owambo and Kavango regions.
 Results have not yet been announced. In October 1983, police
 officials affirmed that charges against elements of the
 police force would be investigated.
 Military and civilian authorities allege that SWAPO has changed
 from a policy of planting mines targeted at military vehicles
 to one of indiscriminate mining of all roads. As of September
 1983, mines had killed 15 non-combatants, according to South
 African military figures. An additional 30 non-combatants
 died in crossfire. Minings are locally recognized as
 indiscriminate, but some Namibian black leaders argue that
 the people accept casualties in the hope that SWAPO might
 succeed in hitting Defense Force targets. Authorities also
 charge that SWAPO engages in political murder or kills
 villagers who resist abduction or forced recruitment. Defense
 Force figures cite 65 members of the local population
 murdered in the first nine months of 1983. Urban terrorism
 has included the occasional bombing of facilities in the
 capital city of Windhoek.
 
 
 342
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances are a regular feature of life in Namibia.
 Young people either voluntarily leave to join SWAPO or are
 kidnapped and Impressed into guerrilla ranks. The Defense
 Force claims that- in the period January-September 1983, 275
 civilians were kidnapped. It is not possible to evaluate
 competing allegations on the ratio of kidnappings to voluntary
 recruitment into SWAPO. Earlier reports that thousands have
 fled Namibia to avoid service in the South African-controlled
 forces since the 1981 introduction of conscription also
 remain unconfirmed. Authorities state that the current
 serious agricultural situation and economic recession have
 caused enough volunteers to come forward to obviate the need
 for a draft.
 One case of a permanent disappearance was reported in 1983
 (Mr. Johannes Kavuka of Kavango). A finding of maltreatment
 against Mr. Kavuka by four "Koevoet" personnel was judicially
 entered.
 There continue to be allegations of incommunicado detention.
 The Government continues to withold information on detentions,
 making it difficult for families to locate relatives.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Tteatment or
 Punishment
 South African authorities use a range of laws, including
 the Terrorism Act, the Security Act, and relevant proclamations
 of the Administrator General, to arrest, detain, and interrogate
 widely. Namibian internal political leaders have publicly
 charged that abuses of these powers have included systematic
 torture of suspected SWAPO agents in the operational area.
 Local clergymen, many of them sympathatic to SWAPO, have
 supported these charges. Victims of such abuse from the
 Kavango area told the press on November 6 that torture
 included beatings and electric shock applied to the head.
 A series of trials have resulted in exposure of indiscipline
 and brutality of *Koevoet" members. Sentences for those
 found guilty range from long jail terms to reprimands. In
 October, a South African police spokesman affirmed that
 allegations of atrocities would be investigated. Authorities
 state that investigations require victims to come forward and
 press charges. Critics counter that victims and relatives are
 afraid to come forward. Fifteen affidavits of torture were
 lodged with the Windhoek Supreme Court on November 22, to
 support a request for a restraining order on the security
 police.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest without access to the courts or to lawyers is
 possible under various laws and proclamations in Namibia,
 including Administrator General Proclamation Number Nine
 (AG-9), which provides for renewable 30-day periods of
 detention. In 1983, 28 persons in Kavango, five in Windhoek,
 and one in Bushmanland were detained under provision of AG-9.
 The chairman of the Namibia Christian Democratic Party,
 Mr. Hans Rohr, has charged that more than 50 persons are
 detained under AG-9. The exact number'is unknown. However,
 on December 14, 24 AG-9 detainees from Kavango were released
 
 
 343
 at the end of what was termed "police investigations."  In
 September 1983, the Administrator General announced that a
 commission of inquiry would be appointed to make recommendations
 on the "adequacy, fairness, and efficacy of legislation
 pertaining to the internal security" of Namibia. Justice
 H.P. Van Dyk was to chair the commission, whose terms of
 reference have not yet been published.
 The number of detainees is difficult to estimate. Twenty-nine
 members of the Kavango tribe were being held as suspected
 SWAPO activists as of November 1983. A large number of
 persons, including some civil servants and a Lutheran pastor,
 were arrested in October. The Council of Churches in
 Namibia placed their number at 50. An unknown number of
 others are held elsewhere in Namibia. In November, a cleric
 of the Namibian Evangelical Reformed Church was detained.
 The Windhoek regional chairman of SWAPO, Mr. Marco Hausiko,
 was detained November 18. Other internal SWAPO officials
 are also held under the provisions of proclamations by the
 Administrator General.
 The South African Government has confirmed that it also holds
 146 prisoners, including 14 Angolans, at a detention camp near
 Mariental, most of whom were captured in a raid on SWAPO bases
 near Cassinga, Angola, in 1978. Since the South African Govern-
 ment does not accord these persons prisoner of war status, yet
 cannot convict them of ordinary crimes, they remain in indefin-
 ite detention as political prisoners. Representatives of
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visit
 the detainees periodically. In a 1982 report, the ICRC
 noted that, of the security detainees at Mariental, it was
 believed 97 were SWAPO members who chose not to convert to
 support of the authorities.
 Some detainees are freed under "release warrants" that restrict
 movements and public statements. This is similar to "banning"
 under the South African Internal Security Act. Statistics are
 not released, but observers believe this is a frequent practice.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Parts of Namibia are under martial law. South African law,
 as adopted in Namibia, also limits access to civil courts.
 Detention without trial is common. Once brought to court,
 however, an accused has access to effective counsel. Charges
 are clearly stated at the time of formal arraignment. All
 cases, including violations of the Terrorism Act or the
 Internal Security Act, are tried in civilian court because no
 state of war has been formally declared. No SWAPO guerrillas
 or political activists have been tried by military court.
 One person (a SWAPO vice president) is currently banned and
 restricted to Walvis Bay. Bannings are administrative procedures
 and require no judicial hearing. Forty-two Namibians are serving
 sentences on Robben Island in South Africa for offenses dealing
 essentially with the formation of SWAPO over 20 years ago.
 Three persons in this category were released in 1982. No other
 releases are scheduled until 1985.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 23
 
 
 344
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Invasion of the home is commonplace, especially in the
 operational area of northern Namibia. The power of the
 military in those areas, and the provisions of security
 legislation elsewhere, supersede legal requirements for
 warrants to search private homes.
 Political figures in Namibia assert that their correspondence
 is monitored. Telephone surveillance is said to be common,
 especially for political activists.
 In a 1971 advisory opinion, the International Court of
 Justice found that South Africa's administration of
 Namibia "based on grounds of race, color, descent, or
 national or ethnic origin" was a "denial of fundamental
 human rights" and "a flagrant violation of the purposes and
 principles of the United Nations charter". Since then
 South African authorities have removed many restrictions
 based on race. For example, housing and certain public
 facilities, such as swimming pools, are officially open to
 all races. However, both physical coercion and economic
 discrimination are sometimes utilized to maintain de facto
 segregation. For example, a public swimming pool in a
 largely white residential district of Windhoek charges a
 considerably higher admission fee than a new pool in a
 black township. In addition, white toughs forcibly dis-
 courage non-white use of the pool. Although restaurants and
 hotels are officially open to all races, the right of equal
 admission is often not enforced in less than deluxe establish-
 ments.
 Furthermore, in the areas of most direct importance to the
 majority of the territory's population--schools and
 hospitals--services are still supplied by separate ethnic
 second-tier governments. The effect is that whites with a
 much higher tax base have access to first-rate hospitals and
 an under-utilized teacher training college, while various
 black groups obtain distinctly inferior and overcrowded
 services. In addition, some facilities directly administered
 by the South African Government, such as the railroads, are
 still segregated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Police-enforced security legislation circumscribes individual
 rights to free speech, press, and association. Anything which
 is embarrassing to the state or concerns military or security
 matters may be subject to censorship. Such matters include the
 names of persons detained and the charges against them. Within
 this principle, however, the Namibian press has regularly
 embarrassed the Government with stories of corruption and
 malfeasance. Charges of brutality and violations of human
 rights regularly feature in the press, and political opinion,
 including that favoring SWAPO, is not censored. Independent
 observers offer analyses which contradict the official line.
 Some literature is "banned", and the possession of such
 literature can be grounds for prosecution.
 
 
 345
 Officially, the censorship law in Namibia is the same as for
 South Africa. In reality, enforcement of censorship in
 Namibia, determined by the Attorney General of Namibia, is
 considerably less stringent than in South Africa. Magazines
 such as the German publication Stern, which are considered
 risque in South Africa and are usually unavailable there,
 are freely sold in Namibia. Namibian newspapers have
 published articles on subjects such as uranium sales that
 would appear to be violations of South African law but were
 not prosecuted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Legislation introduced in 1981 places restrictions on political
 meetings. This law, the "Prohibition and Notification of
 Meetings Act", also requires political parties to abjure
 violence or the taking up of arms to effect political change.
 Under this law, political meetings are not prevented in advance,
 -but prosecution can result from violations. Political meetings
 of fewer than 20 persons are legal and have occurred, but no
 party has been willing to test the act by holding meetings of-
 more than 20 persons. Trade union leaders complain that they
 cannot get permission to hold general meetings but that they
 are able to hold smaller, informal meetings for which they do
 not seek authorization. The number of actual prosecutions is
 unknown.
 Namibia's six labor unions are all registered and all
 nominally nonracial. Few union members are black except in
 the mine workers union. Of the six unions, only the municipal
 workers union, which is basically a white collar workers
 organization, and the mine workers union can be described as
 functioning employee organizations. The mine workers union
 still suffers, however, from the fact that it is only
 represented in one of the three mining houses. Strikes are
 legal, but the machinery for handling disputes is so cumbersome
 that it is never used. Strikes are therefore invariably of the
 wildcat variety and therefore illegal. Black labor militancy
 is little evident because the circumstances of the major
 employers, the mining houses, are such that employers are able
 to discourage worker organizations. The widespread use of
 migrant workers living in compounds controlled by mine
 management, along with an extremely paternalistic approach to
 workers by management, contribute to this passivity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in Namibia, although some church-
 men state that the authorities harass them for alleged pro-SWAPO
 sentiments or statements critical of the South African presence
 in Namibia. The authorities assert that the churches, especially
 the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Owambo-Kavango and Finnish
 Lutheran missionaries, harbor pro-SWAPO sympathies. A Lutheran
 pastor, Rev. Heikki Hausiku, was among those arrested in Kavango
 in October. Non-Namibian church groups opposed to South African
 administration, including South African and foreign bodies, visit
 regularly. Two Windhoek members of the Council of Churches in
 Namibia, Mr. Gregor Makgobane and Mr. Rahimise Kahimise, continue
 to be held in detention, according to the security police.
 The military conscription system of 1981 does not provide
 for conscientious objection to military service.
 
 
 346
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is much freer in Namibia than in South Africa.
 Passes have been abolished. Curfews and check points in the
 northern operational area restrict movements there, as does
 the military situation in general, especially the fear of
 landmines. Travel by blacks into South Africa is controlled.
 No recent reports cite resettlement of any ethnic group.
 Thousands of members of the Herero tribe are in the process
 of negotiating a voluntary departure from Botswana to return
 to Namibia.
 Travel abroad is complicated. Church figures suspected of
 SWAPO sympathies and those formally associated with SWAPO
 are denied passports or have difficulty renewing them. The
 "Departure from the Union Regulations Act of 1955" requires
 all who leave South Africa or Namibia to have a passport.
 The penalty for contravention is a mandatory sentence of
 three months to two years. All those entering South Africa
 or Namibia must have a passport and visa unless they can
 prove to be South African or Namibian by law or descent.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 South Africa's administration effectively undermines the
 right to change government. At present the Administrator
 General holds all executive and legislative power. Within
 that framework, political activity, subject to restrictions
 on meetings noted above, goes on. Even SWAPO has an internal
 wing cautiously active in Windhoek.
 Namibian society is highly politicized, with four white
 and about 40 nonwhite political groups, ranging from modern
 political parties to traditional groups based on tribal
 authority. Some represent single tribes or ethnic groups;
 others encompass several. Most participate in political
 alliances, some of which are multiracial, with frequently
 shifting membership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Critics of the human rights situation in Namibia regularly
 travel there, although the South African Government took
 steps in September 1983 to deport a press team secretly
 investigating human rights violations. In October a group
 of Anglican clergy spent two weeks in Namibia to investigate,
 among other things, human rights conditions. Their report
 has yet to be published, but their statements to the press
 were critical of acts of intimidation, torture, and brutality
 by security forces.
 Amnesty International was concerned about the use of
 detention without trial and the deaths in custody of three
 uncharged political prisoners held incommunicado by South
 African security forces. Freedom House did not report on
 Namibia in 1983.
 
 
 347
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Namibia enjoys a sophisticated and extensive physical
 infrastructure. A modern economy in which most whites
 participate co-exists with a traditional, subsistence,
 agriculturally-based economy, in which most of the majority
 black population takes part. While the modern sector is no
 longer exclusively a white preserve, generally speaking, the
 racial division of the two co-existing economic structures
 remains in place. In large measure, this is due to the
 administration of important government services, particularly
 health and education, by the ethnically-based second-tier
 governments. This awkward and inefficient system of government
 perpetuates the historical pattern of substantial qualitative
 and quantitative differences in government services provided
 to white and black Namibians.
 The situation of women in Namibia, like that of women in
 South Africa, divides legally between the prescriptions of
 either tribal codes or the Roman-Dutch precepts of South
 African law. The second-tier governments are alleged not
 to have a consistent policy on whether to invoke Roman-Dutch
 law or tribal law in cases involving women. There are
 unsubstantiated claims that the status of women varies among
 the different ethnic groups. In the modernized sector, women
 are said to be unable to take out loans or own property
 without their husbands' approval. Women are subject to
 salary discrimination as well.
 The population of Namibia is just over one million: seven
 percent white and 93 percent black. The population growth
 rate was 3.0 percent in 1983. Life expectancy at birth is
 approximately 52 years, and the infant mortality rate (1983)
 is 114.5 per 1,000 live births. Calorie supply as a percentage
 of requirements was 96.78 percent in 1977. Literacy figures
 (1983) are 100 percent for whites and 28 percent for blacks,
 with school attendance 100 percent for whites and 16 percent
 for blacks. In 1981, per capita gross domestic product was
 about $1,500, with distribution of income heavily skewed in
 favor of the white population. The economy has been stagnating,
 if not actually declining in recent years. This reflects
 conditions created by persistent drought, over-fishing of
 Namibian waters, the disincentive to private investment of
 unsettled political conditions, and soft export demand for
 Namibian minerals (primarily diamonds, copper, and uranium)
 and karakul wool.
