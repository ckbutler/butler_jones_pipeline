 BELARUS
 Belarus has a government in which nearly all power is concentrated in the hands
 of the President. Since his election in July 1994 as the country's first President,
 Aleksandr Lukashenko has consolidated power steadily in the executive branch
 through authoritarian means. He used a November 1996 referendum to amend the
 1994 Constitution in order to broaden his powers and extend his term in office. The
 President ignored the then-Constitutional court's ruling that the Constitution could
 not be amended by referendum. As a result, the current political system is based
 
 
 1142
 on the 1996 Constitution which was adopted in an unconstitutional manner. Most
 members of the international community criticized the flawed referendun and do
 not recognize the legitimacy of the 1996 Constitution or the legislature. Although
 the amended Constitution provides for a formal separation of powers, the President
 dominates all other branches of government. The current acting legislature was not
 elected directly, but was created out of the-remnants of the former Parliament
 which Lukashenko disbanded soon after the 1996 referendum. The Constitution lim-
 its the legislature to meeting twice per year'for no more than a total of 170 days.
 Presidentialdecrees made when -the legislature is out of session have the force of
 law, except-in theory-7in those cases restricted by the 1996 Constitution. The 1996
 Constitution also allows' the President to issue decrees having the force of law in
 circumstances of "specific necessity and urgency," a provision that President
 Lukashenko has interpreted broadly. The judiciary is not independent.
 Law enforcement and internal security responsibilities are shared by the Commit-
 tee for State Security (KGB) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), both of which
 answer directly to the President:. Civilian authoriti~s do not maintain effective con-
 trol of the security forces. Under President Lukashenko's direction, the Presidential
 Guard-initially created to protect senior officials--continued to act against the
 President's political enemies with no judicial or legislative oversight. Members of
 the security forces committed numerous human rights abuses.,
 The country's political leadership opposesany significant economic reforms and
 remains committed ideologically to a planned economy. While government officials
 cite continued claimed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of approximately 7
 percent during the year as justification for their policies, most independent analysts
 agree that what growth that has occurred, if any, was the result principally of mas-
 sive credits to the debt-ridden state sector. Increased governmental controls on cur-
 rency convertibility in the wake of significant declines in the value of the ruble dur-
 ing the year (which decreased more than tenfold) resulted in a critical shortage of
 foreign currency reserves and stifled the export sector. Per capita GDP officially're-
 mained constant during the year at approximately $1,100, but in reality was prob-
 ably much lower. Leading exports are trucks, tractors, chemical fertilizers, and fi-
 bers. The majority of workers are employed in the state industrial and agricultural
 sectors. Although the unreliability of official statistics makes it difficult to assess
 accurately economic conditions, living standards for many segments of society con-
 tinued to decline. Calculated at a market rate, the average monthly wage dropped
 170 percent from $88 to $33 over the course of the year. Residents of small towns
 and rural areas where incomes are particularly low and wage arrears more preva-
 lent sustain themselves through unreported economic activity and small gardens.
 The Government's human rights record again worsened significantly as the Presi-
 dent sought to neutralize domestic opposition to his attempts to lead the country
 back toward Soviet-era authoritarian practices. The Government severely limits the
 right of citizens to change their government. Security forces continued to beat de-
 tainees and prisoners, and were implicated in the beating of political opponents, in-
 cluding minors and independent -journalists. The practice of severe hazing in mili-
 tary units apparently continued to abate somewhat, and prison conditions remained
 poor. Security forces arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens, and the number of
 apparently politically motivated- arrests increased, although most of those arrested
 soon were released. Prolonged detention and delays in trials occurred in a number
 of politically sensitive cases. There was at least one political prisoner. Prolonged de-
 tention and delays in trials were common. The security services infringed on citi-
 zens' privacy rights and monitored closely the activities of opposition politicians and
 other segments of the population. Restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, and
 peaceful assembly continued, and the Government did not respect freedom of asso-
 ciation. The Government imposed some limits on freedom of religion, and restricted
 freedom of movement. International human rights monitors were closely monitored
 and were harassed frequently by government security agents. Discrimination and
 domestic violence against women remained significant problems. Societal anti-Semi-
 tism persists. Authorities continued to restrict workers' rights to associate freely, or-
 ganize, and bargain.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From;
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1996 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person and specifically
 
 
 1143
 prohibits torture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. However, po-
 lce and prison guards reportedly beat detainees and prisoners, although political ac-
 tivists who were arrestedin the second half of the year report that in general police
 and prison guards treated them without physical violence. Law enforcement and
 prison officials may usephysical force against detainees and prisoners if the latter
 are violent, have refused to obey the instructions of the prison administration, or
 have violated "maliciously" the terms of their sentences. However, human rights
 monitors credibly report that investigators coerce confessions using physical and
 psychological pressure. Although such behavior is against the law, the Government
 seldom, if ever, punishes those who commit such abuses. Guards used force against
 detainees to coerce confessions as well as during routine activities. Police also beat
 demonstrators (see Section 2.b.).
 On February 24, police officials reportedly beat and choked 52-year-old Vladimir
 Yukho, a member of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front (BNF), who was de-
 tained during the trial of BNF-affiliated Youth Front members Aleksey Shidlovskiy
 and Vadim Labkovich (see Sections 1.d. and I.e.). Yukho's hand was smashed in the
 door of a police car during his arrest. A researcher from the nongovernmental orga-
 nization (NGO) Human Rights Watch later documented the bruises on Yukho's neck
 and the injury to his hand. Government authorities subsequently fined Yukho for
 participating in an unauthorized demonstration and resisting arrest.
 On February 24, following a 6-month period of pretrial detention, Aleksey
 Shidlovskiy, who reached the age of 19 while in detention, was sentenced to 2 years
 in a strict-regime prison for spray painting antipresidential graffiti (see Sections 1.d.
 and I.e.). According to Shidlovskiy's family, prison guards repeatedly beat
 Shidlovskiy and denied him medical treatment.
 On April 2, according to credible information from human rights groups, police
 and security officials beat a number of opposition supporters whom they detained
 following an unsanctioned political protest against the Russia-Belarus union charter
 (see Section 2.b.). While in police custody for the same incident, 15-year-old Dmitriy
 Vaskovich was kicked, beaten, and denied food, according to the Belarusian Helsinki
 Committee, a local human rights NGO. The State Procurator's office later rejected
 the complaint of illegal abuse filed by Vaskovich's mother following the boy's release
 after several days in detention. In April 17-year-old Stefan Kulchanko was punched
 in the face and choked following his detention by plainclothes security officials. A
 human rights monitor interviewed Kulchanko on April 6, following Kulchanko's re-
 lease from detention, and observed a clearly visible black eye that Kulchanko re-
 ceived while being arrested. On May 27, the Marina-Gorka Executive Committee
 District Commission for Juveniles gave Kulchanko an official warning and rep-
 rimand. In April BNF Executive Secretary Vyacheslav Sivchyk suffered a severe
 concussion from a beating he received by plainclothes security officials who detained
 him. Although sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment for participating in an
 unsanctioned demonstration, Sivchyk was released following his discharge from the
 hospital on April 6. Police also detained and beat Youth Front leader Pavel
 Severinets (see Section 1.d.). He was held in pretrial detention until June 3 on
 charges of "malicious hooliganism." Criminal proceedings against Severinets subse-
 quently were dropped on December 4.
 On April 25, according to the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, police detained and
 beat a number of persons who were taken into detention following their participa-
 tion in a peaceful march to commemorate the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe (see
 Section 2.b.). Some detainees later claimed that they were forced to sign false state-
 ments.
 Following a Ministry of Defense announcement in 1996 that "dedovshchina," the
 practice of hazing new recruits, would be tolerated no longer, this practice of severe
 harassment and physical abuse of new draftees by senior soldiers to maintain strict
 discipline apparently continued to abate somewhat. Local human rights groups did
 not report the problem to be extensive during the year.
 Prison conditions are poor, and are marked by severe overcrowding, shortages of
 food and medicine, and the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis.
 Conditions at prison hospitals also are poor, according to human rights monitors.
 Detainees in pretrial detention facilities also reported poor conditions and denial of
 medical treatment, which contributed to their declining health while they awaited
 trial. Vadzim Kabanchuk, an opposition activist released in March, after being held
 for 6 months in a detention center in Minsk, complained that he had been forced
 to share a cell designed for 14 people with 32 other prisoners.
 During an official press conference on August 11, the Deputy Procurator General
 acknowledged severe prison overcrowding. He stated that most prisons were de-
 signed and built during the Soviet era, and that construction of new facilities is un-
 likely because of the Government's financial difficulties. According to NGO sources,
 
 
 1144
 approximately 64,000 persons are held in prisons or places of detention in facilities
 that, according to official data, were designed to hold only up to 41,000 persons.
 Human rights monitors sometimes were granted access to observe prison condi-
 tions, although the Government did not honor some requests to meet with individ-
 ual prisoners. Late in the year, officers from the Minsk Advisory and Monitoring
 Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were per-
 mitted to visit a number of individuals held in prison and detention facilities on
 what are believed to be politically motivated charges and convictions. -
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government has amended only
 slightly its Soviet-era law on detention. During the year, security forces continued
 to arrest arbitrarily and detain citizens, most often in connection with demonstra-
 tions, some of which were not authorized. There continue to be politically motivated
 arrests, although most of those arrested soon were released. The Criminal Procedure
 Code provides that police may' detain a person suspected of a crime for 24 hours
 without a warrant, within which time the procurator is notified. The procurator
 then has 48 hours to review the legality of the detention. If the procurator deems
 the detention legal, a suspect can be held for a maximum of 10 days without formal
 charge. However, usually once the decision is made to hold a suspect, a formal
 charge is made. Once a suspect is charged, a trial must be initiated within 2
 months, although in some cases the Procurator General can extend pretrial deten-
 tion to 18 months to allow for further investigation. Alternatively,' a suspect who
 has been charged can be released on a written pledge not to flee, in which case there
 is no time limit on the pretrial investigation. The law allows detainees the right to
 apply to the court (rather than the procurator) to determine the legality of their de-
 tentions. However, in practice, suspects' appeals to have their detentions reviewed
 -by the courts frequently are suppressed because detainees are at the mercy of inves-
 tigators, and detention officials are unwilling to forward the appeals. There is no
 provision for bail under the current legal code. According to the Belarusian-Helsinki
 Committee, in late 1998 there were 64,000 persons in detention.
 By law detainees may be allowed unlimited access to legal counsel, and, for those
 who cannot afford counsel, the court appoints a lawyer. However, investigators rou-
 tinely fail to inform detainees of their rights and conduct preliminary interrogations
 without giving detainees an opportunity to consult counsel. The information gained
 then is used against the defendant in court. Even when appointed by the state, de-
 fense attorneys are subordinate to the executive branch of power.
 Detainees and lawyers both report restrictions on consultations. Government au-
 thorities also disbarred or threatened to disbar a number of attorneys who had been
 involved in'politically sensitive cases. On April 15, the Government barred Garry
 Pogonyailo, who had defended persons in' several high-profile political cases, from
 officially consulting with or representing Youth Front Leader Pavel Severinets (see
 Section 1.c.). On June 2, the Ministry of Justice' stripped Pogonyaio of his license
 to practice (see Section i.e.). The Ministry of Justice and the Minsk Collegium of
 Advocates repeatedly threatened defense attorney Vera Stremkovskaya with disbar-
 ment following a trip abroad in September, during which she criticized human
 rights violations in Belarus at a talk sponsored by the NGO International League
 for Human Rights. According to Stremkovskaya, Supreme Court Justice Valentin
 Sukalo warned her on November 26 that she would have to mak6 a choice between
 human rights work and practicing law if she wished to keep her license. The treat-
 ment of Stremkovskaya underlines the lack of a truly independent bar association
 and-political interferencein the legal process (see Section i.e.).  - .
 As in 1997, the Government again held hundreds of political detainees during the
 year. Most were peaceful participants in antigovernment demonstrations who were
 held anywhere from several hours to several days (see Section 6.a.). For example
 on December 25, government security officers arrested approximately 10 persons, in-
 cluding journalists, at an unsanctioned demonstration against closer integration
 with Russia. On December 28, four of those detained each were sentenced to 5 days
 in prison, two were fined, and one was given an official warning (see Sections 2.a.
 and 2.b.). Unidentified, nonuniformed officials working for the security services reg-
 ularly apprehended participants in antigovernment demonstrations (see Section
 2.b.). There are credible reports that plainclothes security officials infitrated the
 antigovernment demonstrations and provoked incidents that led to clashes between
 demonstrators and police. Security forces on occasion preemptively apprehended or-
 ganizers and individuals considered to be potential participants prior to demonstra-
 tions, including those that had been sanctioned by the Government. -
 Following demonstrations, security officials held many detainees incommunicado.
 According to one official announcement, as of August, there were approximately
 11,000 persons in pretrial detention. Statistics on average length of pretrial deten-
 tion were not available.
 
 
 1145
 
 In addition to the hundredsof antigovernment protesters, whom authorities held
 for several hours or days, there were several prominent political detainees whom the
 Government held for prolonged periods in pretrial detention, some for over a year.
 For example, prior to his trial in January on the politically motivated charge of ille-
 gaily crossing the Belarusian border with Lithuania (see Section I.e.), journalist
 Pavel Sheremet was held in a KGB facility for 3 months. His cameraman, Dmitriy
 Zavadsky, was released after 3 weeks of detention following an appeal to President
 Lukashenko, which Zavadsky later claimed that he was forced to write under du-
 ress. Both were Belarusian citizens who were working for the Russian television
 network ORT and whose reporting was critical of the Government.
 In August 1997, BNF Youth  Front branch members Aleksey Shidlovskiy and
 Vadim Labkovich were arrested for spray painting antipresidential slogans. Prior to
 their trial in February, the two were held in pretria detention for 6 months (see
 Sections l.c. and i.e.). Despite the non-violent nature of the alleged crime, both
 were denied release pending trial. They were notified by authorities of the formal
 charges against them only in February, just a few weeks before the trial. Prison
 uards reportedly beat Shidlovskiy, who reached 19 years of age while in detention
 see Section 1.c.). Labkovich, although at age 16 still considered a juvenile under
 the law, was permitted only a few, limited visits by his family during his time in
 detention.
 Opposition-affiliated Youth Front leader Pavel Severinets, who was arrested for
 participating in a demonstration on April 2 (see Section 1.c.), was held in pretrial
 detention until June when he was released on his own recognizance.
 On September 2, police arrested regional BNF leader Vladimir Pleshchenko in
 Vitebsk in the northeast on charges that he allegedly vandalized a statue of 18th
 century Russian general Aleksandr Suvorov. He remained in pretrial detention at
 the end of the year.
 A number of former government officials and political figures also have been sub-
 jected to prolonged periods of pretrial detention for what may appear to be at least
 partially politically motivated charges. On February 11, police arrested Andrey
 Klnov, a successful entrepreneur and member of the Parliament that was dissolved
 in late 1996, on charges of embezzlement and other financial irregularities. Klimov's
 supporters and some human rights observers believe that his arrest was politically
 motivated because Klmov is an outspoken critic of President Lukashenko and had
 participated in a commission that examined violations of the law and the Constitu-
 ion by the President. As of year's end, Klimov remained in pretrial detention. In
 early December, the authorities announced that the investigation into charges
 against him was extended until February 11, 1999.
 Former agriculture minister Vasily Leonov and former director of the joint-stock
 agribusiness Rassvet Vasiliy Starovoitov were arrested in October 1997 for allegedly
 embezzling state credits, and at year's end also remained in detention. Despite ap-
 peals to do so, neither was released on their own recognizance due to age and poor
 health. Although it began officially on November 30, the trial of the 74-year-old
 Starovoitov, who suffered a stroke while in detention and has chronic bronchitis,
 was delayed repeatedly due to Starovoitov's deteriorating physical condition, which
 was aggravated by poor prison conditions.
 Local human rights observers believe that the two men were arrested to draw at-
 tention away from a poor harvest on heavily subsidized state farms. The Govern-
 ment is dedicated to maintaining a Soviet model of agriculture and Rassvet appar-
 ently posed a threat to such efforts. Immediately following Starovoitov's arrest, the
 Government renationalized his company.
 Former National Bank chairwoman Tamara Vinnikova, who was arrested in early
 1997 on allegations of malfeasance during her previous tenure as head of a state
 bank, remained under house arrest during the year. The timing of her arrest, which
 coincided with her increasingly public challenges to President Lukashenko's eco-
 nomic policies, suggested a political motivation. It is widely believed that the Presi-
 dential Administration already was aware of the alleged illegal acts at the time of
 her appointment as National Bank" chairwoman. Prior to her transfer to house ar-
 rest in late 1997, to enable her to seek medical treatment for life threatening ill-
 nesses, Vinnikova was held in pretrial detention in a KGB prison for 10 months.
 The Government does not used forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary is not independent and is largely unable to act
 as a check on the executive branch and its agents. The Supreme Council passed leg-
 islation to support the independence of the judiciary in 1995, but these reforms were
 not implemented. Without major structural reforms, the independence of the judici-
 ary cannot be realized. The November 1996 Constitutional referendum further sub-
 ordinated the judiciary to the executive branch by giving the President the power
 
 
 1146
 to appoint 6 of the 12 members of the Constitutional court, including the chairman.
 The remaining six are appointed by the Council of the Republic, which itself is com-
 posed of individuals appointed by the President or elected by individuals influenced
 y the President. The President also appoints the chairmen of the Supreme Court
 and the Supreme Economic Court. The President also has authority under the Con-
 stitution to appoint and dismiss all district and military judges.
 :The criminal justice system follows the former Soviet model and has three tiers:
 District courts, regional courts, and 'the Supreme Court. Several modifications have
 been made, brought about by the passage of the new Constitution, including direct
 presidential appointments. A Constitutional Court was established in 1994 to adju-
 dicate serious constitutional issues, but, dependent on the executive branch, it does
 not challenge presidential initiatives. In addition, the Constitutional Court has no
 means to enforce its decisions.
 Judges adjudicate trials; only in capital offense trials in which the defendant
 pleads not guilty and demands a jury trial do juries determine innocence or guilt.
 Judges are dependent on the Ministry of Justice for sustaining court infrastructure
 and on local executive branch officials for providing their personal housing. In addi-
 tion, judges owe their positions to the President. Although the procurator's office
 categorically denies it, there are widespread reports that "telephone justice" (the
 practice of executive and local authorities dictating to the courts the outcome of
 trials) continues.
 Prosecutors, like the courts, are organized into offices at the district, regional, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to, and serve at the pleasure of, the
 Procurator General who, according to the Constitution, is appointed by the Council
 of the Republic.
 In May 1997, President Lukashenko issued presidential decree number 12, "Sev-
 eral Measures on Improving the Practice of Lawyers and Notaries," which, according
 to international legal experts and human rights monitors, seriously compromised
 the independence of lawyers from the Government. The decree, which ostensibly
 was issued in response to allegedly exorbitant attorneys' fees, subordinated all law-
 yers to the Ministry of Justice, which controls the-licensing of lawyers, and placed
 the bar association under much greater Ministry of Justice control. In 1997 the Gov-
 ernment used the decree to strip several lawyers of their licenses, including Presi-
 dent Lukashenko's political opponents (such as former chairman of the Supreme So-
 viet Mecheslav Gryb). The Government continued to use the decree during the year,
 and the Ministry of Justice revoked the licenses of prominent defense attorneys
 Garry Pogonyailo (see Section 1.d.) and Nadezhda Dudareva. Human rights activist
 and defense attorney Vera Stremkovskaya also was threatened with disbarment fol-
 lowing her public criticisms of the Government while on a visit abroad (see Section
 1.d.).
 The Constitution provides for public trials, although exceptions can be made in
 cases established by law (for example, in cases of rape or on grounds of national
 security). Defendants have the legal right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses,
 and present evidence on their own behalf. However, these rights are not respected
 always in practice. Defendants' legal right to be represented by counsel also is not
 respected always in practice. While the 1996 Constitution establishes a presumption
 of innocence, in practice defendants frequently must prove their innocence.
 Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal, and most criminal
 cases are appealed, according to legal sources. In appeals, neither defendants nor
 witnesses appear before the court; the court merely reviews the protocol and other
 documents from the lower court's trial. Appeals rarely result in reversals of verdicts.
 In criminal cases, the prosecution has the right to appeal an acquittal for a retrial
 to a higher court on the same charge.
 On January 28, ORT correspondent Pavel Sheremet, previously criticized by gov-
 ernment authorities for "biased" reporting, and cameraman Dmitriy Zavadskiy were
 found guilty of iliegally crossing the Belarusian-Lithuanian border in July 1997 (see
 Sections 1.d. and 2.a.). The presiding judge sentenced Sheremet to 2 years in prison
 and Zavadsky to 18 months. Although both sentences were suspended contingent on
 good behavior, the trial of Sheremet and Zavadsky clearly was a politically moti-
 vated prosecution of an action-alleged illegal border crossing-that government au-
 thorities themselves admit takes place frequently.
 Antigovernment protesters arrested after demonstrations were subjected to as-
 sembly line style trials, without the right to counsel or the opportunity to present
 evidence or call witnesses.
 As of year's end, there was at least one political prisoner. On February 24, a
 Minsk court sentenced Aleksei Shidlovskiy and Vadim Labkovich (see Sections 1.c.
 and 1.d.) to 2 years in a hard-regime prison labor camp for "malicious hooliganism
 with extreme cynicism." Labkovich's sentence later was suspended. Shidlovskiy and
 
 
 1147
 Labkovich, members of the opposition-affiliated Youth Front, were arrested in Au-
 gust 1997 for their alleged part in spray painting antipresidential slogans, defacing
 -oviet-era monuments, and replacing the official green and red Belarusian flag with
 the former national flag currently associated with the opposition. Despite the de-
 fendants' youth, the nonviolent nature of the charges, and the fact that neither had
 a prior criminal record, both were denied release pending trial.
 During the trial, Shidlovskiy and Labkovich were held in a guarded cage as if
 they were dangerous criminals. A representative of Human Rights Watch later re-
 ferred to the trial as an "absurd parody of criminal justice and a grotesque show
 trial aimed at intimidating young people from expressing their opposition to the cur-
 rent regime." The prolonged and harsh pretrial detention, the punitive use of what
 apparently was a relatively minor charge, and the disproportionate nature of the
 sentences handed down to Shidlovskiy and Labkovich were both excessive and remi-
 niscent of Soviet-era practices.
 Vladimir Kudinov was convicted in 1997 and sentenced to 7 years in prison and
 full confiscation of property for allegedly bribing a police officer. He also is viewed
 by many opposition activists and human rights observers as a victim of political per-
 secution. Prior to his arrest, Kudinov was an active and vocal critic of President
 Lukashenko. Government authorities first began to harass Kudinov in 1995 during
 his campaign for a seat in the Supreme Soviet. In 1996 Kudinov signed an impeach-
 ment petition against Lukashenko. His conviction and lengthy sentence appear to
 fit a government pattern of using charges of alleged economic-related crimes to si-
 lence and intimidate critics.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection against illegal interference in a citizen's per-
 sonal life, including invasion of privacy of correspondence, telephone, and other com-
 munications. The inviolability of the home is also provided for by the Constitution,
 which states that, "no one shall have the right to enter, without legal reason, the
 dwelling and other legal property of a citizen against such a citizen's will."
 However, in practice, government monitoring of residences, telephones, and com-
 puters continued unabated. The KGB is widely believed to enter homes without
 warrants, conduct unauthorized searches, and read mail. Political, human rights,
 and other NGO's believe that their conversations and correspondence are monitored
 routinely by the security services. Opposition figures have reported a reluctance to
 visit some foreign embassies due to fear of reprisal.
 The KGB, MVD, and certain border guard detachments have the right to request
 permission to install wiretaps, but under the law must obtain a prosecutor's permis-
 sion before installation. The Presidential Guard (or security service) formed in 1995
 reportedly conducted surveillance activities of the President's political opponents.
 There is no judicial or legislative oversight of the Presidential Guard's budget or ac-
 tivities, and the executive branch repeatedly has thwarted attempts to exercise such
 oversight.
 Nearly all opposition political figures assume that the Government monitors their
 activities and conversations. The Lukashenko Government did nothing to refute
 these assumptions. Militia officers assigned to stand outside diplomatic missions are
 known to keep records of visits by political opposition leaders. In addition, even gov-
 ernment officials do not appear to be exempt from monitoring.
 In early 1997, the Ministry of Communications renegotiated contracts for supply-
 ing telephone service. The new contracts forbid subscribers from using telephone
 communications for purposes that run counter to state interests and public order.
 The Ministry has the right to terminate telephone service to those who breach this
 provision.
 Presidential decree number 218, issued in March 1997, prohibits the import and
 export of printed, audio, and visual information that could "damage" the economic
 and political interests of the country (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 as well as the freedom to receive, retain, and disseminate information, but the Gov-
 ernment restricts these rights in practice. The executive branch continued its sup-
 pression of freedom of speech through a decree limiting citizens' rights to express
 their opinions. The Government also continued its campaign against the independ-
 ent media by adopting new restrictive amendments to the law on press and other
 mass media, and by placing a ban on the dissemination of official information to
 the independent media. Although the Constitution prohibits a monopoly of mass
 media, the Government also continued to restrict severely the right to a free press
 through near-monopolies on the means of production and on national level broadcast
 media, and by denying accreditation to journalists critical of the regime. The Gov-
 
 
 1148
 
 ernment also kept up economic pressure on the independent media by pressuring
 advertisers to withdraw advertisements and by evicting newspapers from their of-
 fices. Employees at state-run enterprises are discouraged from subscribing to inde-
 pendent newspapers and journals.
 In 1996, President Lukashenko signed a decree ordering that all editors in chief
 of state-supported newspapers would henceforth be official state employees and
 would become members of the appropriate level government council. Another decree
 granted the Ministry of Press authority to assign graduates of state-supported jour-
 nalism schools to work in state-owned media organizations as a means of payment
 for their schooling. These decrees remain in effect.
 Presidential decree number five, issued in March 1997, prohibits a range of broad-
 ly defined activities and limits freedom of expression. For example, the decree pro-
 hibits individuals from carrying placards or flags bearing emblems that are not offi-
 cially registered with the State, as well as "emblems, symbols, and posters whose
 content is intended to harm the State and public order, rights, and legal interests
 of the citizens." The decree also bans activities that are "humiliating to the dignity
 and honor of the executive persons of state bodies."
 The Defamation Law makes no distinction between private and public persons for
 the purposes of lawsuits for defamation of character. A public figure who has been
 criticized for poor performance in office may ask the public prosecutor to sue the
 newspaper that printed the criticism. On June 4, the lower house of the National
 Assembly approved a bill that stipulated that public insults or libel against the
 President could be punished by up to 4 years in prison, 2 years in a labor camp,
 or a large fine. However, no one was arrested or charged during the year under the
 new law.
 In 1997 the Council of Ministers issued a decree that prohibited and restricted
 the movement of goods across customs borders. The decree specifically prohibited
 the import and export of printed, audio, and video materials, or other news media
 containing information that could damage the economic and political interests of the
 country. The decree targets, among others, some opposition-affiliated bulletins pub-
 lished outside of the country. On May 2, customs officials confiscated at the Belarus-
 Ukraine border 900 copies of Belarusian News from leaders of the opposition
 Belarusian Popular Front. On August -10, authorities on the Belarus-Ukraine border
 detained for 8 hours two Czech nationals and confiscated fim and written materials
 that they believed were intended to "discredit the public and political system in
 Belarus." On October 19, customs officials confiscated approximately 1,800 copies of
 Belarusian News from antigovernment activists at the Belarus-Ukratne border.
 The Belarusian Patriotic Union of Youth, a government-subsidized presidential
 youth organization, was permitted to take control of Radio 101.2. Radio 101.2 had
 been the sole Belarusian language independent station  the country until govern-
 ment authorities shut it down during 1996.
 Independent newspapers are widely available in Minsk, but outside of the capital
 most towns carry oniy local newspapers,ony some of which are independent. In No-
 vember 1997, the State Commitee on the Press issued two warnings to the largest
 independent newspaper, Svabeda, alleging that two of its recent articles violated the
 Law on the Press by trying to incite social unrest. Svaboda subsequently was closed
 following a ruling by the Supreme Economic Court. On January 23, government au-
 thorities issued a warning to Naviny, a new newspaper founded by former Svaboda
 staffers, for reprinting the Svaboda logo on its front p age.
 On May 29, the Stat Committee on the Press officially warned Nasha Niva, an
 independent newspaper published in    Belarusian, to stop using traditional
 Belarusian orthography in favor of spelling reforms first introduced under Joseph
 Stalin in 1933. In an attmpt to forestall what appeared to be the beginning of a
 government campalgn to shut down the newspaper, Nasha Niva filed a lawsuit
 against the State Committee on the Press. Under the amendments to the Law on
 Press and Other Media of December 1997, Nasha Niva could be banned if two more
 warnings are issued. On August 14, the Supreme Economic Court called for the cre-
 ation of a special philological commission to examine the issue further. In December
 after the philological commission completed its investigation, the Supreme Economic
 Court annulled the warning given to Nasha Niva.
 On June 1, the State Committee on the Press issued an official warning to the
 Minsk-based independent newspaper Zdravy Smysi for providing "distorted informa-
 tion." The warning followed an article in Zdravy Smysl that reported that the New
 York-based Committee to Protect Journalists had included President Lukashenko on
 their list of the world's ten worst "enemies of the press." In July local authorities
 in the town of Dyatlovo attempted to pressure the editors of the opposition-affiliated
 Nasha Prawda to close down following the ne wspaper's publication of an article by
 
 
 1149
 Zyanon Paznyak, the exiled leader of the Belarusian Popular Front. In August, two
 editors of Nasha Prawda were questioned by the local police and fined.
 On December 2, new regulations went into effect that restrict the distribution of
 legal information to specially licensed media. The regulations required the inde-
 pendent media that publish legal acts to apply for licenses from a commission under
 the Ministry of Justice. Several independent informational bulletins, including
 Femida and Beloruski Rynok, were denied licenses.
 State-controlled Belarusian television and radio (B-TR) maintains its monopoly as
 the only nationwide television station. Its news programs regularly featured report-
 ing biased in favor of the Government and refused to provide an outlet for opposing
 viewpoints. Local, independent television stations operated in some areas, and were
 relatively unimpeded in reporting on local news. However, some of these stations
 reported that they were under pressure not to report on national-level issues or
 were subject to censorship.
 Broadcasts into the country from Russian television stations represent the only
 significant source of independent information from broadcast media and constitute
 a frequent source of irritation to the Lukashefko Government. However, to transmit
 their video material to Moscow, Russian stations rely on the B-TR broadcasting fa-
 cility. According to Russian television crews, authorities sometimes have limited ac-
 cess to this facility.
 On January 28, in a politically-motivated case, ORT correspondent Pavel
 Sheremet and cameraman Dmitriy Zavadskiy (both Belarusian citizens) were found
 guilty of illegally crossing the Belarusian-Lithuanian border in mid-1997 (see Sec-
 tions 1.d. and I.e.). The two were given suspended sentences of 2 years in prison.
 Earlier in 1997, the authorities already had stripped Sheremet of his accreditation
 as a journalist because his reports contained "intentional distortions of information
 about events in the Republic of Belarus." On March 13, then-Foreign Minister
 Antanovich accused Russian journalists of "misinformation, fabrications, and libel"
 against President Lukashenko. Citing the January convictions, authorities denied
 Sheremet permission to travel abroad to receive an international press freedom
 award in November from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 On December 25, government security officers arrested approximately 10 persons,
 including journalists, at an unsanctioned demonstration against closer integration
 with Russia. On December 28, four of those detained were sentenced to 5 days in
 prison each, two were fined, and one was given an official warning (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.b.).
 A 1997 Council of Ministers decree nullified the accreditation of all correspond-
 ents and required all foreign media correspondents to apply for reaccreditation with
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the application form for accreditation requested bio-
 graphic information, as well as a record of the applicant's journalistic activity. Jour-
 nalists who were residents of Belars were also required to register with the state
 tax authorities. The impact of the decree is still unclear, although it does not appear
 that the Government specifically invoked the decree during the year as a tool to ex-
 clude certain journalists.
 In January more stringent regulatory provisions, introduced by amendments to
 the Law on Press and Other Mass Media that were adopted by the Council of the
 Republic in December 1997, went into effect. The new regulatory provisions grant
 greater authority to the Government to ban and censor critical reporting. For exam-
 ple, the State Committee on the Press was given authority to suspend "for 3 months
 publication of periodicals or newspapers without a court ruling.
 On March 17, the presidential administration issued an internal directive entitled
 "On Strengthening Countermeasures against Articles in the Opposition Press." Spe-
 cifically listing 10 independent media organizations covered by these provisions, the
 directive prohibits government officials from making comments or distributing docu-
 ments to non-state media and forbids state enterprises from advertising in non-state
 media. Although the directive does not restrict directly independent media or im-
 pinge on the right of citizens to receive information, it does restrict government offi-
 cials in speaking to the independent media and gives further advantages to the
 state press.
 In an open letter to the authorities and eresentatives of the OSCE in early
 April, the Belarusian Association of Journalists protested the new directive, refer-
 ring to it as "anticonstitutional, antidemocratic, and discriminatory." On April 14,
 Narednaya Volya reported that the Ministry of Emergency Situations refused to pro-
 vide it with information about Chernobyl cleanup workers because the newspaper
 is not state-owned. In an attempt to limit independentjournalists' access to informa-
 tion, authorities also reportedly denied accreditation to them at a number of events,
 including the Eighth Session of the Belarusian-Russian Union Parliamentary As-
 
 
 1150
 
 sembly held in May and a state visit to Minsk in June by then-Russian Prime Min-
 ister Sergey Kiryienko.
 The Government's observance of academic freedom is mixed. University students
 and academics are free to pursue virtually any course of study or research.
 Throughout the year, the Government continued to harass students engaged in
 antigovernment activities, like demonstrations. Aleksey Shidlovskiy, who was sen-
 tenced in February to 2 years in a hard labor facility for allegedly spray painting
 antipresidential graffiti (see Sections 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.), was expelled from his uni-
 versity while in pretrial detention. Members of the propresidential, government-
 funded Belarusian Patriotic Union of Youth served as the regime's watchdog against
 antigovernment activities. Moreover, there are reports that members of the Union
 received preferential treatment at state schools.
 In 1997, the Council of Ministers issued a decree effective as of the 1997-98 aca-
 demic year requiring students who receive free university education from the State
 to accept jobs assigned by the Government upon graduation. There were no reports
 that the   Government used     this decree  to  punish  students  engaged  in
 antigovernment activities during the year.
 The Government continued to close schools that teach in the Belarusian language.
 According to the Belarusian League for Human Rights, the number of schools that
 teach in Belarusian has dropped by half since 1991. Government authorities, on the
 other hand, claimed that only schools that experienced diminishing enrollment have
 been closed. However, the opposition-affiliated Belarusian Language Society noted
 that the decline in the percentage of first graders taught in Belarusian-from 76
 percent to 28 percent between 1993 and 1998-was evidence of a government policy
 to promote education in .Russian. In July, the Ministry of Education replaced Vladi-
 mir Kolas, the director of the Belarusian Humanities Lyceum (the only Belarusian-
 language high school in Minsk) with a Ministry-appointed educator. The move
 prompted protests by students and parents who believed the decision was. part of
 a government campaign aimed at ultimately shutting down the school. However,
 Ko as was permitted to remain at the Lyceum in the capacity of deputy director.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly; however the Government restricts this right in prac-
 tice. Organizers must apply at least 15 days in advance to local officials for permis-
 sion to conduct a demonstration, rally, or meeting. The local government must re-
 spond with a decision not later than 5 days prior to the scheduled event
 In March .1997, President Lukashenko issued decree number five to reglate what
 he termed the "orgy" of street protests taking pace. The decree further limited citi-
 zens' ability to assemble peacefully by restricting the locations where raol'es may
 take place and allowing local authorities to put strict limits on the number of par-
 ticipants. The decree also prohibited the display of unregistered flags and symbols,
 as well as placards bearing messages deemed threatening to the State or public
 order (see Section 2.a.). The decree, along with subsequent amendments adopted by
 the acting legislature, imposed severe penalties on those who violate the law, par-
 ticularly the organizers of events. Although the   e decree allows for either monetary
 fines or detention for up to 15 days, courts frequently impose high fines knowing
 that those convicted cannot pay. When individuals fail to pay fines, authorities
 threatened to confiscate their property. The courts punished organizers of rallies
 with fines of $800 to $1,000, which are exceptionally high in a country where the
 average monthly wage is under $100. Although assessments were made, there were
 no known instances of property actually being confiscated as of year's end.
 Public demonstrations occurred frequently in Minsk but were always under strict
 government control including through open videotaping of the participants by the
 polce and plainclothes security officers. Demonstrations were less frequent in other
 parts of the country, particularly in the east, close to the border with Russia. In
 contrast to prior practices, the authorities in Minsk generally did not deploy riot po-
 lice in a blocking pattern across the planned routes of demonstration marchers. This
 helped to reduce tensions and resulted in fewer clashes during demonstrations.
 However, following some sanctioned and unsanctioned demonstrations, police and
 other security officials continued to round up, beat, detain, and coerce forced confes-
 sions out of some demonstration participants (see Section 1.d.).
 On June 17, following numerous complaints filed by citizens and 2 days of public
 hearings, the Minsk City Council passed a resolution that called for the Ministry
 of Interior to consider ways of preserving public order during demonstrations that
 did not violate civil rights, and to increase the personal accountability of its officers.
 The City Council also called on the State Procurator's office to investigate allega-
 tions of abuses that took place during the year. At year's end, the effect of this reso-
 lution on the behavior of executive branch-controlled security forces remained un-
 clear.
 
 
 1151
 During the February trial of Aleksey Shidlovskiy and Vadim Labkovich (see Sec-
 tion .e.), police detained a number of persons who had been denied access to the
 courthouse and were forced to wait outside while the hearings proceeded. On Feb-
 ruary 23, police arrested three 16-year-old members of the opposition-affiliated
 Youth Front and a human rights monitor from the Belarusian Helsinki Committee
 for holding an "unsanctioned demonstration." Also in February, several members of
 the Youth Front were detained briefly by police in Minsk for posting announcements
 about a demonstration already sanctioned by governmental authorities.
 On March 15, following a small and peaceful demonstration march in Minsk in
 commemoration of the anniversary of the adoption of the 1994 Constitution, police
 briefly detained Social Democratic chairman Nikolai Statkevich for allegedly -step-
 ping into a lane not authorized for marching. All charges were dropped against
 Statkevich by court order, 5 days after his arrest. On March 22, following an opposi-
 tion-organized protest march, which had proceeded peacefully with the permission
 of governmental authorities, riot police and plainclothes security officials rounded
 up march participants and journalists in various locations around Minsk. Three ob-
 servers from the Belarusian Helsinki Committee also were briefly detained.
 On March 30, city authorities denied permission to the opposition (BNF) and
 Belarusian Social Democratic Party to hold a rally in downtown Minsk on April 2
 against the Belarus Union Charter with Russia. Permission was denied on the
 grounds that such a rally would interfere with government festivities planned for
 the same day. Minsk city authorities decided instead that the opposition rally could
 be held outside the city 3 days after government-sponsored festivities. When Youth
 Front members nevertheless staged a small protest on April 2 during the govern-
 ment-sponsored event, police and plainclothes security officials reportedly arrested
 and beat a number of them (see Section 1.c.).
 On April 25, at least 5,000 persons took part in a government-approved march
 and rally in Minsk to mark the 12th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear catas-
 trophe. The march and rally themselves passed peacefully without incident. How-
 ever, following the event, police and plainclothes security officials detained over 30
 Belarusian participants-including minors-according to credible reports from local
 human rights groups. Some of those detained claimed that they were beaten and
 forced to sign false statements (see Section 1.c.). Government authorities also de-
 tained between 15 and 25 Russians (mainly members of the Moscow-based
 antifascist Youth Action Organization) who had participated in the event. The Rus-
 sians subsequently were deported from the country.
 On May 1, according to the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, plainclothes security
 officers detained and beat 15 members of the Belarusian Social Democratic Party
 who had participated in a demonstration. On May 5, plainclothes security officers
 detained participants in a government-sanctioned demonstration, including two ob-
 servers from the Belarusian Helsinki Committee.
 On July 28, Anatoliy Fyodorov, the leader of the Mogilev regional chapter of the
 opposition Belarusian Popular Front was fined heavily for organizing an unauthor-
 ized demonstration on July 15. The demonstration was held to protest the Govern-
 ment's expulsion, in violation of the Vienna Diplomatic Convention, of foreign am-
 bassadors from their official residences located near the presidential compound in
 Drozdy outside of Minsk. Fyodorov later commented that it is virtually impossible
 to get approval from local officials in Mogilev to hold opposition rallies or dem-
 onstrations.
 On August 30, a Minsk court fined Valeriy Shchukin, a member of the Charter
 97 human rights organization and the 13th Supreme Soviet, for holding a dem-
 onstration during the official national day celebrations on July 3.
 On November 5, following a decision to divert a protest march from a government
 preapproved demonstration site to presidential administration offices in Minsk, se-
 curity officers briefly detained at least 15 independent labor activists. Those ar-
 rested either were released with warnings, fined, or sentenced to minor (between
 6 and 15 days) prison terms (see Section 6.b.).
 In an attempt to prevent antigovernment demonstrations near the presidential
 administrative office building, the Minsk City Executive Committee issued in early
 December a directive banning mass meetings in October Square located in down-
 town Minsk. Although the decree did not go into effect until December 8, opposition
 figures and human rights activists were denied permission to hold a rally on Decem-
 ber 6 in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. When they attempted to proceed with the rally anyway, police de-
 tained a number of protesters, including BNF deputy chairman Yury Khadyka and
 Charter '97 deputy director Ludmilla Gryazanova. Six protesters were sentenced to
 between 3 and 10 days in prison.
 
 
 1152
 
 On December 25, government security officers arrested approximately 10 persons,
 including journalists, at an unsanctioned demonstration against closer integration
 with Russia. On December 28, four of those detained were sentenced each to 5 days
 in prison, two were fined, and one was given an official warning (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.a.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 does not respect this right in practice. According to members of parties in opposition
 to the President, authorities frequently deny permission to opposition groups to
 meet in public buildings. Employees at state-run enterprises are discouraged from
 joining independent trade unions, and the Ministry of Justice long denied registra-
 tion   the Congress of Independent Trade Unions (see Section 6.a.). Only in late
 1997 did the Government, under considerable international pressure, order the Min-
 istry of Justice to register the Congress of Independent Trade Unions and lift the
 1995 ba    n one of its constituents, the Free Trade Union (see Section 6.a.). The
 Government regularly harasses members and supporters of opposition parties, and
 confiscates their leaflets and publications. Government officials warned alumni of
 foreign-sponsored education programs against continued affiliation with their pro-
 gram's sponsoring agency or embassy.
 There are 28 registered national political parties and 43 registered trade unions
 (9 of which label themselves as free, independent, and democratic), and 2,200 reg-
 istered social organizations. A 1995 decision by the Ministry of Justice required ex-
 isting public associations to reregister. During the reregistration process, the Min-
 istry sometnes found cause to deny reregistration to NGO's. According to the
 Belarus League for Human Rights, some government officials admitted that the
 process was illegal, and that they therefore had allowed some groups to continue
 operating under their original registration. However, since the 1995 decision, it has
 become more difficult in general for NGO's to obtain registration. On August 14, the
 Ministry of Justice upheld its prior decision to deny registration to the Belarnsian
 Association of Prisoners of the Lukashenko Regime, a new opposition-affiliated orga-
 nization.
 The Government attempted to limit severely the activities of NGO's, primarily
 through intrusive and questionable tax audits, denial of registration, limited access
 to rental properties and intimidation of employees. Although it was not authorized
 to do so under the Law on Public Associations rewritten in 1997, the Security Coun-
 cil announced audits against the Belarusian Soros Foundation (BSF), as well as
 other NGO's. The BSF was forced to cease its operations as a result of the Govern-
 ment's campaign of harassment. On February 11, the Minsk Regional Economic
 Court reduced from $3 million to $80,000 a 1997 fine against BSF for alleged tax
 and currency violations but upheld the confiscation of the BSF's office equipment
 and property. Deputy Presidential Administration Head Ivan Pashkevich announced
 in November that all NGO's would have to reregister with the Government during
 early 1999.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, the Government restricts this right in practice. The Government enforces a
 1995 Cabinet of Ministers decree that controls religious workers, in an attempt to
 protect orthodoxy and prevent the growth of evangelical religions. Foreigners gen-
 erally are prohibited from preaching or heading churches, at least with respect to
 what the Government views as "nontraditional" religions, which include Protestant
 faiths. In September 1997, a Belarusian Baptist pastor was arrested for allowing a
 foreigner to lead a prayer group under the pastor's auspices. The pastor subse-
 quently was released. A 1997 directive by the Council of Ministers prohibits teach-
 ing religion at youth camps.
 Citizens are not prohibited from proselytizing, but foreign missionaries may not
 engage in religious activities outside the institutions that invited them. Only reli-
 gious organizations already registered in the country may invite foreign clergy. For-
 eign religious workers who do not register with the authorities, or who fail to get
 approval for reigious activities--often a difficult bureaucratic process-have been
 expelled from the country.
 The Government and the President encourage a greater role for the Orthodox
 Church, largely as part of an overall strategy to strengthen Slavic unity in the re-
 gion. However, the effort has not slowed the growth of Roman Catholic and Protes-
 tant churches. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church has experienced difficulty getting
 permission from authorities to bring in a sufficient number of outside religious
 workers to make up for a shortage of native clergy. According to an independent
 Russian press report, President Lukashenko told Russian Orthodox Church Patri-
 arch Aleksey II, during a visit'by the Patriarch to Minsk in late September, that
 Christian values should become "the state ideology of Belarus."
 
 
 1153
 
 During a press conference held at a seminar in Minsk in early December,
 Vyacheslav Savitskiy, an official of the State Committee on Religious and Ethnic Af-
 fairs, emphasized the existence of "destructive sects" in the country. According to
 Savitskiy, the Government had denied the registration requests of 11 such "sects."
 For example, authorities consistently have denied the repeated registration at-
 tempts of the Belarus Orthodox Autocephalous Church.
 The President granted the Orthodox Church special financial advantages, which
 other denominations do not enjoy, and has declared the preservation and develop-
 ment of Orthodox Christianity a "moral necessity." Bishops must receive permission
 from the State Committee on Religious Affairs before transferring a foreign priest
 to another parish.
 Restitution of religious property remained limited during the year. A key obstacle
 is the lack of a legal basis for restitution of property that was seized during the So-
 viet era and the Nazi occupation. The few returns of property to religious commu-
 nities have been on an individual and inconsistent basis, and local government au-
 thorities in general are reluctant to cooperate on the issue. Over the past several
 years, the Jewish community has lobbied the Government successfully to return
 three synagogues in Minsk and several buildings outside the capital. In August fol-
 lowing extensive restoration, the Catholic community reconsecrated a church in
 Pruzhany that had been shut down by Soviet authorities following World War II.
 The consecration ceremony was led by the church's former priest who had spent 10
 years in prison in Siberia during the Soviet period.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-According to the Constitution, citizens are free to travel within the
 country and to live and work where they wish. All adults are issued internal pass-
 ports, which serve as primary identity documents and are required for travel, per-
 manent housing, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although provided by law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despite its formal abolition by the Soviet Government in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "propiska" (pass) system survives in the country. All citizens are re-
 quired to register their places of residence and may not change them without official
 permission. The authorities no longer explicitly limit the number of residence per-
 mits in Minsk and the five other regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mogilev, Vitebsk,
 and Gomel. However, in order to register a citizen must have employment in the
 city already; but to be legally employed in the city, one must be registered already.
 These circular and conflicting requirements limit citizens' freedom of movement.
 Government regulations on entry and exit require citizens who wish to travel
 abroad to receive first an overseas passport and a "global" exit visa, valid for be-
 tween 1 and 5 years. Once a traveler has these documents, the law does not restrict
 travel.
 In November authorities denied Pavel Sheremet, a local television correspondent
 for a Russian network given a 2-year suspended sentence in January for alleged ille-
 gal border crossing (see Sections I.e. and 2.a.), permission to leave the country to
 receive an award from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 Following the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet in 1996, the Government took
 measures aimed at limiting the travel of opposition politicians who refused to sub-
 mit to the legislature created by the November 1996 referendum. The Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs announced in December 1996 that those Parliamentarians who did
 not join the new legislature could no longer travel on their diplomatic passports, de-
 spite the fact that these individuals had been assured that they would retain their
 status as deputies until their terms of office expired. Although the diplomatic pass-
 ports were not confiscated, the border guards reportedly had a blacklist of opposition
 members who were to be denied exit from the country if they used a diplomatic
 passport. Subsequent to the January 1997 refusal by border guards to allow former
 Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and Parliamentary Deputy
 Anatoliy Lebedko to travel abroad on their diplomatic passports, a number of mem-
 bers of the dissolved Parliament have acquired regular passports and have been al-
 lowed to travel abroad.
 According to official data, the State did not deny any citizen permission to emi-
 grate. However, legislation restricting emigration by those with access to "state se-
 crets" remained in effect, and any citizen involved in a criminal investigation was
 also ineligible to emigrate. Prospective emigrants who have been refused the right
 to emigrate may appeal to the courts.
 The Constitution gives aliens and stateless persons the same rights as citizens,
 except in cases established by law, international agreement, or the Constitution.
 The Constitution also allows the State to grant refugee status to persons who were
 being persecuted in other states for their political and religious convictions, or be-
 
 
 1154
 cause of nationality. The Government does not have a law on first-asylum, nor has
 it signed readmission agreements with any of its neighboring states.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. In May
 1997, the Government implemented for the first time the 1995 Law on Refugees,
 granting refugee status to a group of Afghans. As of December, the Government had
 granted official refugee status to 64 persons (mostly Afghans and Ethiopians who
 have lived in the country since prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union). Since its
 formation in early 1997 from the State Migration Service, the Committee on Migra-
 tion within the Ministry of Labor officially has turned down four requests for refu-
 gee status.
 Based on information from government agencies, the UNHCR estimates that
 there could be up to 35,000 potential refugees and 200,000 illegal aliens in the coun-
 try. However, the UNHCR acknowledges that these numbers appear to overestimate
 refugees and aliens. The number of illegal aliens probably does not exceed 100,000.
 Some refugees report difficulty registering with local authorities, and continued
 delay in establishing a comprehensive asylum and refugee policy has made the lives
 of some of these individuals difficult. The UNHCR is not aware of any cases of bona
 fide refugees forced to return to countries in which they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government severely limits the right of citizens to change their government.
 From November 9-24, 1996, the executive branch conducted a controversial con-
 stitutional referendum that was neither free nor fair, according to credible inter-
 national observers, including representatives of the European Union and the OSCE.
 Many Members of Parliament and of the Constitutional Court actively opposed
 President Lukashenko's proposals for both substantive and procedural reasons. The
 justices asserted that the referendum gave Lukashenko control over the legislative
 and judicial branches of government and extended his term in office. They also criti-
 cized it on procedural grounds as an unconstitutional means to eliminate the Con-
 stitution's checks and balances and grant the President virtually unlimited powers.
 In the period leading up to the referendum, opponents of President Lukashenko's
 proposals were denied access to the media, election officials failed to record the
 names of early voters, and no texts of the proposed Constitution were made avail-
 able to voters until several days after citizens began voting. As a result of these
 irregularities, the head of the Central Election Commission (CEC) announced prior
 to the event that he would not be able to certify the results of the referendum.
 President Lukashenko promptly fired him, although the Constitution in force at the
 time gave the Parliament the exclusive authority to appoint and dismiss the CEC
 Chairman. Members of the security forces forcibly removed the head of the CEC
 from his office. Shortly thereafter, the Prime Minister resigned in protest of Presi-
 dent Lukashenko's refusal to cancel the widely criticized referendum.
 Most members of the international community chose not to send election monitors
 to observe the referendum because of the illegitimacy of the entire process. Human
 rights organizations, including the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the Com-
 mittee to Protect Journalists, and Human Rights Watch, protested the conduct of
 the referendum.
 The Constitutional Court formally ruled that the issues posed in President
 Lukashenko's referendum could not be decided legally through a referendum, and
 that its results should be purely advisory, consistent with the Constitution. How-
 ever, after winning the referendum-according to the Government's own official
 count-President Lukashenko began to implement it immediately. The new Con-
 stitution established a bicameral legislature. Its 110-member lower house was
 formed out of the membership of the existing Supreme Soviet; deputies volunteered
 or were lured by promises of free housing and other benefits to serve in the new
 body. The 64-member upper house was created by a combination of presidential ap-
 pointments and elections by the 6 regional or oblast councils and the Minsk City
 Council. The transition left 86 electoral districts unrepresented because the new
 Constitution reduced the number of representatives, and also because a full Su-
 preme Soviet had never been seated, largely due to the executive branch's interven-
 tion in the 1995 elections.
 Despite consultative assistance provided by the OSCE's Advisory and Monitoring
 Group in Minsk, President Lukashenko's National Assembly passed in December se-
 riously flawed legislation on local elections, next scheduled to be held on April 4,
 1999. A late modification to Article 33 of the law, inserted at the insistence of the
 President, effectively bars many opposition candidates from running in local elec-
 
 
 1155
 tions by prohibiting the participation of individuals who have been fined administra-
 tively by government authorities.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics and govern-
 ment. However, with the exception of the judiciary, social barriers to women in poli-
 tics are strong, and men hold virtually all leadership positions. In the acting legisla-
 ture, women hold 19 of 110 seats in the lower house and 5 of 64 in the upper house.
 The Deputy Chair of the upper house is a woman. The Minister of Social Security
 is the only female member of the Council of Ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The country's poor human rights record drew the attention of many international
 human rights organizations, and there are several local human rights groups active
 in the c       However, members of local human rights organizations reported that
 the Government hindered their attempts to investigate alleged human rights viola-
 tions. The Government monitored their correspondence and telephone conversations.
 The Government also attempted to limit severely the activities of NGO's through
 denial of registration, questionable tax audits, and other means (see Section 2.b.).
 Human rights monitors of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee were briefly detained
 occasionally while observing demonstrations during the year.
 In general, the Government has been willing to discuss human rights with inter-
 national NGO's whose members have been allowed to visit the country. Following
 a 3-day fact finding trip in August, the director of the international Helsinki Federa-
 tion for Human Rights sent an open letter to the Foreign Ministry criticizing human
 rights violations in the country. In particular, the letter criticized the judiciary's re-
 fusal to investigate violence against journalists, the persecution of university stu-
 dents for political activities, and unreasonably high fines for participants in
 unsanctioned public protests.
 On February 27, after protracted negotiations, the Government finally approved
 the opening in Minsk of the OSCE's Advisory and Monitoring Group office. The
 OSCE's presence in Minsk provides a potentially important forum for dialog on
 human rights issues.
 In February following the trial of Youth Front members Shidlovskiy and
 Labkovich, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for their release
 and condemning, among other things, arbitrary arrests, intimidation, and threats of
 violence against journalists.
 On August 19, the United Nations Human Rights Commission's Subcommission
 for the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a resolu-
 tion expressing concern at the climate of "fear and intolerance," the concentration
 of legislative power in the executive branch, and the existence of a weak judiciary
 in Belarus. The resolution called upon the Government to lift restrictions on free-
 dom of expression and to protect the integrity and rights of journalists and human
 rights defenders by allowing them to investigate, publish, and report on abuses of
 power and violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law and have the
 right, without any discrimination, to equal protection of their rights and legitimate
 interests. However, the Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination
 based on factors such as race, sex, or religion. The Law on Citizenship, passed by
 the Parliament, grants citizenship to any person living permanently on the territory
 of the country as of October 19, 1991. Those who arrived in the country after that
 date and wish to become citizens are required to submit an application for citizen-
 ship, take an oath to support the Constitution, have a legal source of income, and
 have lived in the country for 7 years.
 Women.-Although statistics are not available, domestic violence including spous-
 al abuse against women is a significant problem, according to women's groups.
 There are laws prohibitting spousal abuse. Knowledgeable sources indicate that po-
 lice generally are not hesitant to enforce the laws against domestic violence and hat
 the courts are not reluctant to impose sentences. The main problem, according to
 women's groups, is a general reluctance among women to report incidents of domes-
 tic violence. Violence against women was not the subject of extensive media cov-
 erage, marches, or demonstrations during the year.
 Although government authorities and local human rights observers report that
 prostitution is not a significant problem within the country, there is much anecdotal
 evidence that young women seeking to work or travel abroad are vulnerable to sex-
 ual exploitation. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, very few women are
 
 
 1156
 
 deported back to Belarus for engaging in prostitution, and there are no local orga-
 nized crime groups involved in the trafficking of women. However, the Ministry of
 Internal Affairs acknowledges that Russian criminal organizations may try actively
 to recruit and lure Belarusian women into serving as prostitutes in Western Europe
 and the Middle East.
 Sexual harassment is reportedly widespread, but there are not any specific laws
 to deal with the problem other than laws against physical assault.
 The law requires equal wages for equal work; however, such is not always the
 case in practice..Women have significantly fewer opportunities for advancement to
 the upper ranks of management. Women report that managers frequently take into
 consideration whether a woman has children when considering potential job oppor-
 tunities. �
 The level of education of women is higher than that of men. Women make up 58
 percent of workers with a higher education and 66 percent of workers with a spe-
 cialized secondary education. Despite their higher rate of education, women are em-
 ployed in lower paying fields, such as health care and education. In these sectors,
 between two-thirds and three-fourths of employees (mostly women> live beneath the
 official poverty level. Women are equal to men before the law with regard to prop-
 erty ownership and inheritance. There are active women's groups, most of them fo-
 cusing on issues such as child welfare, environmental concerns (in the aftermath of
 Chernobyl), and the preservation of the family. A private university in Minsk estab-
 lished the country's first gender studies faculty during 1997.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare and health, par-
 ticularly as related to the consequences of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl, and,
 with the help of foreign donors, gives them special attention. By law everyone is en-
 titled to health care, including children. There does not appear to be any difference
 in the treatment of girls and boys. Children begin school at the age of 6 and are
 required to complete 9 years, although the Government makes 11 years of education
 available at no cost, and is in the process of developing a 12-year education pro-
 gram. Higher education also is available at no cost on a competitive basis. Families
 with children receive token government benefits. A World Bank study has reported
 that the majority of those living in poverty are families with- multiple children or
 single mothers.
 There does not appear to be a societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1992 law mandated accessibility to'transport, resi-
 dences, businesses, and offices for the disabled; however, facilities, including trans-
 Fort and office buildings; often are not accessible to the disabled. The country's dif-
 icult financial condition makes it especially difficult for local governments to budget
 sufficient funds to implement the 1992 law. The central Government continues to
 provide some minimal subsidies to the disabled. However, high inflation and the
 sharp decline in the value of the Belarusian ruble greatly reduced the real worth
 of these limited subsidies.
 Religious Minorities.-Societal anti-Semitism exists but usually is not manifested
 openly. Senior government officials, including the President, and the state media
 have sometimes used coded anti-Semitic language in their attacks on perceived op-
 ponents. At the time of former National Bank Chairwoman Tamara Vinnikova's ar-
 rest in 1997 for alleged malfeasance (see Section 1.d.), the state media made insinu-
 ations about a previous trip to Israel.
 In February, vandals smashed 35 tombs and monuments in a Jewish cemetery in
 the town of Rechitsa in the Gomel region. A similar incident, in which over 50
 tombs were vandalized, took place in the same cemetery during 1997. Local officials
 reportedly have failed to come up with any leads in these cases.
 In a television interview given in Moscow during December, in which he sought
 to criticize Russian financier and Executive Secretary of the Commonwealth of Inde-
 pendent States Boris Berezovskiy, President Lukashenko stated that Berezovskiy's
 activities, "might result in Jewish pogroms in Russia." Lukashenko also remarked
 that, "the main anti-Semites in Russia are representatives of the Jewish popu-
 lation."
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution upholds the right of workers, ex-
 cept state security and military personnel, to form and join independent unions on
 a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense of worker rights, including the
 right to strike. However, these rights are not recognized in practice. The independ-
 ent trade union movement is still in its infancy. The Belarusian Free Trade Union
 (BFTU) was established in 1991 and registered in 1992. Following the 1995 Minsk
 metro workers strike, the President issued a decree suspending its activities. In
 1996 the BFTU leaders formed a new umbrella organization, the Congress of Demo-
 
 
 1157
 cratic Trade Unions (BCDTU), which encompasses four leading independent unions
 and currently has approximately 18,500 members.
 The Government has taken measures to suppress independent trade unions. For
 example, members of independent unions have been arrested for distributing union
 literature, had material confiscated at the borders (see Section 2.a.), have been de-
 nied access to work sites, have been subjected to excessive fines, and have been
 pressured by their managers and state security services to resign from their jobs
 because of trade union activities. Despite the repeal by the Government of its illegal
 ban on the BFTU and the Ministry of Justice's registration of the BCDTU during
 December 1997, government authorities have continued to threaten and harass
 independent union members. State managers at the Mogilev Trolley Bus Directorate
 refused to allow Victor Tarnovskiy, the chairman of a local branch of the independ-
 ent Democratic Trade Union of Transport Workers, to fulfill his union leadership
 responsibilities. The Directorate terminated Tarnovskiy's employment in April.
 The Government continues to discourage employees at state-run enterprises from
 joining independent trade unions. Several workers at the Mogilev automobile plant
 were threatened during April that their employment contracts would be terminated
 unless they resigned their membership in the BFTU. Mogilev city officials also re-
 peatedly have refused permission to hold union demonstrations.
 Presidential decree number 639, "On Measures Aimed at Improvement of Co-
 operation of State Governing Bodies and Trade Unions," issued in December 1997,
 assigned to the Council of Ministers and the official Federation of Trade Unions of
 Belarus (FTUB) the task of drafting new legislation regarding collective bargaining,
 union rights, and representation. Although the FTUB-drafted "Concept of the State
 Policy Towards Trade Unions," has not yet been adopted, independent unions lead-
 ers fear that it potentially would lock them out of the collective bargaining process
 by limiting participation based on the size of union membership.
 The FTUB, formerly the Belarusian branch of the Soviet Union's All-Union Cen-
 tral Council of Trade Unions, consists of approximately 4.4 million workers (includ-
 ing retirees) and is by far the largest trade union organization. According to official
 union federation figures 92 percent of the workforce is unionized. Although unwill-
 ing in the past to challenge the regime seriously, the FTUB's leadership during the
 year was far more vocal in its criticisms of the policies of the Lukashenko regime.
 In retaliation FTUB officials reportedly have been subjected to threats and harass-
 ment from the Government. However, independent labor leaders maintain that most
 FTUB officials do not promote effectively worker rights. Independent labor leaders
 also believe that the official trade unions' continued control over social welfare func-
 tions usually performed by the State (such as pension fumds).is an obstacle to the
 growth of true, independent trade unions.
 Tight control by the Government over public demonstrations (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.b.) makes it difficult for unions to strike or hold public rallies to further their
 objectives.
 Approximately 15 independent trade union activists, including BFTU chairwoman
 Maria Aliyeva and editor of the BFTU bulletin, Worker, Viktor Ivashkevich, were
 detained by police on November 5 following an antigovernment labor demonstration
 (see Section 2.b.). Although the BFTU had received government approval to hold a
 demonstration outside of the Minsk Tractor Factory, protest leaders were arrested
 after they decided to march on presidential administration offices to present a peti-
 tion calling for higher wages and union access to the official media. A Minsk city
 court subsequently released with official warnings, fined, or sentenced to between
 6 and 15 days in prison those who were arrested.
 Following an extensive antiunion campaign conducted by the state media, the
 FTUB-affiliated Automobile and Agricultural Equipment Manufacturing Union
 called off at the last moment a demonstration against falling living standards that
 it had planned to hold in Minsk on December 2. There were credible reports that
 state sector workers were threatened with retaliatory punishments if they proceeded
 with the demonstration.
 Unions may affiliate freely with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet era provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the econ-
 omy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek political redress
 for their economic problems. Workers and independent unions have recourse to the
 court system. According to a poll conducted by the Ministry of Labor's Labor Re-
 search Institute in January, most industrial workers believe that the terms of their
 employment are governed by collective bargaining agreements. However, only 17
 percent of the workers polled thought that collective bargaining agreements are exe-
 cuted as stipulated.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 1158
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, except in cases when the work or service to be performed is fixed by a court's
 decision or in accordance with the Law on the State of Emergency and Martial Law.
 The Constitutional provision prohibiting forced or bonded labor applies to all citi-
 zens, although its application to children is not specified. With the possible excep-
 tion of juvenile prisoners, forced labor is not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 establishes 16 as the minimum age for employment. With the written consent of one
 parent (or legal guardian), a child of 14 years may conclude a labor contract. The
 Prosecutor General's office reportedly enforces this law effectively. The constitu-
 tional provision prohibiting forced or bonded labor applies to all citizens, although
 its application to children is not specified (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-On October 1, in a failed attempt to maintain
 the real value of wages, the Council of Ministers raised the monthly minimum wage
 from $4 (250,000 rubles) to $6 (350,000 rubles). On December 30, the Council of
 Ministers announced that the monthly minimum wage would be "raised" from
 350,000 rubles to 500,000 rubles, which was then worth only $2 at the official rate
 of exchange. The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. However, the minimum wage is used by the Government most-
 ly as a statistical measuring tool, and the official monthly poverty line on December
 30-approximately $16.50 (4,180,267 rubles)-was actually much higher. According
 to one estimate, the average monthly wage at the end of the year stood at approxi-
 mately $33 (8,527,189 rubles), a drop of 170 percent in real terms since January.
 Agricultural workers are paid approximately 39 percent less than the average
 monthly wage. Sharp devaluation of the ruble during the year made it even more
 difficult for the average worker to earn a decent living. Wage arrears in the state
 sector were also a growing problem and totaled over 9 percent of the Government's
 wage fund in October. Collective and state farms accounted for over 84 percent of
 the arrearages. According to the president of the FTUB, at least 12 percent of state
 industrial enterprises pay workers late, and less than 50 percent of agricultural
 workers receive their wages on time.
 The Constitution and Labor Code set a limit of 40 hours of work per week and
 provide for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the country's dif-
 ficult economic situation, an increasing number of workers find themselves working
 considerably less than 40 hours per week. Factories often require workers to take
 unpaid furloughs due to shortages of raw materials and energy and lack of demand
 for factory output.
 The law establishes minimum conditions for workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards often are ignored. Workers at many heavy machinery
 plants do not wear even minimal safety gear, such as gloves, hard hats, or welding
 glasses. A State Labor Inspectorate exists, but does not have the authority to en-
 force compliance, and violations often are ignored. According to official data, 294
 people died and 692 were injured in workplace accidents during the year. The high
 accident rate is due to lack of protective clothing, shoes, and equipment, non-observ-
 ance of temperature regulations, and the use of outdated machinery. There is no
 provision in the law that allows workers to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations without risking loss of their jobs.
