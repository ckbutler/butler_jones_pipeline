 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan, one of the world's least developed and
 poorest nations, experienced a violent change of
 government in late April, 1978. Many individuals
 associated with the previous regime were killed
 during the fighting and several purges since then
 have removed potential opponents from official
 positions and led to the jailing of others. The
 new, leftist-oriented regime has announced its
 commitment to extensive reforms of the country's
 economic and social systems. Afghan society remains
 highly conservative, Islamic, and traditional, and
 some of the regime's reforms will probably encounter
 stiff resistance. The domestic political situation
 continues to be unstable. There are persistent
 reports of active opposition in several provinces to
 the central government. The regime is preoccupied
 with establishing its own security and with elimina-
 ting real or perceived opposition groups.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Reports concerning the regime's use of torture
 continue to be received, but what appear to be
 confirmed cases are few since most political detai-
 nees are still incarcerated or their whereabouts are
 unknown. However, the new Government has not
 gained wide political support. It has detained many
 members of several opposition groups which were
 allegedly plotting the regime's overthrow. Other
 such groups may exist. It is probable that authori-
 ties employ physical coercion to extract information
 from prisoners.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Instances of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment probably have occurred in the case of
 major figures allegedly associated with countercoup
 attempts but confirmation is not available. Some
 members of the previous royal family and officials of
 the previous government were killed during the April
 1978 coup or reportedly executed thereafter, but
 confirmation is not available. According to govern-
 ment officials, many elements of the previous regime's
 penal and civil codes have been retained, while
 judicial features which were deemed "incompatible with
 the principles of the revolution" have been abolish-
 ed. Provisions have been announced for the establish-
 ment of "revolutionary tribunals" which would dispense
 "revolutionary justice" if necessary. So far the
 regime has not resorted to the use of these bodies,
 and the day-to-day administration of justice for
 common criminals apparently does not now differ
 greatly from that employed by the previous regime.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The new regime has released perhaps as many as 12,000
 ordinary prisoners who, according to official state-
 ments, had never been given a trial by the previous
 government. The sentences of all remaining prisoners
 were reduced. On the other hand, the revolutionary
 regime has imprisoned as many as 200 members of the
 former Royal Family or others prominent in the pre-
 vious regime, including women and children. The
 Government maintained that this action was taken to
 ensure the safety of the individuals involved.
 The Afghan Government recently announced the release
 of approximately 70 of the women and children but
 according to the Department of State's information,
 the male detainees, most of whom were arrested shortly
 after the revolution, remain incarcerated in very
 primitive conditions. There are reports that some
 
 
 prisoners may have been transferred recently to more
 comfortable surroundings and that a handful may have
 been allowed to return home.
 Subsequent political arrests have involved indivi-
 duals suspected of plotting the forcible overthrow of
 the Government and may number more than ten thousand,
 but the regime only acknowledges publicly that it is
 holding approximately 200 persons whom it regards as
 "political prisoners." The accusation of such plott-
 ing may be true in some cases, but detainees seem to
 have only a very tenuous relationship with any opposi-
 tion group. Although the new regime never resor-
 ted to the imposition of formal martial law, an
 overnight curfew was in effect during the first three
 months of its existence and the Government repeatedly
 announced that violators could be shot summarily.
 There is no confirmation, however, that this threat
 has been carried out. The curfew was relaxed during
 the Moslem holy month of Ramadan (August), but was
 reinstated afterwards in Kabul and a few other loca-
 tions in the country.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most individuals accused of non-political civil and
 criminal offenses are being tried according to the
 provisions in the penal code of the previous regime.
 These provisions include a guarantee of public trial
 in civilian courts with the usual rights to legal
 counsel, appeal and confrontation of witnesses.
 Nothing is known by the Department of State about how
 individuals suspected of offenses related to the
 regime's security are treated. We have been unable to
 verify reports that those identified as "traitors"by
 the regime have been regularly executed without
 trial.
 e. Invasion of the Hone
 Despite the social reforms of the April revolution,
 Afghanistan remains a traditional, closed and conser-
 vative Muslim society, and the privacy of the home is
 
 
 520
 generally respected. Nevertheless, in the current
 political environment there have been numerous instan-
 ces of sudden nighttime arrests of individuals and
 whole families associated with the previous ruling
 clans or suspected of anti-regime activities.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The provision of "food, clothing, and shelter" to all
 Afghans is the standard slogan of this regime. The
 regime has stated ambitious goals for bringing about a
 genuine improvement in the average Afghan's standard
 of living. Programs planned include, among others,
 land reform, stimulation of domestic industry, impro-
 ved health care and increased educational opportunities.
 Revolutionary Council Decree Number Six represents the
 first step in the regime's land and credit reform
 programs. Aimed at "feudal landlords and usurers", it
 reduces or eliminates peasant debts and mortgages. To
 have a lasting effect, however, the Government would
 have to provide the peasantry a source of credit other
 than the traditional village money-lender. The publi-
 cation of the regime's "Five-Year Plan", now being
 drafted, should provide indication of the Government's
 economic and social goals and how it intends to achieve
 them.
 Shortly after the revolution, the Ministry of Commerce
 decreed the reduction of prices for a wide range of
 imported consumer goods and for such basic commodities
 as wheat. Some prices decreased, although others
 remained the same or increased. An Embassy price
 index calculated for a few staples shows that their
 prices have dropped about fifteen percent since the
 revolution,but this may have been the result of
 factors unrelated to government policies. Recent-
 ly, however, some key commodities, such as flour and
 firewood, have become scarce and are demanding very
 high prices. Elimination of corruption, endemic to
 Afghan society, is a stated goal of the Government. A
 few news stories have featured the arrests of corrupt
 
 
 officials. Petty corruption persists, however,
 especially in connection with the issuance of pass-
 ports and visas, and the practice of offering bribes
 to elicit action by working level government offi-
 cials has probably not diminished significantly.
 As of November, the Government appreared to be follow-
 ing generally pragmatic and conservative fiscal and
 monetary policies.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The new Government, like its predecessor, controls all
 the media, although this regime appears to exert
 stricter control over content and uses the press more
 to reflect official policy than did the previous
 government. The leftist regime's leadership insists
 that it respects the practice of Islam, the designated
 national religion. Many devout Afghans view these
 reassurances with suspicion. Minority citizens such
 as Sikhs, Hindus and Jews are permitted to practice
 their own faiths without interference.
 Political assembly is permitted only in support of the
 Government. The regime has organized demonstrations,
 parades and rallies to show the people's alleged
 support for its policies.
 Labor organizations, which did not exist under the
 previous government, have been established in several
 ministries and larger industries. These unions will
 not likely be given the right to strike or to take
 stands opposing the Government's policies. However,
 the new regime's ideology reflects a strong concern
 for the status of workers, and the creation of labor
 unions could result in improved working conditions.
 Many government workers have "donated" time or
 wages to such programs as flood relief or the cause of
 the revolution in general. Official pressure may have
 been applied to solicit these donations.
 
 
 For centuries, Afghan society has been dominated by
 the Pushtun ethnic group, which forms about one-half
 the population. Others, such as Hazaras, Tajiks, and
 Uzbeks, have been victims of direct and indirect
 discrimination. Central goals of the new regime's
 program are the assimilation of all ethnic groups into
 the political, social and economic mainstream of the
 country and the elimination of the historic hold of
 the Mohammadzai family on all levels of power.
 Several members of ethnic minority groups were appoin-
 ted to the cabinet, although the top political leader-
 ship is still Pushtun.
 The revolutionary regime has pledged itself to estab-
 lish full equality for women. The previous regime had
 made some basic reforms in this field. In general,
 however, and especially in the countryside, women
 occupy an inferior status in this traditional Islamic
 society.
 b. Freedom of Movment Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Restrictions on travel within the country exist,
 especially to areas where armed resistance to the new
 Government continues. Permission for foreign travel,
 difficult to obtain under previous governments, has
 been further reduced by the new regime. Even foreign-
 born wives of Afghans (considered by the Goverment to
 be Afghan citizens) have difficulty leaving the
 country. Emigration is more strictly controlled
 than it was under the former government.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Firm information regarding the political policy-making
 process remains scarce. Clearly the People's Democratic
 Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) controls the country. All
 decisions are made by a small group of men, including
 Prime Minister Taraki and Foreign Minister Amin, who
 form the Party's political bureau. The regime has
 claimed that the PDPA has about 50,000 members and
 sympathizers (out of a population of approximately 14
 million), but many observers believe the actual figure
 
 
 523
 is much lower. The Government has expressed its inten-
 tion to expand participation in the political process.
 Whether this portends a rapid increase in the size of
 the PDPA is unclear. Membership in the only legal
 party is a prerequisite for effective political parti-
 cipation and professional advancement.
 The leaders have hinted that a new constitution may be
 promulgated, but no information regarding timing or
 content has yet been.revealed.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 National and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 representative who went to Afghanistan three times in
 1978 was permitted to visit certain prisoners. In
 accordance with ICRC practice, the representative
 did not issue any public statement regarding his
 findings.
 An official Amnesty International mission visited
 Afghanistan in October of 1978 and was received by
 Foreign Minister Amin. In a November 7 news release,
 the organization welcomed the release of 72 to 74
 members of the royal family but voiced concern about
 reliable reports that "several thousand political
 prisoners" were being held without charge or trial.
 These prisoners are reported to be opponents of the
 present as well as of previous regimes, one of whom is
 said to have been held without charge for more
 than 20 years. The latter, a political prisoner, was
 released by the Afghan regime after the publication of
 the Amnesty International Report. Several former
 members of the Government implicated in an attempted
 coup in August are to be tried at a yet unspecified
 date.
 The Taraki Government has stated represenatives
 of international human rights organizations will be
 permitted to attend the trial.
