 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy in which the
 government's authority is balanced between executive
 and legislative branches. The French system is based
 on the thesis that the plurality of power provides the
 checks and balances essential to ensure that the rights
 of individuals stand higher than the claims of the
 state. France has an established tradition of respect
 for human rights and of their promotion at home and
 abroad. The French government and people fully support
 this element of national tradition and policy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in prac-
 tice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaran-
 teed by French law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 France provides extensive social benefits, unemployment
 compensation, full health services and free education to
 all citizens through university levels. The Government
 of France has actively pursued a humanitarian refugee
 policy. In 1979 alone, France accepted almost 15,000
 Indochina refugees. In addition, France has accepted
 a large number of refugees from Algeria and has allowed
 Africans from former French colonies to work in France
 on long-term permits. The government has taken particu-
 lar care to avoid circumstances which might evolve into
 racial conflict.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are respected.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of internal movement, foreign travel
 and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in democratic processes is fully respected.
 The rights of women and minorities are guaranteed by law.
 A cabinet level official is charged with responsibility
 for women's affairs. Labor practices entail full respect
 for the right to organize, to strike and to bargain
 collectively.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Pegarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, no investi-
 gations of human rights performance in France have been
 sought.
