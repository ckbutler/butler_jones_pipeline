 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa is a small Pacific island country located 1,600 miles northeast of
 New Zealand. It is a parliamentary democracy with certain concessions to Samoan
 cultural practices. The Constitution provides for a Samoan head of state, a unicam-
 eral legislature of matai (family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an independ-
 ent judiciary, protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of
 fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested in the Head of
 State, with the Government administered by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 Minister and 12 ministers chosen by him. All legislation passed by the Legislative
 Assembly needs the approval of the Head of State. The present Head of State,
 Malictoa Tanumafili 11, holds the position for life. His successors will be elected by
 the Legislative Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but uniquely Samoan.
 Traditional authority is vested in the matai who is appointed by a consensus of the
 aiga (extended family) or by decision of the fono (council of matai). Ownership of
 land is legally vested in the matai whose responsibility is to direct the economic,
 social, and political affairs of the aiga. Western Samoa has 362 villages with over
 25,000 matai (Samoa's population is approximately 160,000). Each village is gov-
 erned by a fono, which can fine or otherwise punish offenses against village rules.
 Western Samoa does not have a defense force. The small national police force is

 firmly under the control of the Government but has little impact beyond the capital
 e.onomy is Primarily agricultural end susce tible to shifts in world prices for
 its export commodities, such as coconut products.   recent years, tourism and light
 industry have become increasingly important foreign exchange earners. Western
 Samoa is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on remittances sent to family mem-
 bers by more than 100,000 Samoans living abroad in Australia, New Zealand, and
 the United States.
 Western Samoan society is based on a collective value system in which obligations
 and responsibilities to the alga are often given precedence over individual rights.
 Most disagreements are settled by decision of the fono (which usually involve fines
 or more rarely, banishment from the village).
 Principal hu man rights problems arise out of discrimination and violence against
 women; societal pressures may interfere with the ability to conduct fair trials. A
 government-established public defender's office and an ombudsman's office help
 Samoans in their dealings with the courts and the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Such killings are not known to
 occur.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports of such practices by police or other
 government authorities. However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the
 fones mete out banishment and fines as traditional punishments when deemed nec-
 essary.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law contains safeguards against ar-
 bitrary arrest and preventive detention, and these are widely observed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair
 public trial, which is honored by the official court system, modeled on the British
 system. However many civil and criminal matters are not handled by the Western-
 style courts but by village fonos. The 362 village fonos each have their own proce-
 dures handed down by oral tradition, and they differ considerably both in their deci-
 sionmaking style and in the number of matai involved in the decisions. The Village
 Fono Law of 1990gave legal recognition to the decisions of the fono. The law also
 provided for limited recourse of appeal to the Lands and Titles Courts and the right
 of direct appeal to the Supreme Court. No such appeals have yet been made to the
 Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Samoan
 law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property without
 substantive and procedural safeguards, including search warrants which are issued
 by the judicial branch. Practically, however, there is little or no privacy in the vil-
 lage. Village officials by law must have permission to enter homes, but there can
 be substantial social pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and of the press are fun-
 damental parts of the Constitution. Two major newspapers are printed regularly in
 the country. In addition to the government radio station, a private radio station is
 also permitted to broadcast. There is no television in Western Samoa, but broad-
 casts from American Samoa are readily available to viewers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations. There are no sig-
 nificant restrictions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution,
 along with freedom of thought and conscience. There is no government-favored reli-
 gion. Nearly 100 percent of the population is Christian. While the Constitution
 grants each person the right to change religion or belief and to worship or teach
 religion alone or with others, in practice the matai often chooses the relious de-
 nomination of the aiga. There is strong societal pressure to support chuz  leaders
 and projects financia]ly, with contributions often totaling more than 30 percent of
 income.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriat/on.-The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement and reset.

 tlement in Western Samoa, but in practice some citizens have been banished either
 from village activities or completely from the village. This is one of the harmhest
 forms of punishment in this collective society. Emigration is actively supported by
 the Government because it is a 'safety valve for pressures of a growing population,
 for potentially rebellious youths, and because it increases foreign income through re-
 mittances. Foreign travel is not arbitrarily restricted. The right of citizens to return
 is guaranteed.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Samoan citizens have the right to change their government through direct,
 multiparty elections. All citizens above the age of 21 may vote. The right to run for
 47 of the 49 seats in Parliament, however, remains the prerogative of the approxi-
 mately 25,000 matai (virtually all of whom are men). The remaining two seats are
 reserved for citizens not of Samoan heritage. While all adult Samoans may vote for
 the Parliament, matai continue to control local government through the village fono
 which is open to them alone. However, the system does permit change, and matai
 can be removed if they do not meet the responsibilities of their position.
 The political process in Western Samoa is more a function of personality than of
 party. The first party, founded in 1982, was the Human Rights Protection Party
 (HRPP). Its leader, Tofilau Eti Alesana, is the Prime Minister. The HRPP now holds
 35 of the 49 seats in Parliament. The opposition party, the Samoan National Devel-
 opment Party, was formed in 1988, replacing the previous Christian Democratic
 Party founded in 1985. Unless defections to the opposition cause the Government
 to fall, which is unlikely, the next general elections will not be held until 1996.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no official or private human rights organi-
 zations exist. There are no reports of any international or nongovernmental requests
 for investigations of alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion. Language, or Social Status
 Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic minorities. Samoan
 politics and culture are the product of a heritage of chiefly privilege and power, and
 members of certain families have some advantages. While there is discrimination
 against non-matai and women, women (and particularly women matai) play an im-
 prtant role in society and can reach high office. There is one female cabinet mem-
 er and one other female member of Parliament. The passage of universal suffrage
 in 1990 and the establishment of a Women's Affairs Ministry in 1991provided sub-
 stantial new rights and opportunities for women, but their traditional subordinate
 role is changing slowly in the more conservative parts of society.
 Abuse of women and children is prohibited by law, but it is known to be a prob-
 lem that is often unreported or ignored. No reliable data about its extent are avail-
 able. Many cases of rape go unreported. However, those convicted are given sen-
 tences of at least several years imprisonment.
 The Constitution makes special provision to preserve the political rights of non-
 Samoans. Persons of mixed ancestry who are culturally Samoan are fully accepted
 and can attain positions of considerable wealth and influence. Several have held or
 hold cabinet positions and a number serve in the Parliament.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Western Samoan workers have legally unrestricted
 rights to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. While trade unions
 have not emerged in the private sector, the Government does not restrict efforts to
 develop them. The Public Service Association, representing government workers, an
 increasingly important sector of the work force, functions as a union. The Supreme
 Court has upheld the right of government workers to strike, subject to certain re-
 strictions imposed principally for reasons of public safety. The Public Service Asso-
 ciation freely maintains relations with international bodies and participates in bilat-
 eral exchanges.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While workers have the legal
 right to engage in collective bargaining, this right is seldom practiced because of the
 absence of unions in the private sector. However, the Public Service Association en-
 gages in collective bargaining on behalf of government workers, including bargain-
 ing on wages. Arbitration and mediation procedures are in place to resolve labor dis-
 putes, although these rarely arise. Labor law and practice in the one export process-
 ini zone are the same as in the rest of the country.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While the Government does not
 demand compulsory labor and it is prohibited by law, in this collective society people
 are frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most people do so willingly.
 but, if not, the matai can compel them to do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the terms of the Labor and
 Employment Act of 1972 and      ations of 1973, it is illegal to employ children
 under 15 years of age except in safe and light work." The Commissioner of Labor
 refers complaints about illegal child labor to the Attorney General for enforcement.
 The Attorney General has received no complaints about violation of the child labor
 laws, which probably seldom occur. The law does not apply to service rendered to
 the matai, some of Whom require children to work, primarily on village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and
 Regulations of 1973 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 small minimum wage. This minimum wage suffices for a minimum standard of liv.
 ing when supplemented by the subsistence farming and fishing in which most fami-
 lies en age.
 The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health standards, which
 the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing. Independent observers report,
 however, that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when accidents high-
 light noncompliance. In addition, many agricultural workers, among others, are in-
 adequately protected from pesticides and other dangers to health. Government edu-
 cation programs are addressing these concerns. The law does not apply to service
 rendered to the matai. Government employees are covered under different and more
 stringent regulations, which are adequately enforced by the Public Service Commis-
 sion.
