 LESOTHO
 Lesotho has been ruled since 1986 by a aix-member Military Council, which over-
 threw the civilian government of Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan in that year.
 Major General Elias Ramaema, who took over in April 1991 as Chairman of both
 the ruling Military Council and the 15-member civilian and military Council of Min-
 isters, continued on the path laid out by his predecessor to return Lestho to civilian
 rule. Throughout 1992, as the Military Council's commitment to elections became
 more apparent, political activity resumed, with 14 parties campaigning for elections
 planned for early 1993.
 Electoral p reparations took place against a grwing controversy over the future
 of Lesotho's Monarchy. The exiled ex-king Moshoeho ue II, returned from London in
 July and attempted to regain the throne arom his son, Letsie Il, who had been in-
 stalled during his father's absence. The Military Council insisted that Moshoeshoe's
 return not disrupt the electoral process, but political discourse in the country inten-
 sifed after his return to include consideration of modifying or abolishing the Monar-
 chy and the subordinate traditional chieftainship structure. A new constitution,
 under consideration by the government-appointed National Constituent Assembly
 since 1990 butot yt o t enacted, would fly limit the Kindgs poitical prerogatives
 and clearly establish a constitutional monarchy.
 The Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF) of about 2,000 troops is responsible for
 internal and border security. The Royal Lesotho Mounted Police (RLMP) of about
 1,600 men and women assists the RLDF. Members of both forces occasionallybeat
 or otherwise mistreat detainees. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament A      n conducted a detailed
 analysis, were roughly estimated to be between $18 million and $22 million. There
 are no indications that efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures in the near
 future.
 A landlocked country surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is almost entirely de-
 pendent on its sole neighbor for trade finane employment, and access to the out-
 side world. Approximately one-third bf the adult male work force is employed in
 South African mines. Miners' remittances vlav a large role in Lesotho's balance of
 
 
 130
 ayments, accounting for over 40 percent of the gross national product in 1990.
 tateowned organizations dominate the agroindustrial and a iusiness sectors, but
 private sector activity dominates in manufacturing and contruction. Under
 Lesotho's traditional c *eftainship structure, the chiefs control the land, precluding
 private ownership of property.
 Human rights in Lest ho in 1992 remained circumscibed under the military Gov-
 ernment, but the imminent return to civilian rule by year's end resulted in greater
 freedom of speech, press, association, and assembly. The revised, but not yet en-
 acted, constitution includes a lengthy section on protection of fundamental human
 rights and freedoms, based primarily on the 1966 Constitution. However, the mili-
 tary Government used its powers to restrict promonarhy activities. Police brutality
 against detainees and trade unionists continued, as did excessive force against
 criminal suspects. Provisions remain in force for lengthy detentions without trial,
 and women's rights continue to be severely restricted.
 RFSPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Kiling-There were no ,reported political
 killings, but some extrajudicial killings continued to occur. Excess~s by law enforce-
 ment agencies included the fatal shooting of suspects involved in a rash of armed
 car thefts in early 1992. The authorities have not taken any convincing action to
 punish those responsible for excesses, including torture. There were no investiga-
 tions into the 1991 police shooting of Ngaka Sula, a trade union official, or into the
 death in police custody of Mofokeng Makakola, a criminal suspect. Makakola appar-
 ently died as a result of severe beatings and electric shocks. In recent years, a num-
 ber of people have died while in government custody or reportedly at the hands of
 prgovernment forces; only one person was investigated and brought to trial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically re ate dsappearances in
 1992, nor were there any further instances of reported abductions by South African
 authorities in Lesotho, as occurred in previous years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish ment.-
 Reports of police brutality includinof detainees, continued d
 There were also continues reports that police or military personnel ran l  a
 civilians. No known investigations or other official measures were launched as a re-
 sult of these practices.
 Prison facilities in Lesotho are overcrowded and in need of repair. Credible re-
 ports have spoken of prisoners being held in rooms ankle-deep in water for extended
 eriods; there are also reports indicating severe beatings of prisoners by police and
 Senialof proper medical treatment in cases of injury resulting from such abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-In civil and criminal cases, persons ar-
 rested or detained have the right to immediate consideration of habeas corpus pleas
 as well as the right to legal counsel and medical attention. The 1981 Criminal Pro-
 cdures and Eviene Act, as amended in 1984, makes provision for the granting
 of bail. Under the Act, the High Court is the only judicial body empowered to grant
 bail in cases of armed robbery or suspected homicide.
 The Internal Security (general) At (ISA) of 1984 provides for so-called investiga-
 tive detention without charge or trial in political cases for up to 42 days (the frst
 14 days on order of the police; the second14 days on order of the Police Commis-
 sioner; and the final 14 days on order of the Mipster of Defense and Internal Scu-
 rity-a portfolio d t h byt head of the militar government). During the second
 stage of the detention, ministerially appointed 'advisers" (all of whom have been
 government employees to date) are avaiable to report on the health of the detainee,
 investigate whether the detainee has been involved in subversive activities and ad-
 vise the Minister of Defense and Internal Security whether there is a need for con-
 tinued detention. Detainees under the Act may make representation about their
 own treatment only through the adviser. The Act also allows for detention of wit-
 nesses in security cases. There were no known detentions under the Act or other
 laws in 1992.
 In addition, a 1986 amendment to the ISA allows the Minister of Defense and In-
 ternal Securityto restrict" a person who, in the opinion of the Police Commissioner,
 is conducting himself in a manner prejudicial to public order, security, administra-
 tion of justice, or obedience to the law or lawful authority. After ex-king Mosheeshoe
 II's return from exile in July, the Government made clear its expectation that he
 would remain primarily at his home village about 30 minutes from Maseru, al-
 though it did not invoke the Internal Security Act to enforce this.
 The continued existence of the Internal Security Act became a source of political
 party criticism in 1992 of the Government's commitment to genuine demecratiza-
 
 
 tion. Some parties argued that free and fair elections could not, in fact, be held so
 long as the Act's broad powers remained available to the Government as a means
 of intimidation. The Act was used in 1991 to charge three trade unionists with hold-
 ing an illegal meeting at a local textile factory, but they were not brought to trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public T7al.-The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal
 (which meets semiannually), the High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or
 traditional courts, which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 Judges on the High Court are relatively independent; magistrates appear more sus-
 ceptible to governmental or chieftainship influence. Court decisions and rulings are
 respected by the authorities and are generally free of interference by the executive.
 Accused persons have and use the right to counsel and public trials. The courts have
 acted to limit infringements of law on numerous occasions in past years, e.g. the
 April 1988 annulment on procedural grounds of the state of emergency which, how-
 ever, the military Government quickly reinstituted.
 Under the system of Roman-Dutch law a pplied in Lesotho, there is no trial by
 jury. A single High Court judge, presiding with two assessors who serve in an advi-
 sory capacity, normally adjudicate criminal trials.. In civil cases, judges normally
 hear cases alone. The High Court also provides procedural and substantive advice
 and guidance to military tribunals on matters of legal procedure; however, it does
 not participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have jurisdiction only
 over military cases.
 The Attorney General may initiate a judicial inquest on the authority of the Judi-
 cial Inquest Proclamation Number 32 of 1954. In November 1989, he initiated such
 an inquiry into the 1986 slayings of two former cabinet ministers and their wives.
 The 1991 conviction by the Chief Justice of the High Court of two military officers
 for the murder of these persons is under automatic appeal in light of the death sen-
 tence imposed on one defendant. Due to the volume of testimony resulting from this
 lengthy case, the appeal was not heard in 1992.
 In late 1992 the authorities released 23 former members of the military, who
 were arrested ?ollowing the 1986 coup, after the High Court made clear it was re-
 pared to hear their cases on appeal. They had been convicted by a court-martial Sur-
 ing which they had been denied access to counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A-
 though search warrants are usually required un er normal circumstances, the ISA
 provides police with wide powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to
 enter homes and other places for similar purposes without a warrant. Such searches
 occurred generally in the context of police operations against criminal activity, pri-
 marily theft. Government officials occasionally monitor correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press were more widely
 observed in 1992, as the Military Council made preparations to hand over authority
 to a civilian government. After the 1991 lifting of the 1986 Order No. 4, which
 banned partisan political activity, political parties expanded their activities through-
 out 1992. In the months leading up to the general elections, criticism of military
 sovernment leaders and policies was widespread and generally unrestrained, attest-
 ing to growing press freedom and declining inhibitions on the part of journalists.
 In particular, events surrounding the return in July of ex-king Moshoeshoe pro-
 voked strong editorial positions, both proand antigovernment, in the press and in
 general political discourse.
 The Government controls the official media (one radio station, a 1-hour daily
 newscast on a local television channel, and two weekly newspapers) and ensures
 that they faithfully reflect official views. Prior to the elections, however, the Govern-
 ment made available free time on television and radio to each of the 14 political
 parties contesting the elections. There were charges that government media gave fa-
 vorable coverage to the political activities of the Basotho National Party (BNP), al-
 though this perception was widely reported and debated within the independent
 media. With the exception of editorial warnings in, the government-controlled media
 to royalists who criticized the electoral process and foreign donors, the Government
 rarely used the official media to attack its partisan critics. Opposition viewpoints
 were routinely expressed in 1992 in two Sesotho-language weekly newspapers pub-
 lished by the Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical Churches and in two inde-
 pendent English-language weeklies.
 Academic freedom is generally respected, although some professors and students
 complained about restrictions on their ability to discuss academic and political is-
 sues. Political meetings took place on the National University campus in the run-
 uv to elections.
 
 
 132
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government inhibited
 large public gatherings in supprt of ex-king Moshoeshoe's return and continued to
 monitor closely the actions of his supporters throughout 1992. However, political
 party meetings and rallies occurred regularly throughout Lesotho in preparation for
 the elections, limited only by the requirement for prior police notification. Nonpoliti-
 cal organizations and professional groups are freely formed and are allowed to hold
 public and regular meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open reli-
 ous practice is permitted and encouraged. Christianity is nominally the dominant
 fith of the majority of Basotho, and Roman Catholicism has the most adherents,
 although less than half of the population.
 There is a significant Protestant minority composed of the Lesotho Evangelical
 Church, the Anglican Church, and a number of other smaller denominations. Con-
 version is permitted, and there is no apparent social or political benefit or stigma
 attached to belonging to any particular church. There are no barriers to missionary
 activity or work by foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the country and
 across national boundaries. There were no instances in 1992 of the Government de-
 nying passports to prominent critics, as occurred in 1991.
 The Government distinguishes between "international" passports and "local" pass-
 ports--the latter being more readily available, and for use only in traveling to South
 Africa, as many Basotho do on a regular basis for work or shopping. A refundable
 deposit of up to $875 is required to obtain an international passport, depending on
 the destination, in theory to cover the cost of an eventual repatriation if necessary.
 The Government does not obstruct its citizens who wish to emigrate.
 There are currently about 220 refugees registered with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCRY who ave been granted asylum in Lesotho,
 the majority unaffiliated South Africans. The local office of the UN-CR also reports
 over 4,000 South Africans in 'refugee-like status," most of whom have lived in Leso-
 tho for many years. There is no forced resettlement of refugees. At year's end, the
 UNHCR planned to close its Lesotho office, owing to the lack of new refugee cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 Citizens of Lesotho prepared in 1992 to exercise their right to choose their own
 government for the first time in over 20 years. National elections, scheduled for No-
 vember 28, were postponed at the last minute for technical reasons until early 1993,
 with the agreement of all political parties.
 Under its new constitution Lestho will have a democratically elected Parliament
 with universal suffrage for tose over 21, an independent judiciary, and a constitu-
 tional monarch. The new onstitution is based largely on the in ndence constitu-
 tion of 1966, updated by the National Constituent Assembly which met intermit-
 tently from 1990 to 1992. A commission of the Assembly traveled around the coun-
 try in 1991 and 1992, explaining major provisions of the new constitution and sli-
 itng public comment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of  ttuman Rights
 A new human rights umbrella, nongovernmental organization (NGO) was formed
 in August, which aimed to bring under its leadership church groups and other
 NO's active in human rights issues. The official media gave coverage to this orga-
 nization's founding, and te Government showed no sign of interferi ng with its ac-
 tivities. The independence of this organization and its ability to investigate human
 rights abuses within Lesotho remained untested at year's end.
 The Government neither comented on, nor hindered the distribution within Le-
 sotho of a May 1992 Amnesty International report on human rights violations. The
 report cited torture, extrajud cial killings, and abuses against trade unionists, all of
 which allegedly occurred in 1991 or earlier. There was scant comment on the report
 in the local press, although persons within and without the Government did not dis-
 pute the accuracy of its account of individual cases involving torture    and
 extrajudicial killings.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Most citizens of Lesotho speak a common language and share common historical
 and cultural traditionst.Small numbers of Asians (primarily ethnic Chinese and In-
 dians) and South African whites are active in the country's commercial life. Eco-
 nomic and racial tensiontn bwelthe Chinese business community and the Basotho
 remained an issue after the May 1991 riots which targeted Asian-owned shops. An-
 
 
 though there was no repeat of generalized, ethnically based violence in 1992, foreign
 shop owners remained subject to the 1987 Tradin Enteri   Order which calls on
 foreign owners to enter into joint ventures with Basotho nationals. Although equity
 transfers would entail compensation and the program has not been strongly en-
 forced, it remains a concern to non-Basotho business people.
 In Lesotho the rights of women are severely limited by both law and custom in
 areas such as property, inheritance, and contracts, but women have the legal and
 customary right to make a will and sue for divorce. Under Lesotho's customary law,
 a married woman is considered a minor during the lifetime of her husband; she can-
 not enter into any legally binding contract, whether for employment, commerce or
 education, without her husband's consent. A woman married under customary law
 has no standing in court and may not sue or be sued without her husband's permis-
 sion. Despite their second-class status, women in Lesotho traditionally have been
 the stabilizing force in the home and in the agricultural sector, given the absence
 of tens of thousands of Basotho men who work in South Africa. More female than
 male children complete primary and secondary schools. The Government has not se-
 riously addressed the issue of women's rights but has made some attempts to im-
 prove the economic prospects of women.
 In August the Government announced that married female civil servants would
 henceforth have the same pension eligibility as men; they had been ineligible pre-
 viously.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. While statistics are
 not available, the extent of the problem is thought to be great. In Basotho tradition,
 a wife may return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by her husband; under
 common law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault. A 1976 High
 Court case successfully reversed a Roman-Dutch legal tradition which recognized a
 husband's right to chastise his wife at will.
 Women's rights organizations have formed, including a partnership of women law-
 yers. The local chapter of the International Federation of Women Lawyers has taken
 a leading role in educating Basotho women about their rights under customary and
 common law and emphasized the importance of women fully participating in the de-
 mocratization process.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization. A large portion of Lesotho's active male
 labor force between the ages of 20 and 44 seeks work in the Republic of South Afri-
 ca, mainly in gold and coal mines. At least 70 percent of the remainder is engaged
 in traditional agriculture. The rest are employed mainly by the Government and in
 small industries and enterprises in Lesotho. A majority of Basotho mineworkers are
 members of the South African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Because the
 NUM is a foreign organization, it is not permitted to engage in union activities in
 Lesotho.
 During the year, the Government withheld its recognition of the Lesotho Congress
 of Democratic Unions (CDU)-formed in 1991 by four recognized independent
 unions. The Government's action was an effort to require the CDU to join a rival
 federation, the officially recognized Lesotho Labor Congress (LLC), composed of 24
 affiliated trade unions, in order to attempt to bring organized labor within a single,
 umbrella trade union federation. Overall, unionized workers represent only 10 per-
 cent of the total work force, and the LLC now accounts for three-quarters of those
 union members. However, important sectors remain outside its umbrella, leaving
 the Lesotho Allied Clothing and Textile Workers as the only major industrial union
 within the LLC. All major unions professed political neutrality in the elections, but
 some independent unions charge the LLC remains subject to government con-
 tro1.While a legal right to strike cxists for workers in nonessential services, in prac-
 tice the proce    or calling a atre is so lengthy and cumbersome that it discour-
 ages legal strike actions andaccounts for the prevalence of wildcat strikes. The 1964
 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act enumerates lengthy procedures which must
 be followed before a strike can be legally called. Although no lea strikes took place,
 several wildcat strikes occurred in 1992 against both foreign and domestic compa-
 nies, mostly over waes and conditions of work. Most were resolved through compul.
 sory government arbitration.
 In 1992 the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) issued an interim report on a complaint brought before it on be-
 half of the Construction and Allied Workers Union of Lesotho  CAWULE), one of
 the founding unions of the Congress of Democratic Unions, over alleged antiunion
 reprisal actions. These actions ranged from dismissals, detentions, and frequent
 court actions to police shooting of union leaders and the slaying of a shop steward
 
 
 134
 after a strike at the construction site of the giant Lesotho Highlands Water Project
 in 1990-91. The CFA faulted the Government for some of its actions as well as its
 inaction in not setting up a judicial inquiry to ascertain the facts in full, determine
 responsibilities, punish those responsible and prevent the repetition of such actions.
 The complaint remains before the ILO while the Committee awaits further govern-
 ment response to its questions.
 The Lesotho Labor Congress and unaffiliated unions maintain a wide network of
 international trade union links. In general, the Government imposes no obstacles
 to international affiliations or foreign travel for labor union-related purposes. The
 CAWULE General Secretary was detained under the Internal Security Act and de-
 prived of his passport for 2 weeks in 1990 to prevent his attendance at an inter-
 national labor meeting, but labor officials traveled freely in 1992.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in Lesotho in principle enjoy the right in law to organize and bargain collec-
 tively, but these rights are not always respected in practice. Bargaining between
 unions and employers to set wage and benefit rates increased in 1992, although
 wage rates continue to be set primarily through unilateral action by employers.
 There were continuing credible reports of government acquiescence in private em-
 ployer intimidation of union officials. An Unfair Labor Practices Tribunal has the
 responsibility to investigate unfair labor practices and charges of antiunion discrimi-
 nation. The Tribunal began to function effectively only in 1992, once all members
 were officially named. In one case, it ordered the reinstatement of construction
 workers who staged an unsanctioned strike and were dismissed. A government-ap-
 pointed labor commission is charged with monitoring wages and working conditions
 and accepting, reviewing, and investigating worker complaints. Both the LLC and
 CDU-affiliated unions have accused the Government of maintaining an antiunion
 bias.
 Lesotho has several industrial estates grouping together companies, mostly textile
 and apparel firms, engaged in manufacturing for export. All national labor laws
 apply in these industrial zones, but the textile workers' union charges that the Gov-
 ernment colludes with textile industry employers to inhibit union organizational ac-
 tivities in the workplace. In 1991 union officers were arrested, detained, or other-
 wise intimidated by the police, but none was successfully charged. Similar incidents
 did not occur in 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the 1987 Employment Act, and there is no indication of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, chil-
 dren under 14 are commonly employed in family owned businesses. There are prohi-
 bitions against the employment of minors in commercial, industrial, or nonfamily
 enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working conditions. Basotho minors
 under 18 years of age may not be recruited for employment outside of Lesotho. En-
 forcement of these laws by inspectors of the Ministry of Employment, Social Welfare
 and Pensions is lax. In Lesotho's traditional society rigorous working conditions for
 the country's young "herdboys" is considered a prerequisite to manhood and a fun-
 damental feature of Basotho culture beyond the reach of labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Wages in Lesotho are extremely low. The Gov-
 ernment, following the annual recommendation of a tripartite wages advisory board,
 again raised the statutory minimum wage rates in 1992 for various specified types
 of work. Wages at these rates still are barely sufficient for a minimum decent stand-
 ard of living for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their monthly
 income through subsistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in
 South Africa. Many employers in Lesotho now pay more than minimum wages in
 an effort to attract and retaii  motivated employees.
 Lesotho's 1967 Employment Act spells out basic worker rights, including a 45-
 hour workweek, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 2 weeks' paid leave per
 year, and pay for public holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate light,
 ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain ma-
 chinery to minimize the risk of injury. In practice, these regulations are generally
 followed only within the wage economy and are enforced haphazardly by inspectors
 from the Department of Labor of the Ministry of Employment, Social Welfare and
 Pensions. Staff shortages in this Ministry limit effective enforcement to the major
 urban areas.
