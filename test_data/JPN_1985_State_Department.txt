 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Its industrial free
 market economy is the second largest in the world in terms of
 gross national product (GNP). Japan's culture incorporates
 many elements from the West while retaining strong Eastern
 roots. Buddhist and Shinto traditions continue to have a
 basic and pervasive influence on thought and social
 institutions, but several minor religions also flourish. Less
 than one percent of the population is Christian. Although the
 Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas, the citizens of this
 densely populated nation have a cultural, ethnic, and racial
 homogeneity which makes them less willing or able to integrate
 alien residents in Japan into their society.
 While the legal system has gradually evolved toward granting
 equality of opportunity to minorities, there has been little
 positive change in the social prejudice against Koreans,
 approximately 676,000 of whom are first, second, and third
 generation permanent residents, in addition to the
 approximately 120,000 naturalized Japanese nationals of Korean
 ancestry. An estimated 1.2 million descendants of persons
 historically considered to be outcasts ("Burakumin") also
 suffer social but not legal proscription.
 The Japanese Constitution states, "All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in
 political, economic, or social relations because of race,
 creed, sex, social status, or family origin." The human
 rights guaranteed by the Constitution are secured by a just
 and efficient legal system. Political liberties are
 guaranteed to all nationals. Over 70 percent of the
 electorate usually vote in general elections, which involve
 candidates from seven freely-functioning political parties.
 The right of workers to organize, bargain, and act
 collectively is guaranteed by the Constitution. Slightly
 under 30 percent of the active work force belongs to labor
 unions. Most unions are involved in political activity as
 well as in labor relations.
 In May 1985 the Diet passed the Equal Employment Opportunity
 Law prohibiting discrimination based on sex. This law will
 take effect in April 1986, but it contains no sanctions for
 violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no known cases of murder for political motives on
 the part of the Government or any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known cases in which people have been abducted,
 secretly arrested, held in clandestine detention, or held as
 hostage by security forces or any other organization.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. There is no evidence that penal treatment varies
 by social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for a writ of habeas corpus. Individuals cannot be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be
 prepared to demonstrate before trial that probable cause
 exists to detain the accused. The length of time before a
 suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of the crime
 but rarely exceeds two months; the average is one to two
 months. Preventive detention does not exist.
 The key statute protecting workers, the Labour Standards Law
 of 1947, prohibits the use of forced labor, and there are no
 known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is made aware
 of charges upon arrest and guaranteed a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. Defendants are guaranteed free and
 private access to counsel as well as the right not to be
 compelled to testify against themselves under the
 Constitution, although access is often restricted immediately
 after arrest. Defendants also are protected from the
 application of ex post facto laws and have right of access to
 evidence deemed to be necessary for trial after a formal
 indictment has been made and generally before a trial. Judges
 are appointed by the Cabinet for permanent terms, but face
 periodic review through popular referendum. A defendant
 dissatisfied with the decision of a trial court of first
 instance may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a
 higher court as the reviewing court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Japanese
 authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. The standards for issuing such
 warrants exist to guard against arbitrary searches. There are
 no reports that the Government or any other organization has
 arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Japanese Constitution, an independent press and judiciary,
 and a functioning democratic political system combine to
 ensure freedom of speech and press.

 JAPAN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 Japanese law grants unions the right to organize, strike,
 bargain collectively, lobby, and to make political campaign
 contributions, and the unions actively do so. Unions are
 involved also in international bodies and bilateral
 exchanges. Public employees do not have the right to strike
 but do have recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to
 resolve disputes. Members of the armed forces, police
 officers, and fire fighters are not permitted to organize.
 In exchange for a ban on their right to strike, government
 employees' pay raises are determihed by the Government based
 on a recommendation by the independent National Personnel
 Authority (NPA). Citing tight finances, however, the
 Government in 1985, as in the previous three years, has not
 fully implemented the NPA recommendations for wage increases.
 In response to the Government's failure to implement fully the
 NPA's recommendations, the General Council of Trade Unions of
 Japan (SOHYO) has in the past filed complaints with the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO Committee on
 Freedom of Association has urged Japan to respect the NPA
 recommendations and has also asked that Japan establish new
 prqcedures for deciding wages and working conditions for
 government employees.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several Christian denominations. Missionaries are welcome and
 receive special visa status. Some temples and shrines, as
 treasured national properties, receive public support for
 maintenance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Nationality is never
 revoked.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of
 its Bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party has ruled
 Japan since 1955 and currently governs in a coalition with an
 offshoot party, the New Liberal Club.  Five opposition
 parties are active. All adult citizens have the right to
 vote. Voting is by secret ballot. Political interest groups,
 regardless of their political hue, can organize and engage in
 nonviolent political activity. Well-organized labor unions
 ensure participation by workers in the political process.
 According to law, aliens with five years continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 
 
 789
 JAPAN
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 been naturalized. Naturalization is a difficult and
 complicated process requiring "proof of assimilation into the
 Japanese culture." Many Korean residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization on the grounds that their cultural
 identity would be erased by the requirements. Korean human
 rights activists have urged Japan to restore, unconditionally,
 the citizenship which Korean residents of Japan had previously
 but which was revoked after World War II.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Various groups have petitioned the office of the United
 Nations Human Rights Commissioner (UNHRC) to take up
 allegations of discrimination against Koreans in Japan and of
 maltreatment of mental patients in Japan. The Government
 responded to the complaints and the UNHRC decided not to take
 up these matters for further discussion or investigation. The
 International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and International
 Commission of Health Professionals (ICHP) released a joint
 report in July 1985, which described Japan's mental health
 system as "seriously inadequate." Through its membership in
 the UNHRC, the Japanese Government is active in working for
 improvement of human rights practices in other countries.
 There is a Human Rights and Refugee Division in the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs to give long-range attention to these
 matters. Amnesty International's 1985 Report expressed
 concern over the practice of capital punishment and the
 reported treatment of some prisoners during official police
 interrogation. Freedom House rates Japan as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Japan's population in 1985 was 120,731,000, with an annual
 growth rate of approximately 1 percent. In total land area,
 Japan is slightly smaller than Caifornia. While Japan is one
 of the three major industrial complexes of the world, and the
 industrial sector is the most important part of the economy,
 agriculture is practiced so intensively that Japan has an
 agricultural self-sufficiency rate of around 70 percent. Per
 capita GNP in current U.S. dollars was $10,120 in 1983.
 Good quality food, shelter, health care, and education are
 widely available to inhabitants of Japan regardless of race,
 religion, ethnic background, or political opinion. Life
 expectancy at birth in 1983 was 77 years. The infant
 mortality rate was 6 per 1,000 live births in 1985. With a
 highly competitive education system that provides nine years
 of free compulsory schooling, Japan has virtually total
 primary school enrollment and virtually total adult literacy.
 The Labour Standards Law of 1947 provides for an 8-hour day, a
 48-hour week, and an overtime rate of time and a quarter.
 Workers under the age of 18 years may not be employed in
 dangerous or harmful work and minors under 15 years of age may
 not be employed as workers. A system fixing minimum wages on
 industry and regional bases was introduced by the Minimum
 Wages Law of 1959. The Ministry of Labor administers various
 laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety,
 principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law
 of 1972.

 JAPAN
 Women comprise approximately 36 percent of the employed
 population. Social pressures discouraging involvement of
 women in positions of managerial and professional
 responsibility remain strong. Discrimination by private
 employers against women continues despite its prohibition by
 the Constitution and by legislative measures adopted over the
 past 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men.
 In a recent government survey, around 60 percent of responding
 corporations indicated they have job categories that exclude
 females, and more than 65 percent hire only men as executive
 recruits. Another recent survey indicated nearly 86 percent
 of women workers said they had no interest in management
 positions and preferred marriage and motherhood to careers.
 In May 1985, the Diet passed the Equal Employment Opportunity
 Law which will take effect in April, 1986. This law prohibits
 discrimination based on sex in such areas as recruitment and
 hiring, pay inequality, and the number of night or overtime
 hours that can be worked. The law has been criticized,
 however, as containing no concrete measures, such as penalties
 for violators, to ensure equality for women workers.
 In recent years the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations extending to permanent resident aliens, 82 percent
 of whom are Koreans, the benefits of equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those who
 otherwise qualify, and certain public employment rights.
 Rectifying another issue of concern to resident Koreans, the
 Foreign Ministry now pronounces Korean names according to the
 Korean, rather than the Japanese, reading of name characters.
 The Government has also extended, until 1987, a Special
 Measures Law (first issued in 1969) designed to help
 assimilate Burakumin (descendants of Feudal Era "outcasts" who
 practiced so-called "unclean" professions such as hide
 tanning) into mainstream society through a number of social,
 economic, and legal programs. Nevertheless, entrenched social
 prejudice against both Koreans and Burakumin restricts the
 access of both groups to private housing, employment, and
 marriage opportunities. There is a growing conflict between
 alien residents, primarily Koreans (although some Americans
 are also involved), and the Government over the requirement
 that foreign residents be fingerprinted every five years.
 Korean rights activists have recently been arrested and fined
 for refusing to be fingerprinted. They argue that it harms
 the individual dignity of foreign residents (Japanese citizens
 are not routinely fingerprinted) and is in violation of the
 International Human Rights Covenant as well as the Equal
 Protection Article of the Japanese Constitution. The
 Government asserts that it is a reasonable way to confirm the
 identity of foreign residents and justified on the basis of
 public welfare.
